==Biography==

Ahlam bint Ali bin Hazeem Alshamsi was born in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to an Emirati father and a Bahraini mother. Her father is an Emirati folk singer, Ali Alshamsi. Ahlam was raised as a child in [[Bahrain]]. She is married to the famous Qatari rally champion, Mubarak Al-Hajiri, with whom she has three children.  She is one of the Arab Stars in the Middle East. Mohammed Abdo, a prominent and well-known musician within the Arab world, gave her the nickname: Star of the UAE. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} however, Ahlam was crowned queen at the Festival in Doha 2003 Qatar.&lt;ref name="Ahlam-alshami.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahlam-alshamsi.com/Ahlam/Ahlam_EN.html |title=Ahlam |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023125124/http://ahlam-alshamsi.com/Ahlam/Ahlam_EN.html |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She participated in many festivals around the Arab region and western region , particularly the "Layali Dubai" festival. She has also been honored at several festivals across the arab region and in USA in Dolby Theatre. She was crowned queen of the Arab art in the Doha-Qatar festival in 2003.&lt;ref name="Ahlam-alshami.com" /&gt;

===Festival===

She performed at the Unisco Festival and Ledo Festival in France where she was the first Arab singer that sang twice. She also had the honour of performing at the Washington Festival in the USA, the Albert Hall Festival in the UK and many other Festivals in London.&lt;ref name="Ahlam-alshami.com" /&gt;

===Joining ''Arab Idol''===
In 2011, Ahlam joined [[Middle East Broadcasting|MBC]]'s ''[[Arab Idol]]'' judging panel alongside [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] singer [[Wael Kfoury]] and [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] composer [[Hassan El Shafei]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] singer [[Nancy Ajram]].&lt;ref name="Al Bawaba"/&gt; Ragheb reportedly left due to her "tackiness".&lt;ref name=dailymail/&gt;

=="The Queen" TV show==
In March 2016, after the first episode of her show "The Queen" was broadcast on [[Dubai TV]], a trending [[Twitter]] hashtag was launched by viewers and other people demanding that the program gets stopped for multiple reasons such as the "lack of manners, degrading acts, returning us to the age of slaves" and various other claims made by the Arab world and the people of UAE.&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3500092/Pop-star-Ahlam-s-reality-Queen-axed-Dubai-TV-viewers-criticise-arrogance-call-dethroned.html|title=Ahlam dethroned as "Queen" by Dubai TV!|quote=Emirati singer Ahlam's show "The Queen" has been axed by Dubai TV.|date=19 March 2016|publisher=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=albawaba&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/ahlam-dethroned-queen-dubai-tv-819192|title=Ahlam dethroned as "Queen" by Dubai TV!|quote=Emirati singer Ahlam's show "The Queen" has been axed by Dubai TV|date=20 March 2016|work=Al Bawaba}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the show, Ahlam asks contestants, who come from across the Arab world, how much they love her and if they are willing to do everything she asks of them, one of the contestants went by far to say that she's willing to cheat and betray anyone for Ahlam.

Several other journalists and known personalities such as [[Nidal Al Ahmadieh]] and [[Adel Karam]] and a few others; took the opportunity to further trend the hashtag and even insult Ahlam, and Ahlam used her Twitter to insult them back first by retweeting a poem written by one of her fans which accuses Lebanon of being "falafill peddlers" and then Ahlam tweeted said: "I'm telling the beggars so they won't keep on talking about their mistress and queen. Let them prove they love their country and pick up the rubbish from their streets" which majority of people considered to be a disrespectful generalization to the people of Lebanon.&lt;ref name=alaraby&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/Blog/2016/3/25/Emirati-Pop-star-Ahlam-enrages-Lebanese-after-calling-them-falafel-peddlers|title=Emirati pop star Ahlam enrages Lebanese calling them 'falafel-peddlers'|quote=The Lebanese are fuming after pop-star Ahlam labelled them as "falafel-sellers" and "beggars", prompting a Twitter hashtag to have her banned from entering the country.|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nidal launched a hashtag on Twitter which became a popular trend easily in Lebanon and other Arab countries "{{lang-ar|#منع_أحلام_من_دخول_لبنان}}" (Ban Ahlam from entering Lebanon).&lt;ref name=alaraby/&gt;

After that, Ahlam reportedly took other news channels to explain the situation that she referred only to few people which she doesn't consider journalists or media and that she wouldn't even insult the sand of Lebanon, let alone insulting Lebanon as a whole, she never apologized because according to her she never made a mistake.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Whether directly or indirectly, she was reportedly replaced as judge with [[Samira Said]] for Arab Idol Season 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13672">'''Alfred O. Deshong''' (September 30, 1837 - April 19, 1913) was an American [[industrialist]], [[philanthropist]] and [[art collector]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]].  Deshong came from a wealthy family including his grandfather [[Peter Deshong]] and father [[John O. Deshong]].  He operated a successful quarry business for years, was a director in the [[Delaware County National Bank]] and invested his fortune in the collection of art.

Deshong donated liberally to support the Chester Hospital and upon his death, donated his trust and land to the city of Chester which resulted in the creation of the Deshong Art Museum and Deshong Park.  Over time, the museum fell into disrepair, suffered theft and eventually closed.  The art museum is now vacant and the art collection resides with [[Widener University]].

==Early life==
[[File:Grounds and Entrance of the Alfred O Deshong Memorial.jpg|thumb|Grounds and Entrance of the Deshong Mansion]]
Alfred Odenheimer Deshong was born in Chester, Pennsylvania to [[John O. Deshong]] and Emmeline L. (Terrill) Deshong and educated in the local schools.

The partnership was successful and lasted for 30 years until John's death on November 1, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deshong Family|url=http://www.widener.edu/about/campus_resources/art_gallery/deshong_family/default.aspx|website=www.widener.edu|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Deshong was elected a director of the [[Delaware County National Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cope |first1=Gilbert |title=Historic Homes and Institutions and Genealogical and Personal Memoirs of Chester and Delaware Counties, Pennsylvania |date=1904 |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company |location=New York |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MwwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=alfred+o.+deshong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GOsJjzTfCY&amp;sig=eCoClptllDr-WE6znrQJ07eoSmU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5r4uVwM_dAhURPN8KHQzOB344FBDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=alfred%20o.%20deshong&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Deshong donated liberally to support Chester Hospital, located at 9th and Barclay Streets in Chester.  The Alfred O. Deshong sanitary cottage for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] was built by Deshong and donated to the Chester Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 47 |date=1906 |page=787 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZU1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA787&amp;dq=alfred+o.+deshong&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjss7qwx5jeAhXymuAKHfyYBr84FBDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=alfred%20o.%20deshong&amp;f=false |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, he left in trust his art collection, mansion and 27 acre estate to the city of Chester as an art gallery and for educational purposes.  The bequest resulted in the establishment of the Deshong Memorial Park and the building of an art gallery.

==Deshong Mansion==
The Deshong mansion was built in 1850 on 22 acres off Edgemont Avenue in the Greek Revival [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style by Alfred's father, John O. Deshong, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chester|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-6348-0|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tr4_Kx9Mf9AC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=alfred+o.+deshong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8-WZTOP7RZ&amp;sig=t5vmqf5F1e-ESccTMqZgWt82Y14&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYjbbkmsTYAhXRQ98KHZ77Cfo4ChDoAQhCMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=alfred%20o.%20deshong&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was willed to the people of Chester after Alfred's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=H.V.|title=Chester and Vicinity|date=1914|location=Chester, Pennsylvania|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stAwAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The land was turned into a public park named Deshong Park and an art museum was built on the property.  The mansion and art museum fell into disrepair in the 1980s. The trust was dissolved and the property was taken over by the [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] Industrial Development Authority.  The mansion suffered a partial collapse in 2013 and was demolished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Vince|title=Crews undertake demolition of decrepit Deshong Mansion|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140324/NEWS/140329801|website=www.delcotimes.com|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deshong Art Museum and Collection==
The Deshong Art Museum was built in 1914 after his death on the same property as the Deshong Mansion.  The building was designed to be fireproof with exterior walls of Dover marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Architecture and Building, Volume 48 |date=2016 |publisher=The William T.

Other select works from the collection include:

Deshong's last art purchase was a pair of large [[Chinese guardian lions|Foo dogs]] cast in bronze.  The statues were placed flanking the doors of the Deshong mansion.&lt;ref name="Alfred O.

Deshong|url=http://www.widener.edu/about/campus_resources/art_gallery/deshong_family/aodeshong.aspx|website=www.widener.edu|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time it was the only public art gallery on the East Coast.

A modern '''Belarusian name''' of a person consists of three parts: [[given name]], [[patronymic]], and [[family name]], according to the [[Eastern Slavic naming customs]], similar to [[Russian name]]s and [[Ukrainian name]]s.

==Belarusian given names==

As with most cultures, a person has a [[given name]] chosen by the parents. First names in East-[[Slavic languages]] mostly originate from three sources: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church tradition (which is itself of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin), [[Catholic]] church tradition (which is itself of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin) and [[Slavic names|native pre-Christian Slavic origin lexicons]]. Most names have several diminutive forms.

==Belarusian family names (surnames)==

In Belarus and most of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics.

Belarusian surnames, like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father on to his children.

Depending on the region, Belarusian surnames could have a different form and different ending.

One very large group of surnames end with the common Slavonic suffixes -vič (wicz) and -ič (icz) (Daškievič, Šuškievič, Vajciuškievič, Mackievič, Mickievič, Misilievič) or -cki and -ski (feminine form -ckaja and -skaja: Navicki, Kalinoŭski, Piliecki, Rusiecki, Sadoŭski, Caŭloŭski, Bialiaŭski).

One common suffix in surnames is ''-čuk'' (Ramančuk, Kačuk, Kavaĺčuk) or its simplified versions ''-iuk'' and ''-juk'' (Maliuk, Masiuk).

Other group includes surnames with the suffix ''-ka'', corresponding to the suffix ''-ko'' [[Ukrainian names]] (Lukašenka, Jakavienka, Haponienka), ''-onak, -jonak (-ionak)'' (Malašonak, Manionak).

Another suffix is ''-jenia (-ienia)'' (Majsienia, Astapienia, Jurčenia, Hierasimienia).

[[File:pallik.jpg|thumb|200px|Béla Pállik (date unknown)]]
'''Béla Pállik''' (2 February 1845, [[Nagymihály]] - 27 July 1908, [[Budapest]]) was a Hungarian artist, opera singer and theater director. He was best known for his [[animal painter|animal paintings]] and was nicknamed "Birkapiktor" ("Sheep-painter").

==Biography==
He went to Budapest to pursue his art studies and work in the studios of {{ill|Adolf van der Venne|de}}, a German painter who was living there at the time. His parents were unable to support his studies for long, so he chose to support himself by selling copies of the old masters he made at the local museums,&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; but eventually concluded that portrait painting would be most profitable. Soon after, he acquired an important patron; Count János Waldstein-Wartenberg (1809-1876), a well-known art collector. 
[[File:Pállik Bárányok.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Lambs (before 1880)]]
He spent some time at the Count's estate in [[Várpalota]], doing portraits, some of his first animal paintings and [[fresco]]es for the library at Zichy Castle. In 1867, he was able to enroll at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], thanks to a state grant that the Count was able to obtain for him from Prime Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.epa.oszk.hu/00000/00009/00042/384-389-pallik.htm Művészet, 1908] Biography and appreciation by Károly Lyka.&lt;/ref&gt; His primary instructor there was [[Eduard von Engerth]].

In 1871, he received an extension of his grant and went to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where his teachers were [[Wilhelm von Diez]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and [[Karl von Piloty]]. It was there that he decided to devote himself to animal painting. He had his first showing at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Exposition]] in Vienna. In 1874, he returned to Budapest and soon became popular with the aristocracy, so he continued to do portraits along with paintings of their favorite dogs and horses. 
 
===Singing career===
[[File:Béla Pállik Winterzeit 1901.jpg|thumb|325px|Wintertime (1901)]] 
By 1880, he was successful enough to buy an old church, where he set up apartments and a studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://szerelmembudapest.blog.hu/page/3 Szerelmem Budapest: "Church for Sale"]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the amount of work he had been doing created a severe case of [[eyestrain]] and, on his doctor's advice, he gave up painting for a while. Rather than remain inactive, he began to take singing lessons.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; In 1883, encouraged by his friends and family, he sold his studio (which later became a church again) and toured Germany; performing in several major cities, including [[Weimar]], singing opera arias. He eventually learned thirty different operatic roles and was especially successful with the works of [[Richard Wagner]]. Düsseldorf became his base of operations and he spent his summers in [[Nordkirchen]], at the [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy]] estates.

Once that he felt his eyes had sufficiently recovered, he had sheep brought to Düsseldorf and started painting again. With the help of Prince [[Nikolaus III, Prince Esterházy|Nikolaus]], he was able to re-establish himself in the art world. In 1887, he took up residence at the Esterházy Palace in [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]],&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; where he continued to display his singing talent at the castle theater and directed some productions as well as painting the theater's ceiling. He also exhibited widely, including a show at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1890. That same year, he acquired property in the [[Epreskert Art Colony]] and built a studio there. It is currently known as the "Atelier Kernstok" after a famous later resident, the artist [[Károly Kernstok]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
At the age of 11 or 12, Staton and her sister Maggie were sent to the Jewell Christian Academy in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

As teenagers, they toured the traditional gospel circuit in the 1950s with [[the Soul Stirrers]], [[C. L. Franklin]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]].&lt;ref name="americanamusicshow.com"&gt;from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode191 episode 191 of the Americana Music Show], published May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded several sides for Nashbro, [[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo]] and [[Savoy Records]] between 1953 and 1963.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

She and Rick Hall reunited to make a half dozen more sides for Staton's 2014 southern soul album, ''Life Happens''. The lead Americana radio single, "[[I Ain't Easy to Love]]", featured Jason Isbell and John Paul White (formerly of The Civil Wars). The trio performed the track on ''The Late Show with David Letterman''.

Staton's television show ''New Direction'' aired on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]].  Staton has also made appearances on the ''[[Praise the Lord (TV program)|Praise the Lord]]'' telecast with the late [[Paul Crouch]] and his late wife [[Jan Crouch]].&lt;ref name="titleCandi Staton" /&gt;

In August  2018, Staton released her 30th album, “Unstoppable,” which has been touted as a retro psychedelic R&amp;B project. NPR music journalist, Alison Fensterstock, wrote that it, “Delivers the kind of forthright confidence and soul-girding power that can only be summoned by a grown woman who has learned a thing or two. And Staton has lived many lives. Creatively, the quadruple Grammy nominee and Christian Music Hall of Famer has moved between soul and R&amp;B, gospel, disco and even EDM before returning to her roots as an elder stateswoman.”

On 30 October 2018, Staton announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46029712 Soul singer Candi Staton diagnosed with breast cancer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Edith Macauley Martin''' (1848 &amp;ndash; 15 March 1937) was an Australian novelist who used the pseudonyms '''M. C.''', '''Mrs Alick MacLeod''' or anonymous.

==Biography==
Martin was born in the [[Isle of Skye]] in 1847 or early in 1848. Her father, whose name was Mackay, brought her to [[South Australia]] when a child, and in 1874 she was living at [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]]. In that year she published at [[Melbourne]] a volume of poems ''The Explorers and other Poems.'' The book was credited to 'M.C.' and her name remained unknown to the public. She came to [[Adelaide]] and did journalistic work, including a serial story, ''Bohemian Born''. For a period she was a clerk in the Education Department. In 1890 she published anonymously ''An Australian Girl'', a novel which was favourably reviewed and in 1891 went into a second edition. This was followed in 1892 by ''The Silent Sea'', published under the pseudonym of "Mrs Alick MacLeod".

In 1906 appeared ''The Old Roof Tree: Letters of Isabel to Her Half-brother'', a series of essays in letter-form. Some are supposed to be written from London, others from a cathedral town, while others describe a tour on the continent. In 1923 appeared ''The Incredible Journey'', by C. E. M. Martin, the story of an Aboriginal woman's journey across desert country to recover her son.

Mrs Martin died in the Adelaide suburb of [[Hyde Park, South Australia|Hyde Park]] on 15 March 1937 in her ninetieth year. She married Frederick Martin who predeceased her. She was never as well known as she deserved to be, partly because her work was always published anonymously or under a pseudonym. ''An Australian Girl'' is an interesting book written by a woman of thoughtful and philosophic mind, and ''The Incredible Journey'', with its sympathetic appreciation of the point of view of [[Indigenous Australians]], is among the best books of its kind in Australian literature.

==Family==
Catherine Edith Macauley Mackay married Frederick "Fred" Martin (9 April 1848 – 27 April 1909) on 4 March 1882 at St Paul's Church, Adelaide. They had no children. Fred's sister Lucy Martin (1839–1863) was married to [[John Howard Clark]], editor of the [[South Australian Register]]; another sister, [[Annie Montgomerie Martin]], was a noted teacher and headmistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60371616 |title=Concerning People |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=20 August 1918 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Martin/Clark Book Committee ''The Hatbox Letters'' Published by the authors, Adelaide 1999 {{ISBN|0 646 36207 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Bulfinch''' (August 8, 1763 – April 15, 1844) was an early [[United States|American]] [[architect]], and has been regarded by many as the first native-born American to practice [[architecture]] as a [[architect|profession]].&lt;ref name=baltzell&gt;Baltzell, Edward Digby. ''Puritan Boston &amp; Quaker Philadelphia''. Transaction Publishers (1996), p. 322-24. {{ISBN|1-56000-830-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulfinch split his career between his native [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], where he served as Commissioner of Public Building and built the intermediate [[United States Capitol rotunda]] and [[United States Capitol dome|dome]]. His works are notable for their simplicity, balance, and good taste, and as the origin of a distinctive [[Federal style architecture|Federal style]] of classical domes, columns, and ornament that dominated early 19th-century [[American architecture]].

==Early life==
Bulfinch was born in Boston to Thomas Bulfinch, a prominent physician, and his wife, Susan Apthorp. He was educated at [[Boston Latin School]] and [[Harvard University]], from which he graduated with an AB in 1781 and master's degree in 1784.

[[File:ThomasBulfinch ca1757 byJosephBlackburn MFABoston.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|Thomas Bulfinch (father of Charles), ca.1757]]

He then made a [[grand tour]] of [[Europe]] from 1785 to 1787, where he was influenced by the classical architecture in [[Italy]] and the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings of Sir [[Christopher Wren]], [[Robert Adam]], [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and others in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] became something of a [[mentoring|mentor]] to him in Europe, as he would later be to [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kronenberger (editor), ''Brief Lives: A Biographical Guide to the Arts'' (1972 edition), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HannahApthorp ca1788 byJosephDunkerley MFABoston.png|thumb|60px|left|Hannah Apthorp (Mrs. Charles Bulfinch), ca.1788]]

Upon his return to the United States in 1787, he became a promoter of the ship [[Columbia Rediviva]]'s voyage around the world under command of Captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] (1755&amp;ndash;1806). It was the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe. In 1788 he married Hannah Apthorp, his first cousin. Their sons include [[Thomas Bulfinch]] (1796&amp;ndash;1867), author of ''Bulfinch's Mythology'', and [[Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch]] (1809&amp;ndash;1870), Unitarian clergyman and author.

==Career==
[[File:Massachusetts State House, Boston, Massachusetts - oblique frontal view.JPG|thumb|right|240px|[[Massachusetts State House]], completed 1798]]
[[File:Old State House, Hartford CT - front facade.JPG|thumb|right|240px|[[Old State House (Hartford)|Old Connecticut State House]], built in 1796]]
Bulfinch's first building was the [[Hollis Street Church]] (1788).  Among his other early works are a memorial column on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] (1789), the first monument to the [[American Revolution]]; the [[Federal Street Theatre|Federal Street theater]] (1793); the "[[Tontine Crescent]]" (built 1793&amp;ndash;1794, now demolished), fashioned in part after [[John Wood, the Younger|John Wood]]'s [[Royal Crescent]]; the [[Old State House (Hartford)|Old State House]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (1796); and the [[Massachusetts State House]] (1798). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1791.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of ten years, Bulfinch built a remarkable number of private dwellings in the Boston area, including [[Joseph Barrell (merchant)|Joseph Barrell]]'s Pleasant Hill (1793), a series of three [[Harrison Gray Otis House|houses in Boston]] for [[Harrison Gray Otis (lawyer)|Harrison Gray Otis]] (1796, 1800, 1806), and the John Phillips House (1804). He built several churches in Boston, of which [[St. Stephen's Church, Boston|New North]] (built 1802&amp;ndash;1804) is the last standing.

Serving from 1791 to 1795 on [[Boston's board of selectmen]], he resigned due to business pressures but returned in 1799. From 1799 to 1817, he was the chairman of Boston's board of selectmen continuously, and served as a paid Police Superintendent, improving the city's streets, drains, and lighting. Under his direction, both the [[infrastructure]] and civic center of Boston were transformed into a dignified classical style. Bulfinch was responsible for the design of the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]], the remodeling and enlargement of [[Faneuil Hall]] (1805), and the construction of [[India Wharf]]. In these Boston years he also designed the Massachusetts State Prison (1803); [[Boylston Market]] (1810); [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] for [[Harvard University]] (1813&amp;ndash;1814); the Meeting House in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]] (1815&amp;ndash;17); and the Bulfinch Building home of the [[Ether Dome]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (1818), its completion overseen by [[Alexander Parris]], who was working in Bulfinch's office at the time the architect was summoned to Washington.

Despite this great activity and civic involvement, Bulfinch was [[insolvent]] several times starting in 1796, including at the start of his work on the statehouse, and was jailed for the month of July 1811 for debt (in a prison he had designed himself). There was no payment for his services as selectman, and he received only $1,400 for designing and overseeing the construction of the State House.

In the summer of 1817, Bulfinch's roles as selectman, designer and public official coincided during a visit by President [[James Monroe]]. The two men were almost constantly in each other's company for the week-long visit, and a few months later (1818) Monroe appointed Bulfinch the successor to [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] (1764&amp;ndash;1820) as [[Architect of the Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (The Capitol Building had been partially burned by the British in 1814.) In this position he was paid a salary of $2,500 per year plus expenses.

As Commissioner of Public Building, Bulfinch completed the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]'s wings and central portion, designed the western approach and [[portico]], and constructed the Capitol's original low wooden [[dome]] to his own design (replaced by the present cast-iron dome completed in the mid-1860s). In 1829 Bulfinch completed the construction of the Capitol, 36 years after its [[cornerstone]] was laid.  During his interval in Washington, Bulfinch also drew plans for the State House in [[Augusta, Maine]] (1829&amp;ndash;1832), a Unitarian Church and prison in Washington, D.C.. In 1827, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary member. He returned to Boston in 1830, where he died on April 15, 1844, aged 80, and was buried in [[King's Chapel]] Burial Ground in Boston. His tomb was later moved to [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 1943, a [[United States]] [[Liberty ship]] named the [[SS Charles Bulfinch|SS ''Charles Bulfinch'']] was launched. The ship was scrapped in 1971.

'''David Waweru''' is the CEO of [[WordAlive Publishers]] based out of [[Nairobi]], Kenya. According to his website he refers to himself as a "publisher, trainer, coach, and speaker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.davidwaweru.com | title=David Waweru | publisher=David Waweru | date=29 May 2011 | accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WordAlive Publishers]] was founded in September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/magazines/lifestyle/-/1214/501510/-/item/1/-/139ivvtz/-/index.html | title=Publisher proves critics wrong | publisher=Nation Media | work=[[Daily Nation]] | date=13 December 2008 | accessdate=2011-05-30 | last=Ngunjiri | first=Joseph | location=Nairobi, Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Waweru has been active in advocating for a strong and vibrant local publishing industry and reading culture in East Africa. In interviews with [[NTV (Kenya)|Nation TV]]&lt;ref name="NTV Interview"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufW7XmOZ5DI | title=Tough year for local publishers | publisher=Nation Media | work=NTV Kenya | date=24 December 2009 | accessdate=31 May 2011 | author=Nation Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Business Daily,&lt;ref name="Business Daily - Nation Media Group"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/-/539444/842178/-/t1oh69/-/index.html | title=Publishers face lean times as competition and government cutbacks eat into their returns | publisher=Nation Media Group | work=Business Daily | date=14 January 2010 | accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David alludes that though the Kenyan book trade has faced major challenges in the last couple of years, the market will recover.

In an article titled, "A Literary Contribution to Healing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/magazines/lifestyle/-/1214/462448/-/9dxmxyz/-/index.html | title=A Literary Contribution to Healing | work=[[Daily Nation]] | date=23 August 2008 | accessdate=31 May 2011 | author=JOSEPH NGUNJIRI | location=Nairobi, Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Daily Nation]], David Waweru said "We cannot always complain about a poor reading culture," he said. "It is up to us to expand the horizons and give people what they want to read."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8188">'''Donna Laframboise''' is a Canadian investigative journalist, writer, and photographer. She has published recent critical reviews of the [[IPCC]] and its recent reports for the [[UN]].

==Background==
Laframboise has worked as a freelance photographer and  journalist. She describes herself as a libertarian feminist, and  earned a degree in [[women's studies]].&lt;ref name=Gprof&gt;[https://profiles.google.com/116698682371698041493#116698682371698041493/about Laframboise Google profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= spon/&gt; Laframboise has written articles and editorials for Canada's ''[[National Post]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and others.&lt;ref name=Gprof/&gt; In 1992, she asked for reconsideration of the guilty verdict for [[Guy Paul Morin]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Genetic Imaginary: DNA in the Canadian Criminal Justice System'', Neil Gerlach,  University of Toronto Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; who had been wrongly convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1992. Renewed DNA testing led to overturning of this verdict in 1995. From 1993 to 2001, Laframbroise served on the [[board of directors]] of the [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]].&lt;ref name=Gprof/&gt;

In 1997, Laframbroise published ''The Princess at the Window: A New Gender Morality'', a book critical of many aspects of contemporary [[feminism]]. [[Gender studies]] scholar [[Joan Sangster]] went so far to call Laframboise an "anti-feminist", and dismissed her "frontal attack" on abuse accusations against [[Grandview Training School for Girls]] staff in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Girl Trouble: Female Delinquency in English Canada, Joan Sangster: Between the Lines, 08.12.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications on the global warming controversy==
{{see also|Global warming controversy}}
Laframboise is an outspoken critic of the scientific assessment of [[global warming]] published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC). In 2010, she commented on the outcome of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] enquiries, echoing the complaints of contrarians such as the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Case Studies in Crisis Communication: International Perspectives on Hits and Misses.'' Amiso M. George, Cornelius B. Pratt.  Routledge, 13.08.1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Laframboise organized a "citizen audit" of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], to determine how many of the report's sources were [[peer-review]]ed. The audit claims that 21 of the report's 44 chapters used fewer than 60% peer-reviewed sources, with the other sources being non-peer-reviewed material, commonly called "[[grey literature]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noconsensus.org/ipcc-audit/findings-main-page.php Main Findings of the Citizen Audit of IPCC AR4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koprowski&gt;Koprowski, Gene J. [http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/19/united-nations-climate-global-warming-ipcc/ "Last in Class: Critics Give U.N. Climate Researchers an 'F'"], Fox News, April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noconsensus.org/about.php  "About Noconsensus.org"]&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC has clear guidelines allowing the use of non peer-reviewed grey literature where appropriate, subject to evaluation by the IPCC authors. An IPCC spokesman has stated that such sources include government statistics or reports from industry associations, and said "We do not believe that it is appropriate to keep out such material from the process."&lt;ref name= spon /&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcc-principles-appendix-a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles-appendix-a.pdf |title=Appendix A to the Principles Governing IPCC Work |year=2008 |format=PDF |work= |publisher= IPCC |page=14 |quote=Because it is increasingly apparent that materials relevant to IPCC Reports, in particular, information about the experience and practice of the private sector in mitigation and adaptation activities, are found in sources that have not been published or peer-reviewed (e.g., industry journals, internal organisational publications, non-peer reviewed reports or working papers of research institutions, proceedings of workshops etc) the following additional procedures are provided. These have been designed to make all references used in IPCC Reports easily accessible and to ensure that the IPCC process remains open and transparent.  |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she published a book about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ''The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World's Top Climate Expert''. She promotes her perspective on Global warming on her noconsensus.org blog. Laframboise claims that the IPCC's appeal to authority doesn't live up to its own promises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonbookreview.com/lbr0061.html  Review, ''The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World's Top Climate Expert''], LondonBookReview.com, October 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and this book has received some critical attention. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concatenation.org/nfrev/laframboise_delinquent.html  Review, ''The Delinquent Teenager
Who was mistaken for the world's top climate expert''] The Science Fact &amp; Science Fiction Concatenation April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2011 book has been translated in Norwegian and German. The German translation was  by [[:de:Helmut Jäger]] (among others), a retired Geography professor  affiliated with the German climate skeptical think tank [[:de:Eike]].&lt;ref name= spon/&gt; The Norwegian translation was provided by [[Jan-Erik Solheim]], an astrophysicist at the [[University of Oslo]], and Knut Bakke, a retired engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the VIAF entry and  Laframboises blog&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, she published a new book, repeating her criticisms of  IPCC chairman [[Rajendra Pachauri]] which she had originally published as blog posts.&lt;ref&gt;''Into the Dustbin: Rajendra Pachauri, the Climate Report &amp; the Nobel Peace Prize.'' CreateSpace Publishing, 2013. {{ISBN|1492292400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' op-ed, she wrote that  Pachauri had repeatedly claimed the IPCC based its conclusions solely on peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323981304579079030750537994 Warming Up for Another Climate-Change Report] opinion piece by Laframboise, Wall Street Journal, Sept. 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPCC Fifth Assessment Report==
In 2013, Laframboise received leaked drafts of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] WG II section on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, and commented on them on her blog. She wrote that NGOs like the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]] and [[Germanwatch]] had provided comments based on grey literature, to push a political agenda.&lt;ref name= spon/&gt;  IPCC Spokesman Jonathan Lynn commented that the data leak broke a [[confidentiality agreement]] which did not have legal force. Authors of the report also included industry representatives such as the insurer [[Munich Re]] and the oil company [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref name= spon&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuer-ipcc-bericht-weltklimarat-gesteht-zweites-datenleck-ein-a-876574.html Neuer IPCC-Bericht: Weltklimarat gesteht zweites Datenleck ein], Christoph Seidler, Spiegel 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''[[Bill Clinton|William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]]''' was the 42nd [[President of The United States]] from 1993 to 2001. He won two elections with landslide margins in the [[Electoral College]] in both [[United States Presidential Election, 1992|1992]] and [[United States Presidential Election, 1996|1996]]. Most of his early life was spent in his home state of [[Arkansas]], where he was born and raised for his entire childhood in varying cities from [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]] to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]]. He served in multiple political offices in the state including as the state's [[Attorney General of Arkansas|Attorney General]] for two years and as the [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] for almost twelve total, but not consecutive, years.

==Early years==
===Birth===
Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/dir/pres.htm | title=Directory of Irish Genealogy: American Presidents with Irish Ancestors | publisher=Homepage.eircom.net | date=March 23, 2004 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; He was the son of [[William Jefferson Blythe Jr.]] (1918–1946), a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994).&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov bio"&gt;{{cite web | title=Biography of William J.

===Family===
Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] to study nursing.

[[File:Bill Clinton in the White House Music Room (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Clinton with his saxophone at the White House in 1996. He began playing the saxophone in elementary school. At one point, Clinton considered pursuing a career in music.]]

==Education==
As a student in Hot Springs, Clinton attended several schools, including St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]]. There, he was an active student leader, an avid reader, and a musician.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; Clinton was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music instead of politics, but as he noted in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':{{block indent|Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]]. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]]. But I knew I could be great in public service.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;}}

==Interest in law and politics==
Clinton began an interest in taking a career path in law at Hot Springs High when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient [[Roman Senator]] [[Catiline]] in a mock trial in his Latin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/bill-clinton-facts_n_3497083.html?ncid=txtlnkushpmg00000037 | title=10 Things You Definitely Didn't Know About Bill Clinton | work=The Huffington Post | date=June 25, 2013 | first=Jimmy | last=Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a vigorous defense that made use of his "budding rhetorical and political skills", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it "made him realize that someday he would study law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton | author=David Maraniss | year=1996 | publisher=Touchstone | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision to become a public figure===
Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. The first was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet then-President [[John F. Kennedy]]&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;. The second moment he has identified was watching [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech on television, impressing him so much that he ended up memorizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) | publisher=[[The White House]] | url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | accessdate=August 30, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719152125/http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html| archivedate= July 19, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during an address commemorating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the [[March on Washington]], Clinton stated his belief that watching the march on television "had a more profound impact" on his life than his meeting with President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1998-book2/html/PPP-1998-book2-doc-pg1472.htm|title=Remarks on the 35th Anniversary of the March on Washington in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts|date=August 28, 1998|first=Bill|last=Clinton|authorlink=Bill Clinton|publisher=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States|quote= The summer of 1963 was a very eventful one for me, the summer I turned 17. What most people know about it now is the famous picture of me shaking hands with President Kennedy in July. It was a great moment. But I think the moment we commemorate today--a moment I experienced all alone--had a more profound impact on my life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting Hillary===
Bill Clinton met his future wife, [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]], at [[Yale University]] and married her in 1975. They moved to Arkansas, where Clinton began to pursue a career in politics by running for and eventually being elected to the position of [[Attorney General of Arkansas]]. He was sworn into office in 1977. Had he not decided to study law, he may have never met Hillary at Yale.

===Tenure as Governor===
He eventually decided to run for [[Governor of Arkansas]] two years later. He was sworn in as Governor for the first time in 1979. At the time, the Governor and Attorney General served only two-year terms. He lost his [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980|1980 election]], but ran again in 1982, and was therefore sworn in for the second time in 1983. During his tenure, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] changed the constitution to have the Governor serve four-year terms&lt;ref&gt;https://ballotpedia.org/Amendments,_Arkansas_Constitution#Amendment_63&lt;/ref&gt;. He subsequently ran again in 1984, 1986, and 1990. He resigned halfway through his last term after becoming elected [[President of the United States|President]].

'''Emma Calvé''', born '''Rosa Emma Calvet''' (15 August 1858 – 6 January 1942), was a French [[opera]]tic [[soprano]].

Calvé was probably the most famous French female opera singer of the [[Belle Époque]]. Hers was an international career, and she sang regularly at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] House, New York, and the [[Royal Opera House]], London.

==Early life==
Calvé was born on 15 August 1858 in [[Decazeville]], [[Aveyron]].{{Sfn|Hoffman|2004|p=153}} Her birth name was Rosa Emma Calvet.{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2013|p=395}} Her father, Justin Calvet, was a civil engineer. She spent her childhood at first in Spain with her parents, then in different convent schools in [[Roquefort-sur-Soulzon|Roquefort]] and Tournemire (Aveyron). After her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Paris. There she attempted to enter the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatory]], while she studied singing under Jules Puget.

She started learning music in Paris from [[Mathilde Marchesi]],{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2013|p=395}} a retired German [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[Manuel García (baritone)|Manuel García]]. She made a tour of Italy, where she saw the famous actress [[Eleonora Duse]], whose impersonations made a deep impression on the young singer. She trained herself in stage craft and gesture by closely observing Duse's performances.

==Career==
[[File:Jean de Paleologu - Jules Massenet - Sapho.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for Emma Calvé in [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]'s ''[[Sapho (Massenet)|Sapho]]'', [[Opéra-Comique]], Paris, November&amp;nbsp;27, 1897]]
She made her operatic debut on 23 September 1881 in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' at Brussels' [[La Monnaie]].{{Sfn|Hoffman|2004|p=153}} Later she sang at [[La Scala]] in Milan, and also at the principal theatres of Naples, Rome, and Florence.

Returning to Paris in 1891, she created the part of Suzel in ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'' by [[Pietro Mascagni]], playing and singing the role later at Rome. Because of her great success in it, she was chosen to appear{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} as Santuzza in the French premiere of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', which was viewed as one of her greatest parts. She repeated her success in it in London.

In 1892, she spent 6 months in Rome, studying under Mustafa, the last castrato Head of the Sistine Chapel Choir, adding half an octave to the top of her range.

Her next triumph was [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''. Before beginning the study of this part, she went to Spain, learned the Spanish dances, mingled with the people and patterned her characterization after the cigarette girls whom she watched at their work and at play. In 1894, she made her appearance in the role at the Opéra-Comique, Paris. The city's opera-goers immediately hailed her as the greatest Carmen that had ever appeared, a verdict other cities would later echo.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} She had had many famous predecessors in the role, including [[Adelina Patti]], [[Minnie Hauk]] and [[Célestine Galli-Marié]], but critics and musicians agreed that in Calvé they had found their ideal of Bizet's cigarette girl of Seville.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Calvé first appeared in America in the season of 1893–1894 as [[Mignon]]. She would make regular visits to the country, both in grand opera and in concert tours. After making her [[Metropolitan Opera]] debut as Santuzza, she went on to appear a total of 261 times with the company between 1893 and 1904. She created the part of Anita, which was written for her, in [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]'s ''[[La Navarraise]]'' in London in 1894 and sang ''[[Sapho (Massenet)|Sapho]]'' in an opera written by the same composer.

She sang Ophélie in [[Ambroise Thomas]]'s ''[[Hamlet (opera)|Hamlet]]'' in Paris in 1899, but the part was not suited to her and she dropped it. She appeared with success in many roles, among them, as the Countess in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', the title role in Félicien David's ''[[Lalla-Roukh]]'', as Pamina in ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', and as Camille in [[Ferdinand Hérold|Hérold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]'', but she is best known as Carmen.

Calvé's Metropolitan Opera career ended abruptly in 1904, as Irving Kolodin described in his book THE METROPOLITAN OPERA [Knopf 1968]. She was to sing  a group of Provençal songs at the Met's Sunday evening concert. Music director Felix Mottl was to accompany her at the piano. "As they were about to begin, she turned and asked him to transpose the music a tone lower. When he refused, she walked off the stage and out of the Metropolitan's history. When she reappeared in New York, it was with Hammerstein's company (1907)."

Calvé developed an interest in the [[paranormal]] and was once engaged to the [[occult]] author [[Henri Antoine Jules-Bois|Jules Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mme. Calve to Marry|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00914FA3B5412738DDDAF0894D9405B838CF1D3|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 January 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1893/1894 the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] (1862–1947) executed a life-size portrait of her standing full-length in a green-blue dress, wearing an opera cloak of white and gold with a sable edge, clutching American Beauty roses. It is now lost, but a pastel he made of her in March 1894 has been discovered in a London private collection.

==Later life==
Calvé died on 6 January 1942 at [[Montpellier]], [[Hérault]], and is buried in [[Millau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music: A Carmen Dies|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=19 January 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice is preserved in a number of recordings made between 1902 and 1920. These are available on CD transfers.

==Influences==
Calvé wrote of [[Swami Vivekananda]] in her autobiography: "[He] truly walked with God, a noble being, a saint, a philosopher and a true friend. His influence upon my spiritual life was profound [...] my soul will bear him eternal gratitude".&lt;ref&gt;Calvé, Emma (1922). [https://archive.org/details/mylife004040mbp ''My Life''], p. 185 (English translation by Rosamond Gilder). D. Appleton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light from the Orient: Essays on the Impact of India's Sacred Literature on the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s38aAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2013|year=2005|publisher=Advaita Ashrama Publication Department|isbn=978-81-7505-277-2|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also visited [[Belur Math]], Swami Vivekananda's tribute to his guru [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]]. She said of this visit and her association with the monks there: "The hours that I spent with these gentle philosophers have remained in my memory as a time apart. These beings – pure, beautiful and remote seemed to belong to another universe, a better and wiser world"&lt;ref&gt;Calvé (1922) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sri Ma Darshan in Bengali by Swami Nityatmananda, volume 3, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Vivekananda wrote of Calvé:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of Swami Vivekananda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4tIXAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2013|year=1981|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;She was born poor but by her innate talents, prodigious labour and diligence, and after wrestling against much hardship, she is now enormously rich and commands respect from kings and emperors....The rare combination of beauty, youth, talents, and "divine" voice has assigned Calve the highest place among the singers of the West. There is, indeed, no better teacher than misery and poverty. That constant fight against the dire poverty, misery, and hardship of the days of her girlhood, which has led to her present triumph over them, has brought into her life a unique sympathy and a depth of thought with a wide outlook.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">'''Gurughli''' (also known as '''Gurghuli''')  is the titular character of an epic cycle from Central Asia. The cycle includes up to fifty segments which are still performed by the peoples of [[Turkistan]] in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] as well as [[Turkic languages]].&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claus|first1=Peter J.|last2=Diamond|first2=Sarah|last3=Mills|first3=Margaret Ann|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=28 August 2013|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415939195|page=275|chapter=Gurughli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurughli, whose name means "born of the grave", is the immaculately conceived child of the sister of Ahmadkhan (a Turkistan [[Khan (title)|khan]]). She dies during pregnancy, and the child is born while the mother is already buried and survives on the milk of one of the mares from Ahmadkhan's herd, until he is found and named by shepherds. The other hero in the tales is his adopted son Ahwazkhan, child of a fairy mother.

His tales are told in all-night storytelling sessions in free verse. The background presumed known by the audience, they start without much introduction and are accompanied by music from a two-stringed lute, the [[dombra]]. Later brought into line with [[Islam]], the stories originate from a time before Islam reached the area but became a "vehicle for the transmission of religious and moral instruction, especially targeted at the masses of nonliterate Muslims".&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003"/&gt; 

The extant corpus of Gurughli poetry entails some 100,000 lines. It reached its final form in the 18th century and was first discovered by the outside world through Russian travelers in 1870. It was recorded between 1930 and 1960 and is preserved in the [[Tajik Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdullaev|first1=Kamoludin|last2=Akbarzaheh|first2=Shahram|title=Historical Dictionary of Tajikistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mC9RsIYy8m8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=9780810860612|pages=153–54|chapter=Gurughli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy &amp; Ralna''' are an [[United States|American]] singing duo that appeared as regulars on television's ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' from 1970 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=0Pl7QZqXlBsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22guy+and+ralna%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DcBGTv-tCungiALQ4dmbBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22guy%20and%20ralna%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
The act consists of [[Guy Hovis]] and [[Ralna English]], who married in  early 1969 and made their Welk debut on his Christmas show the same year. English had been a solo performer on the show for a few months, having already joined in mid-1969.  They specialize in [[country music|country]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[big band]] and [[popular music]].

The couple has released a number of albums, including ''Hymns We Love To Sing'', which was nominated for a [[Dove Award]] in 1972. ''Country Songs We Love to Sing'', released in 1973, peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;21 on the [[Billboard Country Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/guy-ralna-p83045/charts-awards&lt;/ref&gt; Their popularity peaked in the 1970s, at which time they had their own fan club and made numerous appearances on other television shows and commercials.

When the Welk show ended in 1982, and later when the couple divorced in 1984, the act disbanded for a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ralnaenglish.com/ralnaart53usa.html&lt;/ref&gt; They have since reunited professionally and have continued to perform, both at [[PBS]] [[Pledge drive|pledge specials]] and in concert venues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhptv.org/events/guyandralna/&lt;/ref&gt; They have also performed at political appearances of U.S. Senator [[Trent Lott]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oU2cm1bOIGIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22guy+and+ralna%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DcBGTv-tCungiALQ4dmbBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22guy%20and%20ralna%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Official site of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, consulted 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nigerien]] athlete.  A competitive swimmer, Djibo Issaka trained as a [[Rowing at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls|Men's single sculls]] rower for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] to take a development spot offered to the Nigerien federation by the International Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCABRE86S0NN20120729?sp=true Novice rower wins hearts of Eton crowd].

Djibou Issaka, a gardener and swimming pool attendant,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/sports/olympics/14iht-srolathlete14.html?src=recg "The Good, the Bad and the Unforgettable"], ''New York Times'', 13 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was chosen by Niger to train as a sculler just three months prior to the 2012 Summer Olympic games, receiving his first training in competitive rowing in Egypt, then spending two months at the International Rowing Development Centre in Tunisia.  He was chosen for a wild card from the IOC Tripartite Commission, adding him to the full pool of otherwise qualified rowers, in a program that seeks to develop sports outside traditional competitors.  In the 12 weeks prior to the Olympics he was named Nigerien national rowing champion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180673/London-2012s-Eric-Eel-uncovered-Niger-rower-finishes-90-seconds-winning-boat.html London 2012's Eric the Eel uncovered: Niger rower finishes last (but he was only 90 seconds behind the winner)]. Ian Garland, Daily Mail. 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He trained in the Belgian town of Hazewinkel, prior to the opening of the games.

On 28 July, Djibo Issaka gained widespread press attention for his first Olympic appearance in the 2000 metre single sculls heat, in which he finished last with a time of 8:25.56, almost a minute behind his nearest competitor and almost 1 minute 40 seconds behind the winner. The British press gave Djibo Issaka a wave of attention following his first appearance, comparing him with Equiguinean swimmer [[Eric Moussambani Malonga|Eric "the Eel" Moussambani]] from the Sydney games in 2000, and giving Djibo Issaka headline nicknames of "Issaka the Otter", "Hamadou The Keel," and the "Sculling Sloth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/athletics/niger-rower-hamadou-djibo-issaka-1185103 Issaka The Otter: Novice from Niger is new Eddie The Eagle after super-slow sculls] Steve Anglesey, The Mirror (London). 29 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&amp;id=8217217 'Sculling Sloth' back on water at London Olympics]. AP 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While crowds and the press cheered him, British former Olympic Gold Medal rower [[Steve Redgrave]] criticised Djibo Issaka's inclusion.  Despite these comments, the IOC explained Djibo Issaka had not taken the place of any other qualified rower, but was one of a number of Olympians added to additional places created after qualification.

In total, Djibo Issaka rowed in four rounds of the competition, finishing in last position in each race.

He actively promoted the ITU Connect series of events, with the first one, [[Connect Africa]], being held in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]], in 2007. Connect Africa raised US$55 billion in investment pledges to improve Africa's telecommunications infrastructure over seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.pcworld.about.com/businesscenter/article/144718/itu_nets_55_billion_for_connect_africa_launch.html |title=About.com: Need.

Touré serves as co-vice-chair of the [[Broadband Commission for Digital Development]] which was launched in May 2010 by ITU and [[UNESCO]], with Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, and Carlos Slim Helú, Honorary Lifetime Chairman of Grupo Carso, as co-chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org |title=Broadband Commission for Digital Development |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also on the [[International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats]] (IMPACT) International Advisory Board &lt;ref&gt;http://www.impact-alliance.org/aboutus/profile-of-IAB-members.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, IMPACT has been appointed the United Nation’s (UN) Cybersecurity Executing Arm by the UN’s Specialised Agency – International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The Memorandum of Agreement was officially signed by Hamadoun Touré and [[Mohd Noor Amin|Datuk Mohd Noor Amin]], Chairman of IMPACT at the ITU’s head office in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;http://it.tmcnet.com/topics/it/articles/223220-impact-appointed-uns-cybersecurity-executing-arm-un-specialized.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76347">[[John Le Mesurier]] (born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley; 5&amp;nbsp;April 1912{{spaced ndash}}15&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;1983) was an English actor who performed in many mediums of [[light entertainment]], including film, radio and theatre.&lt;ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /&gt; Le Mesurier's career spanned from 1934 until his death in 1983.  He is best remembered for his role as [[Sergeant Arthur Wilson]] in the BBC situation comedy ''[[Dad's Army]]'', between 1968 and 1977.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=ix}}

Le Mesurier made his professional stage debut in September 1934 in ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh under his birth name, and appeared on television for the first time four years later as Seigneur de Miolans in the [[BBC Television]] broadcast of "The Marvellous History of St Bernard".  The broadcast was adapted from a 15th-century manuscript by [[Henri Ghéon]].{{sfn|Barry|1992|p=190}} After [[World War II|wartime]] service as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Royal Tank Regiment]],&lt;ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /&gt; Le Mesurier returned to acting and made his radio debut on the [[BBC Home Service]] in a March 1947 broadcast of ''Escape or Die''. He continued working in television roles throughout his career, but it was his portrayal in the BBC television play ''[[Traitor (TV drama)|Traitor]]'', of a character loosely based on [[Kim Philby]], which earned him the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actor]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="BFI: Traitor" /&gt;

In 1948, Le Mesurier worked on his first film, ''[[Death in the Hand]]'', a mystery in which he played the character Jack Mottram. He went on to appear in over 100&amp;nbsp;films, including ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1955), ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959), ''[[The Punch and Judy Man]]'' (1962), ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'' (1959), ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1963), ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /&gt; He always appeared in supporting roles.

Le Mesurier took a relaxed approach to acting, saying: "I'm a jobbing actor&amp;nbsp;... as long as they pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title".&lt;ref name="Guardian: star dies" /&gt; He was known for playing "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days".&lt;ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /&gt; Le Mesurier died in November 1983 from a stomach [[haemorrhage]]; his last words before slipping into a coma were: "It's all been rather lovely."{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|p=189}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Le Mesurier gave the impression of an "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which [he] made his own",&lt;ref name="Guardian: 2nd row" /&gt; while [[Philip Oakes]] considered that Le Mesurier single-handedly "made more films watchable, even absorbing than anyone else around".&lt;ref name="S Times: Worrier" /&gt;

'''Jonathan Goldman'''  is an American author, musician and teacher in the fields of [[Harmonics]] and ''Sound Healing''. He is based in Boulder, Colorado. His career spans over 30 years.  In 2011, he was included by the [[Watkins Review]] as 74 on its list of "100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in the World".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watkinsmagazine.com/watkins-spiritual-100-list 100 Spiritual Power List] Watkins Review. Issue 26, Spring 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to Goldman, his interest in using sound as a healing modality originated from his own experiences during live performances as a guitarist in the Boston [[punk rock|punk]] scene in the late 1970s. While playing, he became aware of how sound could be made to affect listeners, determined, in part, by the intention of the musician,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/fashion/thursdaystyles/24sounders.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=stephanie%20rosenbloom%20sound%20healing&amp;st=cse Rosenbloom, Stephanie:  ''What's the Buzz? Sound Therapy''] The New York Times. November 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; not just the physical act of playing an instrument, nor the emotional energy expressed by the musician while playing. Based on these experiences, Goldman began to research the science of sound and music psychology, directing his overall studies towards the use of sound as a healing force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2010/jun/21/ear-wars-and-ultimate-om/ ''Ear Wars and the Ultimate Om''] Arkansas Democrat Gazette. June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he founded the Sound Healers Association (SHA) in Lexington, Massachusetts. SHA was a small, informal gathering of musicians, artists, scientists, teachers and authors, and anyone interested in sound healing. Meetings were  held in his home once a month and typically included a guest speaker's presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session. Guest speakers included [[Steven Halpern]], John Beaulieu, Randall McClellan and Dr. Peter Guy Manners. Subjects discussed at SHA meetings included the work of [[Hans Jenny (cymatics)|Hans Jenny]]; [[Resonance]]; [[Musica universalis]]; [[Harmonics]] and [[Entrainment (physics)|Entrainment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundhealersassociation.org/sha/ History of the Sound Healers Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Goldman worked on his master's degree program in Independent Study from [[Lesley University]], researching the uses of sound and music for Healing, which became the main source of material for his first published works.  He began recording his own music and he formed Spirit Music, one of the first {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}record labels dedicated to the therapeutic use of sound and music.The label has recorded and released music by Goldman, as well as [[Mozart Effect|Don Campbell]], Sarah Benson, Sam McClellan, [[Laraaji]], the [[Gyuto Monks|Gyume Monks]] and more recently, [[Ngawang Tashi Bapu|Lama Tashi]], among others.

Goldman's healing music and writing has been  influenced by the early SHA meetings as well as mythology; psychology; multi-cultural music traditions; ancient religions; mathematics and speculative fiction. The  theory that runs beneath all of his written and music works is:

# That everything in the universe is in a state of vibration. Everything is in motion and produces a sound or frequency. This includes the various parts of our body, organs, bones, tissue, etc.
# When we are in a state of "sound" health, everything in our bodies is vibrating in resonance or harmony with itself. When something is vibrating out of harmony, we call this "disease".
# Sound is an energy that can entrain or change the vibrational rate of objects. Therefore, if something is vibrating out of tune or harmony, it is possible to create the correct, natural "resonant" frequency of the out of tune object, project it to that out of tune portion and cause it to vibrate back to its normal, healthy state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/soundheals.html ''Interview with Jonathan Goldman'' Perfect Sound Forever. Online Music Magazine. Furious.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501033444/http://www.furious.com/perfect/soundheals.html |date=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, can be summarized as: Frequency + Intent = Healing.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Jonathan ''Healing Sounds: The Power of Harmonics'' Healing Arts Press; 1992. {{ISBN|0-89281-993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Tibetan Buddhism==
During his research, Goldman worked with the [[Gyuto Order|Gyume Monks]], whose [[Buddhist chant|sacred chanting]] of ancient mantras is said to be encoded with healing properties and to be of great benefit to its listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh ''Chanting from the Heart'' Parallax Press; 2006. {{ISBN|1-888375-63-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldman met and became a student of the monks during their 1988 US Tour.  During this time, Goldman recorded and produced a concert of the Gyume Monks' chanting, and he learned the art of deep voice chanting and the [[Overtone singing|'One Voice Chord']] technique from the monks.

He later went on to meet the [[Tibetan Buddhist|Tibetan Buddhist Monk]], Rinchen Chugyal, then Chant Master for the [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung Loseling Monastery]]. In 1995 Rinchen Chugyal ordained Goldman as a Chant Master, empowering him to teach Tibetan Chanting in the West. He also met the [[Ngawang Tashi Bapu|Venerable Ngawang Tashi Bapu]] (Lama Tashi), who succeeded Rinchen Chugyal as Chant Master. Lama Tashi recorded several sessions of Tibetan chanting with Goldman. His 'Tibetan Master Chants', recorded and produced by Goldman, was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=11406&amp;t=1&amp;c=1 ''Tibetan Monk Nominated for Grammy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102085808/http://phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=11406&amp;t=1&amp;c=1 |date=2010-01-02 }} www.phayul.com. December 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/12/22/stories/2006122201370400.htm ''Grammy nomination for Buddhist monk''] The Hindu. January 26th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman's chanting has been featured on several recordings, notably the 1999 Grammy Award-winning album by [[Kitaro]], 'Thinking of You'; his own 'Chakra Chants' series; 'Chakra Dance', which was produced for the opening of a holistic dance club in New York City, and 'Medicine Buddha', made for the US teachings of [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/05.16.01/dalailama-0120.html ''I am only a monk''] "Medicine Buddha" at Shoreline Ampetheatre, May 17–20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
Goldman produces and hosts an annual 'Healing Sounds Intensive' course in [[Loveland, Colorado]]. He also hosts private clinics . He has lectured and taught internationally at major sound conferences and health expos, including National Music &amp; Health Conference, Harvard University, Wesak Festival, American Association of Music Therapy Conference, Tufts University, Global Sound Conference and the University of Hawaii. He also is the presenter of a monthly online radio show on www.healthylife.net.

[[Brigadier]] '''Juan Mackenna''' (October 26, 1771 – November 21, 1814) was an [[Irish people|Irish-born]], [[Chile]]an military officer and hero of the [[Chilean War of Independence]]. He is considered to have been the creator of the Corps of Military Engineers of the [[Chilean Army]].

==Early life==
He was born '''John MacKenna''' (or '''Seán Mac Cionath''' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) in [[Monaghan]], [[Co. Monaghan]], [[Ireland]], the son of William MacKenna of Willville House near Monaghan town and Eleanora O'Reilly and, on his mother's side, a nephew to [[Count]] [[Alejandro O'Reilly]].&lt;ref&gt;Brett, C.E.B. "''Historic Buildings, Groups of Buildings and Areas of Architectural Importance in the Town of Monaghan''". Belfast, Ulster Architectural Heritage Society, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Count O'Reilly took an interest in the young Mackenna and took him to [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] where he studied at the Royal School of Mathematics in [[Barcelona]]. He also trained in the Royal Military Academy as a Military Engineer between 1785 and 1791.

===Military career===
In 1787 he was accepted into the Irish Brigade of the [[Spanish army]], and joined the army fighting in [[Ceuta]] in northern Africa, under Lieutenant Colonel [[Luis Urbina]], and was promoted to Second Lieutenant. In 1791 Mackenna resumed his studies in Barcelona and acted as liaison with mercenaries recruited in Europe. The following year he was promoted to Lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Engineers. In the [[War of the Pyrenees]] against the French, Juan Mackenna fought in [[Rosselló (comarca)|Rosselló]] under General Ricardos and there met the future liberator of Argentina, [[José de San Martín]]. For his exploits in defence of the Plaza de Rozas, he was promoted to captain in 1795.

==Career in Chile==
For the purpose of a new assignment, in October 1796, Juan Mackenna left Spain for South America. He arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] and then travelled to [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and to [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]] across the Andes and then to [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]]. Once in [[Lima]], he contacted [[Ambrosio O'Higgins]], another Irishman, at that time [[Viceroy]] of Perú, who named him Governor of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] and put him in charge of the reconstruction works for this southern Chilean town.{{sfn|Seccombe|1893}}

In this capacity, Juan Mackenna convinced the families of [[Castro, Chile|Castro]], on the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], to move to Osorno to found a colony there. He built the storehouse and two mills, as well as the road between Osorno and present-day [[Puerto Montt]]. His successful administration provoked jealousy from Chile's captain-general [[Gabriel de Avilés, 2nd Marquis of Avilés|Gabriel de Avilés]], who feared that Juan Mackenna and Ambrosio O'Higgins would create an Irish colony in Osorno. Both Irishmen were loyal to the Spanish crown, though Juan Mackenna had good relations with O'Higgins' son [[Bernardo O'Higgins|Bernardo]], the future emancipator of Chile, and was also connected with the Venezuelan [[Francisco de Miranda]] and his group of supporters of South American independence. When Ambrosio O'Higgins died in 1801, Avilés was appointed viceroy of Peru. It took him eight years to remove O'Higgins's protégé Juan Mackenna from Osorno.

===Revolutionary wars===
In 1809 Juan Mackenna married Josefina Vicuña y Larraín, an eighteen-year-old Chilean woman from a family with revolutionary connections, with whom he had three children: María del Carmen Dolores, Juan Francisco María del Tránsito, and Félix. After the Declaration of Chilean Independence in 1810, he adhered to the [[Patriotism|Patriot]] side and was commissioned by the first Chilean government to prepare a plan for the defense of the country and oversaw the equipment of the new [[Chilean Army]]. At this juncture he trained the first military engineers for the new army.

The following year he was called to the defence committee of the new Republic of Chile, and in 1811 was appointed governor of [[Valparaíso, Chile|Valparaíso]]. Owing to political feuds with [[José Miguel Carrera]] and his brothers, Juan Mackenna was dismissed from the post and taken prisoner. He was a firm ally of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who appointed him as one of the key officers to fight the Spanish army of General [[Antonio Pareja]]. Mackenna's major military honour was attained in 1814 at the [[Battle of Membrillar]], in which the general assured a temporary collapse of the royal forces.

As a reward for his victory, he was appointed commandant-general by Bernardo O'Higgins, but after a coup d'état led by [[Luis Carrera]] he was exiled to [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Argentina]] in 1814, when Carrera took over power. Juan Mackenna died in [[Buenos Aires]] late in 1814, after a duel with Luis Carrera.{{sfn|Seccombe|1893}}

==Public commemoration in Monaghan==
A bust of General MacKenna was publicly presented to Monaghan County Museum on 5 August 2004 by his direct descendant [[:es:Luis Valentín Ferrada]].&lt;ref name="geese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishidentity.com/geese/stories/djuanmckenna.htm |title=Co-Liberator of Chile |website=Irish Identity |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the presentation ceremony General MacKenna, the man "unreservedly regarded as the greatest of Co. Monaghan's exiles" was commemorated in speeches by Most Rev. Dr Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher and by his descendant Senor Ferrada who declared, "In this city of Monaghan, very near to Willville House, the tombs of my ancestors are in the old cemetery. There, my own blood is interred in the sacred earth."&lt;ref name="geese"/&gt;

==Family==
Mackenna was the great-grandfather of Chilean composer [[Carmela Mackenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-92942.html|title=Carmela Mackenna Subercaseaux (1879-1962)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealog.cl/Chile/M/Mackenna/|title=GENEALOGIA DE LA FAMILIA MACKENNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played [[college football]] for the [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU Horned Frogs]] at [[Texas Christian University]]. Berry was selected in the [[1950 NFL Draft]], and played professional football for two seasons with the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in what later became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). In 1950, he received the [[Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy]] for the CFL West Division's [[most valuable player]].

==Early life==
Berry attended [[Wichita Falls High School]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]. While there, he played [[high school football|football]] under head coach [[Thurman Jones|Thurman "Tugboat" Jones]]. During his junior season in 1944, he led the Coyotes to an 8–3 record and the district championship. Nevertheless, Berry said, "There was this café in town where people went on Saturday mornings to rehash the game from the night before. One morning I heard a couple of guys in there talking about me. One said, 'He will never make it.' I said to myself, 'We'll see.'"&lt;ref name=nick&gt;[http://m.timesrecordnews.com/news/2008/Jun/21/gholson-nick-time-june-21/ Gholson: In the Nick of Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717060352/http://m.timesrecordnews.com/news/2008/Jun/21/gholson-nick-time-june-21/ |date=2011-07-17 }}, ''[[Times Record News]]'', June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior in 1945, Berry led Wichita Falls to an 11–1–1 record. The Coyotes' sole loss was to the eventual state champions, [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]], which eliminated Wichita Falls in the semifinals.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt;

==College career==
Berry attended [[Texas Christian University]] where he played on the [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Horned Frogs]] varsity football team all four seasons. In addition to playing quarterback, he was also TCU's [[punt returner|punt]] and [[kickoff returner]] and played [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] on defense.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt; His [[forward pass|passing]] duo with [[end (American football)|end]] [[Morris Bailey]] was nicknamed the "Berry-to-Bailey Battery."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amarillo.com/stories/071902/obi_executivedies.shtml Retired business executive dies at age 77], ''[[Amarillo Globe-News]]'', July 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Wichita Falls' ''[[Times Record News]]'' reported an incident that demonstrated Berry was "tough as nails".&lt;ref name=nick/&gt; In one unspecified game against the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]], Berry dropped back in the [[passing pocket|pocket]] looking to pass. A Longhorns defender, [[Errol Fry]], dodged a [[blocking (American football)|block]] and [[quarterback sack|sacked]] Berry. During the [[tackle (football move)|tackle]], Fry's elbow struck Berry in the face and knocked out two of his front teeth and [[mandibular fracture|broke his jaw]]. Nevertheless, Berry played the following week, while wearing a [[goaltender mask|hockey mask]] to protect his jaw that had been wired shut.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt;

He earned his first [[Letterman (sports)|letter]] as a freshman in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gofrogs.cstv.com/photos/schools/tcu/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/0809-mg-sec1-137-158.pdf Records], ''2008 TCU Football Media Guide'', p. 172, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he led the team in passing with 429 yards, 31 [[completion (American football)|completion]]s on 67 attempts, and one [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name=pass/&gt; He also led the team in [[rush (American football)|rush]]ing with 379 yards on 112 attempts and four [[touchdown]]s.&lt;ref name=records/&gt; In 1948, Berry recorded 706 passing yards, 61 completions on 134 attempts, and two touchdowns.&lt;ref name=pass/&gt; Midway through the season, he ranked second in the nation in total offensive yards until surpassed by [[Charlie Justice (American football player)|Charlie Justice]] of [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scott.k12.va.us/gchsfootball/1948%20Articles/48coeburn.pdf Present Army Duo Eyes New Cadet Record]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), [[Associated Press]], 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Berry finished the season as the team's rushing leader with 783 yards on 190 attempts and four touchdowns.&lt;ref name=records&gt;Records, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; He was named an All-[[Southwest Conference]] selection.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;Records, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the Rogers Trophy as the team's [[most valuable player]].&lt;ref&gt;Records, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Berry compiled 1,445 passing yards, 106 completions on 220 attempts, and seven touchdowns.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;Records, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He also threw 23 [[interception]]s, which to date remains the school record.&lt;ref name=pass/&gt; He was named a first-team All-American and an All-Southwest Conference selection.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Records, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, he participated in the [[East-West Shrine Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Records, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; During that season, he compiled 1,445 passing yards in 10 games. At the time, only one other TCU quarterback had exceeded that in a season, [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Davey O'Brien]], and he had the benefit of playing in one additional game.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt;

During his college career, Berry had recorded 1,745 rushing yards, 1,372 punt return yards, 729 kickoff return yards, 185 interception return yards, and 32 receiving yards. He graduated from TCU as its all-time career leader in all-purpose yardage, a distinction which stood through the mid-1980s when his mark was surpassed by [[Tony Jeffery]].&lt;ref&gt;Records, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Berry's 2,101 total kick return yards set a school record that stood until 2005, when it was broken by [[Cory Rodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/draft/2006/coryrodgers.phtml Cory Rodgers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211051028/http://www.packers.com/draft/2006/coryrodgers.phtml |date=2009-02-11 }}, [[Green Bay Packers]], retrieved July 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Berry married Mary, the secretary of his former college coach [[Dutch Meyer]].&lt;ref name=nick/&gt; Their grandson, Charlie Berry, played for Highland Park High School and the [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU Mustangs]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] as a [[defensive lineman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://smumustangs.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/berry_charlie00.html Charlie Berry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115200427/http://smumustangs.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/berry_charlie00.html |date=2007-11-15 }}, Southern Methodist University, retrieved July 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since those are both rivals of the elder Berry's [[alma mater]]s, he said, "It wasn't easy but I had to cheer for Charlie."&lt;ref name=nick/&gt;

Berry was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt; In 2008, he was inducted into the [[Oil Bowl (high school)|Oil Bowl]] Hall of Fame, which honors the most outstanding past participants of a high school football all-star game between Texas and Oklahoma players.&lt;ref name=nick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilbowl.com/fame.php Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617101252/http://www.oilbowl.com/fame.php |date=2010-06-17 }}, [[Oil Bowl (high school)|Oil Bowl]], retrieved July 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' listed him among six others as "worthy of consideration" as the best player to have ever worn the [[squad number|number]] 43.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/ncaa/01/03/worthy/ Worthy of Consideration Honorable Mention: Best College Players by Number], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long Jiguang''' (龍濟光) (1867–1925) was an ethnic [[Hani people|Hani]] Chinese general of the late Qing and early Republican period of [[China]].

==Biography==
Long's older brother Jinguang (龍覲光) was also a general. Long began his military career suppressing anti-Qing rebellion by Republican revolutionaries in China. After the fall of the Qing, he supported [[Yuan Shi-kai]] against [[Sun Yat-sen]]. After Yuan created the [[Empire of China]], Long fought against the [[Guangxi]] warlords Lu Rongting and [[Li Liejun]], who opposed Yuan's restoration of the monarchy. An opponent of the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]], Yuan fled southern China to Beijing, where he supported [[Duan Qirui]] and the [[Anhui clique]] until their defeat in the [[Zhili-Anhui War]]. Long died in Beijing on the same day as Sun Yat-sen.

[[Ye Ju]] was one of his lieutenants.

=={{anchor|Responses}}Controversy==
One of Steinberger's articles published by ''Slate'' in 2002, "Grape Rot: The New Wine Spectator's Distinct Aroma of Fishiness",&lt;ref name=sl-wsrot&gt;{{cite web|last= Steinberger |first=Mike, ''Slate'' | title= Grape Rot: The New Wine Spectator's Distinct Aroma of Fishiness;  Wine Spectator defends its Honor |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2075720/ |date= December 26, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a harsh response by ''Wine Spectator'' executive editor Tom Matthews. Steinberger's articles were no longer published in ''Wine Spectator'' after the  article, and Matthews demanded a retraction of the article, while recommending that ''Slate'' "no longer accept Steinberger's unprofessional and potentially libelous contributions".

An article that revealed Steinberger's distaste for the [[Sauvignon blanc]] grape, "White Lies: Why Sauvignon Blanc is Overrated",&lt;ref name=ms-sb&gt;{{cite web|last= Steinberger |first= Mike, ''Slate'' |title = White Lies: Why Sauvignon Blanc is Overrated |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2139871/  |date=April 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was widely met with surprise by the wine writers' community.&lt;ref name=nytea&gt;{{cite web| last= Asimov |first= Eric, ''The New York Times'': The Pour |title= Easygoing Califonians  |url= http://thepour.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/easygoing-californians/ |date= July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vinog&gt;{{cite web| last= Yarrow |first= Alder, Vinography.com |title= Why Slander a Grape?  |url= http://www.vinography.com/archives/2006/04/why_slander_a_grape.html |date= April 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Slate'' article titled "Change We Can Taste", written concerning an interview with [[White House]] food and beverage operations usher Daniel Shanks published on ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg.com]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Elin, ''Bloomberg.com'' (September 18, 2008). [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aYT1uP1dkSPI White House Wine Jeeves Picks Bottles for 'Presence']&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberger called for a new "wine policy" for the [[Barack Obama|Obama presidency]].&lt;ref name=ms-ch&gt;{{cite web|last= Steinberger |first= Mike, ''Slate'' |date= January 14, 2009 |title= Change We Can Taste |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2208229/pagenum/all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coining the term "Shafer-gate", in reference to the serving of bottles of "extravagant" 2003 Shafer Hillside Select, costing around $250 a bottle, at a November 2008 emergency economic summit, the article described the [[George W. Bush|Bush era]] tactics of "[[shock and awe]]" in terms of wine policy, achieved with what Steinberger calls "fruit bombs"; he wrote that the White House wine service had been "hostage to a profoundly misguided strategy", and pointed to Obama's opportunity "to act swiftly and boldly on the wine front".&lt;ref name=ms-ch/&gt; When the article was described by ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter.com]]'' to have "slammed the White House wine policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Shaw |first= Lucy, ''Decanter.com'' |title= Obama urged to change White House wine policy |date= January 28, 2009 |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/275955.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; its contents were quoted and reiterated without any element of [[satire]].

'''Peter Moore''' (29 August 1939 – 20 December 2009) was a British town crier. He worked for the London Tourist Board, the Mayor of London, the cities of London and Westminster, and the boroughs of Southwark, Kingston upon Thames, Tower Hamlets, Merton, Haringey, Redbridge and Ealing.

==Life==
Moore was born in Walsall, West Midlands, England, to a "father unknown". He was raised in a nearby [[Barnardo's|Barnardo's Home]]. He left Walsall for London, and became an actor.&lt;ref name="TimesEngland"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6974553.ece | title=Peter Moore: London’s town crier | work=The Times | date=4 January 2010 | accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast in the original 1960 stage production of [[Lionel Bart| Lionel Bart’s]] ''[[Oliver!]]'', as the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry.&lt;ref name="TimesEngland2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6992866.ece | title=Noisy tribute for Peter Moore, London's town crier | work=The Times | date=18 January 2010 | accessdate=16 May 2011 | author=Bannerman, Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, impresario [[Bernard Delfont]] swore him in as a town crier in the [[Piccadilly Circus]]. He was called on by [[Ken Livingstone]], Leader of the [[Greater London Council]], to promote parades in the [[South Bank]].&lt;ref name="TimesEngland" /&gt;

Peter spent 31 years as the official Town Crier of London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6907934/Londons-town-crier-of-31-years-dies.html | title=London's town crier of 31 years dies | work=The Telegraph | date=29 December 2009 | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the town crier to the mayor of London, the Greater London Authority, the city of Westminster and the London borough of Merton. Moore announced the 1982 birth of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]] outside the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001666.html | title=Peter Moore | publisher=The Blog of Death | date=2 January 2010 | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was a well-known figure in London, often seen at various locations such as [[Covent Garden]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[The Tower of London]], [[Parliament Square]], or [[Piccadilly Circus]]. Peter had a deep love and fondness of London, often shown when quoting [[Dr Samuel Johnson]], ''"When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for in London there is all that life can afford."''&lt;ref name="pmoore"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~webpage/pmoore/docs1.4/index.html | title=Town Crier London, UK, England, Great Britain | publisher=GlobalNet | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Philadelphia Spiritualism and the Curious Case of Katie King''. The History Press. p. 25. {{ISBN|978-1-62619-153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a book entitled ''Experimental Investigation  of the Spirit Manifestations'' (1855). His work was criticized by scientists but was welcomed with enthusiasm by Spiritualists.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Dalton, Maggi. (2012). ''A History of Spiritualism and the Occult in Salem: The Rise of Witch City''. The History Press. p. 91-92. {{ISBN|978-1-60949-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his experiments utilized a board and spring balance, the other involved the movement of a [[table (furniture)|table]] at which a medium sat caused a pointer to indicate letters on a wheel. According to the psychical researcher [[Frank Podmore]] it would have been easy for the medium to move the table with their knees or other parts of the body but "Hare does not seem to have realized the possibility of fraud of this kind."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1897). ''Studies in Psychical Research''. G. P. Putnam's Sons. pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Podmore also wrote that "the machinery, indeed, was not ill-devised, but its use did not dispense with the necessity for close and continuous observation of the human agent; and there is no evidence that Hare recognized this necessity, or took any steps to guard against trickery."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1902). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism''. Methuen Publishing. pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Terence Hines]] has written:

{{quote|What of the scientists such as Hare and Wallace, who were convinced by what they saw at seances? Were they incompetent scientists, dupes, or just plain gullible? The answer is none of the above. They had simply ventured out of their own area of expertise—an often fatal mistake. They assumed, as did their critics in the scientific community, that if one is a good observer in the laboratory, one is also qualified to observe in the seance. This is simply not true. Mediums were known to cheat, using the magicians’ tricks of sleight of hand and distraction. Magic is a skilled trade requiring years of experience and practice. The training of a chemist, physicist, or psychologist confers no ability to spot magicians’ tricks. To detect such cheating requires a magician.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Timothy Kneeland has argued that Hare's interest in Spiritualism was consistent with political and social beliefs that he held throughout his career. His book ''Experimental Investigation  of the Spirit Manifestations'' (1855) promoted the restoration of [[social order]] based on principles of [[republicanism]].&lt;ref name="Kneeland 2008"/&gt;

==Publications==

Hare was a prolific writer, writing about hundred and fifty articles in the [[American Journal of Science]]. Among his other publications, there are:

* ''A Brief View of the Policy and Resources of the United States'' (1810);
* ''Chemical Apparatus and Manipulations'' (1836);
* ''Compendium of the Course of Chemical Instruction in the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania'' (1840);
* ''Memoir on the Explosiveness of Niter'' (1850);
*[https://archive.org/stream/experimentalinv00hare#page/n5/mode/2up ''Experimental Investigation  of the Spirit Manifestations''] (1855);
* ''Spiritualism Scientifically Demonstrated'' (1855).

Hare also wrote two novels:
* ''Standish the Puritan: A Tale of the American Revolution'' (1850)
* ''Overing: or, The heir of Wycherly. A Historical Romance'' (1852)

Kaulback and had a younger brother Roy (known as Bill).&lt;ref&gt;Kaulback, Ronald (1934). ''Tibetan Trek''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton. pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying at the [[University of Cambridge]] and learning surveying at the Royal Geographical Society he accompanied [[Frank Kingdon-Ward]] on an expedition to Tibet. For political reasons Kaulbach was forbidden to continue on the second part of that journey. So he, Brooks Carrington and some others set out on a route by [[Fort Hertz]] and Burma which included crossing the [[Diphuk La]] and after travelling at the worst season reached Fort Hertz.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon-Ward F (1934). "Introduction". '''''In'':''' Kaulback R (1934). ''Tibetan Trek''.

''[[The Straits Times]]''. 17 January 1935. p. 6. Accessed 12 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaulback wrote in defence of the possible existence of the [[Yeti]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Willy Ley|Ley, Willy]] (1962).

'''Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz''' (1565–1619) was a [[Kabbalistic]] author, who flourished in [[Prague]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His father, named Akiba according to Steinschneider and Benjacob, not Jacob, was the son of Abraham Sheftels and the brother of [[Isaiah Horowitz]]. 

Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz wrote ''Nishmat Shabbethai ha-Lewi'', a kabbalistic treatise on the nature of the soul (Prague, 1616), and ''Shefa Ṭal'' (Prague, 1612; [[Frankfurt]], 1719), another kabbalistic compendium, containing also some works of others. The latter has been often reprinted, and is highly recommended by his cousin, [[Shabbethai Horowitz|Shabbethai the Younger]], in his will.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">{{about|the Turkish law|the general concept|Surname law}}
The '''Surname Law''' ({{lang-tr|Soyadı Kanunu}}) of the [[Republic of Turkey]] was adopted on June 21, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perge.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313E603BF9486D4371DF01B9CC4F1C001E7 1934 in history], Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism.&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires all citizens of Turkey to adopt the use of hereditary, fixed, [[surname]]s. Much of the population, particularly in the cities as well as Turkey's [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] citizens, already had surnames, and all families had names by which they were known locally. The Surname Law of 1934 enforced not only the use of official surnames but also stipulated that citizens choose [[Turkish language|Turkish]] names. Until it was repealed in 2013 in Turkey the eldest male was the head of household and the law appointed him to choose the surname. However  in his absence, death or mental incapacitation the wife would do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI3125908/|title = The Social Life of the State's Fantasy: Memories and Documents on Turkey's Surname Law of 1934|date = 2004|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Turkoz|first = Meltem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law was modeled after a 1926 Fascist [[Italianization]] law 'restoring' German, Slovene and Croat surnames to their 'original Italian form'.&lt;ref&gt;Regio decreto legge 10 Gennaio 1926, n. 17: Restituzione in forma italiana dei cognomi delle famiglie della provincia di Trento&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mezulić, Hrvoje; R. Jelić (2005) Fascism, baptiser and scorcher (O Talijanskoj upravi u Istri i Dalmaciji 1918-1943.: nasilno potalijančivanje prezimena, imena i mjesta), Dom i svijet, Zagreb, {{ISBN|953-238-012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims in the Ottoman Empire carried [[title]]s such as “[[Pasha]]”, “[[Hoca]]”, “[[Bey]]”, “[[Khanum|Hanım]]”, “[[Efendi]]”, etc. These titles either defined their formal profession (such as Pasha, Hoca, etc.) or their informal status within the society (such as Bey, Hanım, Efendi, etc.). Ottoman [[prime minister]]s (Sadrazam/Vezir-î Azam or [[Grand Vizier]]), ministers (Nazır/Vezir or [[Vizier]]) and other high-ranking [[civil servant]]s also carried the title Pasha. Retired generals/admirals or high-ranking civil servants continued to carry this title in civilian life. A “Pasha” did not become a “Bey” after retiring from active military or political service.

The articles of the Soy Adı Kanunu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.nvi.gov.tr/Files/File/Mevzuat/Nufus_Mevzuati/Kanun/pdf/soyadi_kanunu.pdf|title =Soy Adı Kanunu|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170107165807/http://www.nvi.gov.tr/Files/File/Mevzuat/Nufus_Mevzuati/Kanun/pdf/soyadi_kanunu.pdf|archivedate =2017-01-07|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulated that: 
# All Turks must bear their surnames in addition to their proper name;
#The surname must follow the proper name in signing, speaking and writing; 
#Names may not relate to military rank and civil officialdom; to tribes, foreign races or ethnicities; nor may they be offensive or ridiculous. The use of “historical names” without the proper genealogical evidence were also forbidden.

The surname law specifically forbade certain surnames that contained connotations of foreign cultures, nations, tribes, and religions.&lt;ref name="Basak"&gt;{{cite book|last=İnce|first=Başak|title=Citizenship and identity in Turkey : from Atatürk's republic to the present day|publisher=I.B.

[[File:Tereo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]: ''Tereus Confronted with the Head of his Son Itys'', 1636–38]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Tereus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|r|i|ə|s|,_|ˈ|t|ɪər|j|uː|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Τηρεύς means "watcher"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Thracians|Thracian]] king,&lt;ref name=T&gt;[[Thucydides]]: ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:29|2:29]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022&amp;layout=&amp;loc=3.14.8 3.14.8]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[Ares]] and the naiad [[Bistonis]]. He was the brother of [[Dryas of Calydon|Dryas]]. Tereus was the husband of the Athenian princess [[Procne]] and the father of [[Itys]].

== Mythology ==
When Tereus desired his wife's sister, [[Philomela]], he came to Athens to his father-in-law Pandion to ask for his other daughter in marriage, stating that Procne had died. Pandion granted him the favour, and sent Philomela and guards along with her. But Tereus threw the guards into the sea, and finding Philomela on a mountain, forced himself upon her. He then cut her tongue out and held her captive so she could never tell anyone. After he returned to Thrace, Tereus gave Philomela to King [[Lynceus (mythology)|Lynceus]] and told his wife that her sister had died. Philomela wove letters in a [[tapestry]] depicting Tereus's crime and sent it secretly to Procne. Lynceus' wife [[Lathusa]] who was a friend of Procne, at once sent the concubine (Philomela) to her. 

When Procne recognized her sister and knew the impious deed of Tereus, the two planned to return the favour to the king. Meanwhile it was revealed to Tereus by prodigies that death by a relative's hand was coming to his son Itys. When he heard this, thinking that his brother Dryas was plotting his son's death, he killed the innocent man. Procne, however, killed her son Itys by Tereus, served his flesh in a meal at his father's table in revenge, and fled with her sister.

When Tereus learned what the crime she had done, he pursued the sisters and tried to kill them but all three were changed by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]] into birds out of pity: Tereus became a [[hoopoe]] or a hawk; Procne became the [[swallow]] whose song is a song of mourning for the loss of her child; Philomela became the [[nightingale]]. Incidentally, the female nightingale has no song. ([[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 45).

== Other usage ==
Tereus was also a common given name among Thracians.&lt;ref name=T /&gt;

The [[Athens|Attic]] playwrights [[Sophocles]] and [[Philocles]] both wrote plays entitled ''[[Tereus (play)|Tereus]]'' on the subject of the story of Tereus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Word and Image in Ancient Greece|editor1=Rutter, N.K.|editor2=Sparkes, B.A.|author=March, J.|chapter=Vases and Tragic Drama|pages=121–123|year=2000|publisher=University of Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-1405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] refers to Tereus in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', after Chiron and Demetrius have raped Lavinia and cut out her tongue and also both her hands. He also makes reference to Tereus in "[[Cymbeline]]", when Iachimo spies upon the sleeping Imogen to gather false evidence so he can persuade Posthumus he has seduced her.

==Modern adaptations==

*''[[The Love of the Nightingale (opera)|The Love of the Nightingale]]'', [[opera]] by [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]] to a [[libretto]] from the above play

{{Missing information|Vættir in Norse myth. The article requires significant verifiable expansion|date=November 2018}}

}}

The '''Vættir''' (Old Norse; [[Old Norse morphology#Strong nouns|singular '''Vættr''']]) of Norse myth are spirits. The term can be used to refer to the full Norse cosmos of supernatural beings, including the [[Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar|Álfar]] (elves), [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|Dvergar]] (dwarves), [[Jötunn|Jötnar]] (giants), and gods (the [[Æsir]] and [[Vanir]]). Vættir can also refer more specifically to [[Landvættir]] ([[nature spirits]]), '''Sjóvættir''' (sea spirits), '''vatnavættir''' (guardians of the specific waters), or '''Húsvættir''' (house spirits.) 

==Etymology==

The Old Norse term ''véttr/vættr'' and its English cognate ''wight'' are descended from Proto-Germanic [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/wihtiz|''*wihtiz'']] (thing, creature), from  Proto-Indo-European ''*wekti-'' ("object, thing").&lt;ref&gt;http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=wight&lt;/ref&gt; Vættr and wight normally refer to [[supernatural]] 'being', especially [[landvættr]] (land spirit), but can refer to any creature. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''vette'' is used much in the same way as the Old Norse ''vættr'', as are the corresponding [[Swedish language|Swedish]] cognate ''vätte'' (dialect form vätter - Old Swedish vætter)&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/svetym/1267.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Danish language|Danish]] ''vætte''. A related form in the Slavic languages can be seen in Old Church Slavonic ''вєшть'', (veštĭ), meaning thing, matter, or subject.

==Viking Age==

[[Landvættir]] (land spirits) are [[chthonic]] guardians of specific grounds, such as wild places or farms. When [[Vikings]] approached land, they reportedly removed their carved [[dragon]] heads from the bows of their [[longship]]s, so as not to frighten and thus provoke the ''landvættir'' to attack, thereby incur bad [[luck]] from them. Icelandic culture continues to celebrate the supernatural protection over the island, and four ''landvættr'' can still be seen in the [[Coat of arms of Iceland|Icelandic coat-of-arms]]: a troll-bull, troll-eagle, dragon, and handsome giant. The troll-animals are actually Jötnar who shapeshifted into the form (and mentality) of an animal, and such animals are supernaturally strong. Even the dragon is generally a troll-snake: compare the Jötunn [[Loki]] whose children include a wolf, a serpent, and a horse.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Folklore==

Húsvættir is a collective term for keepers of the household, like the English [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]] and the Swedish ''[[tomte]]''. The ''tomte'' or ''nisse'' is a solitary vätte, living on the farmstead. He is usually benevolent and helpful, which can not be said about an innately mischievous ''illvätte''. However, a ''nisse'' can cause a lot of damage if he is displeased or angry, including killing of livestock or causing serious accidents.

[[Scandinavian folklore]] features a class of beings similar to the Old Norse ''landvættir''. They are known by many names, although the most common are ''vättar'' in southern [[Sweden]] (singular: vätte), ''[[Vittra (folklore)|vittra]]'' in northern Sweden and ''[[Hulder|huldrefolk]]'' in [[Norway]] (although the singular ''vittra'' and ''huldra'', respectively, refer to a solitary and quite different being).

During the 19th century, [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] compiled the folk tales among Norwegians, as part of the emotive, nationalistic and anti-rational values of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]]. These stories reflected the animistic 'folk belief' that preserved earlier elements deriving from the [[Viking Age]] but strongly influenced by the medieval [[Biblical cosmology]] of Germany, Britain and France. Prominent are stories that reflect later views of the Vættir, usually called the Huldrefolk (from [[Old Norse]] Huldufólk), meaning 'concealed people' and referring to their otherworldliness or their power of invisibility.

The English surname 'Wightman' retains the meaning of the word 'wight' and could be transliterated as 'Elf-friend'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surname Database|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Wightman|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
