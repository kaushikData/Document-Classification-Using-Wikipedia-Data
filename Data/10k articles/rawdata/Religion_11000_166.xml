      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6511">'''African theology''' is Christian theology or [[black theology]] from the perspective of the African cultural context. Although there are very old Christian traditions on the continent, in the last centuries [[Christianity in Africa]] has been determined to a large extent by western forms of Christianity, brought by [[colonization]] and [[Mission (Christian)|mission]], until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyZMtrx6QXAC|title=Reinventing Christianity: African Theology Today|last=Parratt|first=John|date=1995|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|year=|isbn=9780802841131|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
There has been some debate among theologians about the relation of African theology to [[Black Theology|Black theology]]. During the 1970s Black theology developed in [[South Africa]], where the main concern was liberation from [[apartheid]], while African theology developed in other parts of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2ZMAwAAQBAJ|title=African Theology: Inculturation and Liberation|last=Martey|first=Emmanuel|date=2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=|isbn=9781608991259|location=Eugene, OR|pages=1-2|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
In the mid-20th century, African theology as a theological field came into being. This movement began to protest against negative colonial and missionary interpretations of the religion and culture in Africa. Realizing that theology is a contextual phenomenon, [[Christianity in Africa|African Christians]] began to read the [[bible]] using their own cultural lens, which of course resulted in some interpretations that did not always agree with how [[Western Christianity|Western theology]] interpreted things. As such, African theology stands on the shoulders of the early [[African initiated church|African independent churches]] that broke away from missionary churches in the late 19th century or early 20th century. African theology is engaged to shape Christianity in an African way by adapting and using African concepts and ideas. &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nwibo, “A Brief Note on the Need for African Christian Theology” (Cursus  Godsdienst  Onderwijs  (CGO-HBO), September 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

African theologians such as [[Bolaji Idowu]], [[John Mbiti]], and [[Kwesi Dickson]] have given an analysis and interpretation of the [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and point to its relation to the Christian faith. [[Lamin Sanneh]] and [[Kwame Bediako]] have argued for the importance of [[Vernacular|vernacularization]] of the bible and theology. [[Kwame Bediako]] and [[John Pobee]] have developed an African [[Christology]] in terms of the ancestors. 

There is also a movement of African [[Women as theological figures|female theologians]], organised in ''[[The Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians]]'', inaugurated in 1989 by the [[Ghana|Ghanaian]] [[Mercy Oduyoye|Mercy Amba Oduyoye]]. Nowadays this is a movement of hundreds of women theologians from several African countries and with different religious backgrounds. The general coordinator of the Circle have been Oduyoye, [[Musimbi Kanyoro]], [[Isabel Phiri]], and, currently, [[Malawi|Malawian]] [[Fulata Moyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecirclecawt.com/profile.html?PHPSESSID=a796b0ed0a4552e2e85a53799b655ec1|title=The Circle of Concerned African Woman Theologians|last=|first=|date=|website=thecirclecawt.com|publisher=|access-date=8 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, African [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] have also begun to wrestle with the quest of developing a Christian theology which has African context in mind. In this direction, African evangelicals have taken initiative to develop an African [[Exegesis|Bible commentary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Africa-Bible-Commentary-One-Volume-Scholars/dp/0310291879|title=Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars|last=Aboagye-Mensah|first=John R. Stott and Rubert K.|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|year=|isbn=9780310291879|editor-last=Adeyemo|editor-first=Tokunboh|edition=2nd|location=Downers Grove, IL|pages=|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this is not a critical commentary, it shows a quest by African evangelicals to engage traditional and contemporary issues in Africa from an evangelical perspective. Secondly, African evangelicals have also taken initiative in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and texts on [[systematic theology]] which engage the various issues facing most African Christians. For example, [[Samuel Kunhiyop]] has engaged [[Christian ethics]] and [[systematic theology]] from an African evangelical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/African-Christian-Ethics-Samuel-Kunhiyop/dp/9966805362|title=African Christian Ethics|last=Kunhiyop|first=Samuel Waje|date=2008|publisher=Zondervan|year=|isbn=9789966805362|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Matthew Michael]] has engaged systematic theology from the vantage point of [[Traditional African religion|African traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWMNBQAAQBAJ|title=Christian Theology and African Traditions|last=Michael|first=Matthew|date=2013|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=|isbn=9781621896432|location=Eugene, OR|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amar Singh Majithia''' was a soldier and administrator during the [[Sikh Empire]].

==Biography==
He was also called Amar Singh Kallan (senior) to distinguish him from Amar Singh Khurd (junior). Both Amar Singh Kallan and Khurd were from the village of [[Majitha]]. Amar Singh Majithia took part in many early campaigns under [[Ranjit Singh]] and was appointed governor of [[Hazara Division]] after Diwal Ram Dial's death by the [[Mashwanis|Mashwani]] and [[Utmanzai Uthmanzai Atmaanzai|Utmanzai]] tribesmen of Hazara. He was known to be an astute person and succeeded in winning over the leading men to his side, and in collecting the old Durani revenue and tribute from the Hazara plains. However, like his predecessor, Amar Singh Majithia was also killed in battle along with all of his men by the [[Karlal]] tribe of Hazara. The scene of this battle was at the banks of Samundar stream, a tributary of the [[Harroh]] river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=238240&amp;Cat=6&amp;dt=5/9/2010 | title=Commencement of Sikh Rule — The Hazara District | accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/biographies/sikh-martyrs/amar-singh-majithia | title=Amar Singh Majithia | accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Aminadi''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|n|ə|d|aɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-mĭn´a-dī»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]]. Briefly mentioned in the [[Book of Alma]], he is a descendant of [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], and an ancestor (through at least three generations) of [[Amulek]].  

During a speech to the people of [[Ammonihah]], Amulek states that Aminadi was known as a prophet that had "interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/10/2-3#2 Alma 10:2-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''associations of good-doing''' ({{zh|s=行好的|p=Xínghǎode}}) are organised groups of the [[Chinese folk religion|indigenous religion]] of [[Hebei]] province (河北民间宗教 ''Héběi mínjiān zōngjiào'' or 河北民间信仰 ''Héběi mínjiān xìnyǎng''), or the "Pear Area" of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Hua, 2011. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation of the Dragon's Name (龙牌会 ''Lóngpái Huì'') is one of these movements of good-doers.&lt;ref&gt;Hua, 2011. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hua, ''Name of the Dragon'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xinghaode associations organise temple festivals and pilgrimages for the worship of certain deities, as well as other types of collective activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hua, 2013. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Their purpose is to make ''rènào'' (热闹), that is "social living" or "social harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Hua, 2013. p. 6, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The designation of ''Xínghǎode'' (行好的), literally "good-doers" or "those who act well", originated with the spread of the [[Catholic Church]] in the Pear Area over the last two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Local Chinese following the native faith adopted the name in contrast with Catholics, who in the area were called ''Fèngjiàode'' (奉教的).&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics nowadays remain less than 3% of the population of the Pear Area.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperation with local shamans==
In Hebei folk religion, people who have the ability to mediate with the gods are known as ''xiāngdàode'' (香道的), "practitioners of the way of incense", and they cooperate with good-doing groups.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The major ritual practice of ''xiangdaode'' is provide communities of good-doers with "incense reading" (看香 ''kànxiāng''), "incense watching" (瞧香 ''qiáoxiāng'') or "incense kindling" (打香 ''dǎxiāng'').&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly female and are also called by the general terms ''shénpó'' (神婆) or ''xiāngtóu'' (香頭 "incense heads").

In the Pear Area, one can acquire the ministry of the way of incense either through afflatus (or vocation, 仙根 ''xiāngēn'') or acquisition (ordination from another specialist).&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Often they claim that they are spiritual disciples (童儿 ''tónger'') of the [[Four Great Gates]], whose specialists operated in [[Beijing]] in the 1940s, thus connecting their practice with the shamanism of northeast China.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deities==
The deities (神 ''shén'') of good-doers are divided into two classes:&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
* generated or natural gods (家神 ''jiāshén''), who are part of nature and produce concrete things. They can be pan-Chinese deities such as [[Guandi]] or uniquely local deities such as the Goddess of the Nine Lotuses.
* full gods (全神 ''quánshén''), who sustain the cosmos. They are gods of the three planes of the world (heaven, earth and the underworld).

The Horse God (马神 ''Mǎshén'' or 马王 ''Mǎwáng'') has a particular importance in the religion of good-doers.&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Gods that are believed to be particularly powerful are dedicated independent worship halls (仙家堂 ''xiān jiā táng'') or altars (仙家坛 ''xiān jiā tán''), that often start from the house and congregation of popular ''xiangdaode'' (shamans).&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yue, 2014. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bhikkhunī''' ([[Pali]]) or '''bhikṣuṇī''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is a fully ordained female monastic in [[Buddhism]]. Male monastics are called [[bhikkhu]]s. Both bhikkhunis and bhikkhus live by the [[Vinaya]], a set of rules. Until recently, the lineages of female monastics only remained in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] and thus are prevalent in countries such as [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Vietnam]] but a few women have taken the full monastic vows in the [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] schools over the last decade. From conservative perspectives, none of the contemporary bhikkuni ordinations are valid.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/bhikkhuni-ordination-modern-buddhism/|title=Bhikkhuni Ordination: Buddhism's Glass Ceiling|last=Talbot|first=Mary|work=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, women are as capable of reaching [[nirvana]] as men. According to Buddhist scriptures, the order of bhikkhunis was first created by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] at the specific request of his aunt and foster-mother [[Mahapajapati Gotami]], who became the first ordained bhikkhuni.  A famous work of the [[early Buddhist schools]] is the ''[[Therigatha]]'', a collection of poems by elder nuns about enlightenment that was preserved in the [[Pāli Canon]].

Bhikkhunis are required to take extra vows, [[the Eight Garudhammas]], and are subordinate to and reliant upon the bhikkhu order. In places where the bhikkhuni lineage was historically missing or has died out, due to hardship, alternative forms of renunciation have developed. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], women officially take the vows of [[śrāmaṇerī]]s (novitiates); Theravadin women may choose to take an informal and limited set of vows similar to the historical vows of the sāmaṇerī, like the [[maechi]] of [[Thailand]] and [[thilashin]] of [[Myanmar]].

==History==
The tradition of the ordained monastic community ([[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]) began with the Buddha, who established an order of [[Bhikkhu]]s (monks).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One), page 352&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;''Book of the Discipline'', [[Pali Text Society]], volume V, Chapter X&lt;/ref&gt; later, after an initial reluctance, he also established an order of Bhikkhunis (nuns or women monks). However, according to the scriptural account, not only did the Buddha lay down more rules of discipline for the bhikkhunis (311 compared to the bhikkhu's 227 in the Theravada version), he also made it more difficult for them to be ordained, and made them subordinate to monks. The bhikkhuni order was established five years after the bhikkhu order of monks at the request of a group of women whose spokesperson was [[Mahapajapati Gotami]], the aunt who raised [[Gautama Buddha]] after his mother died.

The historicity of this account has been questioned,&lt;ref&gt;Routledge ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', page 822&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes to the extent of regarding nuns as a later invention.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, ''Indian Buddhism'', Kansai University of Foreign Studies, Hirakata, Japan, 1980, reprinted Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1987, 1989, pages 57-9, point (6)&lt;/ref&gt; The stories, sayings and deeds of a substantial number of the preeminent Bhikkhuni disciples of the Buddha as well as numerous distinguished bhikkhunis of early Buddhism are recorded in many places in the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]], most notably in the [[Therigatha]] and Theri Apadana as well as the Anguttara Nikaya and Bhikkhuni Samyutta.  Additionally the ancient bhikkhunis feature in the Sanskrit Avadana texts and the first Sri Lankan Buddhist historical chronicle, the Dipavamsa, itself speculated to be authored by the Sri Lankan Bhikkhuni Sangha.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

According to Peter Harvey, "The Buddha's apparent hesitation on this matter is reminiscent of his hesitation on whether to teach at all", something he only does after persuasion from various [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Peter|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|page=384|isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the special rules for female monastics were given by the founder of Buddhism they have been upheld to this day. Buddhists nowadays are still concerned with that fact, as shows at an [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]] held at the University of Hamburg, Germany, in 2007.

In Buddhism, women can openly aspire to and practice for the highest level of spiritual attainment. Buddhism is unique among [[Indian religions]] in that the Buddha as founder of a spiritual tradition explicitly states in canonical literature that a woman is as capable of [[nirvana]] as men and can fully attain all [[four stages of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ven.

There are also no extant Jain texts from that period to match stories in the Avadānaśataka of women converts who attained high levels of religious experience. Nor is there any equivalent of the forty Apadānas attributed to the nuns who were the Buddha's close disciples. In Brahminism, again, although Stephanie Jamison has eruditely and insightfully drawn out the vicissitudes of the role of women within the Brahmanic ritual of sacrifice, the literature of Brahmanism does not supply us with voices of women from the ancient world, nor with stories of women who renounced their roles in the domestic sphere in favor of the fervent practice of religious observances. |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, major canonical [[Mahayana sutras]] such as the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', chapter 12,&lt;ref name="lotus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus12.htm|title=Lotus Sutra - Chapter 12|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; records 6000 bhikkhuni [[arhant]]is receiving predictions of [[bodhisattva]]hood and future [[buddhahood]] by [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="lotus"/&gt;

===The Eight Garudharmas===
{{main|The Eight Garudhammas}}
Female monastics are required to follow special rules that male monastics do not, [[the Eight Garudhammas]]. The origin of [[the Eight Garudhammas]], the special vows taken by female monastics, is unclear. The Buddha is quoted by Thannisaro Bhikkhu as saying, "Ananda, if Mahaprajapati Gotami accepts eight vows of respect, that will be her full ordination (upasampada)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2/ch23.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122202501/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2/ch23.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 November 2005|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code II: The Khandhaka Rules Translated and Explained|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars{{Who|date=January 2011}} have shown that this story abounds in textual problems, and cannot possibly be a factual account.&lt;ref name="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-faq/"&gt;[http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-faq/ Bhante Sujato].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scriptural accounts, the reason the Buddha gave for his actions was that admission of women to the sangha would weaken it and shorten its lifetime to 500 years. This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth Hecker, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel273.html#n-30 Ananda The Guardian of the Dhamma]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Young Chung noticed that society as recorded in the Vinaya always criticized the bhikkhunis more harshly using "shaven headed strumpets or whores", whereas the bhikkhus were simply called "shaven headed".  This harsher treatment (which also included rape and assault) of bhikkhunis by society required greater protection. Within these social conditions, Gautama Buddha opened up new horizons for women by founding the bhikkhuni sangha. This social and spiritual advancement for women was ahead of the times and, therefore, drew many objections from men, including bhikkhus. He was probably well aware of the controversy that would be caused by the harassment of his female disciples."&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2010/04/chung9912.pdf |title=A Buddhist View of Women: A Comparative Study of the Rules for Bhikṣunīs and Bhikṣus Based on the Chinese Pràtimokùa |author=In Young Chung | journal =Journal of Buddhist Ethics | volume =6 | year = 1999  | pages =29–105 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vinaya]] does not allow for any power-based relationship between the monks and nuns. [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]] wrote:
{{quote|Nuns at the time of the Buddha had equal rights and an equal share in everything. In one case, eight robes were offered to both sanghas at a place where there was only one nun and four monks. The Buddha divided the robes in half, giving four to the nun and four to the monks, because the robes were for both sanghas and had to be divided equally however many were in each group. Because the nuns tended to receive fewer invitations to lay-people's homes, the Buddha had all offerings brought to the monastery and equally divided between the two sanghas. He protected the nuns and was fair to both parties. They are subordinate in the sense of being younger sisters and elder brothers, not in the sense of being masters and slaves."&lt;ref name="thubtenchodron.org"&gt;Chatsumarn Kabilsingh [http://www.thubtenchodron.org/BuddhistNunsMonasticLife/LifeAsAWesternBuddhistNun/the_history_of_the_bhikkhuni_sangha.html The History of the Bhikkhuni Sangha]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ian Astley argues that under the conditions of society where there is such great discrimination and threat to women, Buddha could not be blamed for the steps he took in trying to secure the Sangha from negative public opinion:{{quote|In those days (and this still applies to much of present Indian society) a woman who had left the life of the household would otherwise have been regarded more or less as a harlot and subjected to the appropriate harassment. By being formally associated with the monks, the nuns were able to enjoy the benefits of leaving the household life without incurring immediate harm. Whilst it is one thing to abhor, as any civilized person must do, the attitudes and behavior towards women which underlie the necessity for such protection, it is surely misplaced to criticize the Buddha and his community for adopting this particular policy.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;}}

== Becoming a Bhikkhuni ==
[[File:Chankhong.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Chân Không]], bhikkhuni in the [[Order of Interbeing]]]]
The progression to ordination as a bhikkhuni is taken in four steps. A layperson takes the [[Five Precepts]]. The next step is to enter the [[pabbajja]] (Sanskrit: ''pravrajya'') or monastic way of life, which includes wearing the monastic's robes. After that, one can become a [[śrāmaṇerī]] or "novitiate". The last and final step is to take the full vows of a bhikkhuni.

===The Fourteen Precepts of the Order of Interbeing===
The [[Order of Interbeing]], established in 1964 and associated with the [[Plum Village]] movement, has fourteen precepts observed by all monastics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051224155236/http://www.mindfulnessbell.org/order_interbeing.htm Order of Interbeing Beginnings (Sister Chân Không, Excerpt form ''Learning True Love'')]&lt;/ref&gt; They were written by [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]. In an interview, [[Chân Không]] described his approach:
{{quote|In Plum Village, the Eight Observations of Respect that nuns have to observe towards Buddhist monks are not observed, as Nhat Hanh claims they were invented only to help the stepmother of the Buddha, and that one need only keep Nhat Hanh's 14 precepts properly. That's all. But of course he doesn't despise the traditional precepts. And I can accept them just to give joy to the monks who practice in the traditional way. If I can give them joy, I will have a chance to share my insights about women with them, and then they will be unblocked in their understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/dailylife/khong.html |title=Walking in the Direction of Beauty--An Interview with Sister Chan Khong  |author=Alan Senauke |author2=Susan Moon  | journal =The Turning Wheel | volume = | issue =Winter 1994 | pages = |accessdate=2010-11-30 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Gelongma ==
A '''gelongma''' ({{bo|w=dge slong ma}}) is the [[Standard Tibetan]] term for a bhikṣuṇī, a monastic who observes the full set of vows outlined in the [[vinaya]]. While the exact number of vows observed varies from one ordination lineage to another, generally the female monastic observes 360 vows while the male monastic observes 265.  

A ''getsulma'' ({{bo|w=dge tshul ma}}) is a [[samanera|śrāmaṇerikā]] or novice, a preparation monastic level prior to full vows. Novices, both male and female, adhere to twenty-five main vows. A layperson or child monk too young to take the full vows may take the Five Vows called "approaching virtue" ({{bo|w=dge snyan|s=genyen}}). These five vows can be practiced as a monastic, where the genyen maintains celibacy, or as a lay practitioner, where the married genyen maintains fidelity.

Starting with the novice ordination, some may choose to take forty years to gradually arrive at the vows of a fully ordained monastic.&lt;ref name="TGCLTrust-GeshePalTsering"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Venerable Geshe Pal Tsering |publisher=''Trashi Ganden Choepel Ling Trust'' |date= |url=http://www.trashiganden.com/geshe_pal_tseriing.htm |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103194231/http://www.trashiganden.com/geshe_pal_tseriing.htm |archivedate=November 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsering-Lifestory"&gt;For example, the life story of Ven. Geshe Palden Tsering, born in 1934 in Zakok. He took the novice ordination at the age of eight (1942?); in 1973 he took the bhikkshu vows of a fully ordained monk.&lt;/ref&gt; Others take the getsulma and gelongma vows on the same day and practice as a gelongma from the beginning, as the getsulma vows are included within the gelongma.

The tradition flourished for centuries throughout South and East Asia, but appears to have lapsed in the [[Theravada]] tradition of Sri Lanka in the 11th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Kawanami, Hiroko (2007). ''The Bhikkhunī Ordination Debate: Global Aspirations, Local Concerns, with special emphasis on the views of the monastic community in Burma'', Buddhist Studies Review 24 (2), 229&lt;/ref&gt; It survived in Burma to about the 13th century, but died out there too.&lt;ref&gt;id, page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is commonly said to have never been introduced to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia or Tibet, there is substantial historical evidence to the contrary, especially in Thailand.

However, the [[Mahayana]] tradition in China, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan and Hong Kong has retained the practice, where female monastics are full bhikṣuṇīs.

==In Theravada Buddhism==
{{peoplepalicanon}}
The traditional appearance of Theravada bhikkhunis is nearly identical to that of male monks, including a shaved head, shaved eyebrows and saffron robes. In some countries, nuns wear dark chocolate robes or sometimes the same colour as monks. In the Theravada tradition, some scholars believe that the bhikkhuni lineage became extinct in the 11th to 13th centuries and that no new bhikkhunis could be ordained since there were no bhikkhunis left to give ordination. For this reason, the leadership of the Theravada bhikkhu Sangha in Burma and Thailand deem fully ordained bhikkhunis as impossible. "Equal rights for men and women are denied by the Ecclesiastical Council. No woman can be ordained as a Theravada Buddhist nun or bhikkhuni in Thailand. The Council has issued a national warning that any monk who ordains female monks will be punished."&lt;ref&gt;Metthanando Bhikku (June 7, 2005). 
[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1295,0,0,1,0; ''Authoritarianism of the holy kind''], buddhistchannel.tv&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the spread of the bhikkhuni lineage to countries like China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Japan and Sri Lanka, other scholars support ordination of Theravada bhikkhunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theravadabuddhism.org|title=Theravada|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without ordination available to them, women traditionally voluntarily take limited vows to live as renunciants. These women attempt to lead a life following the teachings of the Buddha. They observe 8&amp;ndash;10 precepts, but do not follow exactly the same codes as bhikkhunis. They receive popular recognition for their role. But they are not granted official endorsement or the educational support offered to monks. Some cook while others practise and teach meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thaiforesttradition.blogspot.de/2009/09/story-of-mae-chee-kaew-female-nun-and.html|title=Thai Forest Tradition|author=Thai Forest Tradition|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wanderingdhamma.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/book-review-mae-chee-kaew-her-journey-to-spiritual-awakening-enlightenment/|title=Book Review: Mae Chee Kaew: Her Journey to Spiritual Awakening &amp; Enlightenment|work=Wandering Dhamma|accessdate=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220085432/http://wanderingdhamma.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/book-review-mae-chee-kaew-her-journey-to-spiritual-awakening-enlightenment/|archivedate=20 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meditationthailand.com/maechee_index.htm|title=MC Brigitte Schrottenbacher - Meditationteacher Thailand|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306083634/http://www.meditationthailand.com/maechee_index.htm|archive-date=6 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpiw.org/MaeCheeSansanee.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816062113/http://www.gpiw.org/MaeCheeSansanee.html |archivedate=16 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimokkha.com/Wat%20Pa%20Namtok%20Khemmako%20gm.htm|title=Wat Pa Namtok Khemmako|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watkowtahm.org/data/mcahmon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424124046/http://www.watkowtahm.org/data/mcahmon.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White or pink robes are worn by Theravada women renunciants who are not fully ordained. These women are known as [[dasa sil mata]] in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]], [[thilashin]] in [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhism]], [[Maechi]] in [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]], ''guruma'' in [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] and [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]] and [[siladhara]]s at [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] in [[England]].

To help establish the Bhikshuni Sangha (community of fully ordained nuns) where it does not currently exist has also been declared one of the objectives of Sakyadhita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakyadhita.org/index.html|title=Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as expressed at its founding meeting in 1987 in Bodhgaya, India.

In Part Four of Alexander Berzin's Summary Report: Day Three and Final Comments by His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama it is said: "But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34|title=A Summary Report of the 2007 International Congress on the Women's Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Eight Garudhammas]] belong to the context of the [[Vinaya]]. [[Bhikkhuni Kusuma]] writes: "In the Pali, the eight garudhammas appear in the tenth [[khandhaka]] of the [[Cullavagga]]." However, they are to be found in the actual ordination process for Bhikkhunis.

The text is not allowed to be studied before ordination. "The traditional custom is that one is only allowed to study the bhikshu or bhikshuni vows after having taken them", [[Karma Lekshe Tsomo]] stated during congress
while talking about Gender Equality and Human Rights: "It would be helpful if Tibetan nuns could study the bhikshuni vows before the ordination is established. The traditional custom is that one is only allowed to study the bhikshu or bhikshuni vows after having taken them.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_2.html#n55a8d4d77867dbdc7|title=A Summary Report of the 2007 International Congress on the Women's Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ven. [[Tenzin Palmo]] is quoted with saying: "To raise the status of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nuns, it is important not only to re-establish the Mulasarvastivada bhikshuni ordination, but also for the new bhikshunis to ignore the eight gurudharmas that have regulated their lower status. These eight, after all, were formulated for the sole purpose of avoiding censure by the lay society. In the modern world, disallowing the re-establishment of the Mulasarvastivada bhikshuni ordination and honoring these eight risk that very censure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_3.html#nadb9fb1ad3e19e3015|title=A Summary Report of the 2007 International Congress on the Women's Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Summary Report as well as according to the other texts available from the congress there has not been a discussion on how and which of the eight gurudharmas discriminate against Buddhist nuns and how this can be changed in detail in the process of re-establishing the [[Mulasarvastivada]] bhikshuni ordination.

In [[Burma]], the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. In 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in [[Sri Lanka]], thus becoming the first female Burmese novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/saccavadis-story/|title=Saccavadi’s story|work=Sujato’s Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/awake-world/story-one-burmese-nun|title=The Story of One Burmese Nun - Tricycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], the first [[Theravada]] ordination of bhikkhunis in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung.&lt;ref name="bhikkhuni1"&gt;http://www.bhikkhuni.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FirstTheravadaordinationofbhikkhunisinIndonesiaAfteraThousandYears.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.&lt;ref name="bhikkhuni1"/&gt;

There have been some attempts in recent years to revive the tradition of women in the sangha within Theravada Buddhism in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]], with many women ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Studies Review'', volume 24.2, page 227&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition;&lt;ref&gt;id, page 227&lt;/ref&gt; others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone.&lt;ref name="id, page 228"&gt;id, page 228&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="id, page 228" /&gt;

In Thailand, in 1928, the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]], responding to the attempted ordination of two women, issued an edict that monks must not ordain women as samaneris (novices), sikkhamanas (probationers) or bhikkhunis. The two women were reportedly arrested and jailed briefly. A 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman to receive the going-forth ceremony of a Theravada novice (and the gold robe) in Thailand, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommer, PhD|first=Jeanne Matthew|title=Socially Engaged Buddhism in Thailand: Ordination of Thai Women Monks|url=http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/thailand/ordination.shtml|publisher=Warren Wilson College|accessdate=6 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105319/http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/thailand/ordination.shtml|archivedate=4 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]], previously a professor of Buddhist philosophy known as Dr [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni|Chatsumarn Kabilsingh]], was controversially ordained as first a novice and then a bhikkhuni in [[Sri Lanka]] in 2003 upon the revival of the full ordination of women there. Since then, the Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. More than 20 further Thai women have followed in Dhammananda Bhikkhuni's footsteps, with temples, monasteries and meditations centers led by Thai bhikkhunis emerging in Samut Sakhon, Chiang Mai and Rayong. The stance of the Thai Sangha hierarchy has largely changed from one of denial of the existence of bhikkhunis to one of acceptance of bhikkhunis as of foreign (non-Thai) traditions. However Thailand's two main Theravada Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks. Despite substantial and growing support inside the religious hierarchy, sometimes fierce opposition to the ordination of women within the [[Sangha (Buddhism)#Women's role in the Sangha|sangha]] remains.

In 2010, [[Ayya Tathaaloka]] and [[Bhante Henepola Gunaratana]] oversaw a dual ordination ceremony at Aranya Bodhi forest refuge in [[Sonoma County, California]] where four women became fully ordained nuns in the Theravada tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Step Forward|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/another-step-forward/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about lineage and legitimacy===
The only women's ordination lineage that remains is the [[Dharmaguptaka]] one, which is in use in [[East Asian Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anālayo|first=|date=2017|title=The Validity of bhikkhunī Ordination by bhikkhus Only|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/validity.pdf|journal=JOCBS|volume=12|pages=9-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuns from this tradition have assisted in the ordination of nuns in other lineages (e.g. [[Theravada]]), where the presence of nuns is a prerequisite for new nuns to be ordained.

This is problematic from a legalist point of view, as a woman from one Buddhist tradition ordained by nuns in another invalidates the notion of lineage. Inauthentic nuns cannot legitimately go on to ordain other women in their own traditions and thus it is impossible to validly re-establish bhikkhuni ordination in lineages where it has ended.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;

====Defense against criticism====

However, the German monk [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], who was a presenter at the [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Abstract: The Four Assemblies and the Foundation of the Order of Nuns|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=45|publisher=Foundation for Buddhist Studies, University of Hamburg|ref=harv}};{{Citation | chapter = Women's Renunciation in Early Buddhism - The Four Assemblies and the Foundation of the Order of Nuns | title = Dignity &amp; Discipline, The Evolving Role of Women in Buddhism | publisher = [[Wisdom Publications]] | year = 2010 | pages = 65–97|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;, has argued that it is possible for bhikkhus alone to ordain bhikkhunis if necessary.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Analayo|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=On the Bhikkhunã Ordination Controversy|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/bhikkhuni-controversy.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Analayo|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=The Revival of the Bhikkhunī Order and the Decline of the Sāsana|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/revival-bhikkhuni.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By exploring attitudes towards bhikkhunis in early Buddhist texts and the story of the foundation of the bhikkhuni order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/analayo/#bhikkhuni|title=about: core faculty &amp; members|publisher=Āgama research group}}&lt;/ref&gt; he advocates for the continuing validity of "single ordination" (i.e. by monks only)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anālayo|first=|date=2017|title=The Validity of bhikkhunī Ordination by bhikkhus Only|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/validity.pdf|journal=JOCBS|volume=12|pages=9-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is a matter of controversy in the Theravada and Tibetan traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Anālayo's research on women, nuns and bhikkhunīs: http://agamaresearch.ddbc.edu.tw/?page_id=138 bhikkhunīs and women in Early Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;

=== America ===
{{See also|Buddhism in the United States}}
In 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Massachusetts Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118041705/http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Massachusetts |date=18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun. Ven. Gotami received full ordination in 2000, at which time her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni ''vihara''. ''"Vihara"'' translates as monastery or nunnery, and may be both dwelling and community center where one or more bhikkhus or bhikkhunis offer teachings on Buddhist scriptures, conduct traditional ceremonies, teach meditation, offer counseling and other community services, receive alms, and reside.  In 2003 Ven. Sudhamma Bhikkhuni took the role of resident female-monk at the Carolina Buddhist Vihara&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolinabuddhist.net Carolina Buddhist Vihara]&lt;/ref&gt; in Greenville, SC (founded by Sri Lankan monks in 2000); her new dwelling thus became the second such community-oriented bhikkhuni ''vihara'' in the eastern United States. The first such women's monastic residence in the western United States, Dhammadharini Vihara (now the Dhammadharini Monastery in Penngrove, CA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhammadharini.org/|title=Dhammadharini|website=www.dhammadharini.org|access-date=2016-06-26}})&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Fremont, CA, by Ven. Tathaaloka of the USA, in 2005. Soon afterwards, Samadhi Meditation Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sbmc-florida.org/ |title=Samadhi Meditation Center |access-date=21 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924105328/http://www.sbmc-florida.org/ |archive-date=24 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Pinellas Park, Florida, was founded by Ven. Sudarshana Bhikkhuni of Sri Lanka.

Sravasti Abbey, the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery for Western nuns and monks in the U.S., was established in Washington State by [[Bhikshuni]] [[Thubten Chodron]] in 2003.  The Abbey practices in the [[Dharmaguptaka]] [[Vinaya]]. It is situated on 300 acres forest and meadows, 11 miles (18&amp;nbsp;km) outside of [[Newport, Washington]], near the Idaho state line. It is open to visitors who want to learn about community life in a Tibetan Buddhist monastic setting. The name [[Sravasti Abbey]] was chosen by [[His Holiness the Dalai Lama]]. Bhikshuni [[Thubten Chodron]] had suggested the name, as Sravasti was the place in India where comes from the fact that, the [[Buddha]] spent 25 [[Rains Retreat|rains retreats (]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;varsa in Sanskrit and yarne in Tibetan), and communities of both nuns and monks had resided there. This seemed auspicious to ensure the Buddha’s teachings would be abundantly available to both male and female monastics at the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/dalai-lama-endorsement/|title=Dalai Lama Endorsement - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|work=Sravasti Abbey|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sravasti Abbey]] is notable because it is home to a growing group of fully ordained bhikshuni (Buddhist nuns) practicing in the Tibetan tradition. This is special because the tradition of full ordination for women was not transmitted from India to Tibet. Ordained women practicing in the Tibetan tradition usually hold an ordination that is, in effect, a novice ordination. Venerable [[Thubten Chodron]], while faithfully following the teachings of her Tibetan teachers, has arranged for her students to seek full ordination as bhikshunis in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/discover-monastic-life/training/|title=Abbey Training - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|work=Sravasti Abbey|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Abbey, which then had seven bhikshunis and three novices, formally began its first winter [[Vassa|varsa]] (three-month monastic retreat), which lasted until April 13, 2014. As far as the Abbey knows, this was the first time a Western bhikshuni sangha practicing in the Tibetan tradition had done this ritual in the United States and in English. On April 19, 2014 the Abbey held its first [[kathina]] ceremony to mark the end of the varsa. Also in 2014 the Abbey held its first [[Pavarana]] rite at the end of the varsa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sravasti Abbey"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/discover-monastic-life/living-in-vinaya/|title=Living in Vinaya - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|work=Sravasti Abbey|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 the Annual Western Buddhist Monastic Gathering was held at the Abbey for the first time; it was the 21st such gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/joys-challenges-focus-21st-western-buddhist-monastic-gathering/|title="Joys and Challenges" Are the Focus for 21st Western Buddhist Monastic Gathering - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|date=2015-12-04|work=Sravasti Abbey|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently established Theravada bhikkhuni viharas include: Mahapajapati Monastery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahapajapati.com/ Mahapajapati Monastery]&lt;/ref&gt; where several nuns (bhikkhunis and novices) live together in the desert of southern California near Joshua Tree, founded by Ven. Gunasari Bhikkhuni of Burma in 2008; Aranya Bodhi Hermitage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aranyabodhi.org/ Aranya Bodhi Hermitage]&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Ven. Tathaaloka Bhikkhuni in the forest near Jenner, CA, with Ven. Sobhana Bhikkhuni as Prioress, which opened officially in July 2010, where several bhikkhunis reside together along with trainees and lay supporters; and Sati Saraniya&lt;ref&gt;[http://satisaraniya.ca/ Sati Saraniya]&lt;/ref&gt; in Ontario, founded by Ven. Medhanandi in appx 2009, where two bhikkhunis reside. (There are also quiet residences of individual bhikkhunis where they may receive visitors and give teachings, such as the residence of Ven. Amma Thanasanti Bhikkhuni&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmaseed.org/teacher/12/ Ven. Thanasanti Bhikkhuni]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009-2010 in Colorado Springs; and the Los Angeles residence of Ven. Susila Bhikkhuni; and the residence of Ven. Wimala Bhikkhuni in the mid-west.)

In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in North America was established in Vermont,&lt;ref name="vajra"&gt;[http://www.vajradakininunnery.org/ Vajra Dakini Nunnery]&lt;/ref&gt; called Vajra Dakini Nunnery, offering novice ordination.&lt;ref name="vajra"/&gt; The abbot of this nunnery is an American woman named Khenmo Drolma who is the first "bhikkhunni," a fully ordained Buddhist nun, in the [[Drikung Kagyu]] tradition of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002.&lt;ref name="vajra"/&gt; She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as a Buddhist abbot, having been installed as abbot of Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"&gt;[http://www.vajradakininunnery.org/firstsforwomen.html Women Making History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092702/http://www.vajradakininunnery.org/firstsforwomen.html |date=1 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, in Northern California, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai [[Theravada]] tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. [[Bhante Gunaratana]] and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Boorstein"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sylvia-boorstein/ordination-of-bhikkhunis-_b_702921.html#s133846 | work=Huffington Post | first=Sylvia | last=Boorstein |authorlink=Sylvia Boorstein | title=Ordination of Bhikkhunis in the Theravada Tradition | date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, more bhikkhuni ordinations were completed in Southern California, led by [[Walpola Piyananda]] and other monks and nuns. The bhikkhunis ordained in Southern California were Lakshapathiye Samadhi (born in Sri Lanka), Cariyapanna, Susila, Sammasati (all three born in Vietnam), and Uttamanyana (born in Myanmar).&lt;ref name="atribune"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Stephen Long |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/10/13/bhikkhuni-ordination-los-angeles |title=Bhikkhuni Ordination in Los Angeles |publisher=Asiantribune.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter laws protecting freedom of religion. More than 20 further Thai women have followed in Dhammananda Bhikkhuni's footsteps, with temples, monasteries and meditations centers led by Thai bhikkhunis emerging in Samut Sakhon, Chiang Mai and Rayong. the Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law passed in 1928 banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. The stance of the Thai Sangha hierarchy has largely changed from one of denial of the existence of bhikkhunis to one of acceptance of bhikkhunis as of foreign (non-Thai) traditions. However Thailand's two main Theravada Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks. Despite substantial and growing support inside the religious hierarchy, sometimes fierce opposition to the ordination of women within the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] remains.

=== Tibetan tradition ===

[[File:Spiti 3-7-04 (80).jpg|thumb|Head shaving before a Tibetan Buddhist nun's ordination. [[Spiti]], India 2004]]
When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of twelve fully ordained nuns required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet. There are singular accounts of fully ordained Tibetan women, such as the [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]] (1422-1455), who was once ranked the highest female master in Tibet, but very little is known about the exact circumstances of their ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Michaela. "Dakini Power: Twelve Extraordinary Women Shaping the Transmission of Tibetan Buddhism in the West." Shambhala Publications, 2013. {{ISBN|1559394072}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.

According to [[Thubten Chodron]], the current [[Dalai Lama]] has said on this issue:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=30 A New Possibility: Introducing Full Ordination for Women into the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;

#In 2005, the Dalai Lama repeatedly spoke about the bhikshuni ordination in public gatherings. In Dharamsala, he encouraged, "We need to bring this to a conclusion. We Tibetans alone can't decide this. Rather, it should be decided in collaboration with Buddhists from all over the world. Speaking in general terms, were the Buddha to come to this 21st century world, I feel that most likely, seeing the actual situation in the world now, he might change the rules somewhat...."
#Later, in Zurich during a 2005 conference of Tibetan Buddhist Centers, His Holiness said, "Now I think the time has come; we should start a working group or committee" to meet with monks from other Buddhist traditions. Looking at the German bhikshuni, Ven. [[Jampa Tsedroen]], he instructed, "I prefer that Western Buddhist nuns carry out this work…Go to different places for further research and discuss with senior monks (from various Buddhist countries). I think, first, senior bhikshunis need to correct the monks' way of thinking.
#"This is the 21st century. Everywhere we are talking about equality….Basically Buddhism needs equality. There are some really minor things to remember as a Buddhist--a bhikshu always goes first, then a bhikshuni….The key thing is the restoration of the bhikshuni vow."

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] referred to the Dalai Lama having said on occasion of the 2007 Hamburg congress
{{quote|Sometimes in religion there has been an emphasis on male importance. In Buddhism, however, the highest vows, namely the bhikshu and bhikshuni ones, are equal and entail the same rights. This is the case despite the fact that in some ritual areas, due to social custom, bhikshus go first. But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya.&lt;ref name="studybuddhism.com"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]], the [[Karmapa controversy|17th Karmapa]], has announced plan to restore nuns’ ordination.&lt;ref name="karmapa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karmapa announces plan to restore nuns’ ordination|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/karmapa-announces-plan-restore-nuns-ordination/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|No matter how others see it, I feel this is something necessary. In order to uphold the Buddhist teachings it is necessary to have the fourfold community (fully ordained monks (gelongs), fully ordained nuns (gelongmas), and both male and female lay precept holders). As the Buddha said, the fourfold community are the four pillars of the Buddhist teachings. This is the reason why I’m taking interest in this.&lt;ref name="karmapa"/&gt;}}The Tibetan community is taking its own steps to figure out how to approach conferring bhikshuni ordination to women ordained under the mulashravastavada vinaya system. Meanwhile, steps have already been taken to cultivate the bhiksuni monastic community in the West. Bhikshuni [[Thubten Chodron]] established [[Sravasti Abbey]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/|title=Home - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|website=Sravasti Abbey|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Tibetan Buddhist training monastery for Western nuns and monks in the United States. Whilst the Abbey primarily practices under the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, it practices in the Chinese [[Dharmaguptaka Vinaya]] lineage. This has allowed the female monastics to take full ordination, travelling to Taiwan to take part in 6-8 week training programmes. In January 2014, the Abbey, which then had seven bhikshunis and three novices, formally began its first winter [[Vassa|varsa]] (three-month monastic retreat), which lasted until April 13, 2014. As far as the Abbey knows, this was the first time a Western bhikshuni sangha practicing in the Tibetan tradition had done this riSrtual in the United States and in English. On April 19, 2014 the Abbey held its first [[kathina]] ceremony to mark the end of the varsa. Also in 2014 the Abbey held its first [[Pavarana]] rite at the end of the varsa.&lt;ref name="Sravasti Abbey"/&gt; The Abbey currently has ten fully ordained bhikshunis and five novices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sravastiabbey.org/who-we-are/monastic-community/|title=Our Community - Sravasti Abbey - A Buddhist Monastery|work=Sravasti Abbey|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discriminating against nuns ==
In March 1993 in Dharmasala, [[Sylvia Wetzel]] spoke in front of the [[Dalai Lama]] and other luminaries to highlight the sexism of Buddhist practices, imagery and teachings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Vicki|last=Mackenzie|title=Cave in the Snow|year=1998|pp=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two senior male monastics vocally supported her, reinforcing her points with their own experiences. [[Ajahn Amaro]], a Theravada bhikkhu of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, said, "Seeing the nuns not receiving the respect given to the monks is very painful. It is like having a spear in your heart".{{sfn|Mackenzie|1998|pp=155-156}} 
{{quote|American Tibetan Buddhist monk Thubten Pende gave his views: "When I translated the texts concerning the ordination ceremony I got such a shock. It said that even the most senior nun had to sit behind the most novice monk because, although her ordination was superior, the basis of that ordination, her body, was inferior. I thought, "There it is." I'd heard about this belief but I'd never found evidence of it. I had to recite this text at the ceremony. I was embarrassed to say it and ashamed of the institution I was representing. I wondered, "Why doesn't she get up and leave?" I would.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1998|pp=155-156}}}}

== Family ==
The former wife of  Buddha—[[Yasodharā]], mother of his son [[Rāhula]], according to legend also became a bhikkhuni and an [[arahant]].

== Poems ==
There is the quite famous [[Therigatha]] collection of poems call ''Verses of the Elder Nuns''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thig/index.html Therigatha Verses of the Elder Nuns]&lt;/ref&gt; and a less known collection called ''Discourses of the Ancient Nuns''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bl143.html Discourses of the Ancient Nuns (Bhikkhuni-samyutta)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been cases of some high-profile celebrities converting to Buddhism such as [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], a famous British actor of [[Nigeria]]n descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/19172-60-seconds-adewale-akinnuoye-agbaje&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the very few monastics of African descent is Ven. Bhante Buddharakkhita from Uganda, founder of the [[The Uganda Buddhist Centre|Uganda Buddhist Centre]].

'''Buddhism''' is the fourth largest [[Religions in Denmark|religion in Denmark]] with approximately 30,000 members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jørn Borup ''Who are these Buddhists and How Many of Them are There?: Theoretical and Methodological Challenges in Counting Immigrant Buddhists: A Danish Case Study'', in Journal of Contemporary Religion 31, 1: 85-100, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, knowledge about Buddhism was brought back from expeditions that explored the Far East but interest was mainly from authors, [[Buddhology|Buddhologists]] and [[philologists]]. In 1921, Dr. [[Christian F. Melbye]] founded the first Buddhist Society in Denmark, but it was later dissolved in 1950 before his death in 1953. In the 1950s, there was a revival in interest towards Buddhism, especially [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. [[Hannah Nydahl|Hannah]] and [[Ole Nydahl]] founded the first [[Karma Kagyu]] Buddhist centers in [[Copenhagen]].The third wave of Buddhism came in the 1980s, when refugees from [[Vietnam]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[China]] came to Denmark. Some Buddhist women, especially those from [[Thailand]], came to Denmark seeking Danish husbands.&lt;ref&gt;The history of Buddhism in Denmark is written by Jørn Borup in ''Dansk Dharma. Buddhisme og buddhister i Danmark'', Højbjerg: Forlaget Univers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Accurate figures for the number of Buddhists in Denmark is not known, as it is illegal to record people's faiths in Denmark. However, according to Jørn Borup (Department of the Study of Religion, Aarhus University), there are approximately 30,000 Buddhists in Denmark today,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of which 80% are Asian [[immigrant]]s. Of these, 9,000 are from [[Vietnam]] and 10,000 are from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Despite Buddhism being a minority religion, the [[Dalai Lama]] is the Danes' preferred religious role model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Elisabeth Schnabel |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/326104:Kirke---tro--Dalai-Lama--Lad-vaere-med-at-konvertere-til-buddhismen |title=Laura Elisabeth Schnabel '&amp;#39;Dalai-Lama: Lad være med at konvertere til buddhismen (Don't convert to Buddhism)'&amp;#39;. Kristeligt Dagblad (danish newspaper) 30-05-2009. '&amp;#39;(In danish)'.' Retrieved 01-06-09 |publisher=Kristeligt-dagblad.dk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
There are 43 Buddhist groups in Denmark, 15 of which have official status as 'recognized congregations'. While the number of members and users of the groups are typically small, the 'convert groups' mainly oriented towards Tibetan and Zen Buddhism outnumber the few Asian Buddhist groups, whose number of 'adherents' nevertheless are much higher &lt;ref&gt;[http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/religion-i-danmark/2015/at-taelle-danske-buddhister/ Jørn Borup: At tælle danske buddhister (in Danish)],.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samtidsreligion.au.dk"&gt;[http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/fileadmin/Samtidsreligion/Religion_i_Danmark/2015_e-aarbog/ReligioniDanmark2015.pdf#page=25,.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
[[Theravada Buddhism]] in Denmark is practised primarily by Thais and Sri Lankans and between 90 and 95% of the 10,000 Danish Thais are Buddhists. Thai [[Buddhist temples]] include the [[Watpa]] in Copenhagen, Wat Thai Denmark Brahmavihara Buddhist [[Monastery]] and the [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya Denmark]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/fileadmin/Samtidsreligion/Religion_i_Danmark/2015_e-aarbog/ReligioniDanmark2015.pdf#page=25.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These Buddhist émigrés seem almost invisible in Denmark, partly because Buddhism is generally not an evangelical religion, and they rarely take part in the larger social debate, partly because they have low unemployment and crime rates and are therefore not particularly newsworthy subjects for the media.&lt;ref name="GrowBuddha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jp.dk/arkiv/?id=318240&amp;eceExpr=Nydahl%22%20/%3E&amp;eceArchive=o |title=Article: '&amp;#39;Buddhism gains adherents in Denmark'&amp;#39; by LAURITS NANSEN, Jyllands-Posten, 2nd Nov 2004 |publisher=Jp.dk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the Vietnamese have attracted such positive views which might be related to their generally positive, cultural integration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/22080661/RELIGION_AND_CULTURAL_INTEGRATION_Vietnamese_Catholics_and_Buddhists_in_Denmark.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although not directly related to Buddhism as a practiced religion, Buddhism's contribution to popular culture, media and marketing should not be underestimated &lt;ref&gt;http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/religion-i-danmark/2015/buddhisme-medier-og-populaerkultur/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vajrayana===
The first Tibetan Buddhist group was founded in Denmark by [[Hannah Nydahl|Hannah]] and [[Ole Nydahl]]. It belongs to the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, one of the major [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] schools. The very first center was opened in Copenhagen in 1972 and relocated in 1975 to its current location. To this day Diamond Way Buddhism has increased to nearly 600 centers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BDD e.V., Wuppertal/Germany |url=http://diamondway-buddhism.org/ |title=DiamondWay-Buddhism.org |publisher=Diamondway-buddhism.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although members of this group has not been growing for the last ten years, it is still the largest [[Vajrayana]] school in Denmark, with 500 Danish affiliates.&lt;ref name="samtidsreligion.au.dk"/&gt;

===Zen===
[[Zen]] is amongst the smallest schools of Buddhism in Denmark. It has five groups (both Soto and Rinzai) and no more than 100 practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Soka Gakkai International===
The [[Soka Gakkai International]] organization was established in Denmark in 1983 and has approximately 800 members in 54 local groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Attempts at unity===
In 1991, the Tibetan-born [[Lakha Lama]] tried to establish a trans-sectarian Buddhist umbrella organization called the [[Buddhist Forum]] and since 1993 it has been a member of the [[European Buddhist Union]] despite having only two hundred paying members. Another Lakha Lama project called ''Phendeling'' has subsequently taken over its role and now includes some non-[[Vajrayana]] Buddhist groups. Two groups, the [[Diamond Way Buddhism]] and [[Sokka Gakkai]], have not been invited to join the umbrella organizations. In the early 1990s, there was a split between Ole Nydahl and the rest of the groups during the [[Karmapa controversy]]. One of two candidates was about to be chosen as the one new [[reincarnation]] of the [[16th Karmapa]]. Ole Nydahl supported [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] whilst [[Urgyen Trinley Dorje]] was supported by most other Buddhist groups and the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Curren, Erik D. (2008)''Buddha's Not Smiling, Uncovering the Corruption at the Heart of Tibetan Buddhism Today'' Alaya Press {{ISBN|0-9772253-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits by the Dalai Lama==
The exiled Tibetan leader, the [[Dalai Lama]] has visited Denmark several times. He first visited in 1973 to help inaugurate the first Karma Kagyu center founded by the Nydahls.&lt;ref&gt;Nydahl, Ole (1992) Riding The Tiger, Twenty Years on the Road - The Risks and Joys of Bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the West, Blue Dolphin Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-931892-67-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came back in 1996 for an official visit, but was not met by the Danish prime minister at that time, [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], who said that he was too busy, which he said again the next time the Dalai Lama visited in 2000. However, he did meet him at the airport just before he left.&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

In 2003, the Dalai Lama returned and was officially welcomed by Rasmussen's successor, [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], with the backing of the entire government, despite protests from China.&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;http://www.information.dk/164021 Article: Louise Wendt Jensen, ''Dalai Lama kommer til Danmark'', Information (Danish Newspaper) 21. august 2008  (''In Danish'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maj"&gt;http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20080812/politik/808120395/ Article: ''Dalai Lama til Danmark i maj 2009'', Berlingske (Danish Newspaper) 12. august 2008 (''In Danish'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cambodian National Sustaining Party''' was created by its president [[Pen Sovan]]. Formed on 21 January 1998, and holding its first party congress on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/khmerchronology/1995.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:21:15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideology==
This political party's ideology is a combination of several ideas. One of its ideologies that's right-wing is supporting and promoting "Nation Religion and King", "constitutional monarchy" and to "protect the constitution of Cambodia". With the other part of its ideology which is left-wing is again promoting/supporting "women's rights in society" and promote equal rights for women like men in both "political" and "social" roles. Another left-wing idea is promoting peoples interests in the present and future. The other part of its ideology is liberalism since the CNSP believes in "peace", "freedom", opposition to "anarchism", "dictatorship" and prevent "starvation and poverty" in Cambodia, and construct a "free and pluralistic democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011201215157/http://www.pensovann.com/platform.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
The CNSP's press secretary explained to a Cambodian newspaper called Phnom Pehn that the CNSP expresses an "appeal" for investigators from the "Human Rights Action Committee" to investigate the deaths of rival candidates like the one called Meas Soy of FUNCINPEC competing against Sam Rainsy and another called Uch Horn who was affected by political violence. This is because the Cambodian National Sustaining Party wanted to protect democracy and safety of political party candidates for a free and fair 2002 February election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011031035417/http://www.pensovann.com/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian culture}}

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

'''Christian music''' is [[music]] that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding [[Christianity|Christian]] life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or with a positive message as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

== Worship services ==
{{Main|Church music}}

[[File:Kirchenchor.gif|thumbnail|left|A church [[choir]] singing]]

Among the most prevalent uses of Christian music are in church worship or other gatherings. Most Christian music involves singing, whether by the whole congregation (assembly), or by a specialized subgroup—such as a soloist, duet, trio, quartet, madrigal, [[choir]], or [[Contemporary worship#Worship band|worship band]]— [[responsory|or both]]. It is frequently accompanied by instruments, but some denominations (such as some [[Exclusive Brethren]], the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Primitive Baptists]] and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)|Free Church of Scotland]]) or congregations still prefer unaccompanied or ''[[a cappella]]'' singing. Some groups, such as the Bruderhof, sing songs both with religious and non-religious meanings and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/bruderhof|title=Bruderhof Communities|website=SoundCloud|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the act of singing is important. One of the earliest forms of worship music in the church was the [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], while not the inventor of chant, was acknowledged as the first person to order such music in the church, hinting the name "Gregorian" chant. The chant reform took place around 590–604 CE (reign of Pope Gregory I) (Kamien, pg. 65–67). The Gregorian chant was known for its very [[monophony|monophonic]] sound. Believing that complexity had a tendency to create [[cacophony]], which ruined the music, Gregory I kept things very simple with the chant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 9th ed. New York, New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumental accompaniment ===
[[File:Ninth Symphony original.png|thumb|A page (leaf 12 [[recto]]) from Beethoven's manuscript. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the West, the majority of Christian denominations use instruments such as an organ, piano, electronic keyboard, guitar, or other accompaniment, and occasionally by a band or orchestra, to accompany the singing. But some churches have historically not used instruments, citing their absence from the New Testament. During the last century or so several of these groups have revised this stance.

The singing of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] is also generally unaccompanied, though in the United States organs are sometimes used as a result of Western influence.

=== Instrumental music ===

Some worship music may be unsung, simply instrumental. During the [[Baroque]] period in Europe, the [[chorale prelude]] (for organ) was widely used, generally composed by using a popular hymn tune thematically, and a wide corpus of other solo organ music began to develop across Europe. Some of the most well-known exponents of such organ compositions include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[François Couperin]], [[César Franck]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]] to name a few. Up to the present time, various composers have written instrumental (often [[organ (music)|organ]]) music as acts of worship, including well known organ repertoire by composers like [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Maurice Duruflé]], and [[Jean Langlais]].

The [[church sonata]] (for orchestra and chamber group) and other sacred instrumental musical forms also developed from the [[Baroque]] period onwards.

== Contemporary Christian music ==
{{Main|Contemporary Christian music}}

From the latter half of the 20th century to the present day in Western Christendom—especially in the United States and in other countries with evangelical churches—various genres of music originally often related to [[pop rock]], have been created under the label of Contemporary Christian Music ("CCM") for home-listening and concert use. It can be divided into several genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. These genres (sometimes referred to as "style") like other forms of music may be distinguished by the techniques, the styles, the context and the themes, or geographical origin. Specific subgenres of CCM may include (but are not limited to): [[Christian country music]], [[Christian pop]], [[Christian rock]], [[Christian metal]], [[Christian hardcore]], [[Christian punk]], [[Christian alternative rock]] and [[Christian hip hop]].

Called Christian pop or gospel in a generalized form, this is a relatively new musical movement and has now evolved into a large number of musical genres by region that comes in a Christian context. This movement appeared as a form of [[evangelization]] for the young but the genre is best known and seen in the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] proselytizing movements, often using rhythms similar to those in secular music.

CCM is not a musical genre like the other genres. When a song is identified as "Christian" it takes into account the lyrics and the songwriters and performers, rather than musical style. Therefore, one can say that CCM is diverse and there are Christian songs that are sung to the rhythm of salsa, reggae, rock, folk, hip-hop or rap, ballads, pop, country, singer-songwriters and even extreme music such as punk or heavy metal.

In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music played a significant role in [[Evangelical]] [[Christian worship]].&lt;ref&gt; Suzel Ana Reily, Jonathan M. Dueck, ''The Oxford Handbook of Music and World Christianities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2016, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Mathew Guest, ''Evangelical Identity and Contemporary Culture: A Congregational Study in Innovation'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of musical styles has developed traditional praise.&lt;ref&gt; George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other languages ===

Similar developments took place in other language, for example the German [[Neues Geistliches Lied]] and [[Korean Contemporary Christian music]].

=== Industry ===
{{Main|Christian music industry}}

Christian music is supported by a segment of the general music industry which evolved as a parallel structure to the same. Beginning in the 1970s and developing out of the [[Jesus movement]], the [[Christian music industry]] subsequently developed into a near-billion dollar enterprise. By the 1990s the genre had eclipsed classical, jazz, and [[new-age music]], and artists began gaining acceptance in the general market.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Christian media}}

Today, Christian music is available through most available media. Christian music is broadcast over the radio, television, or the Internet. Christian Albums and video recordings ([[CD]], [[LP album|LP]], [[music download|digital download]], [[DVD]], etc.) have been increasingly more popular and have continued to increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/27/obituaries.mainsection |title=Obituary: Larry Norman &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2008-02-27|accessdate=2011-09-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Musicals is another growing area, especially with the help of the internet. Church drama groups frequently enjoy performing musical dramas which can be downloaded on-line for free use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Musicals|url=http://www.christianmusicals.co.za|publisher=Gospel Musicals|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music festivals and conferences ===
{{Main|Christian music festival}}

In the US several Christian [[music festivals]] have been organized. They are common in the summertime and draw many different people, specifically those from organized groups such as church [[youth groups]] and campus groups. In addition to music festivals like those that are part of the [[Christian Festival Association]], there are also many Christian [[Academic conference|conferences]] which focus more on speakers, but usually also have musical performances, especially for a [[Worship service]].

The [[Ichthus Music Festival]] started in 1970. Today festivals are held annually around the world, and may draw upwards of 100,000 people.

New Zealand's [[Parachute Music Festival]], the largest Christian music festival in the Southern Hemisphere, began in 1989 and is held annually at Mystery Creek Events Centre outside the city of Hamilton.

England's [[Big Church Day Out Festival]] began in 2009 and has annual attendance of approximately 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Church Day Out|url=http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|publisher=Big Church Day Out|accessdate=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815042528/http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|archive-date=15 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerts ===

Like any musical group or act, many Christian musical artists perform concerts in [[concert halls]], bars &amp; clubs, or outdoor venues, as well as in Church-related venues. Sometimes it may be for pure entertainment, other times with the intention of [[evangelism|witnessing]] (evangelizing by bearing witness of one's faith), and other times may be part [[contemporary worship|worship]] as well.

'''Christianity and domestic violence''' deals with the debate in Christian communities in relation to the recognition and response to [[domestic violence]], which is complicated by a culture of silence and acceptance among abuse victims. There are some Bible verses that abusers use to justify discipline of their wives.

==Abuse within marriage==
{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
[[Christianity|Christian]] groups and authorities generally condemn [[domestic violence]] as inconsistent with the general Christian duty to love others and to the scriptural relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref name=stct&gt;Tracy, Steven. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/february/5.50.html "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' (February 2003). (Accessed January 3, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between husband and wife===

According to the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "Men who abuse often use Ephesians 5:22, taken out of context, to justify their behavior, but the passage (v. 21-33) refers to the mutual submission of husband and wife out of love for Christ. Husbands should love their wives as they love their own body, as Christ loves the Church."&lt;ref name=usccbwi/&gt;

Some Christian theologians, such as the Rev. Marie Fortune and Mary Pellauer, have raised the question of a close connection between patriarchal Christianity and domestic violence and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Child in Christian Thought|editor1-first=Marcia J. | editor1-last = Bunge | editor1-link=Marcia Bunge|pages=462|year=2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4693-9|author=Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore|chapter="Let the Children Come" Revisited: Contemporary Feminist Theologians on Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark Kroeger; Beck, James Beck (ed). (1996). ''Women, Abuse and the Bible.'' Grand Rapids: Baker.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Tracy, author of "Patriarchy and Domestic Violence" writes: "While patriarchy may not be the overarching cause of all abuse, it is an enormously significant factor, because in traditional patriarchy males have a disproportionate share of power... So while patriarchy is not the sole explanation for violence against women, we would expect that male headship would be distorted by insecure, unhealthy men to justify their domination and abuse of women."&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Steven. (2007). Patriarchy and Domestic Violence: Challenging Common Misconceptions. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society.'' 50(3):580-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between religion and domestic violence,&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;Wilcox, William Bradford. ''Soft Patriarchs, New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands''. [[University of Chicago Press]] (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s0cY1rWfxKUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;sig=JEppuMBRuDKRQsIY5ZxLZHroYy8 p181-82]. {{ISBN|0-226-89709-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton, no single factor explanation for wife assault was sufficient to explain the available data.{{refn|"During the late 1970's a number of single factor explanations for male assaultiveness toward women were proffered. These included sociobiology, psychiatric disorders and patriarchy (Dutton, 1988). Dutton argued that no single factor explanation for wife assault sufficiently explained the available data and proposed instead a nested ecological theory examining interactive effects of the broader culture (macrosystem), the subculture (exosystem), the family (microsystem) and individual characteristics (ontogeny)."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A study by Dutton and Browning in the same year found that misogyny is correlated with only a minority of abusive male partners.{{refn|"Only a minority of batterers are misogynistic (Dutton and Browning, 1988), and few are violent to non-intimate women; a much larger group experiences extreme anger about intimacy."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Campbell's study in 1992 found no evidence of greater violence towards women in more patriarchal cultures. Pearson's study in 1997 observed "Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men".{{refn|"‘Patricia Pearson (p. 132) points out: That men have used a patriarchal vocabulary to account for themselves doesn't mean that patriarchy causes their violence, any more than being patriarchs prevents them from being victimized. Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men. To the contrary, some of the highest rates of violence are found in the least orthodox partnerships — dating or cohabiting lovers."|group=nb}}&lt;ref name=Correy&gt;Correy, ‘The Role Of Patriarchy In Domestic Violence’ (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Responding to Domestic Abuse,'' a report issued by the Church of England in 2006, suggests that patriarchy should be replaced rather than reinterpreted: "Following the pattern of Christ means that patterns of domination and submission are being transformed in the mutuality of love, faithful care and sharing of burdens. 'Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ'(Ephesians 5.21). Although strong patriarchal tendencies have persisted in Christianity, the example of Christ carries the seeds of their displacement by a more symmetrical and respectful model of male–female relations."&lt;ref name=ceroda&gt;The Archbishops' Council. [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/domesticabuse.pdf "Responding to Domestic Abuse: Guidelines for those with pastoral responsibilities"]. Church House Publishing (2006), p19. {{ISBN|0-7151-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible===
{{Main|The Bible and violence}}
[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] are often used to justify domestic abuse, such as those that refer to male superiority and female submission. Others counter that the use of violence is a misinterpreted view of the male role.&lt;ref name=stct/&gt;  For instance, [[Eve]] (Genesis 2-3), is seen by some Christians{{Who|date=May 2016}} to be disobedient to patriarchal God and man, and to many a generalized symbol of womanhood that must be submissive and subject to discipline, while others{{Who|date=May 2016}} disagree with this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 92-3. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian domestic discipline===
A subculture known as ''Christian domestic discipline'' (CDD) promotes [[spanking]] of wives by their husbands as a form of punishment. While its advocates rely on Biblical interpretations to support the practice, advocates for victims of domestic violence describe CDD as a form of abuse and controlling behavior. Others describe the practice as a simple [[sexual fetish]] and an outlet for [[sadomasochistic]] desires.&lt;ref name="Zadrozny"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zadrozny, Brandy |date=19 June 2013  |work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/19/spanking-for-jesus-inside-the-unholy-world-of-christian-domestic-discipline.html |title=Spanking for Jesus: Inside the Unholy World of ‘Christian Domestic Discipline’}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christan-conservative radio host [[Bryan Fischer]] said to the ''Huffington Post'' that it was a "horrifying trend{{snd}}bizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian"&lt;ref name="Bennett-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/christian-domestic-discipline-spanking-jesus-marriage_n_3479646 |title=Christian Domestic Discipline Promotes Spanking Wives To Maintain Biblical Marriage |work=Huffpost |date=21 June 2013 |author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to abuse===
There are a variety of responses by Christian leaders to how victims should handle abuse:
* Marjorie Proctor-Smith in "Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook" states that domestic [[physical abuse|physical]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexual]] violence is a [[sin]].  It victimizes family members dependent on a man and violates trust needed for healthy, equitable and cooperative relationships.  She finds that domestic violence is symptom of [[sexism]], a social sin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 428-9. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said in 2002, "As pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States, we state as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home, is never justified."&lt;ref name=usccbwi&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/laity/help.shtml "When I Call for Help: A Pastoral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women"]. [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (November 12, 2002). {{ISBN|1-57455-509-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Church of England's report, ''Responding to Domestic Abuse'' advises that Christian pastors and counselors should not advise victims to make forgiving the perpetrator the top priority "when the welfare and safety of the person being abused are at stake."&lt;ref name=ceroda/&gt;
* Significant numbers of Christian [[pastor]]s ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and  would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday"&gt;Alsdurf, James and Alsdurf, Phyllis, ''Battered into Submission'', Wipf and Stock, 1998, as cited in Tracy, Steven, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=8902 "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', February 2003, accessed January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One mid-1980s survey of 5,700 pastors found that 26 percent of pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and that 71 percent of pastors would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grady, J. Lee [http://www.newmanmag.com/display.php?id=818 "Control Freaks, and the Women Who Love Them"]. ''[[New Man (Christian magazine)|New Man]]'' magazine (Jan/Feb 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to the disparity of responses to abuse is lack of training, many Christian seminaries had not educated future church leaders about how to manage violence against women.  Once pastors began receiving training, and announced their participation in domestic violence educational programs, they immediately began receiving visits from women church members who had been subject to violence.  The first Theological Education and Domestic Violence Conference, sponsored by the Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence, was held in 1985 to identify topics that should be covered in seminaries.  First, church leaders will encounter sexual and domestic violence and they need to know what community resources are available.  Secondly, they need to focus on ending the violence, rather than on keeping families together.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 10. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American religious news-magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' has published articles lamenting U.S. churches for possibly making domestic abuse worse "not in incidence, but in response" due to inadequate understandings. In December 2017, academic [[W. Bradford Wilcox]] wrote for the publication, "Domestic violence is still present in church-going homes... some local churches, clergy, and counselors fail to address abuse head-on for fear of breaking up a marriage." He also argued, "Others steer clear of addressing the topic from the pulpit or in adult education for fear of broaching an uncomfortable subject. This silence around domestic violence has to end."&lt;ref name="Wilcox"&gt;https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/december-web-only/evangelicals-domestic-violence-christian-men-domestic-abuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into incidences of domestic violence==
In the 1970s, when multiple programs were initiated to train church leaders about domestic violence, the response "''But no one ever comes to me with this problem''" often came up to frustrate efforts. Church leaders frequently believed that if no one reached out for assistance within their congregations that there was no problem for them to deal with; however, women often withheld discussing their problems over concern that it would not be handled appropriately.  [[Ordination of women|When women increasingly became pastors]] over the 20th century, many of them found that much of their time became devoted to handling domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women; "crisis intervention" became a vital topic for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 9, 428. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]], research has speculated that local societies with a general [[Culture of violence theory|culture of violence]] and low [[socio-economic status]], which may also be at least nominally religious, are more likely to produce abusive men. The role of working-class [[Scots-Irish American]] culture in areas such as [[Appalachia]] is cited.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

Differing viewpoints between husband and wife may be an aggravating factor in terms of abuse, particularly when women hold beliefs in contrast to more ideologically hardline men.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

[[File:Goya - Caprichos (49).jpg|thumb|''Duendecitos'' by [[Francisco Goya]], 1799]]
A '''duende''' is a creature from Iberian, Latin American, and Filipino folklore. The Spanish term ''duende'' originated as a contraction of the phrase {{lang|es|dueño de casa}} or {{lang|es|duen de casa}}, "possessor of a house", and was originally conceptualized as a mischievous spirit inhabiting a house.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|es|Joan Corominas, 'Breve diccionario etimológico de la lengua castellana', "Duende" (Madrid: Editorial Gredos, 1980).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Duende model.jpg|thumb|Model of a duende]]
===Portuguese===
The word is also used in Portuguese folklore, being used to describe beings of a small stature wearing big hats, whistling a mystical song, while walking in the forest (and rendered in English by "goblins", "pixies", "brownies" and "leprechauns"). Using their talent, they are believed to lure young girls and boys to the forest causing them to lose their way home.

===Latin America===
Conversely, in some Latin American cultures, duendes are believed to be the helpers of people who get lost in the forest so they could find their way home. In the folklore of the Central American country of [[Belize]], particularly amongst the country's African/[[Island Carib]]-descended [[Creole peoples|Creole]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] populations, duendes are thought of as forest spirits called "[[Tata Duende]]" who lack thumbs.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hispanic folklore of Mexico and the American Southwest, duendes are known as gnome-like creatures who live inside the walls of homes, especially in the bedroom walls of young children. They attempt to clip the toenails of unkempt children, often leading to the mistaken removal of entire toes.&lt;ref&gt;See retelling in Garza (2004, pp. 2–11).&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in duendes still exists among the [[Mixtecs]] and [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] of [[Oaxaca]] and it is said that they are most commonly found in the mossy [[cloud forest]]s of the state's mountain ranges.

===Philippines and Mariana Islands===
Some [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] believe in [[Philippine mythical creatures#Duwende|dwende]], which often dwell in rocks and caves, old trees, unvisited and dark parts of houses, or in [[anthill]]s and [[termite mound]]s. Those that live in the last two are termed ''nunò sa punsó'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for “old man of the mound”). They are either categorized as good or evil depending on their color (white or black, respectively), and are often said to play with children (who are more capable than adults of seeing them). Offending a ''nunò sa punsó'' is taboo; people who step on them are believed to be cursed by the angered dwende within.

The [[Chamorro people]] of the [[Marianas Islands]] tell tales of the ''[[Taotao Mona|taotaomo'na]]'', duendes and other spirits. A duende, according to the ''Chamorro-English Dictionary'' by Donald Topping, Pedro Ogo and Bernadita Dungca, is a [[goblin]], [[elf]], [[ghost]] or spook in the form of a [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]], a mischievous spirit which hides or takes small children.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

'''Four of Swords''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card.

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarocchi|tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|978-0-89281-190-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
"The effigy of a knight in the attitude of prayer, at full length upon his tomb." - ''The Pictorial Key to the Tarot'', by A.E. Waite

==Divination usage==
Vigilance, retreat, solitude, hermit's repose, exile, tomb and coffin. The single sword at the knight's side indicates a singularity of purpose and a great focus in life. Reversed: wise administration, circumspection, economy, avarice, precaution, testament.

It is mostly associated with a peaceful, still place. It reflects withdrawal, getting away and shifting the focus inwardly so that recovery and healing can take place.&lt;ref name=learntarot&gt;[http://www.learntarot.com/s4.htm Four Of Swords&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paranormality&gt;[http://www.paranormality.com/tarot_four_of_swords.shtml Tarot Cards - The Four of Swords&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], '''inculturation''' is the adaptation of the way Church teachings are presented to non-[[Christian culture]]s and, in turn, the influence of those cultures on the evolution of these teachings.  This is a term that is generally used by [[Catholics]], the [[World Council of Churches]] and some [[Protestantism|Protestants]], other Protestants prefer to use the term "[[contextual theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9DnwEACAAJ|title=Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission|last=Bosch|first=David J.|publisher=Orbis Books|year=1991|isbn=9780883447192|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=447–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ukPAQAAIAAJ|title=Models of Contextual Theology|last=Bevans|first=Stephen B.|publisher=Orbis Books|year=2002|isbn=9781570754388|edition=rev. and exp.|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=26–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background ==
The coexistence of Christianity and other cultures dates back to the apostolic age.  Before his [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Jesus]] instructed his disciples to spread his teachings to the ends of the earth (Mt 28,18; Mk 16,15) but did not tell them how.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen Kirchengeschichte, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Paul's speech to the Greeks at the Aeropagus of [[Athens]] (Acts 17:22-33) could be considered as the first inculturation attempt.  The speech was not well received by all, according to verse 32:  "Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked".&lt;ref&gt;(ESV)&lt;/ref&gt;   Around the year 50, the apostles convened the first Church council, the [[Council of Jerusalem]], to decide whether to include Gentiles and inculturate Gentile culture.&lt;ref name="McManners37"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'' (2002), p. 37, Chapter 1 The Early Christian Community subsection entitled "Rome", quote: "In Acts 15 scripture recorded the apostles meeting in synod to reach a common policy about the Gentile mission."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McManners371"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'' (2002), pp. 37&amp;ndash;8, Chapter 1 The Early Christian Community subsection entitled "Rome", quote: "The 'synod' or, in Latin, 'council' (the modern distinction making a synod something less than a council was unknown in antiquity) became an indispensable way of keeping a common mind, and helped to keep maverick individuals from centrifugal tendencies. During the third century synodal government became so developed that synods used to meet not merely at times of crisis but on a regular basis every year, normally between Easter and Pentecost."&lt;/ref&gt; The Council confirmed that [[Gentiles]] could be accepted as Christians without first converting to Judaism.

Cultural conflicts continued until Christianity incorporated the [[Greco-Roman]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen,319&lt;/ref&gt; Similar inculturation occurred when the [[Roman Empire]] ceased and the Germanic and Medieval cultures became dominant, a process taking centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 319&lt;/ref&gt; Early practitioners of inculturation in the history of missions include [[St. Patrick]] in Ireland and [[Sts. Cyril and Methodius]] for the [[Slavic peoples]] of Eastern Europe. After the schism of 1054, the [[Catholic Church]] was largely restricted to the Western parts of Europe. Attempts failed to return the sphere of influence to the cultures of the [[Middle East]] with the [[crusades]] and the [[Latin Empire|Latin Empire in Constantinople]] (1204–1261). The [[Protestant Reformation]] generated a division in the Western Church.  However, at the same time, [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discoveries of the Americas, Asia and Africa broadened contact with other cultures and civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inculturation after the discoveries==
After the discoveries of new territories and the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) the movement became more systematic, when the Catholic Church had to ponder how and to evaluate elements of ancient non-[[Christian culture]]s. Notable figures were, among others, [[José de Anchieta]] for the indigenous people of Brazil, [[Thomas Stephens (Jesuit)]] in Goa, [[Roberto de Nobili]] in Southern India, [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] in [[Vietnam]].

===China===
[[File:Ricci_Guangqi_2.jpg|thumb|Matteo Ricci (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'', published in 1607]]
{{main|Chinese Rites controversy}}
The [[Jesuit]]s [[Matteo Ricci]], [[Adam Schall von Bell]] and others had successfully reintroduced Christianity to China. Ricci and Schall were appointed by the [[Chinese Emperor]] in [[Peking]] to be court [[mathematician]]s, court [[astronomer]]s and even [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]]s. The first Catholic Church was built in Peking in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 323&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci had adapted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting, among other things, the cultic veneration of ancestors, which he described as a mere cultural practice. The Holy See disagreed, deeming the veneration an act of worship and hence [[idolatry]],  and forbade any adaptation in the so-called [[Chinese Rites controversy]] in 1692 and 1742. The Chinese emperor felt duped and refused to permit any alteration of the existing Christian practices. The Church experienced missionary setbacks in 1721 when the [[Kangxi Emperor]] outlawed Christian missions.&lt;ref name="McManners328"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'' (1990), p. 328, Chapter 9 The Expansion of Christianity by [[John McManners]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Franzen, "The Vatican policy was the death of the missions in China."&lt;ref name="Franzen 324"&gt;Franzen 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papal teachings==

===Leo XIII===
Pope Leo XIII fostered inter-cultural diversity, leading to the reintegration of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] into the Catholic Church in 1879.  He opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. His 1894 encyclical ''Praeclara gratulationis'' praised the cultural and liturgical diversity of expressions of faith within the Church. In ''[[Orientalum Dignitatis]]'' he repeated the need to preserve and cultivate diversity and declared different cultures to  be a treasure.&lt;ref name="Duffy 241"&gt;Duffy 241&lt;/ref&gt;  He opposed the latinization policies of his own Vatican and decreed a number of measures which preserved the integrity and distinctiveness of other cultural expressions.&lt;ref name="Duffy 241"/&gt;

===Benedict XV and Pius XI===
While [[Pope Pius IX]] and [[Pope Pius X]] tended to be slightly more Latin oriented, [[Benedict XV]] was especially concerned with  the development of missionary activities, which had suffered so much during [[World War I]]. Inculturation meant to him first of all the development of domestic clergy.  On November 20, 1919, he appealed to the Catholics of the world, to support missions and especially the development of local clergy, favouring a de-Europeanization of the Catholic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 382&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] followed suit by promoting local clergy so the local cultures were better recognized.  He held a mission congress in Rome in 1922 and personally consecrated each year bishops from Asia, Africa and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 385&lt;/ref&gt; At his death 240 dioceses and administrations were in the hands of domestic bishops.

===Pius XII===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tardpio12.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Pius XII with his closest co-worker: Monsignore [[Domenico Tardini]] in October 1958'']] --&gt;

In 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]], within weeks of his coronation, radically [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China|reverted the 250-year-old Vatican policy]] and permitted the veneration of dead family members in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Franzen 324"/&gt; 
The December 8, 1939 isuance from  the [[Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] issued at the request of Pius XII stated that  Chinese customs were no longer considered superstitious but rather an honourable way of esteeming one's relatives, and therefore permitted by Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;J Smit, Pope Pius XII, New York 1950 pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; The Church began to flourish again with twenty new arch-dioceses, seventy-nine dioceses and thirty-eight apostolic prefects, but only until 1949, when the Communist revolution took over the country.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 325&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The introduction of the Gospel means inculturation and not the destruction of local cultures. Pius emphasized this because not all seemed to understand this point. He wrote in [[Summi Pontificatus]] that a deeper appreciation of various civilizations and their good qualities is necessary to the preaching of the Gospel of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelii 56&lt;/ref&gt; And in his 1944 speech to the directors of the Pontifical Missionary Society, he said: 
* The herald of the Gospel and messenger of Christ is an apostle. His office does not demand that he transplant European civilization and culture, and no other, to foreign soil, there to take root and propagate itself. His task in dealing with these peoples, who sometimes boast of a very old and highly developed culture of their own, is to teach and form them so that they are ready to accept willingly and in a practical manner the principles of Christian life and morality; principles, I might add, that fit into any culture, provided it be good and sound, and which give that culture greater force in safeguarding human dignity and in gaining human happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelii 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Inculturation was addressed in his encyclicals ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei donum]]'', issued on June 2, 1951 and April 21, 1957, respectively. Pius increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evangelii praecones]]''. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, British Eastern Africa. Finland, Burma and French Africa became independent dioceses in 1955.

=== Paul VI===
In the [[Second Vatican Council]], [[Paul VI]] promulgated the decree ''[[Ad gentes]]'', teaching that inculturation imitates the "economy of [[Incarnation]]".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C. (2009). ''Missionary Pope: The Catholic Church and the Positive Elements of Other Religions in the Magisterium of Paul VI''. IVE Press, New York. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lAmWDAs9hk4C].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Paul II ===
[[John Paul II]] addressed the issue in several encyclicals and public appearances. The term was used again by the encyclical ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'' of John Paul II in 1990.

*"The incarnation of the Gospel in native cultures and also the introduction of these cultures into the life of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;John Paul II, encyclical [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_19850602_slavorum-apostoli_en.html Slavorum Apostoli], June 2, 1985, No. 21: AAS 77 (1985), 802–803; [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1996/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_17011987_address-to-pc-culture_en.html Address to the Pontifical Council for Culture plenary assembly], Jan. 17, 1987, No. 5: AAS 79 (1987), 1204–1205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The intimate transformation of authentic cultural values through their integration in Christianity and the insertion of Christianity in the various human cultures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_07121990_redemptoris-missio_en.html Redemptoris Missio] 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"It is now acknowledged that ''inculturation'' is a theological term which has been defined in ''Redemptoris Missio'' 52 as the on-going dialogue between faith and culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/cultr/documents/rc_pc_cultr_01061996_doc_ii-1996-ple_en.html Ethiopia and Inculturation], Brendan Cogavin C.S.Sp.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benedict XVI===
[[Benedict XVI]], like his predecessor, placed a high regard on the dialogue between cultures and religions. Though he at one point attempted to move from the notion of "inculturation" to "inter-culturality",&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal (2004). ''[[Truth and Tolerance]]: Christian Belief and World Religions''. San Francisco: Ignatius Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSrjXVX8quYC].&lt;/ref&gt; he would later state that the inculturation of the faith is necessary, as long as the specificity and the integrity of the "culture of faith" are not compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Follo, F. (2010). Inculturation and interculturality in John Paul II and Benedict XVI. ''Oasis'', 29/03/2010. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084726/http://www.oasiscenter.eu/ar/node/5610].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
An event cited by some Church historians (such as James Hitchcock, Ph.D.) illustrating the difficulty of inculturation concerns [[Francis Xavier]]'s missionary work in Japan. Xavier asked Anjiro (a convert from Kagoshima) for a Japanese word that would be the equivalent of ''Deus'' (Latin for god). Anjiro offered the word "''Dainichi'', the Cosmic Lord, in the tradition of the Japanese exoteric theism. Xavier rejected Anjiro's ''Dainichi'', after his religious debates with the Shingon Buddhists monks in Yamaguchi in 1551, because of its semantic connections with esoteric Buddhist tenets." The phrase had a "Buddhist connection in the divine name of Dainichi-Mahavairocana" (where ''Mahavairocana'', as the central divinity of the Shingon ''mandala'', has four divine attributes, 'the wisdom of the great mirror, equality, observation, and action' in the ''Mahavairocana-sutra''".) To avoid invoking the god of a competing religion, Xavier retranslated ''Deus'' into a simple phonetic equivalent ''Daiusu''. This turned out to be disastrous due to "its phonetic similarity, ''Daiusu'' was heard as "Great Lie (dai uso)" by the Japanese. European priests attempting to use this word were often pelted on the streets by young Japanese ridiculing them with shouts of "Deos, Deos, Deos."  This choice of words resulted in the view that "The Westerners were the progenitors of the "Great Lie." And the Italian Jesuit Camillo Costanzo gives an account where a Japanese Christian on his deathbed called out ''Tenbo'' (which Costanzo defines as the name of a pagan god) and even when corrected reverts from ''Daiusu''  back to ''Tenbo''. Avoiding Xavier's difficulties Matteo Ricci and Roberto de Nobili did not attempt phonetic simulations but "followed Anjiro's way of [cross-cultural] translation, identifying the Christian God's name with the 'native' Supreme Being's names in the lands of Confucianism and Hinduism."&lt;ref name="Strange"&gt;{{cite book |title=Strange Names of God: The Missionary Translation of the Divine Name and the Chinese Responses to Matteo Ricci's ''Shangti'' in Late Ming China, 1583–1644|author=Sangkeun Kim|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York, NY|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock points out that one must have a deep understanding of both the essential tenets of the faith and a mastery of the culture to successfully engage in inculturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Nature of Modernity|volume=two|publisher=International Catholic University|author=James Hitchcock, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich''' (literally: Israelite Cultus Community Zürich), commonly shortened to ''ICZ'', is a Jewish community organized as an unified parish in the Swiss city of Zürich. Consisting of about 2,500 members, ICZ is the largest [[Jewish community]] in Switzerland. The community provides the [[Synagoge Löwenstrasse]] in [[Zürich-City]], a community center and the largest Jewish library at its seat in [[Zürich-Enge]], and two cemeteries (''Unterer'' and ''Oberer Friesenberg'').

On 2 November 1383 the Jewish citizens of Zürich were allowed by Heinrich, Bishop of Konstanz, on request of the city council of Zürich to renew the Synagogue and the cemetery, under the reserve that exclusively Jews may be buried who resided (namely ''[[Burgrecht]]'') in Zürich.&lt;ref name="staatsarchiv-1383"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suche.staatsarchiv.djiktzh.ch/detail.aspx?ID=347212|title=C I, Nr. 287 Bischof Heinrich von Konstanz erneuert auf Bitten von Bürgermeister und Rat von Zürich den Juden dieser Stadt die bischö...

The surviving Jewish citizens of the 1349 pogrom, were expelled indefinitely from the city in 1423. Thereafter, the property probably was used from 1455 as an accommodation building, and the Jewish citizens were forbidden to live in the city and in the canton Zürich to 1850, even in the whole area of the today's Switzerland; excluded the two communities in [[Jüdischer Friedhof Endingen|Endingen]] and [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]] in the [[Surb Valley]].&lt;ref name="judaica-löwenstrasse"/&gt; Among others, Jewish citizens from Endingen and Lengnau, 80 Jewish women, children and men in all, were allowed by the authorities to settle in the whole territory of the Canton of Zurich in 1850, and in 1862 only 175 people, including 100 in the [[Zürich district]]. After the repeal of the majoritiy legal restrictions on Jewish citizens, on 29 March 1862 the ''Israelitische Kultusverein'' (literal: Israelite Cultus Society) was founded by 12 members. In 1880 its name was changed in the present ''Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich''.  As early as in August 1877, the community tried to be accepted as a religious community in the canton of Zürich – the request was denied as "''otherwise, other sects might apply for a state contribution.''"&lt;ref name="judaica-löwenstrasse"/&gt; Not as before 2007, the ICZ community got the ''cantonal'' acceptance by introducing the accordingly [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal law]] on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name="ktzh-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zh.ch/internet/de/rechtliche_grundlagen/gesetze/erlass.html?Open&amp;Ordnr=184.1|title=184.1 Gesetz über die anerkannten jüdischen Gemeinden (GjG)|publisher=Kanton Zürich|author=|language=German|date=2009-07-09|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of today, the unified Jewish community of Zürich is the largest Jewish community in Switzerland. [[Sigi Feigel]], [[Mordechai Piron]] and [[Daniel Jositsch]] are among of the most prominent members of the community.&lt;ref name="judaica-löwenstrasse"/&gt;

== Library ==
The library was awarded because of their special content as a Swiss heritage of national importance in 2009.&lt;ref name="icz-biblothek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icz.org/399/bibliothek|publisher=Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich|title=Bibliothek|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there were discussions in early 2014 about the future of this cultural heritage for financial reasons. The library of the largest Jewish community in Switzerland owns more than 50,000 volumes in [[Yiddish]], [[Hebrew]] and German language. Among these there are, in addition to fiction, valuable scientific works,&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20140120"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/zuerich/zukunft-der-geschichtstraechtigen-bibliothek-ist-ungewiss-127583056|title=Zukunft der geschichtsträchtigen Bibliothek ist ungewiss|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Adrian Portmann|language=German|date=2014-01-20|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judaica]], [[Hebraica]], Hebrew prints from the 16th to 18th century, theological literature ([[Talmudica]]), prayer books and Bibles.&lt;ref name="infoclio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infoclio.ch/de/node/131838|title=Bibliothek der Israelitischen Cultusgemeinde Zürich|publisher=infoclio.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1939, the ''Verein Jüdische Bibliothek Zürich'' (literally: Jewish library Zürich association) handed over its stocks to establish the ICZ library while Jewish libraries in Europe were destroyed by the Nazi regime. After the war, [[Hannah Arendt]], then managing director of the [[Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, Inc.]], handed over parts of the library of the Breslau Rabbinical Seminary in Germany which was suppressed by the Nazis. The oldest books of its collection date back to the 16th century, among them a 1595 print of [[Flavius Josephus]]' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', a testimony early book printing dating back to 1595.&lt;ref name="nzz-75jahre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/zuercher_kultur/juedischer-buecherschatz-1.18457480|title=Bibliothek der Israelitischen Cultusgemeinde Zürich: Jüdischer Bücherschatz|publisher=NZZ|author=Martina Läubli|language=German|date=2015-01-09|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Josephus Antiquitates Iudaice.jpg|thumb|upright|1466 manuscript of the ''Antiquitates Iudaice'']]
On occasion of the 75th anniversary of the ICZ library, the anniversary edition ''Quelle lebender Bücher'' (literally: source of living books) was published, edited by the ICZ-librarians Yvonne Domhardt and Kerstin A. Paul, in which 75 people present their favorite book from the library.&lt;ref name="exlibris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.exlibris.ch/de/buecher-buch/deutschsprachige-buecher/75-jahre-bibliothek-israelitische-cultusgemeinde-zuerich/id/9783905297584|title=75 Jahre Bibliothek Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich|accessdate=2015-12-18|language=German|work=[[Ex Libris (bookshop)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are "Five years in the country Neutralia" by the Ukrainian journalist Shemariah Gorelik, who talks about his stay in Switzerland from 1914 to 1918. Or Johann Caspar Ulrich, who wrote as the first Christian author a veine history of Swiss Jews in the mid-18th-century. The contemporary Swiss writer [[Charles Lewinsky]] was inspired by a 1938 edition of the ''Israelitisches Wochenblatt'': the protagonist ''Felix Grün'' in Lewinsky's family saga ''Melnitz''. Not only because of the complete volumes of the newspaper ''Israelitisches Wochenblatt'', the ICZ is a rich cultural and historical source for [[Judaism in Switzerland]], its library is a central place of the examination of Jewish identity, and ''with yourself'', the literature professor Andreas Kilcher wrote. The importance of the library was also shown on occasion of the debate on its possible division: ''The library is full of hidden comments to ourselves''. When for financial reasons the sponsorship publicly discussed to outsource the scientific inventory in the Zürich central library, by end of 2014 the ''Verein für Jüdische Kultur und Wissenschaft'' (literally: Association for Jewish Culture and Science), however, managed to collect from foundations and private donations the amount of CHF 250,000, and thus ensuring the financing of the library for another three years.&lt;ref name="nzz-75jahre"/&gt;

== Historical archives ==
The ICZ provides the second-largest historical archives in the section Jewish contemporary history, right after the records of the [[Verband Schweizerischer Jüdischer Fürsorgen]] (VSJF), literally the ''Association of Jewish Swiss Welfare Services''. The rich and diverse archives contains both written and audio-visual media, among them photographs of the ICU presidents and collaborators, sound films, interviews e.g. with [[Sigi Feigel]], speeches of [[Shimon Peres]] or [[Willy Brandt]], a 1939 film showing the laying of the foundation stone of the community center allowing ''a deep insight into Jewish life and work'' in Zürich. The social section comprises hundreds of personal files and index cards, next to the protocols of the community meetings and the board meetings. Besides that, the records include numerous external contacts, and the political and cultural commitment of the ICZ which verify the community's regional position, as well as on national and international level. [[Antisemitism]], racism, and the examination of WWII are the most important topics in these documents. The extensiveness and the antiquity of the educational and religious material, compared to other documents, show the importance of these tasks to the Jewish community. The first yearbook of religious education, or certificates illustrating the acquisition of land for the [[Synagoge Löwenstrasse|community's synagogue]] date back to the 1880s. On occasion of the 150th anniversary of the ICZ, in June 2012 the indexing of the historical archives of the ICZ was finished. The institutional record group has a volume of 85 running metres, but due to organisational reasons, documents of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|rabbinate]] as well as of the heads and members of many commissions are still under the care of the ICZ.&lt;ref name="eth-archiv"/&gt;

== School ==
The religious school was attended by 80 children in 1884, in 1894 there were 130 students, and 18 years later 230. Since 1898, the municipality has its own schoolhouse. The poor relief is governed since 1901.

== Community center ==
The community center in Zürich-Enge was modernized in 2010. The social care for the sick and old people, for refugees, and people otherwise in need of help is from its foundation of the main duties of the ICZ.&lt;ref name="eth-archiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afz.ethz.ch/archiving/indexing/israelite-cultus-community-zurich-icz/|title=ETH Zürich Archiv für Zeitgeschichte|publisher=[[ETH Zürich]]|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cemeteries ==

=== Unterer Friesenberg ===
[[File:Friedhof Unterer Friesenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Cemetery hall at Unterer Friesenberg cemetery]]
On 5 July 1865 the Jewish community, which at that time numbered 30 members, mentioned the acquisition of a field for applying a cemetery.&lt;ref name="SIG-friedhöfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissjews.ch/de/metanavigation/juedisches_leben/juedische_institutionen/friedhoefe.php|publisher=Schweizerischer Israelitischer Gemeindebund (SIG)|title=Friedhöfe|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115041419/http://www.swissjews.ch/de/metanavigation/juedisches_leben/juedische_institutionen/friedhoefe.php|archivedate=2015-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-friedhöfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zuerich-reformiert.ch/ter-nedden/content/e12295/e12319/e12401/e12343/e12363/index_ger.html|publisher=[[Evangelisch-reformierte Landeskirche des Kantons Zürich]]|title=Jüdische Friedhöfe|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 1866 it was inaugurated on occasion of the first funeral of a Jewish woman by the Lengnau Rabbi Dr. Meyer Kayserling. In 1892 a cemetery hall was built in the so-called ''Moorish'' style. After several expansions, a large second site was bought in 1916, and today the cemetery area comprises {{convert|0.17354|ha|acre|2}}. Since the installation of the second cemetery in 1952, fewer and fewer burials were done at the very first Jewish cemetery in Zürich since the 14th century. Notable interments include [[Felix Salten]] (1860-1945), [[Joseph Schmidt]] (1904-1942) and [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885-1973).&lt;ref name="judaica-untererfriesenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/zuerich_friedhof_untfries.htm|title=Zürich: Jüdischer Friedhof - Unterer Friesenberg|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obererer Friesenberg ===
The second ICZ cemetery was inaugurated in 1952 and extended in 1988, and it covers an area of {{convert|3.4618|ha|acre|2}}. At the cemetery grounds there is a large cemetery hall with rooms for ablution ([[Bereavement in Judaism|''Tahara'']]). The glass windows of the cemetery hall were designed by the Jewish artist [[Régine Heim-Freudenreich]] (1907-2004). A memorial stone (limestone cube) by [[Susi Guggenheim Weil]] recalls the victims of in the Nazi era. Notable interments include [[Hermann Levin Goldschmidt]] (1914-1998), [[Kurt Hirschfeld]] (1902-1964), [[Mascha Kaléko]] (1907-1975), [[Erwin Leiser]] (1923-1996), [[Albert Pulmann]] (1893-1965), [[Jenny Splatter Schaner]] (1907-1996), [[Margarete Susman]] (1872-1966), [[Lydia Woog]] (1913-2003), and [[Sigi Feigel]] (1921-2004), the former ICZ president.&lt;ref name="judaica-obererfriesenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/zuerich_friedhof_obfries.htm|title=Zürich: Jüdischer Friedhof - Oberer Friesenberg|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 2015 the ICZ has loosened the funeral arrangements for women. Henceforth, women are allowed at the funeral of a relative or friend of the deceased whose grave and can participate in all burial rites. Previously the related women had to wait along with the rest of the female mourners at the wayside and were not admitted to the grave, at least officially. In reality the presence of women at the grave has been tacitly accepted, but initiated by Chana Berlowitz, the municipal assembly decided a valid determination to change this old tradition. The women are therefore allowed not only to the grave of their relatives or fellow dead, they may also participate in the blades or speak the funeral prayer. In addition, the segregation among the mourners at the funeral chapel was abolished.&lt;ref name="kath.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kath.ch/newsd/israelitische-cultusgemeinde-zuerich-laesst-verwandte-frauen-ans-grab/|title=Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich lässt verwandte Frauen ans Grab|publisher=kath.ch|author=|language=German|date=2015-07-07|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security measures ==
The danger for the Jewish community has increased continuously since the 2000s, and since the terrorist attacks on Jewish people in France and Belgium, the risk situation has become even more precarious. According to Swiss security experts, the current investments in security are at best adequate, but compared with France rather modest. Even the French government contributes to the security costs of the French Jewish communities, while the financial burden in Switzerland is supported solely by the Jewish communities. Because there is no state support for the protection of religious minorities in Switzerland, the municipality must pay for it themselves. Considering that, the Jewish community in Zürich urges government support for the rising security costs. Monitoring personnel, video surveillance and bulletproof windows are among the standard safety measures in Zürich. ''The security costs are further increased and almost unsustainable for the Jewish communities'', the Zürich police chief Richard Wolff said in an interview with the [[Tages-Anzeiger]] newspaper. Hence, the Jewish community stands like no other Swiss minorities in the focus of terrorist attacks. Wolff is responding to the demands of Shella Kerész, president of the ICZ, and the city of Zürich should take over half of the safety issues. For years, the Jewish community invested around 800,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) for the protection of their 2,500 community members, and these expenditures would be doubled within two years. In December 2015, a meeting on the situation of the Jewish minority in Switzerland was held in Bern.  The main theme of the meeting: the rising need for security. Police chief Wolff said on occasion of a panel discussion that the responsibility for protecting the Jewish fellow citizens the government has to assume responsibility. Even the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (VBS), established under [[Guy Parmelin]] a working group to draw up measures to protect Jewish institutions. There are discussed different options, among them financial monitoring or police or army protection, considering if the Swiss Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (''Rahmenabkommen zum Schutz nationaler Minderheiten'' 1999) may provide the legal legitimacy. The Canton of Zürich, because it is home to the largest Jewish community with around 6,000 members, could serve as a Swiss national model.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160201"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/zuerich/stadt-zuerich-prueft-sich-an-den-sicherheitskosten-fuer-die-juedische-gemeinde-zu-beteiligen-130032391|title=Stadt Zürich prüft, sich an den Sicherheitskosten für die Jüdische Gemeinde zu beteiligen|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=|language=German|date=2016-02-01|accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tagi-20160201"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Was-sie-eint-ist-ihr-Hass-auf-Juden/story/15837286|title=Was sie eint, ist ihr Hass auf Juden|publisher=[[Tages Anzeiger]]|author=Martin Sturzenegger|language=German|date=2016-02-01|accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is considered as the epitome of the [[Kannada]] women's valor along with [[Abbakka Chowta|Rani Abbakka]], [[Onake Obavva]] and [[Kittur Chennamma]]. Mirjan fort was built by Keladi Chennamma.

Chennamma was known to be a very virtuous and pious woman, and a pragmatic administrator of her times.

The following is a list of all of the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria]] who have led the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and have succeeded the Apostle [[Mark the Evangelist]] in the office of [[Bishop of Alexandria]], who founded the Church in the 1st century, and therefore marked the beginning of [[Christianity in Africa]].

The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] is one of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches (not to be confused with the [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Orthodox]] group of churches) and is presided over by the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria]] who is the body's spiritual leader. This position is held since 2012 by [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|Pope Tawadros II]], [[Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa]] on the [[Holy See of St. Mark]].

The Oriental Orthodox believe that they are the [[Four Marks of the Church|"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic"]] Church of the ancient Christian creeds.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Title "pope"==
Historically, the title "pope" was first adopted by Pope [[Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the 13th Alexandrine [[Metropolitan Archbishop|Archbishop]] (232–249 AD), three centuries before it was assumed by [[Pope John I|John I, the Roman]] Bishop (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The full ecclesiastical title is Papa Abba, and the person who bears it stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the west to Constantinople in the east, to his guidance. Within the denomination, it is the most powerful designation, for all monks in the East to voluntarily follow his spiritual authority, and it is said that it should be assumed that he is a bearer of Christ.

For the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchs of Alexandria]] prior to the schism after the [[Council of Chalcedon]], see [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria]]. For the patriarchs of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Byzantine Orthodox]] church after the [[Schism (religion)|split]] with the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] church, see [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria]].

Note that not all of the dates given are certain. The dates below are according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Some of the dates disagree with those given in Coptic publications such as ''The English Katameros''. In some cases, publications errors caused the difference and have been corrected. In other cases, calendar differences between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and the Gregorian calendars have caused some confusion.

[[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus I]] served as [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] since 444 until he was deposed and exiled by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, but he was still recognized as the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]] until his death in 454.

|&lt;small&gt;The Umayyad Caliph [[Al-Walid I]] did not limit himself to taxing the Copts' finances; he also taxed their patience. He publicly reviled [[Jesus]] and once, during a [[procession]], he even spat in the face of an image of the [[Virgin Mary]]. When the Copts protested to the Caliph about the level of taxation he responded with more seizure of property and higher taxes. Such behavior continued under Al-Walid's successors; [[Yazid II]] not only reinstated all the earlier taxes, he also ordered the destruction of all crosses and sacred images in churches. He also ordered all his subjects to wear a leaden identification badge around their necks, and required that all Copts who wished to engage in business activity have the mark of a lion branded on their hands. Anyone caught without the mark would have his hand cut off.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Atiya, Aziz S.. ''The Coptic Encyclopedia''.

All heeded him except the [[Peshmurians revolt|Bashmurians]] in the northernmost part of the Nile Delta, who refused his advice.

More than 30,000 churches were demolished, including the burning of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]] in Jerusalem.

|&lt;small&gt;During his Patriarchy, there was an attempt from the Catholic Church to take over the Coptic Church. They ordained a monk from Jerusalem to be a Catholic Bishop in Egypt, but he was unable to come to Egypt and stayed in Jerusalem. They also ordained Raphael Al Tokhi as their bishop for Upper Egypt, but he was unable to stay there, so the Pope of Rome called him to Rome to stay there. Pope Mark VII wrote many books about the Coptic Church.

|&lt;small&gt;Pope Cyril VI (also known in Arabic as "the man of prayer") gave a humble, public image for the Coptic church. One of the more recent popes to become involved in politics, Pope Cyril VI had good relations with Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. In the tenth year of his papacy, the holy church celebrates the inauguration of [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral|the new St. Mark Cathedral]] in Dair El-Anba Rowais, which was known also as Dair El-Khandaq. For this occasion and for the return of the relics of St. Mark the Apostle from Rome, after being in the city of Venice in Italy for eleven centuries, a great religious celebration was organized. The celebration was headed by Pope Kyrillos the Sixth and was attended by President Gamal Abdel Naser, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, [[Haile Selassie|Emperor Haile Selassie the First]], Emperor of Ethiopia, and many of the heads of different religions and representatives of churches from all around the world. Among those religious leaders was [[Ignatius Jacob III|Mar Ignatius Yacoub the Third]], the Antiochian Patriarch for the Syrian Orthodox. He is revered very highly today, and continues to perform numerous miracles especially for students in need.&lt;/small&gt;

|&lt;small&gt;First Pope to visit the Patriarchs of Rome and Constantinople since 451 AD. Most notably, Pope Shenouda III's reign also saw the rapid diaspora of Coptic people throughout the whole world for the first time in centuries (including the establishment of hundreds of churches in the United States, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and several other countries.) Pope Shenouda III had the greatest impact on the Coptic Church's canon, modernizing several regulations to fit not only the needs of the Coptic people, but the traditions of the Church as well. He is formally known as "the man of ministry".&lt;/small&gt;

'''Maha Sammata''' ({{lang-pi|Mahā Sammata}}; {{lang-my|မဟာ သမ္မတ}}; also spelled '''Mahasammata'''; lit. "the Great Elect"&lt;ref name=bk-1997-68/&gt;&lt;ref name=twrd-88/&gt;) was the first monarch of the world according to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition. The chronicles of [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhist]] tradition such as ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' and ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' state that he was the founder of the [[Shakya|Sakya dynasty]], to which the historical [[Buddha]] belonged. He was the first of the eleven world monarchs named Maha Sammata, each of whom founded the eleven dynasties that existed from the beginning to the day of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=my-1-46-51&gt;Kala 1724: 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief==
The future king was born "in the beginning of the world" in [[Jambudvipa]], the only habitable continent on earth, to a family descended from the solar race. As no leaders or political orders were in existence, the people elected him to be their king.&lt;ref name=bk-1997-68&gt;Kapferer 1997: 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=my-1-46-48&gt;Kala 1724: 46–48&lt;/ref&gt; He ascended to the throne with the title Maha Sammata ("the Great Elect"),&lt;ref name=twrd-88&gt;Rhys Davids 2006: 88&lt;/ref&gt; and took [[Manikpala]], the sister of [[Vishnu]] as his queen. As king, he constituted the order of the city-state, the various duties and offices defined for the state, and the boundaries of armies of their protection.&lt;ref name=bk-2002-112&gt;Kapferer 2002: 112&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he also established four different human estates (castes): the rulers, ''[[brahmin]]s'', the wealthy and the poor. He also compiled the first ''[[dhammasattha]]'' (law treatise).&lt;ref name=my-1-46-48/&gt;

There are various historical facts, literature, poetry and cultural practices can be found in Sri Lanka related to Maha Sammata dynasty. Maha Sammata Manu was a rice paddy farmer became the king of the land called Oja Dheepa (today Sri Lanka). He was elected through a participatory democratic election conducted among the civilians, and he also had to show his talents with armory, regarding the country's security. The area where his ancient capital was Manu Arama today called Mannar District. His wife's name is Sankapali. Local people in the island today welcome scholars to study about him.

According to the Mahavamsa Tika (subcommentary), Mahasammata was the bodhisatta in a previous life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malalasekera|first1=GP|title=Mahāsammata|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/maha/mahasammata.htm|website=Tipitaka (Drei-Korb), der Pali Kanon  des Theravāda-Buddhismus|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jataka commentary identifies the primeval king Mahamandhata as being the bodhisatta as well, Mahamandhata being the great-great-great-great grandson of Mahasammata. Mahamandhata is given as an example of one who could obtain great sense-pleasure (and even to the glory of the gods) in his lifetime, but still had to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malalasekera|first1=GP|title=Mandhātā|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ma/mandhaataa.htm|website=Tipitaka (Drei-Korb), der Pali Kanon  des Theravāda-Buddhismus|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cetiya Jataka states that the lifespan of Mahasammata was an asankheyya long (literally, "cannot be calculated").

The dynasty he founded was to have a line of 63,000 kings. That dynasty eventually fell because people forgot religion (''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]''). The second dynasty was founded by the founder who took the title Maha Sammata II. That dynasty too eventually fell after another 63,000 kings later. The fall of the second dynasty was followed by the foundation of the third dynasty. The cycle of rising and falling dynasties continued to the day of the historical Buddha, over 2500 years ago. Based on the reporting in the Sinhalese and Burmese chronicles, each of the eleven cycles lasted 800 billion years, meaning the earth is 10 trillion years old.&lt;ref name=db-57&gt;Mahanama 1999: 57 in the footnotes by editor Douglas Bullis&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, there were 334,569 kings (of the 11 dynasties) from Maha Sammata to the time of the historical Buddha.&lt;ref name=yk-81&gt;Maha Thilawuntha 1928: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada tradition, a total of [[List of the twenty-eight Buddhas|28 Buddhas]] have appeared including the historical Buddha. The first 24 Buddhas appeared in the first seven cycles. The last four Buddhas appeared in the most recent four cycles.&lt;ref name=my-1-51&gt;Kala 1724: 51&lt;/ref&gt;

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
The '''Mahameghavahana dynasty''' ({{IAST|Mahā-Mēgha-Vāhana}}, c. 250s BC to 5th century CE{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}) was an ancient ruling dynasty of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] after the decline of the [[Maurya Empire]]. The third ruler of the dynasty, [[Kharavela]] is known by his [[Hathigumpha inscription]].

Kharavela patronised [[Jainism]], but did not discriminate against other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Hampa Nagarajaiah]] |title=A History of the Early Ganga Monarchy and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JuAAAAMAAJ |year=1999 |publisher=Ankita Pustaka |isbn=978-81-87321-16-3 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kailash Chand Jain |title=History of Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hNPAQAAIAAJ |year=2010 |publisher=D.

==Architecture==
[[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]] is the most prominent example of Mahameghavahana dynasty work. These caves were built in 2nd Century BCE during the rule of [[Kharavela|King Kharavela]]. Udayagiri means "Sunrise Hill" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves. The Hathigumpha cave ("Elephant Cave") has the [[Hathigumpha inscription]], written by Raja Kharavela, the king of Kalinga in India, during the 2nd century BCE. The Hathigumpha inscription consists of seventeen lines incised in deep cut Brahmi letters starting with [[Jain]] [[Namokar Mantra]]. In Udayagiri, ''Hathigumpha'' (cave 14) and ''Ganeshagumpha'' (cave 10) are especially well known due to art treasures of their sculptures and reliefs as well as due to their historical importance. ''Rani ka Naur'' (Queen's Palace cave, cave 1) is also an extensively carved cave and elaborately embellished with sculptural friezes. Khandagiri offers a fine view back over Bhubaneswar from its summit. The ''Ananta cave'' (cave 3) depicts carved figures of women, elephants, athletes, and geese carrying flowers.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stern1.JPG|right|frame]] --&gt;
'''Manfred Stern''' (also known as Emilio Kléber, Lazar Stern, Moishe Stern, Mark Zilbert) (1896–1954) was a member of the [[GRU]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military intelligence. He served as a [[spy]] in the [[United States]], as a [[military advisor]] in [[China]], and gained fame under his ''[[nom de guerre]]'' as General Kléber, leader of the [[International Brigade]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

== Early life ==
He was born into a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Bukovina]] (now [[Hlyboka Raion]], [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]), a province of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] on the border between [[Romania]] and Ukraine. He studied medicine at the [[University of Vienna]].

== World War I and the Russian Revolution ==
Drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian army]] at the beginning of [[World War I]], he was captured by the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] army and taken to a [[prisoner of war]] camp in [[Siberia]]. Freed by the [[October Revolution]], he became a [[Bolshevik]] and joined the [[Red Army]]. He led a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] unit in Siberia against the [[White Army]] of [[Admiral Kolchak]] and fought in [[Mongolia (1911–24)|Mongolia]] against the  warlord "bloody" [[Roman Ungern von Sternberg|Baron Ungern von Sternberg]] and his ally, the religious leader [[Bogd Khan]]. In 1921 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the short-lived [[Far Eastern Republic]].

After the Civil War, he returned to Moscow and enrolled in the [[Frunze Military Academy]]. Upon graduation, in 1924, he joined [[Walter Krivitsky]] in the Red Army's Fourth Department (the [[GRU]], or military intelligence). He was assigned to the [[Comintern]] and acted as an instructor in its military schools.

== Espionage career ==
In 1929, Stern became the GRU's chief spy in the [[United States]]. Based in [[New York City]] and operating under the cover name of Mark Zilbert, he managed a network of sources and agents involved in the theft of military secrets. In one operation they stole the plans for a new American tank. Another operation was foiled by a source who went to U.S. Naval Intelligence and continued to deliver faked documents to the Soviets.

The apparatus kept a safe apartment on West 57th Street, owned by [[Paula Levine]], later part of a Soviet spy ring in Paris, and kept a photographic studio on [[Gay Street (Manhattan)|Gay Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]].  There "Charlie," in actuality [[Leon Minster]], GRU operator of a front, the Ellem Radio Equipment Shop, [[microfilm]]ed the stolen documents. German sailors acted as couriers to the GRU in Europe. (These details come from ''Witness'', the 1952 memoir of [[Whittaker Chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Military advisor in China ==
After handing off to [[Alexander Ulanovsky]] in New York, Stern traveled in 1932 to [[Shanghai]] where he served as the [[Comintern]]'s military advisor to the newly created [[Jiangxi Soviet]]. Stern's activities in China remain veiled in mystery. In a report to the Moscow Comintern, he claimed that he tried to forge an alliance between the [[Chinese Red Army]] and a rebel Nationalist army whose officers had seized control of nearby [[Fujian|Fukien]] province. However, this alliance failed and the [[National Revolutionary Army]], under the command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], encircled the Chinese Red Army, forcing them to abandon their base in Jiangxi and to begin the [[Long March]].

Stern returned to Moscow in 1935 and worked briefly for [[Otto Kuusinen]] in the secretariat of the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Executive Committee of the Comintern]] (ECCI).

== "General Kléber" and the Spanish Civil War ==
Stern arrived in [[Spanish Second Republic|Spain]] on a hot day in September 1936, disguised inappropriately as a "furrier." He adopted the name of one of Napoleon's generals, [[Jean-Baptiste Kléber]], and posed as an Austrian-born Canadian citizen.&lt;ref name=Kowalski&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kowalski|first1=Ludwik|title=Hell on Earth: Brutality and Violence Under the Stalinist Regime|date=2008|isbn=9781600472329|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a military advisor to the [[International Brigades]] against [[Franco's]] rebel army.

During the [[Siege of Madrid|Battle of Madrid]] in November 1936, he led the 3,000 member [[XI International Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Jules|title=Madrid: The History|date=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780762814|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when it appeared all was lost —the Republican government of [[Largo Caballero]] had already abandoned the capital— the arrival of Kléber and the International Brigade boosted the morale of Madrid's Republican defenders when the loyalist troops fought from street to street and held the line at [[Casa de Campo]], repulsing the Nationalists. [[Soviet propaganda]] broadcast the 'Victory over [[Fascism]]' throughout the world and —despite [[General Miaja]]'s and General [[Vicente Rojo]]'s crucial role— heralded General Kléber as the "Savior of Madrid". ''[[The New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Herbert Matthews]] interviewed Stern shortly after the battle. "Listening to General Kléber," he wrote, "one gets the impression of great dynamic force. He is a character possibly destined to play a great part in the troubled years which face the world... In thinking about him it is hard not to ponder on the ironical fact that Hitler is not the only native of Austria who is playing a great part in the Spanish Civil War."&lt;ref&gt;Castells Peig, Andreu (1974). Ariel, ed. Las brigadas internacionales de la guerra de España (1ª edición). Barcelona. p. 103. {{ISBN|8434424606}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 he led the newly established [[45th Division (Spain)|45th Division]], but the ineptitude of the unit in combat caused Kléber to be replaced by [[Hans Kahle]] as leader of the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Infantry]] division. Even so, Stern remained in Spain as liaison agent with the Republican Government and still enjoyed military prestige among [[Spanish Communist Party]] members. He left Spain when the International Brigades were withdrawn in October 1938.&lt;ref Name="Engel306"&gt;Carlos Engel, ''Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República,'' 1976; p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recall to Moscow, imprisonment, and death ==
The [[NKVD]] chief in Spain, [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]], knew that Stern's recall meant certain imprisonment and death because in Moscow [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nikolai Yezhov]] were busy [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|purging]] the Red Army. He offered to employ Stern as a member of the NKVD. While awaiting orders, Stern spent his final months in Spain relaxing at a small orange plantation and entertaining his young Spanish mistress. [[Kliment Voroshilov]] denied his transfer and ordered his return to Moscow{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

In May 1939 a [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR|Military Collegium]] condemned Stern to fifteen years of hard labor. He became a non-person. His name was deliberately withheld from official Soviet histories of the Spanish Civil War. The remaining years of his life were spent in the [[Gulag]] and he  died of exhaustion at a labor camp in Sosnovka on February 18, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=R.S.|last2=Scott|first2=Gordon D.|title=Johnny: A Spy's Life|date=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035697|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7277">The archaeological site of [[Delphi]] is an incredible source of information on Greek [[epigraphy]]. The most numerous single category of inscriptions are the '''manumission inscriptions''', which reach roughly a number of 1300.

==Acts of Manumission==
Manumission was called the action of liberation of a slave in antiquity. Slaves belonged to their masters until they served long enough or until they gathered the necessary sum of money for their liberation. When that moment came, the act of manumission had to be guaranteed by a god, most commonly [[Apollo]]. The slave was thus fictitiously sold to the deity, so that the sale action could never be violated. The act was recorded on inscriptions with a rather formulaic expression. 
The majority of the manumission inscriptions of Delphi are gathered in two main spots: on the supporting wall of the parodoi of the theatre and on the polygonal wall, particularly the part which served as back wall to the portico of the Athenians. Most of the inscriptions date between 200 B.C. and 100 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_24.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manumission inscriptions as a source of information==
Despite their stylized expressions, these inscriptions offer an insights into Greek social and demographic history. Over 60% of the manumission inscriptions of Delphi concern female slaves. A comparison of prices proves that most female slaves were manumitted at a price roughly 20% lower than men. However, it seems that liberation in many cases was not complete: slaves are required under a paramone clause to stay with their ex masters for a specific period of time or until the latter passed away. One wonders what kind of freedom this was, but it seems that in some cases this was considered better than nothing, as the master did not have complete rights of life and death over them; furthermore, there were cases in which the slaves had become almost members of the family, so they did not want to be separated from their social environment, yet they would rather have the choice. 
The manumission acts were usually attended by witnesses, whose names are also mentioned on the inscription. The other people mentioned are the priests of the temple of Apollo and thus manumission inscriptions constitute an excellent source for tracing the succession lists of the priesthood of Delphi.

==The formula of a manumission inscription==
A typical manumission inscription is that of the female slave Meda:&lt;ref&gt;Regions (IG VII-IX)  Delphi SGDI II 1708, Phokis — Delphi — 170-157/56 BC&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting to notice that the slave is mentioned in all manumission inscriptions as " σῶμα" (body). Meda appears to be a young girl, who is manumitted at a price of two silver minas, i.e. at the lowest level. Her obligation is to take care of her parents until she becomes an adult; a possible explanation is that the parents paid for her manumission. Both parents appear to be slaves as well. 
A careful examination of the names and place of origin of those who liberated their slaves proves that the "trend" of liberating slaves in Delphi came with the advent of the Aetolians.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, M., 2014,Delphi: A History of the Center of the Ancient World, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of masters were of Aetolian origin at least in the first century. However, the trend soon spread and the next two largest categories are, naturally, Locrians and Phocians, who lived nearby.

{{Fiqh |marital}}

In [[Islam]], [[marriage]] is a legal [[Islamic marriage contract|contract]] between a man and a woman. Both the groom and the bride are to consent to the marriage of their own free wills. A formal, binding contract - verbal or on paper&lt;ref&gt;https://nikah101.com/getting_married.html&lt;/ref&gt; - is considered integral to a religiously valid Islamic marriage, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and bride. There must be two Muslim witnesses of the marriage contract. [[Divorce in Islam]] can take a variety of forms, some executed by a husband personally and some executed by a religious court on behalf of a plaintiff wife who is successful in her legal divorce petition for valid cause.

In addition to the usual marriage until death or divorce, there is a different fixed-term marriage known as [[Nikah mut‘ah|zawāj al-mutʻah]] ("pleasure marriage")&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=1058,ll=2783,ls=38,la=4127,sg=968,ha=718,pr=145,vi=350,mgf=779,mr=647,mn=1306,aan=617,kz=2459,ulq=1576,uqa=389,uqw=1523,umr=1012,ums=848,umj=778,uqq=365,bdw=829,amr=594,asb=911,auh=1501,dhq=525,mht=842,msb=221,tla=92,amj=766,ens=287,mis=2024,br=890] Wehr, Hans .

== Terminology ==
In Islamic law, marriage is called {{lang|ar-Latn|nikah}}, an Arabic word whose original literal meaning is " Wedding ", but which already in the Quran is used exclusively to refer to the contract of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Schacht, J., Layish, A., Shaham, R., Ansari, Ghaus, Otto, J.M., Pompe, S., Knappert, J. and Boyd, Jean |year= 2012 |title=Nikāḥ |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition= 2nd |publisher=Brill |editors=P.

''Muslim women in law and society: annotated translation of al-Tahir al Haddad''. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In the Wehr-Cowan [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]], {{lang|ar-Latn|nikah}} is defined as "marriage; marriage contract; matrimony, wedlock".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hans Wehr |author2=J. Milton Cowan |year=1976 |title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic |publisher=Spoken Language Services |edition= 3rd |page=997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage contract is known by different names: [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|عقد القران}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻaqd al-qirān}}'', "[[wikt:matrimony|matrimony]] contract"; {{lang-ur|نکاح نامہ}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Nikāḥ-nāmah}}''; {{lang-fa|ازدواج}} {{lang|fa-Latn|ezdevāj}} "marriage" and {{lang|fa|سند ازدواج}} or {{lang|fa|عقدنامه}} ({{lang|fa-Latn|sǎnǎde ezdevāj}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|aqd nāmeh}}) for the certificate.

==History==
{{main|Marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia}}

In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] a variety of different marriage practices existed. The most common and recognized types of marriage at this time consisted of: marriage by agreement, marriage by capture, marriage by mahr, marriage by inheritance and "Mot'a" or temporary marriage.&lt;ref name="Shah"&gt;Shah, N. (2006). Women, The Koran and International Human Rights Law. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. pp. 32. {{ISBN|90-04-15237-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic sources, some women in pre-Islamic Arabia had little control over their marriages. They were rarely bound by contract for marriage or custody of children and their consent was rarely sought. Women were seldom allowed to divorce their husbands and their view was not regarded for either a marriage or divorce.&lt;ref name="Esposito 2002 80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John|title=What Everyone Needs To Know About Islam|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Press|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

==Reforms after Islam==
{{See also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

[[Muhammad]] had reformed the laws and procedures of the common marriage practices that existed during his prophethood. The rules of "marriage by agreement (marriage through consent)" was  reformed and a strict set of rules and regulations were put in place. The practices of  "marriage by inheritance" was forbidden. Several chapters and verses from the [[Quran]] were revealed which banned such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/intro_to_marriage.php|title=Islams Women - Introduction to Marriage in Islam|work=islamswomen.com|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Arabian pre-Islamic law, Islamic sources allege that no limitations were set on men's rights to marry or to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Islamic law limited to men to four wives at one time, not including concubines. ({{Quran-usc|4|3}})&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of marriage was refined into one in which the woman was somewhat of an interested partner. 'For example, the [[dowry]], previously regarded as a [[Bride price|bride-price]] paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property'&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract". The essential elements of the marriage contract were now an offer by the man, an acceptance by the woman, and the performance of such conditions as the payment of dowry. The woman's consent, given either actively or by silence, was required. Furthermore, the offer and acceptance had to be made in the presence of at least two witnesses.&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; A married woman had the right to be given food and clothes by her husband, though her husband had more rights over her: "I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food."&lt;ref&gt;[https://sunnah.com/urn/1261680  Sunan Ibn Majah » The Chapters on Marriage ] accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==
Islamic marriages require acceptance, in {{lang-ar|قبول}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qubūl}}'', of the groom, the bride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/80|title=Hadith - The Book of Marriage - Sahih Muslim |chapter=Chapter: Seeking permission of a previously-married woman in words, and of a virgin by silence |work=sunnah.com|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/72|title=Hadith - Book of Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah) - Sahih al-Bukhari |chapter=Chapter: The father or the guardian cannot give a virgin or matron in marriage without her consent |work=sunnah.com|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the consent of the custodian (''[[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|wali]]'') of the bride. The wali of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. The wali can only be a free [[Muslim]], unless the bride is of the Christian or Jewish faith; in such cases the bride should be given away by someone from her religious background.&lt;ref name="Islam, New Edition p. 27"&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Vol. VIII, p. 27, Leiden 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bride is normally present at the signing of the marriage contract.

{{anchor|Wali mujbir}}The ''Wali mujbir'' ({{lang|ar|ولي مجبر}}) is a technical term of Islamic law which denotes the guardian of a bride. In traditional Islam, the literal definition of "wali", which means "custodian" or "protector", is used. In this context, it is meant that the silence of the bride is considered consent. In most schools of [[Islamic law]], only the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride can be wali mujbir.&lt;ref name="Islam, New Edition p. 27"/&gt;

If the conditions are met and a [[mahr]] and contract are agreed upon, an Islamic marriage ceremony, or wedding, can take place. The marital contract is also often signed by the bride. The consent of the bride is mandatory. The Islamic marriage is then declared publicly, in {{lang-ar|إعلان}}, aa'laan, by a responsible person after delivering a sermon to counsel and guide the couple. It is not required, though customary, that the person marrying the couple should be religiously well-founded in knowledge. The bridegroom can deliver the sermon himself in the presence of representatives of both sides if he is religiously educated, as the story goes about Imam Muhammad bin Ali around 829 AD . It is typically followed by a celebratory reception in line with the couple's or local customs, which could either last a couple of hours or precede the wedding and conclude several days after the ceremony.

The Quran tells believers that even if they are poor they should marry to protect themselves from immorality&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], Tadabbur-i Qur’an, vol. 5, 400.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quran-usc|24|33}}. The Quran asserts that marriage is a legitimate way to satisfy one's sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|24|32|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam recognizes the value of sex and companionship and advocates marriage as the foundation for families and channeling the fulfillment of a base need. Marriage is highly valued and regarded as being half of one's faith, according to a saying of [[Muhammad]]. Whether marriage is obligatory or merely allowed has been explored by several scholars, and agreed that "If a person has the means to marry and has no fear of mistreating his wife or of committing the unlawful if he does marry, then marriage in his case is [[mustahabb]] (preferred)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_151_200/same_sex_marriage_and_marriage_i.htm|title=Same Sex Marriage and Marriage in Islam|work=irfi.org|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prerequisites===
{{see also|Mahr}}
The Quran outlines some conditions for a marriage to take place:{{quran-usc|4|24}}
* A marriage should be conducted through a contract and a mandatory sum of wealth provided to the bride, which here refers to the ''[[mahr]]''. Once a ''mahr'' has been ascertained with the realization that it is an obligation of a Muslim husband, the groom is required to pay it to the bride at the time of marriage unless he and his bride can mutually agree to delay the time of some of its payment. In 2003, Rubya Mehdi published an article in which the culture of mahr among Muslims was thoroughly reviewed. There is no concept of [[dowry]]&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Islam by Dr. Muhammed Hamidullah&lt;/ref&gt; as such in Islam. A dowry as such is a payment to the groom from the bride's family, and is not an Islamic custom. Bride prices are also expressly prohibited.
* Another requisite of marriage is chastity. No fornicator has the right to marry a chaste partner except if the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|24|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan Abu Dawood|Abu Da’ud, Sunan]], vol. 2, 227, (nos. [http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/6 2051]-[http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/7 2052])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marriage is permitted for a man with a chaste woman either Muslim or from the [[People of the Book]] (Arabic Ahl al Kitab, [[Jews]], [[Sabians]] and [[Christians]]) but not to polytheists (or "idolaters": Yusuf Ali translation or "idolatresses": Pickthal translation). For women, marriage to [[Jews]], [[Sabians]] and [[Christians]] and to polytheists ([[Idolatry]]) (or "idolaters": Yusufali translation or "disbelievers": Pickthall translation) is prohibited; they are only allowed to marry Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|221|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|60|10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no express prohibition{{according to whom|date=June 2017}}in the Quran or elsewhere about a Muslim woman marrying a [[People of the Book]]. However, the vast majority of Muslim jurists argued that since express permission was given to men, by implication women must be prohibited from doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/oninma.html|title=Fatwa by Dr. Abou El Fadl: On Christian Men marrying Muslim Women|work=Scholar of the House|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of Islamic jurists and imams that do not agree on this interpretation is growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interreligiousdialogue.weebly.com/uploads/7/9/1/5/7915856/when_two_faiths__meet.pdf (PDF) Ethical Principles – Scottish Committee for Interreligious Dialogue]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken consent of the woman is only required if she is not a virgin and her wali is neither her father nor her paternal grandfather. But a virgin may not be married off without her permission. If she is too shy to express her opinion her silence will be considered as implicit agreement [Al Bukhari:6968]. The wali, who can force a bride against her outspoken will into marriage, is called [[wali mujbir]], according to "The Encyclopaedia of Islam". If the woman was forced into a marriage, without the above-mentioned conditions, according to the [[Hanafi]] school of Islamic law the decision can be revoked, when the bride comes of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/90/15|title=Hadith - Book of Tricks - Sahih al-Bukhari|work=sunnah.com|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami' al-sahih, 596, (no. 3476){{full citation needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binti Khudham says that when she became a widow her father solemnized her marriage. She did not like the decision so she went to Muhammad, who gave her permission to revoke her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari|Al-Bukhari]], [http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/74 Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 919, (no. 5138)]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, forced marriages are against Islamic teachings if the woman is a virgin, and those forced into marriages before they have come of age have the right to contest them once they do.&lt;ref name=forced&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/honour-killings-un-islamic-fatwa-declares-in-wake-of-shafia-trial/article2326829/|title=Honour killings 'un-Islamic,' fatwa declares in wake of Shafia trial|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The importance of the [[wali]] is debated between the different schools of thought.  To the [[Hanafi]] [[Sunnis]], a male guardian is not required for the bride to become married, even if it is her first marriage.  Therefore, the marriage contract is signed between the bride and the groom, not the groom and the wali.  To the [[Hanbali]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] Sunni schools, a wali is required in order for a virginal woman to marry.  In these schools, if a woman has been divorced, she becomes her own guardian and does not need a wali to sign a marriage contract.&lt;ref name="Marriage Without Wali"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saifuddin|first1=Ebrahim|title=Marriage without Wali|url=http://www.peopleofsunnah.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=71|website=People of Sunnah|publisher=People of Sunnah|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and obligations of spouses===
&lt;!-- [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam]] redirects here. --&gt;
According to Islam, both men and women have rights over each other when they enter into a marriage contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|228|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the husband serving as protector and supporter of the family most of the time, from his means.{{quran-usc|4|34}} This guardianship has two aspects for both partners:
* The husband is financially responsible for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, it is the duty of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included as part of his financial responsibility.

Several commentators have stated that the superiority of a husband over his wife is relative, and the obedience of the wife is also restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;Amin Ahsan Islahi, ''Tadabbur-i Qur'an'', vol. 2, 291–292&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women are also reminded that in case the husband is not fulfilling his responsibilities, there is no stigma on them in seeking [[khula|divorce]].{{quran-usc|4|128}} The Quran re-emphasizes that justice for the woman includes emotional support, and reminds men that there can be no taking back of the mahr or bridal gifts given to women, unless they are found guilty of sexual immorality {{quran-usc|4|19}}. In unfortunate cases where the agreement was to postpone payment of the mahr, some husbands will bully their wives and insist on the return of what he gave her in order to agree to the dissolution of the marriage, this is un-Islamic and cruel. "Where the husband has been abusive or neglectful of his responsibilities, he does not have the right to take his wife’s property in exchange for her freedom from him. Unfortunately most couples refuse to go to the judge and binding arbitration for these issues even though the Quran says:&lt;blockquote&gt;"And if you fear a breach between them, then appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they (the arbiters) desire reconciliation, Allah will affect it between them. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware." {{quran-usc|4|35}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mahr, dowry and gifts===
{{Main|Mahr}}
''Mahr'' (''donatio propter nuptias''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaldictionary.lawin.org/donatio-propter-nuptias/|title=Donatio Propter Nuptias|work=lawin.org|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) differs from a marriage dowry or gift, in that it is mandatory for a Muslim marriage and is paid by the groom to the bride. The amount of money or possessions of the mahr is paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage for her exclusive use.&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, "Marriage in Classical Islamic Jurisprudence: A Survey of Doctrines", in ''The Islamic Marriage Contract: Case Studies in Islamic Family Law'' 11, 19 (Asifa Quraishi &amp; Frank E. Vogel eds., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The mahr does not have to be money, but it must have monetary value. Therefore "it cannot be love, honesty, being faithful, etc., which are anyway traits of righteous people."&lt;ref name="masjidtucson.org"/&gt; If the marriage contract fails to contain an exact, specified mahr, the husband must still pay the wife a judicially determined sum.&lt;ref&gt;PEARL &amp; MENSKI, supra note 11, ¶ 7–16, at 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahr is mentioned several times in the Quran and Hadith, and there is no maximum limit to the amount the groom may pay as mahr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_6.php|title=Islams Women - Fiqh of Marriage - Dowry|work=islamswomen.com|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at a minimum it is an amount that would be sufficient for the woman to be able to survive independently if her husband dies or they divorce.

With prior mutual agreement, the mahr may also be paid in parts to the bride with an amount given by the groom to the bride at the signing of the marriage contract, also called a ''mu'qadamm'' (in {{lang-ar|مقدم|translation=forepart presented}}), and the later portion postponed to a date during the marriage, also called a ''mu'akhaar'' (in {{lang-ar|مؤخر|translation=delayed}}). Various Romanized transliterations of ''mu'qadamm'' and ''mu'akhaar'' are accepted. Such an agreement does not make the full amount of the mahr any less legally required, nor is the husband's obligation to fulfill the agreement waived or lessened while he fulfills his obligations to reasonably house, feed, or cloth the wife (and any children produced from the union) during the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.gonzaga.edu/academic-program/Files/GJIL/Volume4/Vol4-TheIslamicInstitution.pdf (PDF) The Islamic Institution of Mahr and American Law] by Richard Freeland, Gonzaga University&lt;/ref&gt;

Quran [4:4] "You shall give the women their due dowries, equitably."&lt;ref name="masjidtucson.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/family/marriage/dowry.html|title=Dowry for Marriage in Quran / Submission (Islam)|work=masjidtucson.org|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quran [5:5] "Today, all good food is made lawful for you. The food of the people of the scripture is lawful for you. Also, you may marry the chaste women among the believers, as well as the chaste women among the followers of previous scripture, provided you pay them their due dowries. You shall maintain chastity, not committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers. Anyone who rejects faith, all his work will be in vain, and in the Hereafter he will be with the losers."&lt;ref name="masjidtucson.org"/&gt;

Quran [60:10] "O you who believe, when believing women (abandon the enemy and) ask for asylum with you, you shall test them. GOD is fully aware of their belief. Once you establish that they are believers, you shall not return them to the disbelievers. They are not lawful to remain married to them, nor shall the disbelievers be allowed to marry them. Give back the dowries that the disbelievers have paid. You commit no error by marrying them, so long as you pay them their due dowries. Do not keep disbelieving wives (if they wish to join the enemy). You may ask them for the dowry you had paid, and they may ask for what they paid. This is GOD's rule; He rules among you. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise."&lt;ref name="masjidtucson.org"/&gt;

==Marriage contracts and forced/un-consented marriages==
{{Religious text primary|date=March 2013}}
The [[marriage contract]] is concluded between the ''[[wali]]'', or guardian, of the bride and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and bride {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} . The ''wali'' of the bride can only be a free [[Muslim]]. The ''wali'' of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. If the bride is a [[virgin]], the ''[[wali mujbir]]'', that is her father or paternal grandfather, can not force the bride into the marriage against her proclaimed will; according to most scholars. According to [[Khomeini]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Risalah (fiqh)|Risalah]]-ye Towzihul Masaael-e Imam Khomeini. '''(Persian and Arabic)'''. Title translation: ''Imam Khomeini's Islamic Laws Explanation Book'' .

The notable example to this is the Hanafi school (the largest of the four classical schools of Islamic thought), which holds that a bride's permission is required if she has reached puberty. They also hold that if a bride was forced into marriage before reaching puberty, then upon attaining puberty she has the option to nullify the marriage if she wishes. A ''wali'' other than the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride, then called ''wali mukhtar'', needs the consent of the bride according to the majority of scholars. If the bride is silent about the issue, i.e. her wali expressed his intention to marry her off to a certain man, and she did not object to it; then consent is assumed via her lack of objection.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Islam"&gt;''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' New Edition, Leiden 1995, tome 8, page 27&amp;nbsp;b, article Nikāḥ: "The ''wali'' can only give the bride in marriage with her consent, but in the case of a virgin, silent consent is sufficient. The father or the grandfather, however, has the right to marry his daughter or granddaughter against her will, as long as she is a virgin (he is therefore called wali mudjbir, wali with power to coercion); the exercise of this power is, however, very strictly regulated in the interests of the bride."&lt;/ref&gt;

For all [[Madhhab|schools of Islamic jurisprudence]] {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} the systematization of their school is the guideline for their decision, not single hadiths, that liberal Muslims often cite {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Two of these hadiths are the following:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her is to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others].{{Full citation needed|date=March 2013}}

It is reported in a [[hadith]] that [[A'ishah]] related that she asked the Prophet : "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission."

===International human rights responses===
{{Further|Child marriage#International initiatives to prevent child marriage}}
Children in some {{which|date=July 2015}} Muslim sub-cultures who defy their parents' wishes may in practice, suffer penalties supported by the community. International awareness, campaigns and organizations such as the U.K.'s [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/forced-marriage/ Forced Marriage Unit] have recognized the severity of this human rights issue and their rescue and support services extend beyond the borders of U.K. territories. Some countries have instituted prison time for parents who try to coerce their children into such unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/7941539/MP-acts-against-forced-marriage|title=MP acts against forced marriage|work=Stuff|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==

{{Main|Divorce in Islam}}

Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

== Prohibited marriages ==
In certain sections of the pre-Islamic Arab tradition, the son could inherit his deceased father's other wives (i.e. not his own mother) as a wife. The Quran prohibited this practice.

Marriage between people related in some way is subject to prohibitions based on three kinds of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|4|22|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following prohibitions are given from the male perspective for brevity; the analogous counterparts apply from the female perspective; e.g., for "aunt" read "uncle".[[Image:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|150px|A bride signing the ''nikah nama'' ([[marriage certificate]])]]
The Quran states:

{{quote|O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women forcefully. (Al-Quran 4:19)}}

{{quote|And don't marry women to whom you father has ever married except what has passed. Indeed it was lewdness, disbelief, and a bad way. Prohibited to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, brother's daughters, sister's daughters, your  mothers that are those who suckled you, your sisters from suckling, mothers of your women, your step-daughters in your guardianship from your women you have entered upon but if you have not entered upon them then there is no blame on you, women of your sons from your loins, and that addition of two sisters (in a wedlock) except what has passed. Surely God is All-forgiving All-merciful. (Al-Quran 4:22-23)}}

===Prohibitions based on consanguinity===
Seven relations are prohibited because of [[consanguinity]], i.e. kinship or relationship by blood, viz. mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal aunts, maternal aunts and nieces (whether sister's or brother's daughters). In this case, no distinction is made between full and half relations, both being equally prohibited. Distinction is however made with step relations i.e. where both the biological mother and father of a couple wishing to marry are separate individuals for both parties, in which case it is permitted. The word "mother" also connotes the "father’s mother" and "mother’s mother" all the way up. Likewise the word "daughter" also includes the "son’s daughter" and "daughter’s daughter" all the way down. The sister of the maternal grandfather and of the paternal grandmother (great aunts) are also included on equal basis in the application of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghamidi|first=Javed Ahmad|title=Mizan: A Comprehensive Introduction to Islam|publisher=Al-Mawrid|location=Lahore|authorlink=Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibitions based on suckling===
{{Main|Rada (fiqh)}}
Marriage to what are sometimes described as foster relations in English are not permitted, although the concept of "[[fosterage]]" is not the same as is implied by the English word. The relationship is that formed by suckling from the breast of a [[wet nurse]]. This is what is meant by "fosterage" in Islam in the quotation below. In Islam, the infant is regarded as having the same degree of affinity to the wet nurse as in consanguinity, so when the child grows up marriage is prohibited to those related to the wet nurse by the same degree as if to the child's own mother.

[[Hadith]] reports confirm that fosterage does not happen by a chance suckling, it refers to the first two years of a child's life before it is weaned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]], Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 616, (no. 3590)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhari, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 912 (no. 5102)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 619, (no. 3606)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Every relationship which is prohibited (for marriage) owing to consanguinity is also prohibited owing to fosterage" [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Mu’atta]], 395-396, (no. 1887)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amin Ahsan Islahi|Islahi]] writes that "this relationship is established only with the full intent of those involved. It only comes into being after it is planned and is well thought of".&lt;ref&gt;Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i Qur’an, vol. 2, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibitions based on marriage===
The daughter-in-law is prohibited for the father, and the mother-in-law, the wife’s daughter, the wife’s sister and daughters of the wife's siblings (nieces), the maternal and paternal aunts of the wife are all prohibited for the husband. However, these are conditional prohibitions:
# Only the daughter of that wife is prohibited with whom one has had conjugal contact.
# Only the daughter-in-law of a real son is prohibited.
# The sister of a wife, her maternal and paternal aunts and her brother's or sister's daughters (nieces) are only prohibited if the wife is in wedlock with the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, Al-Mu’atta’, 341, (no. 1600)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition based on religion===
The Quran states:
*Do not marry polytheist woman until she believes; a slave believing woman is better than polytheist women though she allures you; Do not marry (your girls) to polytheist man until he believes: A man slave who believes is better than an polytheist man, even though he allures you. They do (but) beckon you to the Fire. But God beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: so that they may understand. (Al-Quran 2:221)
*O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees, examine (and test) them: God knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful wives for the Unbelievers, nor are the Unbelievers lawful husbands for them. (Al-Quran 60:10)

*
*It is not lawful by Allah Almighty for Muslim women to marry non Muslim men of any faith. (Quran 2:221 60:10 4:141)
*It is lawful for Muslim men to marry Jewish or Christian women but not a polytheist woman. (Quran 5:5)

===Prohibited marriage partners===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
* Marriage between people of the same sex
* Marriage between a man and his sister, half-sister, foster sister, mother, stepmother, foster mother, wife's mother, aunt, grandmother, great aunt, great-grandmother, etc.
* Marriage between a woman and her father, stepfather, husband's biological father, uncle, grandfather, great uncle, great-grandfather, etc. &lt;!-- foster father OK? --&gt;
* Marriage of a man with women who are sisters or stepsisters or foster sisters of each other (except if marrying one who was separated from her husband by divorce or death)

Note: Marriage between cousins is not prohibited.

==Polygamy==
According to [[sharia law]], Muslims are allowed to practice [[polygyny]]. According to the Quran, a man may have [[Polygyny in Islam|up to four legal wives]] at any one time.

The husband is required to treat all wives equally. If a man fears that he will not be able to meet these conditions then he is not allowed more than one wife.

"If he fears that he shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if he fear that he shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or that which your right hands possess. That will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice." (Qur'an 4:3) Yusuf Ali translation.

A bride-to-be may include terms in her marriage contract that require [[monogamy]] for her husband or require her consent before he marries another wife.

Polyandry is forbidden. A woman cannot have more than one husband at a time.

===Sororal polygyny prohibited===
Sororal polygyny is forbidden. A man cannot marry:
* two sisters
* a woman and a descendant of her sibling
* a woman and sibling of her ancestor

== Iddah ==
{{Main|Iddah}}
A woman cannot marry after divorce or death of her husband for a certain period. This period is known as [[iddah]].
* A divorcee cannot marry for three menstrual cycles after divorce
* A divorcee who has no courses cannot marry for three months
* A pregnant woman cannot marry until laying her burden
* A widow cannot remarry for four months and ten days

== Modern implementations ==
In today’s world, Muslims practice Islamic marital laws in a multitude of ways all over the globe. In the United States, for example, 95% of Muslim American couples included in a 2012 study by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding had completed both the Nikkah and had obtained a civil marriage license, which is required to have a marriage legally recognized in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU-Report_Marriage-II_Macfarlane_WEB.pdf|title=Understanding trends in american mUslim divorce and marriage: A Discussion Guide for Families and Communities|last=Macfarlane|first=Julie|date=January 2012|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shares that “In some cases, the Islamic marriage contract is completed once the couple has decided to get married, but cohabitation occurs later after the wedding reception. In other cases, the Islamic marriage contract is completed simultaneously with the civil marriage and is followed immediately by the wedding reception.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU-Report_Marriage-II_Macfarlane_WEB.pdf|title=Understanding trends in American Muslim divorce and marriage: A Discussion Guide for Families and Communities|last=Macfarelane|first=Julie|date=January 2012|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is ongoing debate about whether or not Sharia law should be recognized in western countries like the United States and Australia that would allow for the Nikkah to be recognized as a legally valid marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/trump-campaign-survey-sharia-law-russia-2020|title='Are you concerned by sharia law?': Trump canvasses supporters for 2020|last=Smith|first=David|date=2018-03-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU-Report_Marriage-II_Macfarlane_WEB.pdf|title=Understanding trends in American Muslim divorce and marriage: A Discussion Guide for Families and Communities|last=Macfarlane|first=Julie|date=January 2012|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=6|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other elements to the Islamic marriage rituals that have difficulty being acknowledged in courts, according to the study, including the Mahr, or the dowry. Women who are denied their dowry do not have a clear path to legal contestation in either the US or Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies have also shown that even young Muslim Americans who might describe themselves as “not very religious “embrace the rituals of their faith at important moments of transition – birth, death and marriage. These occasions motivate reaffirmation of emotional and behavioral touchstones, even for those who do not practice their faith by attending mosque, praying or fasting regularly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU_Promoting_Healthy_Marriages_and_Preventing_Divorce_in_the_American_Muslim_Community.pdf|title=Recommendations for Promoting Healthy Marriages &amp; Preventing Divorce in the American Muslim Community|last=Killawi|first=Amal|last2=Daneshpour|first2=Manijeh|date=June 2014|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|publisher=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018|last3=Elmi|first3=Arij|last4=Dadras|first4=Iman|last5=Hamid|first5=Hamada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to divorce, the 2014 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding states that, "Two divorce rates commonly cited for American Muslims include 32.33% and 21.3%, respectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU_Promoting_Healthy_Marriages_and_Preventing_Divorce_in_the_American_Muslim_Community.pdf|title=Recommendations for Promoting Healthy Marriages &amp; Preventing Divorce in the American Muslim Community|last=Killawi|first=Amal|last2=Daneshpour|first2=Manijeh|date=June 2014|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018|last3=Elmi|first3=Arij|last4=Dadras|first4=Iman|last5=Hamid|first5=Hamada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States and Canada, many Muslim couples interviewed in the study mention that they value a religious divorce and its proceedings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU-Report_Marriage-II_Macfarlane_WEB.pdf|title=Understanding trends in American Muslim divorce and marriage: A Discussion Guide for Families and Communities|last=Macfarlane|first=Julie|date=January 2012|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=33|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some turn to religious figure to help them navigate the divorce process, while many still go through the courts to terminate the civil marriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Divorced Muslim women today also face the stigmas associated with being divorced within the North American Muslim community that can make it difficult for them seek remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU_Promoting_Healthy_Marriages_and_Preventing_Divorce_in_the_American_Muslim_Community.pdf|title=Recommendations for Promoting Healthy Marriages &amp; Preventing Divorce in the American Muslim Community|last=Killawi|first=Amal|last2=Daneshpour|first2=Manijeh|date=June 2014|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|pages=9–10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018|last3=Elmi|first3=Arij|last4=Dadras|first4=Iman|last5=Hamid|first5=Hamada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles and ideas about marriage have also shifted since the early onset of Islam when many of the rules around marriage were established. ISPU reports that “the most frequent source of marital conflict in this study was conflict over changing gender roles and expectations”,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ISPU-Report_Marriage-II_Macfarlane_WEB.pdf|title=Understanding trends in American Muslim divorce and marriage: A Discussion Guide for Families and Communities|last=Macfarlane|first=Julie|date=January 2012|website=The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|page=40|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing a nation-wide increase in women in higher education and professional jobs over the past three decades, and, “In many cases are trying to integrate childrearing and family life with professional goals”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Millî Görüş''' ({{IPA-tr|milˈliː ɡøˈɾyʃ|lang}}, "National Outlook" or "National Vision") is a religio-political movement and a series of [[Islamist]] parties inspired by [[Necmettin Erbakan]].

==Background==
In 1969 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] politician [[Necmettin Erbakan]] published a [[manifesto]] that he gave the title Millî Görüş.&lt;ref&gt;Atacan 2005, 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; It spoke only in the most general terms of [[Islamic]] moral and religious education but devoted much attention to [[industrialization]], [[regional development|development]] and [[autarky|economic independence]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

It warned against further rapprochement towards [[Europe]], considering the [[Common Market]] to be a [[Zionist]] and [[Catholic]] project for the assimilation and de-[[Islamization]] of Turkey and called instead for [[Pan-Islamism]]. According to author Banu Eligur, Erbakan and the party "used the code words ''national'' and ''culture'' to refer to Islam, and ''National Vision'' to refer to the project of [[Islamism|Political Islam]]" as "it is illegal" in Turkey "to use religious symbols for political purposes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6eFzRgxCkhQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=milli+turkey+islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3dMe0Mv_F&amp;sig=dS9KvqXoyrmHCstsD1os9MlXCEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qL_JTKj_OIPAnAfRnN3IDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=milli%20turkey%20islam&amp;f=false The Mobilization of Political Islam in Turkey] By Banu Eligur, p.66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of Millî Görüş would remain associated with a religio-political movement and a series of [[Islamist]] parties inspired by Erbakan, one succeeding the other as they were banned for violating Turkey’s [[Secularism in Turkey|secularist]] legislation.

== Islamist rift ==
Following the ban of the [[Virtue Party]] (FP), a rift that had been developing in the movement resulted in two parties taking its place, the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) representing Erbakan’s old guard, and the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AK Party) led by younger and more pragmatic politicians around [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], which claims to have renounced a specifically Islamist agenda. The AK Party convincingly won the [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002 elections]] and formed a government with a strong popular mandate, that brought Turkey closer to acceptance for membership in the [[European Union]] than any previous government had done.

=== European Turkish diaspora ===
Among the [[Turkish diaspora|Turkish immigrants in Western Europe]], Milli Görüş became one of the major, if not the major, religious movements, controlling numerous [[mosques]]. Like the movement in Turkey, it went through some remarkable changes, not least because the first generation, which was strongly oriented towards what happened in Turkey, is gradually surrendering leadership to a younger generation that grew up in Europe and is concerned with entirely different matters. Milli Görüş’ public profile shows considerable differences from one country to the next, suggesting that nature of the interaction with the ‘host’ societies may have as much of an impact on its character as a religious movement as the relationship with the ‘mother’ movement in Turkey.

According to several sources in Germany the attitude of the German branch towards Turkey has completely changed. After the taking over of Erdogan and the AKP the organisation is mainly serving the interest of the turkish government which now subsidizes the organisation. Diyanet, AKP and the turkish government practically control the organisations public statements and appearances. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Joachim Frank|Periodical=Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger|Title=Türkische Islam-Verbände: Ditib und Milli Görüs im Schulterschluss|language=German|URL=https://www.ksta.de/politik/tuerkische-islam-verbaende-ditib-und-milli-goerues-im-schulterschluss-29949890#|AccessDate=2018-06-17

[[File:IVE Missionaries in Papua New Guinea.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Catholic]] missionaries in [[Papua New Guinea]]]]

A '''missionary''' is a member of a [[Religious denomination|religious group]] sent into an area to [[proselytize]] or perform ministries of service, such as [[education]], [[literacy]], [[social justice]], [[health care]], and [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/missionary Missionary | Define Missionary at Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Hale 2003"&gt;Thomas Hale 'On Being a Missionary' 2003, William Carey Library Pub, {{ISBN|0-87808-255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "mission" originates from 1598 when the [[Jesuits]] sent members abroad, derived from the Latin ''missionem'' (nom. ''missio''), meaning "act of sending" or ''mittere'', meaning "to send".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mission Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in light of its biblical usage; in the Latin translation of the [[Bible]], Christ uses the word when sending the disciples to preach [[The gospel]] in his name. The term is most commonly used for Christian missions, but can be used for any creed or ideology.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Buddhism]] launched "the first large-scale missionary effort in the history of the world's religions" in the 3rd century BCE. ([[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 37 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionaries by religion==

===Christian missions===
{{main|Mission (Christianity)|List of Christian Missionaries}}
{{see also|Jesuit reduction}}
A [[Christianity|Christian]] missionary can be defined as "one who is to witness across cultures".&lt;ref name="Thomas Hale 2003"/&gt; The [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Congress]] of 1974, defined the term, related to Christian mission as, "to form a viable indigenous church-planting movement". Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world.

In the Bible, [[Jesus]] is recorded as instructing the apostles to make [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of all nations ({{bibleref|Matthew|28:19–20}}, {{bibleref|Mark|16:15–18}}). This verse is referred to by Christian missionaries as the [[Great Commission]] and inspires missionary work.

====Historic====
[[File:Rugendas - Aldea des Tapuyos.jpg|thumb|Village of Christianized Tapuyos Indians, [[Brazil]] c. 1820]]
The Christian Church expanded throughout the [[Roman Empire]] already in New Testament times and is said by tradition to have reached even further, to Persia ([[Church of the East]]) and to India ([[Saint Thomas Christians]]). During the Middle Ages the Christian [[monasteries]] and missionaries such as [[Saint Patrick]] (5th century), and [[Adalbert of Prague]] (ca 956-997) propagated learning and religion beyond the European boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In 596, Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (in office 590-604) sent the [[Gregorian Mission]] (including [[Augustine of Canterbury]]) into England. In their turn, Christians from Ireland (the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]) and from Britain ([[Saint Boniface]] (ca 675-754), and the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], for example)  became prominent in converting the inhabitants of central Europe.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the Americas and in other Western colonies through the [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]], and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] to spread Christianity in the New World and{{clarify|date=August 2014}} to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and other indigenous people. About the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] (1506–1552) as well as other [[Jesuits]], Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans reached Asia and the [[Far East]], and the Portuguese sent missions into Africa. Emblematic in many respects is  [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China from 1582, which was totally peaceful and non-violent. These missionary movements should be distinguished from others, such as the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries, which were arguably compromised in their motivation by designs of military conquest.

[[File:The Reception of the Rev. J. Williams, at Tanna, in the South Seas, the Day Before He Was Massacred, 1841 (B-088-015).jpg|thumb|English missionary [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], active in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]]]
Much contemporary Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962-1965, with an increased push for indigenization and [[inculturation]], along with  [[social justice]] issues as a constitutive part of preaching the Gospel.

As the [[Catholic Church]] normally organizes itself along territorial lines and had the human and material resources, religious orders, some even specializing in it, undertook most missionary work, especially in the era after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. Over time, the [[Holy See]]  gradually established a normalized Church structure in the mission areas, often starting with special jurisdictions known as apostolic prefectures and [[apostolic vicariates]]. At a later stage of  development these foundations are raised to regular diocesan status with a local bishops appointed. On a global front, these processes were often accelerated in the later 1960s, in part accompanying political decolonization. In some regions, however, they are still in course.

Just as the Bishop of Rome had jurisdiction also in territories later considered to be in the Eastern sphere, so the missionary efforts of the two 9th-century [[saints Cyril and Methodius]] were largely conducted in relation to the West rather than the East, though the field of activity was central Europe. 

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], under the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] undertook vigorous missionary work under the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This had  lasting effects and in some sense is at the origin of the present relations of [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Constantinople]] ith some sixteen Orthodox national churches including the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (both traditionally said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Andrew), the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] (said to have been founded by the missionary Apostle Paul). The Byzantines expanded their missionary work in Ukraine after the [[Baptism of Rus'|mass baptism in Kiev]] in 988. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] had its origins in the conversion by Byzantine missionaries of the Serb tribes when they arrived in the Balkans in the 7th century. Orthodox missionaries also worked successfully among the Estonians from the 10th to the 12th centuries, founding the [[Orthodoxy in Estonia|Estonian Orthodox Church]].

[[File:Martires de elicura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Jesuits who were martyred by the [[Mapuche|Araucanian]] Indians in Elicura in 1612]]

Under the [[Russian Empire]] of the 19th century, missionaries such as [[Nikolay Ilminsky|Nicholas Ilminsky]] (1822–1891) moved into the subject lands and propagated Orthodoxy, including through [[Belarus]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church|Latvia]], [[Moldova]], [[Finnish Orthodox Church|Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chinese Orthodox Church|China]]. The Russian [[Nicholas of Japan|St. Nicholas of Japan]] (1836–1912) took Eastern Orthodoxy to [[Japanese Orthodox Church|Japan]] in the 19th century. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also sent missionaries to [[Alaska]] beginning in the 18th century, including Saint [[Herman of Alaska]] (died 1836), to minister to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] continued missionary work outside Russia after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], resulting in the establishment of many new dioceses in the [[diaspora]], from which numerous converts have been made in Eastern Europe, North America, and Oceania.

Early [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries included [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and contemporary ministers including [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and Richard Bourne, who ministered to the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] natives who lived in lands claimed by representatives of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in the early 17th century. Quaker "publishers of truth" visited Boston and other mid-17th century colonies, but were not always well received.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, D., discussed throughout Chapter 1, ''Quakers in Boston: 1656–1964'', Fleming &amp; Son, Somerville, 1980.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish government began the first organized Protestant mission work through its [[College of Missions]], established in 1714. This funded and directed [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]] missionaries such as [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg]] in [[Tranquebar]], India, and [[Hans Egede]] in [[Isle of Hope|Greenland]]. In 1732, while on a visit in 1732 to [[Copenhagen]] for the coronation of his cousin King [[Christian VI]], the [[Moravian Church]]'s patron Nicolas Ludwig, Count von [[Zinzendorf]], was very struck by its effects, and particularly by two visiting [[Kalaallit people|Inuit]] children converted by [[Hans Egede]]. He also got to know a slave from the [[Danish Virgin Islands|Danish colony]] in the [[West Indies]]. When he returned to [[Herrnhut]] in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], he inspired the inhabitants of the village{{spaced ndash}}it had fewer than thirty houses then{{spaced ndash}}to send out "messengers" to the slaves in the West Indies and to the [[Moravian missions in Greenland]]. Within thirty years, Moravian missionaries had become active on every continent, and this at a time when there were fewer than three hundred people in Herrnhut. They are famous for their selfless work, living as slaves among the slaves and together with the Native Americans, the Delaware (i.e., [[Lenni Lenape]]) and [[Cherokee]] Indian tribes. Today, the work in the former mission provinces of the worldwide Moravian Church is carried on by native workers. The fastest-growing area of the work is in [[Tanzania]] in Eastern Africa. The Moravian work in [[South Africa]] inspired [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and the founders of the British [[Baptist]] missions. {{As of | 2014}}, seven of every ten Moravians live in a former mission field and belong to a race other than Caucasian.

Much [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] mission work came about under the auspices of the [[United Society|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG, founded in 1701), the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS, founded 1799) and of the [[Intercontinental Church Society]] (formerly the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, originating in 1823).

With a dramatic increase in efforts since the 20th century, and a strong push since the ''Lausanne I: The International Congress on World Evangelization'' in Switzerland in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620162513/http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=12722 |date=June 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; modern evangelical groups have focused efforts on sending missionaries to every ethnic group in the world.  While this effort has not been completed, increased attention has brought larger numbers of people distributing [[Bible]]s, [[Jesus (1979 film)|Jesus videos]], and establishing [[evangelical]] churches in more remote areas.

Internationally, the focus for many years in the later 20th century was on reaching every "people group" with Christianity by the year 2000.  Bill Bright's leadership with Campus Crusade, the Southern Baptist [[International Mission Board]], The Joshua Project, and others brought about the need to know who these "[[unreached people group]]s" are and how those wanting to tell about the Christian God and share a Christian Bible could reach them.  The focus for these organizations transitioned from a "country focus" to a "people group focus". (From "What is a People Group?" by Dr. Orville Boyd Jenkins:  A "people group" is an ethnolinguistic group with a common self-identity that is shared by the various members. There are two parts to that word: ethno and linguistic. Language is a primary and dominant identifying factor of a people group. But there are other factors that determine or are associated with ethnicity.)

[[File:The missionary ship "Duff" arriving (ca. 1797) at Otaheite, lithograph by Kronheim &amp; Co.jpg|thumb|left|The missionary ship ''Duff'' arriving at [[Tahiti]], c. 1797]]
What can be viewed as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of cooperation and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their [[Gospel|gospel message]], but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort.

Over the years, as indigenous churches have matured, the church of the "Global South" (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) has become the driving force in missions. Korean and African missionaries can now be found all over the world. These missionaries represent a major shift in church history.

Brazil, Nigeria, and other countries have had large numbers of their Christian adherents go to other countries and start churches. These non-western missionaries often have unparalleled success; because, they need few western resources and comforts to sustain their livelihood while doing the work they have chosen among a new culture and people.

One of the first large-scale missionary endeavors of the British colonial age was the [[Baptist Missionary Society]], founded in 1792 as the Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen.

The [[London Missionary Society]] was an [[evangelical]] organisation, bringing together from its inception both [[Anglican]]s and [[Nonconformist]]s; it was founded in England in 1795 with missions in Africa and the islands of the South Pacific.  The [[Colonial Missionary Society]] was created in 1836, and directed its efforts towards promoting [[Congregationalist]] forms of [[Christianity]] among "British or other European settlers" rather than indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Bebbington, David.

The [[Church Mission Society]], first known as the Society for Missions to Africa and the East, was founded in 1799 by evangelical Anglicans centred around the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery]] activist [[William Wilberforce]]. It bent its efforts to the [[Coptic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Church]], and India, especially [[Kerala]]; it continues to this day. Many of the [[church planting|network of churches they established]] became the [[Anglican Communion]].

In 1809, the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews was founded, which pioneered mission amongst the Jewish people; it continues today as the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People]]. In 1865, the [[China Inland Mission]] was founded, going well beyond British controlled areas; it continues as the OMF, working throughout [[East Asia]].

[[File:LDS name tags.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic black name tags of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]]]
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has an active [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary program]]. Young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five are encouraged to prepare themselves to serve a two-year, self-funded, full-time proselytizing mission. Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a [[Missionary Training Center]] (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people they live among. As of January 2014, the LDS Church had over 80,000 missionaries worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/dramatic-increase-number-church-missionaries-highlights-2013 |title= Dramatic Increase in the Number of Church Missionaries Highlights 2013 |date= 30 December 2013 |work= Newsroom [MormonNewsroom.org] |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 10,000 Welfare Services Missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-stats |title= Facts and Statistics |date= n.d. |work= Newsroom [MormonNewsroom.org] |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2014-01-22 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054940/http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-stats |archivedate= 2012-02-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====[[Maryknoll]]=====
The sending of missioners from the U.S. Church was seen as a sign of the U.S. Catholic Church finally coming of age.

When two American Catholic [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] from distinctly different backgrounds met in Montreal in 1910, they discovered they had one thing in common.  [[James Anthony Walsh|Father James Anthony Walsh]], a priest from the heart of Boston, and [[Thomas Frederick Price|Father Thomas Frederick Price]], the first native North Carolinian ordained into the priesthood, recognized that through their differences, they were touched by the triumph of the human spirit and enriched by encountering the faith experience of others.  This was the foundation of their mutual desire to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions.

Countering arguments that the Church needed workers here, Fathers Walsh and Price insisted the Church would not flourish until it sent missioners overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maryknollmissiontrips.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, the men had written extensively about the concept, Father Price in his magazine ''Truth'', and Father Walsh in the pages of ''A Field Afar'', an early incarnation of ''Maryknoll Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryknollmagazine.org/ ''Maryknoll Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they formulated plans to establish a seminary for foreign missionaries. With the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 to receive final approval from [[Pope Pius X]] for their project.  On June 29, 1911, Pope Pius X gave his blessings for the formation of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, now better known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maryknollsociety.org Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic missions===
{{main|Islamic missionary activity}}
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Mission Dawah.gif|Mission Dawah is one of the largest contemporary Islamic missionary organizations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Dawah]] means to "invite" (in Arabic, literally "calling") to [[Islam]], which is the second largest religion with 1.6 billion members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|title=The Global Religious Landscape|date=18 December 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 7th century, it spread rapidly from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the rest of the world through the initial [[Muslim conquests]] and subsequently with traders and explorers after the death of [[Muhammad]].

Initially, the spread of Islam came through the Dawah efforts of Muhammad and his followers. After his death in 632 C.E., much of the expansion of the empire came through conquest such as that of North Africa and later Spain ([[Al-Andalus]]). The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] put an end to the [[Sassanid Empire]] and spread the reach of Islam to as far east as [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which would later become the cradle of Islamic civilization during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (622-1258 C.E.) and a stepping-stone towards the introduction of Islam to the [[Turkic tribes]] living in and bordering the area.

The missionary movement peaked during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], with the expansion of foreign trade routes, primarily into the [[Indo-Pacific]] and as far south as the isle of [[Zanzibar]] as well as the South-Eastern shores of Africa.

With the coming of the [[Sufism]] tradition, Islamic missionary activities increased. Later, the [[Seljuk Turks]]' conquest of [[Anatolia]] made it easier for missionaries to go lands that formerly belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the earlier stages of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] form of [[Shamanism]] was still widely practiced in Anatolia, but soon lost ground to [[Sufism]].

During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] presence in the [[Balkans]], missionary movements were taken up by people from aristocratic families hailing from the region, who had been educated in [[Constantinople]] or other major city within the Empire such as the famed [[madrassah]]s and [[kulliye]]s. Primarily, individuals were sent back to the place of their origin and were appointed important positions in the local governing body. This approach often resulted in the building of mosques and local [[kulliye]]s for future generations to benefit from, as well as spreading the teachings of Islam.
[[File:World Islamic Mission 1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[World Islamic Mission]]'s mosque in [[Oslo]], Norway]]

The spread of Islam towards [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa had until the early 19th century has been consistent but slow. Previously, the only connection was through Trans-Saharan trade routes. The [[Mali Empire]], consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong example of the early Islamic conversion of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the [[Colonization of Africa|European colonization of Africa]], missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies.

There is evidence of Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia as early as the 8th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |title = Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World Vol. 2 M-Z index |author = Martin. C, Richard |year= 2004 |publisher= Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's early people were animists, Hindus, and Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Islam in Indonesia |author= Duff, Mark |year= 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2357121.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was not until the end of the 13th century that the process of "Islamization" began to spread throughout the areas local communities and port towns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The spread, although at first introduced through Arab Muslim traders, continued to saturate through the Indonesian people as local rulers and royalty began to adopt the religion subsequently leading their subjects to mirror their conversion.

Recently, Muslim groups have engaged in missionary work in Malawi. Much of this is performed by the [[African Muslim Agency]] based in [[Angola]]. The [[Kuwait]]-sponsored AMA has translated the [[Qur'an]] into [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]] (Cinyanja),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.org.za/mission%20reports_prayer/macedonian_call_Malawi.htm Proseletysation in Malawi]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the official languages of Malawi, and has engaged in other missionary work in the country. All of the major cities in the country have mosques and there are several Islamic schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicfinder.org/cityPrayer.php?country=Malawi|title=Malawi Accurate Prayer Times أوقات الصلاة, Qiblah, Qibla اتجاه القبلة Mosques (Masjids), Islamic Centers, Organizations and Muslim Owned Businesses |work=islamicfinder.org|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[South Africa]]n, [[Kuwait]]i, and other Muslim agencies are active in Mozambique, with one important one being the African Muslim Agency. The spread of Islam into West Africa, beginning with ancient [[Ghana]] in the 9th century, was mainly the result of the commercial activities of North African Muslims. The empires of both [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] that followed ancient Ghana in the Western Sudan adopted the religion. Islam made its entry into the northern territories of modern Ghana around the 15th century. [[Mande languages|Mande]] speakers (who in Ghana are known as [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]]) traders and clerics carried the religion into the area. The northeastern sector of the country was also influenced by an influx of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] Muslim traders from the 16th century onwards

Islamic influence first occurred in India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the [[Indian subcontinent]] from ancient times. Even in the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic era]], Arab traders used to visit the [[Malabar region]], which linked them with the ports of [[South East Asia|Southeast Asia]]. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book ''[[The History of India as told by its own Historians]]'', the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 C.E.. H. G. Rawlinson, in his book: ''Ancient and Medieval History of India'' claims the first [[Arab Muslims]] settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|81-86050-79-5}} Ancient and Medieval History of India&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykh Zainuddin Makhdum's "Tuhfat al-Mujahidin"  also is a reliable work.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|983-9154-80-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is corroborated, by J. Sturrock in his ''South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals'',&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock, J., South Canara and Madras District Manual (2 vols., Madras, 1894-1895)&lt;/ref&gt; and also by Haridas Bhattacharya in ''Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|81-85843-05-8}} Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV&lt;/ref&gt; It was with the advent of Islam that the Arabs became a prominent cultural force in the world. The Arab merchants and traders became the carriers of the new religion, and they propagated it wherever they went.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaihoon.com/watan/indarbmappilacommunity.htm -Genesis and Growth of the Mappila Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622220846/http://jaihoon.com/watan/indarbmappilacommunity.htm |date=2006-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam in Bulgaria can be traced back to the mid-ninth century when there were Islamic missionaries in Bulgaria, evidenced by a letter from Pope Nicholas to [[Boris of Bulgaria]] calling for the extirpation of Saracens.&lt;ref&gt;H. T. Norris: "Islam in the Balkans: religion and society between Europe and the Arab world" 1993 pp.21-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneer Muslim missionaries to the Kenyan interior were largely [[Tanganyikan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, who coupled their missionary work with trade, along the centres began along the railway line such as [[Kibwezi]], [[Makindu]], and [[Nairobi]].

Outstanding among them was Maalim Mtondo [[Islam in Kenya]], a Tanganyikan credited with being the first Muslim missionary to Nairobi. Reaching Nairobi at the close of the 19th century, he led a group of other Muslims, and enthusiastic missionaries from the coast to establish a "Swahili village" in present-day [[Pumwani]]. A small mosque was built to serve as a starting point and he began preaching Islam in earnest. He soon attracted several [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] and Wakambas, who became his disciples.&lt;ref name="Quraishy:1987:182"&gt;Quraishy, MA (1987). Text Book of Islam Book 1. Nairobi: The Islamic Foundation, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1380, [[Makhdum Karim|Karim ul' Makhdum]] the first Arabian [[Dawah|Islamic missionary]] reached the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and [[Jolo]] in the Philippines and established Islam in the country. In 1390, the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]'s Prince [[Rajah Baguinda]] and his followers preached Islam on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1990/06/23/SEL/mbm.19900623.SEL18854.id.html | title=Kerinduan orang-orang moro | publisher=TEMPO- Majalah Berita Mingguan | accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque]] was the first mosque established in the Philippines on [[Simunul, Tawi-Tawi|Simunul]] in [[Mindanao]] in the 14th century. Subsequent settlements by Arab missionaries traveling to [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] helped strengthen Islam in the Philippines and each settlement was governed by a [[Datu]], [[Rajah]], and a [[Sultan]]. Islamic provinces founded in the Philippines included the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], [[Sultanate of Sulu]], and other parts of the southern Philippines.

Modern missionary work in the United States has increased greatly in the last one hundred years, with much of the recent demographic growth driven by conversion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DB1F3EF931A15753C1A9679C8B63 A NATION CHALLENGED: AMERICAN MUSLIMS; Islam Attracts Converts By the Thousand, Drawn Before and After Attacks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to one-third of American Muslims are [[African American]]s who have converted to Islam during the last seventy years.

An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries.

====Ahmadiyya Islam missions====
[[File:Jamia Ahmadiyya International.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Jamia Ahmadiyya, Ghana]]
Missionaries belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] thought of Islam often study at International Islamic seminaries and educational institutions, known as [[Jamia Ahmadiyya]]. Upon completion of their degrees, they are sent to various parts of the world including South America, Africa, North America, Europe, and the Far East as appointed by [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]], present head and [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim community. Jamia students may be appointed by the Caliph either as Missionaries of the community (often called Murrabi, Imam, or Mawlana) or as Qadis or Muftis of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community with a specialisation in matters of fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence). Some Jamia alumni have also become Islamic historians such as the late Dost Muhammad Shahid, former Official Historian of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, with a specialisation in tarikh (Islamic historiography). Missionaries stay with their careers as appointed by the Caliph for the rest of their lives, as per their commitment to the community.

===Missionaries and Judaism===
Despite some Jewish missionary activity [[intertestamental|in the biblical times]], contemporary [[Judaism]] states clearly that missionary activities are mostly taboo. Historically, various Judaic sects and movements have been consistent on avoiding [[proselytization]] to convert Gentiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conversion to Judaism|date=2018-08-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_to_Judaism&amp;oldid=853680852|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Jewish religious groups encourage "Outreach" to [[Jew]]s. The outreach, or ''[[kiruv]]'', movements encourage Jews to become more knowledgeable and observant of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. People who become more observant are known as ''[[Baal teshuva|baalei teshuva]]''. "Outreach" is done worldwide, by organizations such as [[Chabad Lubavitch]], [[Aish Hatorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and [[Partners In Torah]]. There are also many such organizations in the United States. There has been a singular, isolated movement to convert Catholics to [[B'nai Moshe|Judaism in Peru]].

Members of the [[Reform Judaism|American Reform]] movement began a program to convert to Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who have an interest in Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during [[the Holocaust]] that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews&lt;ref&gt;[[Missionary#cite note-39]]&lt;/ref&gt; as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices.

The first Buddhist missionaries were called "Dharma Bhanaks", and some{{who|date=October 2017}} see a missionary charge in the symbolism behind the Buddhist wheel, which is said to travel all over the earth bringing Buddhism with it. The Emperor [[Ashoka]] was a significant early Buddhist missioner. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Dharmaraksita]]—among others—was sent out by emperor Ashoka to proselytize{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} the [[Buddhist]] tradition through the Indian [[Maurya Empire]], but also into the Mediterranean as far as Greece. Gradually, all India and the neighboring island of [[Ceylon]] were converted. Then Buddhism spread eastward and southeastward to the present lands of [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Welty, Paul Thomas 1966 pg. 77"&gt;Welty, Paul Thomas. The Asians: Their Heritage and Their Destiny (Revised Edition). Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. (1966); pg. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism was spread among the [[Turkic people]] during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE into modern-day Pakistan, [[Kashmir]], [[Afghanistan]], eastern and coastal [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]. It was also taken into China brought by [[Kasyapa Matanga]] in the 2nd century CE, [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] and [[An Shigao]] translated Buddhist sutras into Chinese. [[Dharmarakṣa]] was one of the greatest translators of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Dharmaraksa came to the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] in 266 CE, where he made the first known translations of the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Dasabhumika Sutra]], which were to become some of the classic texts of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Altogether, Dharmaraksa translated around 154 [[Hīnayāna]] and [[Mahāyāna]] ''[[sutra]]s'', representing most of the important texts of Buddhism available in the Western Regions. His [[proselytizing]] is said to have converted many to Buddhism in China, and made [[Chang'an]], present-day [[Xi'an]], a major center of Buddhism. Buddhism expanded rapidly, especially among the common people, and by 381 most of the people of northwest China were Buddhist. Winning converts also among the rulers and scholars, by the end of the T'ang Dynasty Buddhism was found everywhere in China.&lt;ref&gt;Welty, Paul Thomas. The Asians: Their Heritage and Their Destiny (Revised Edition). Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. (1966); pg. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marananta]] brought Buddhism to the Korean Peninsula in the 4th century. [[Seong of Baekje]], known as a great patron of [[Buddhism]] in [[Korea]], built many temples and welcomed priests bringing Buddhist texts directly from India. In 528, Baekje officially adopted Buddhism as its state religion. He sent tribute missions to Liang in 534 and 541, on the second occasion requesting artisans as well as various Buddhist works and a teacher. According to Chinese records, all these requests were granted. A subsequent mission was sent in 549, only to find the Liang capital in the hands of the rebel [[Hou Jing]], who threw them in prison for lamenting the fall of the capital. He is credited with having sent a mission in 538 to [[Japan]] that brought an image of [[Shakyamuni]] and several sutras to the Japanese court. This has traditionally been considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. An account of this is given in ''[[Gangōji Garan Engi]]''. First supported by the Soga clan, Buddhism rose over the objections of the pro-Shinto [[Mononobe]]&lt;ref name="Crim, Keith 1989 pg. 523"&gt;Crim, Keith (ed.). The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions. San Francisco: Harper Collins (1989). Reprint; originally pub. as Abingdon Dictionary of Living Religions, 1981; pg. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; and Buddhism entrenched itself in Japan with the conversion of Prince [[Shotoku Taishi]].&lt;ref name="Welty, Paul Thomas 1966 pg. 77"/&gt; When in 710 [[Emperor Shomu]] established a new capital at [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] modeled after the capital of China, Buddhism received official support and began to flourish.&lt;ref name="Crim, Keith 1989 pg. 523"/&gt;

[[Padmasambhava]], The Lotus Born, was a sage guru from Oḍḍiyāna who is said to have transmitted Vajrayana Buddhism to [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]] and neighbouring countries in the 8th century.

The use of missions, councils, and monastic institutions influenced the emergence of Christian missions and organizations, which developed similar structures in places that were formerly Buddhist missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sats.edu.za/userfiles/Final%20Thesis%20Joseph%20Paul%20Charles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Western intellectuals such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Max Müller]], and [[esoteric]] societies such as the [[Theosophical Society]] of [[H.P. Blavatsky]] and the [[Buddhist Society, London]] spread interest in Buddhism. Writers such as  [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Jack Kerouac]],   in the West, and the [[hippie]] generation of the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a re-discovery of Buddhism. During the 20th and 21st centuries Buddhism has again been propagated by missionaries{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} into the West such as the [[Dalai Lama]] and monks including [[Lama Surya Das]] (Tibetan Buddhism). [[Tibetan Buddhism]] has been significantly active and successful in the West since the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Today Buddhists make a decent proportion of several countries in the West such as [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], and the [[United States]].

In Canada, the immense popularity and goodwill ushered in by [[Tibet]]'s [[Dalai Lama]] (who has been made honorary Canadian citizen) put Buddhism in a favourable light in the country. Many non-Asian Canadians embraced Buddhism in various traditions and some have become leaders in their respective [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]].

In the early 1990s, the French Buddhist Union (UBF, founded in 1986) estimated that there are 600,000 to 650,000 Buddhists in France, with 150,000 French converts among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/obadia012.html|title=Tibetan Buddhism in France: A Missionary Religion?|work=globalbuddhism.org|accessdate=12 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022707/http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/obadia012.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, sociologist Frédéric Lenoir estimated there are 10,000 converts and up to 5 million "sympathizers", although other researchers have questioned these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lenoir, Frédéric.

[[Taisen Deshimaru]] was a Japanese [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] who founded numerous [[zendo]]s in France. [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]]-nominated, [[Vietnam]]ese-born Zen Buddhist, founded the [[Unified Buddhist Church]] (Eglise Bouddhique Unifiée) in France in 1969. [[Plum Village]], a monastery and retreat center in the [[Dordogne]] in southern France, is his residence and the headquarters of his international [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]].

In 1968 Leo Boer and Wener van de Wetering founded a [[Zen]] group, and through two books made Zen popular in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Janwillem van de Wetering (1973) ''Het dagende niets'' (The Dawning of Nothingness)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janwillem van de Wetering (1973) ''The Empty Mirror'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul)&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance of the group was taken over by Erik Bruijn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erikbruijn.nl Erik Bruijn]&lt;/ref&gt; who is still in charge of a flourishing community. The largest Zen group now is the Kanzeon Sangha, led by Nico Tydeman under the supervision of the American Zen master [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]], Roshi, a former student of Maezumi Roshi in Los Angeles. This group has a relatively large centre where a teacher and some students live permanently. Many other groups are also represented in the Netherlands, like the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives in Apeldoorn, the [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] Order of Interbeing and the International Zen Institute Noorderpoort&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeninstitute.org/en/home.html International Zen Institute – EN – home].

Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist leader in the world is [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the current [[Dalai Lama]], who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of [[Tibet]], he has become a popular cause célèbre. His early life was depicted in Hollywood films such as ''[[Kundun]]'' and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]''. He has attracted celebrity religious followers such as [[Richard Gere]] and [[Adam Yauch]]. The first Western-born Tibetan Buddhist monk was [[Robert A. F. Thurman]], now an academic supporter of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama maintains a North American headquarters at [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Ithaca, New York]].

Lewis M. Hopfe in his "Religions of the World" suggested that "Buddhism is perhaps on the verge of another great missionary outreach" (1987:170).

===Hindu missions===
[[Hinduism]] was introduced into Java by travelers from India in ancient times. When the early Javanese princes accepted Hinduism, they did not give up all of their early animistic beliefs—they simply combined the new ideas with them. Several centuries ago, many Hindus left Java for [[Bali]] rather than convert to [[Islam]]. Hinduism has survived in Bali ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Hintz, Martin. Indonesia (series: Enchantment of the World). Chicago: Childrens Press (1993), pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dang Hyang Nirartha]] was responsible for facilitating a refashioning of Balinese Hinduism. He was an important promoter of the idea of moksha in Indonesia. He founded the Shaivite priesthood that is now ubiquitous in Bali, and is now regarded as the ancestor of all Shaivite pandits.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, p 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shantidas Adhikari]] was a [[Hindu]] preacher from [[Sylhet]] who converted King [[Pamheiba]] of [[Manipur]] to Hinduism in 1717.&lt;ref name="SLM"&gt;[http://www.manipuronline.com/Features/August2002/manipurimuslimfoundation15_2.htm Foundation of Manipuri Muslim History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043152/http://www.manipuronline.com/Features/August2002/manipurimuslimfoundation15_2.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} Manipur Online – August 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Hinduism has only recently had a large influence in western countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Canada. Since the 1960s, many westerners attracted by the world view presented in Asian religious systems have converted to Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;NW, 1615 L. S., Suite 8.

The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has a presence in New Zealand, running temples in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch.

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]], an Indian [[yoga|yogi]] and [[guru]], introduced many westerners to the teachings of meditation and [[Kriya Yoga]] through his book, ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Vivekananda]], the founder of the Ramakrishna Mission is one of the greatest Hindu missionaries to the West.

===Sikh missions===
[[Sikhism|Sikhs]] have emigrated to countries all over the world, especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to a high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity. Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. However, they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_sikh.html Sikhs].

One morning, when he was twenty-eight, Guru Nanak Dev went as usual down to the river to bathe and [[meditate]]. It was said that he was gone for three days.

===Jain missions===
According to [[Jain]]a tradition, Mahavira's following had swelled to 14,000 monks and 36,000 nuns by the time of his death in 527 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Crim, Keith (ed.). ''The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions''. San Francisco: [[Harper Collins]] (1989). Reprint; originally pub. as ''Abingdon Dictionary of Living Religions'', 1981; pg. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
For some two centuries the Jains remained a small community of monks and followers. However, in the 4th century BCE, they gained strength and spread from [[Bihar]] to [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], then so [[South India]] and westwards to [[Gujarat]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], where [[Jain communities]] became firmly established, particularly among the mercantile classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]] (ed.).

(1970); pg. 1481.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of the [[Mauryan Dynasty]] to the 12th century was the period of Jainism's greatest growth and influence. Thereafter, the Jainas in the South and Central regions lost ground in face of rising Hindu devotional movements. Jainism retreated to the West and Northwest, which have remained its stronghold to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Crim, Keith (ed.). ''The Perennial Dictionary of World Religions''.

Emperor [[Samprati]] is regarded as the "Jain Ashoka" for his patronage and efforts to spreading Jainism in east India. Samprati, according to Jain historians, is considered more powerful and famous than Ashoka himself. Samprati built thousands of [[Jain Temples]] in India, many of which remain in use, such as the Jain temples at [[Viramgam]] and [[Palitana temples|Palitana]] (Gujarat), [[Agar Malwa]] ([[Ujjain]]). Within three and a half years, he got one hundred and twenty-five thousand new temples built, thirty-six thousand repaired, twelve and a half million murtis, holy statues, consecrated and ninety-five thousand metal [[murtis]] prepared. Samprati is said to have erected Jain temples throughout his empire. He founded Jain monasteries even in non-Aryan territory, and almost all ancient Jain temples or monuments of unknown origin are popularly attributed to him. It may be noted that all the Jain monuments of [[Rajasthan]] and Gujarat, with unknown builders are also attributed to Emperor Samprati.

[[Virachand Gandhi]] (1864–1901) from [[Mahuva, Bhavnagar|Mahuva]] represented Jains at the first [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893 and won a silver medal. Gandhi was most likely the first Jain and the first Gujarati to travel to the United States, and his statue still stands at the Jain temple in Chicago. In his time he was a world-famous personality.
Gandhi represented Jains in Chicago because the Great Jain Saint Param Pujya Acharya [[Vijayanandsuri]], also known as Acharya Atmaram, was invited to represent the Jain religion at the first [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World Parliament of Religions]]. As Jain monks do not travel overseas, he recommended the bright young scholar Virchand Gandhi to be the emissary for the religion. Today there are 100,000 Jains in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McCourt, Frank. "God in America " in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' (December 1998); pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also tens of thousands of Jains located in the UK and Canada.

== Criticism ==
Contact of zealous missionaries with the uncontacted tribes has made some tribes and their culture extinct due to several factors, such as extinction from infections and even simple diseases such flu, [[Great Andamanese]] are exampleof such extinction.&lt;ref name=wiresen1&gt;Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar, [https://thewire.in/government/centre-ignored-scheduled-tribe-panel-recommendations-vulnerable-andaman-tribes Centre Ignored ST Panel Advice on Protecting Vulnerable Andaman Tribes], The Wire, 23 Nov 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wiresen2&gt;Navina Jafa, [https://thewire.in/health/jarawa-north-sentinel-andaman-tribes The Sentinelese and the Dilemma of Conservation Without Contact], The Wire, 2 Dec 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans contact with indigenous since 1492 has killed 100 million from the imported diseases to which tribes had no immunity.&lt;ref name=LeaveAlone1&gt;[http://time.com/3909470/tribes-uncontacted-ethics/ Is It Ethical to Leave Uncontacted Tribes Alone?], [[Time (magazine)]], 4 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Survival International]], a human rights organisation formed in 1969 which campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and uncontacted peoples, advocates the authorities to enforce their protection for the safety of both the tribe and outsiders.&lt;ref name=wiresen1&gt;Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar, [https://thewire.in/government/centre-ignored-scheduled-tribe-panel-recommendations-vulnerable-andaman-tribes Centre Ignored ST Panel Advice on Protecting Vulnerable Andaman Tribes], The Wire, 23 Nov 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain issues have brought criticism to missionary activity. This has included concerns that missionaries have a perceived lack of respect for other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=JSTOR|journal=Jstor.org|jstor = 1185603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential destruction of social structure among the converts has also been a concern. The [[Akha people]] of [[South East Asia]] are an example of those who believe that missionaries are only converting others for personal gain. The Akha people have complained the missionaries are more worried about building a church than building a clinic in a village that is very unhealthy. Many traditional values of the Akha have been lost as a result of these conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akha.org/content/commentary/theblackhand.html|title=The Black Hand - Missionaries and the Destruction of Akha Culture - Akha.org|work=akha.org|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huaorani people]] of Amazonian Ecuador have had a well-documented [[Operation Auca|mixed relation]] with [[Evangelical Christian]] missionaries and the contacts they brought to their communities, criticized by outsiders.

==Impact of missions==
A 2012 study by political scientist Robert Woodberry, focusing on Protestant missionaries, found that they have often left a very positive societal impact in the areas where they worked. "In cross-national statistical analysis Protestant missions are significantly and robustly associated with higher levels of printing, education, economic development, organizational civil society, protection of private property, and rule of law and with lower levels of corruption".&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Woodberry, “The Missionary Roots of Liberal Democracy.” [http://www.hillcountryinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/missionaryrootsofliberaldemocracy.pdf ''American Political Science Review'' (2012) 106#2: 244-274. online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that areas of colonial Mexico that had Mendicant missions have higher rates of literacy and educational attainment today than regions that did not have missions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldinger|first=Maria|date=July 2017|title=The long-run effects of missionary orders in Mexico|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438781630116X|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=127|pages=355–378|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.12.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas that had Jesuit missions are today indistinct from the areas that had no missions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study also found that "the share of Catholics is higher in regions where Catholic missions of any kind were a historical present."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2016 study found that regions in Sub-Saharan Africa that Protestant missionaries brought printing presses to are today "associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cagé|first=Julia|last2=Rueda|first2=Valeria|date=July 2016|title=The Long-Term Effects of the Printing Press in sub-Saharan Africa|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=69–99|doi=10.1257/app.20140379|issn=1945-7782|citeseerx=10.1.1.635.9580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/christian-missions-and-development-sub-saharan-africa|title=The devil is in the detail: Christian missions' heterogeneous effects on development in sub-Saharan Africa|last=Cagé|first=Julia|last2=Rueda|first2=Valeria|date=2017-03-04|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionaries have also made significant contributions to linguistics and the description and documentation of many languages. "Many languages today exist only in missionary records.  More than anywhere else, our knowledge of the native languages in South America has been the product of missionary activity… Without missionary documentation the reclamation [of several languages] would have been completely impossible"&lt;ref&gt;p. 223, 224.

'''Ngarrabullgan''' (also ''Njrrabulgan'', ''Nurrabullgan'', ''Ngarrabullgin'', or ''Nguddaboolgan''), officially named '''Mount Mulligan''' by the State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QPN|39750|Mount Mulligan|mountain|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a large tabletop [[mountain]] (18&amp;nbsp;km by 6.5&amp;nbsp;km) located 100&amp;nbsp;kilometres west of [[Cairns]] in the north of [[Queensland]] (Australia).&lt;br /&gt;

The tabletop mountain is a monolith bounded by high cliffs (or escarpments) that fall 200 to 400 m to the surrounding Hodgkinson Basin, making it an impressive natural monument which is regarded by the local Djungan Aboriginal peoples to be a sacred 'Dreaming' place (see [[Dreamtime]]), and features in the mythological legends and beliefs of other Aboriginal groups for hundreds of&amp;nbsp;kilometres around.&lt;ref name="BDavid01"&gt;DAVID, B. (2002) '''Landscapes, Rock-art and the Dreaming'''. Leicester University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the tabletop itself are found the two oldest-known Aboriginal sites in Queensland: Nonda Rock and Ngarrabullgan Cave.  Here Aboriginal cultural deposits have been [[radiocarbon]] dated, and dated by [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), back to 40,000+ years ago.&lt;ref&gt;DAVID, B; ROBERTS, R; TUNIZ, C; JONES, R; &amp; HEAD, J (1997) ''New Optical and Radiocarbon Dates from Ngarrabullgan Cave, a Pleistocene archaeological site in Australia: implications for the comparability of time clocks and for the human colinization of Australia''.  '''Antiquity'''.  Volume 71. Pg 183-188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DAVID, B.; ROBERTS, R.G.; MAGEE, J.; MIALANES, J.; TURNEY, C.; BIRD, M.; WHITE, C.; FIFIELD, L.K. &amp; TIBBY, J. (2007) ''Sediment Mixing at Nonda Rock: Investigations of Stratigraphic Integrity at an Early Archaeological Site in Northern Australia and Implications for the Human Colonisation of the Continent''. '''Journal of Quaternary Science''' Volume 22. Pg 449-479.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient Aboriginal rockshelter sites on the mountain have been dated to the end of the last [[Ice Age]], and, together, the many 'archaeological' caves and rockshelters found in and around Ngarrabullgan constitutes Queensland's greatest density of known sites dating back more than 4,000 years BP.&lt;ref name="BDavid01"/&gt;

The combination of impressive natural feature, Aboriginal beliefs and mythologies, and archaeological sites of such antiquity make Ngarrabullgan the oldest known and dated [[cultural landscape]] in Queensland, and a place of state, national and international interest and scientific significance.&lt;ref name="AHC01"&gt;{{cite AHD|100267 |accessdate=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomorphology==

[[Image:Ngarrabullgan006 02.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Ngarrabullgan from the north]]

The mountain was originally formed in a narrow faulted [[rift]] (running in a general south-east to north-west direction) within the deformed and folded [[metamorphic rock]] ([[arenite]]) of the Hodgkinson Basin.  Successive layers of sediment were deposited into this rift filling it first with [[Permian]] coal (at its base), then Permian conglomerates, with [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]]s above. With [[tectonic]] uplift the original arenite surrounding the deposits eroded away leaving Ngarrabullgan as a free-standing conglomerate and sandstone [[massif]].&lt;ref&gt;HALFPENNY, R.W; DONCHAK, P.J.T; &amp; HEGARTY, R.A (1987) ''Geology of the Hodgkinson Formation in the Mount Mulligan 1:100 Sheet Area''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"&gt;[[Roger Cribb|CRIBB,R]] (1993) ''Report to A.N.P.W.S and the Kuku Djungan Aboriginal Corporation on the Ngarrabullgan Heritage Survey Project: 21 May - 31 August 1993''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Ngarrabullgan Vegtn 0001.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Ngarrabullgan vegetation on top]]
The vegetation on the Ngarrabullgan tabletop (plateau) has been described as wet [[sclerophyll]] [[forest]]s, mainly of a [[bloodwood]] species of [[Eucalyptus]], with a well-developed understory.  These tabletop forests contrast, noticeably, with the open sclerophyll [[woodland]] of the surrounding hills and plains below.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Cribb|CRIBB, R]] (1990) ''Archaeology of Mount Mulligan: A Quick Reconnaissance''. Unpublished report to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of both Ngarrabullgan's eucalypt forests and its surrounding woodlands identified 13 distinct land units supporting:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Ngarrabullgan Vegtn 0002.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Ngarrabullgan vegetation below]]
'''Flora:'''   10 plant species that are considered either rare or threatened, including 8 plant species that are found nowhere else.&lt;ref name="DEW001"&gt;GILLIGAN, Brian (2007) ''The Indigenous Protected Area's Programme 2006 Evalutation''.  Report to the Commonwealth Department of Heritage and Water, Canberra. Page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fauna:'''   8 frog species, 55 reptile species, 99 bird species and 20 mammal species; 22 of which are species of special conservation significance under either the Queensland or Australian biodiversity conservation statutory regimes.&lt;ref name="DEW001"/&gt;

==Heritage status==

===Register of the National Estate===

The Australian Heritage Commission included Ngarrabullgan on its register of the National Estate on 24 June 1997, describing it as a place that holds:&lt;ref name="AHC01"/&gt;

[[Image:1990Cribb ML2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Rock art site on Ngarrabullgan]]

(a)  important evidence enhancing the Australian communities' knowledge of Aboriginal occupation of [[Pleistocene]] into the [[Holocene]];

(b) large diversity of well-preserved (intact) archaeological sites and features, some of which are directly associated with locally known initiation sites and places still sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples (both on top of the mountain and around the mountain's base);

(c)  strong potential to yield new and important information about Aboriginal occupation, use, beliefs and lifestyles from the Pleistocene down to the present (especially as new archaeological techniques are developed and combined with further, ongoing research and study);

(d)  excellent examples of the rock art and resource use of those Aboriginal peoples who have occupied and used the area for many generations and still, to this day, view the mountain as a major spiritual site at the heart of their country;

(e)  considerable aesthetic impact combining an impressive physical presence as a large natural monument, together with natural and cultural features valuable to the Djungan peoples, other Aboriginal peoples, the people of [[Mareeba]] Shire, the [[North Queensland]] region more generally, and Australia as a whole.

===Queensland Register of Aboriginal Heritage===

For similar reasons the Queensland Government formally registered Ngarrabullgan as "The Mount Mulligan Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Area" under its Aboriginal heritage legislation (''Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act'' 2006 (Qld)) in 2006.&lt;ref name="DNRW001"/&gt;

==History==

=== Hodgkinson River gold-rush ===

Prior to gold rushes and the associated occupation of the Hodgkinson River area, Ngarrabullgin was a place of some spiritual and ceremonial significance to the Djungan Aboriginal peoples&lt;ref name="AHC01"/&gt;

[[Ion Idriess]] in his far north Queensland gold prospecting story, wrote about Ngarrabullgan as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Farther out in those [[Chillagoe]] lands an outstanding landmark on the Hodgkinson is a massive wall of rock overlooking 'Mulligan's goldfield'. A meeting-place of the aborigines from time immemorial, it has seen the passing of a thousand tribes."''&lt;ref&gt;IDRIESS, Ion L. (1958) '''Back O' Cairns'''. Angus and Robertsson. Sydney: 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During and following the Hodgkinson River gold rush of 1876, the local Djungan population was decimated and the survivors were drawn to the fringes of mining settlements formed at [[Thornborough, Queensland|Thornborough]] and [[Mount Mulligan]].  The Djungan peoples tell of how their grandparents had to flee from police and settlers, and by climbing Ngarrabullgan's escarpments they could sometimes escape the horses (some Djungan remember a cave on the south of the mountain where many were massacred and hidden).&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

It was also during these times that townspeople within the Hodgkinson goldfields fearful of Aborigines first experimented with a policy of 'pacification'.  Local shop owner, John Byrnes, in 1882 brought a small group of Djungan peoples into town, feeding them meat and potatoes, and, soon, there were 150 Aborigines living in a camp just 8&amp;nbsp;km from Ngarrabullgan.&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

=== Mount Mulligan coal mining ===

By 1921 the Hodgkinson gold fields had declined, and a coal mine at [[Mount Mulligan]] had burrowed its way into the side of Ngarrabullgan, much to the fear of the Djungan Aboriginal peoples.  On 19 September 1921 there was a huge explosion killing 75 people in what turned out to be Queensland's worst mining disaster (see also [[Mount Mulligan mine disaster]]). To the Djungan people this was retribution for disturbing the sacred mountain in which dwelt a 'white horse' and the spirit Eekoo.&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

By 1990 the coal mine had long been closed (since 1957); the mining towns had all broken down and been deserted; and the cattle-properties were profitless, run down with rubber-vine, feral pigs and [[brumby|brumbies]]. Ngarrabullgan, however, still stood to become the focus of a Djungan Aboriginal people's 'cultural renaissance'.&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

=== Cultural Renaissance ===

==== 1986 ====
Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation (QTTC) staff, followed by Sir Frank Moore (QTTC Chairman) and the Queensland Minister for Tourism, visited Ngarrabullgan and Kondoparinga Station (the pastoral property within which Ngarrabullgan sits)to see if a small tourist resort should be built, and tourist enterprise developed within the vicinity of Ngarrabullgan, offering tourists an 'experience' of the mountain and surrounding heritage.&lt;ref name="WHITE001"&gt;WHITE, M &amp; HELBER, L (1988) Mount Mulligan Tourist Project. Report to the Queensland Travel and Tourist Corporation. Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1988 ====
Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation (QTTC) had prepared and costed the feasibility of developing the tourism potential of Ngarrabullgan, and, by this time there was some genuine commercial interest in purchasing Kondoparinga property and Ngarrabullgan to enable a corporation operating out of [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]] to offer tourists and visitors an exciting, authentic 'outback Queensland' experience. .&lt;ref name="WHITE001"/&gt;

====1990====
The person occupying Kondoparinga pastoral property and joint owner of the property (Mr Reg Adams) approached people then living in [[Mareeba]] expressing a strong wish to see Ngarrabullgan sold to the Djungan peoples who had enjoyed free access to his property for many years.  The other owner of the property, Skyfleet, wished to see the property sold to the Japanese owned consortium who were interested in developing the property's identified tourism potential.:&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

====1991====
[[Image:Narrabullgan002 0001.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Kuku Djungan people gather 27 July 1991]]
'''27 July:'''  over 150 Djungan people had travelled from Cairns, [[Yarrabah]], [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]], [[Townsville]], [[Chillagoe]] and [[Mareeba]], to re-unite and form the Kuku Djungan Aboriginal Corporation; to raise the pan-Australian Aboriginal flag; and to resolve to regain ownership of Ngarrabullgan.&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

'''August:''' the Australian Government (i.e. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission) approved the purchase of Kondoparinga property, and Ngarrabullgan, for the Djungan people.&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

'''December:''' Kondoparinga had been purchased, and the Djungan peoples had regained ownership of Ngarrabullgan.  Queensland Government's Department [[Image:Narrabullgan002 0002.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Kuku Djungan raise flag and resolve to regain ownership of Ngarrabullgan]]of Environment had sought to excise Ngarrabullgan from the property at the time of purchase, but, at the last moment,  a binding agreement was negotiated and agreed to see Ngrrabullgan remain part of the property and later declared a [[National Park]] to be managed by a majority Djungan board of management&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;

==== 2007 ====

'''November:'''
The Djungan people:

* have ownership of the mountain and developed management plans for its future protection and management;&lt;ref name="CRIBB002"/&gt;
* have registered the mountain with the Australian Heritage Commission to form part of Australia's 'National Estate'&lt;ref name="AHC01"/&gt;
* have nominated the mountain to be declared an Indigenous Protected Area under the Australian Government's protected area program&lt;ref name="DEW001"/&gt;
* have seen the mountain declared an 'Aboriginal cultural heritage area' under Queensland legislation.&lt;ref name="DNRW001"&gt;[http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/cultural_heritage/pdf/mountmulligan.pdf  PDF of Queensland Government Map of 'Mount Mulligan Cultural Heritage Area'].&lt;/ref&gt;
* are still seeking to see Ngarrabullgin declared a National Park with a majority Djungan board of management, as agreed back in December 1991.

Near '''Pak Ou ''' (mouth of the Ou river) the '''Tham Ting''' (lower cave) and the '''Tham Theung''' (upper cave) are caves overlooking the [[Mekong River]], 25 km to the north of [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]]. They are a group of two caves on the west side of the Mekong river, about two hours upstream from the centre of Luang Prabang, and have become well known by tourists. 

The caves are noted for their miniature Buddha sculptures. Hundreds of very small and mostly damaged wooden [[Buddhist]] figures are laid out over the wall shelves. They take many different positions, including meditation, teaching, peace, rain, and reclining (nirvana).

'''Pierrette Bloch''' (June 16, 1928 – July 7, 2017) was a Paris-born Swiss painter and textile artist.

==Early life==
Pierrette Bloch was born on June 16, 1928 in Paris. In 1939, Bloch and her parents left France for Switzerland to escape the war. At the age of 15, she began living on her own in a hotel, which she says helped foster very early on a complete sense of independence and autonomy. She began her professional artistic training at the end of the 1940s, taking courses in the plastic arts in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00020969?rskey=Mn27bF&amp;result=1 Benezit Artist Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bloch began exhibiting her works in Paris and the United States in the 1950s. The ensemble of her works have their roots in the use of  "poor" materials such as ink, paper, mesh, and horsehair. The last of these, horsehair, began appearing in her work in the 1970s, with her first sculpture using horsehair created in 1979, and have become one of the key symbols of her work. The corpus of her work thus spans mediums, including drawings, collages and three-dimensional pieces, and falls into the category of postwar abstraction. Her work has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

A monograph on Pierrette Bloch was published in November 2013 by Musée Jenisch.

==Death==
Bloch died on July 7, 2017 in Paris at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dagen|first1=Philippe|title=Mort de Pierrette Bloch, artiste d’une " inextinguible continuité "|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2017/07/08/mort-de-pierrette-bloch-artiste-d-une-inextinguible-continuite_5157830_1655012.html|accessdate=July 9, 2017|work=Le Monde|date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious behaviours''' are [[behavior|behaviours]] [[Motivation|motivated]] by [[religious belief]]s. Religious actions are also called '[[ritual]]' and religious avoidances are called [[taboo]]s or ritual prohibitions.

==Actions==
The two best known religious actions are [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]]. The most general religious action is prayer. It can be done quietly by a person all alone, but people can also pray in groups using songs. [[Sacrifice]] is also a widely spread religious action. Prayer and sacrifice often form the basis of other, more complicated religious actions like [[pilgrimage]], [[procession]]s, or consulting an [[oracle]]. Many rituals are connected to a certain purpose, like [[initiation]], [[ritual purification]] and preparation for an important happening or task. Among these are also the so-called rituals of transition, which occur at important moments of the human life cycle, like [[birth]], adulthood/[[marriage]], sickness and [[death]]. A special religious action is [[spirit possession]] and [[religious ecstasy]]. Religious specialists, such as [[priest]]s, [[vicar]]s, [[rabbi]]s, [[imam]]s and [[pandit]]s are involved in many religious actions.

==Avoidances==
{{see also|Taboo}}
A religious avoidance is when a person desists from something or from some action for religious reasons. It can be food or drink that one does not touch because of one's religion for some time ([[fasting|fast]]). This [[abstinence]] can also be for a longer time. Some people do not have sex ([[celibacy]]). Or one avoids contact with [[blood]], or dead animals. Well known examples are: [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s do not eat [[pork]]; the celibacy of [[Catholic]] priests; the purity rules of [[Hinduism]] and Judaism.

These avoidances, or 'taboos', are often about food and drink.
* speech; some words are forbidden ([[Profanity|cursing]])
* dying, death and [[mourning]]

Religious avoidances are often not easily recognisable as (part of) religious behaviour. When asked, the believers often do not motivate this kind of behaviour explicitly as religious but say the avoidance for health reasons, ethical reasons, or because it is hygienic.

==Academic study==
{{See also|Study of religion}}
Religious behaviour is seldom studied for itself. When it is given attention at all, it is usually studied as an illustration of the religious images, like in [[comparative religion]] and [[cultural anthropology]], or as part of the study of man in the social sciences.

[[File:Sandung 101014-7588 mp.JPG|thumb|right|Details of a sandung of Dayak Pesaguan people in [[Ketapang Regency]], [[West Kalimantan]]. Note a sculpture of a dragon above it.]]
'''Sandung''' or '''sandong''' is the [[ossuary]] of the [[Dayak people]] of [[South Kalimantan|South]] and [[Central Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. The sandung is an integral part of the [[Tiwah]] ceremony of the [[Ngaju people]], which is basically a secondary burial ritual where the bones of the deceased are taken from the cemeteries, purified and finally placed in a sandung.

==Form and types==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Geestenhuis bij Pangkoh aan de Kahajan-rivier versierd met vele beelden en schilderingen TMnr 10001020.jpg|thumb|left|A sandung in Central Kalimantan ca. 1915.]]
The sandung is a wooden [[ossuary]] shaped like a small house, with ornate roofs, windows, doors, and miniature stairs. Ideally a sandung is made of [[ironwood]], although today lighter wood of any kind of trees can also be used.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=59}} The house-shaped ossuary will actually be brought by the deceased to the paradise to become their house. Sandungs are painted in bright colors and decorated with carvings representing various religious symbols and patterns. The base of the sandung container is usually decorated with foliage pattern representing the mythical tree of life. Figures of man and woman painted on both side of the miniature door is said to represent a couple which would marry and produce children who will assist their parents in guarding the repository.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}} Other figures painted on the walls of the sandung represents different Ngaju deities from the [[Kaharingan]] folk religion.{{sfn|Waterson|1999|p=49}} Painting or carving of moon and stars is painted on the downriver side of the sandung, while painting of the sun is depicted on the upriver side; these astronomical landmarks are related with the journey that must be passed by the souls on their way to the Kaharingan paradise, the Lewa Liau.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}} The roof of a sandung is usually decorated with a type of wild chicken. This bird, known as the ''piak liau'', will become a possession for the deceased in the afterlife.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}}

Some sandung are built to contain the bones of a single individual, while others for fifty or more persons.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}} In general, the Dayak people of the [[Kahayan River|Kahayan region]] prefers large sandung capable of storing remains of many kin, assuring that they will form another household in the afterlife.{{sfn|Metcalf|Brookes|2014}}{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}} The Dayak of the [[Katingan Regency|Katingan region]] prefer smaller sandung. A sandung for an individual person (''sandung tunggal'', "single sandung") is usually build for persons who had died a "bad" or unnatural death, or other reasons which deemed the person remains is inappropriate to be interred with the bones of other family members.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}}

A sandung is normally set high above poles, although there are some sandung that is simply placed on ground (known as ''sandung munduk'').{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}} Some sandung reach the height of {{convert|20|ft|m}} while others at the height of only {{convert|4|ft|m}}. The poles supporting the sandung are often carved with ferocious faces, bulging eyes and protruding tongues. This figure represents the animate essence of the sandung (''ganan sandung'') which protects the inhabitant of the sandung from potential threats.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}}

There are many varieties and shapes of sandung, among those discovered in the villages of Ngaju people along the [[Kahayan River]] include:
*''Sandung buwuk'', a sandung made from a tree trunk and carved with a single opening. This type of sandung is very uncommon.
*''Sandung tunggal'', a sandung which stands on a single pole.
*''Kariring'' or ''sandung kariring'' is a long sandung supported by two poles.
*''Sandung keratun'' is a sandung supported on four poles.
*''Sandung samburup'' is a Chinese jar in a small, open-sided hut. An uncommon type of sandung.
*''Sandung munduk'' is a sandung built directly on the ground.
*''Sandung tingang'' is a brass container placed in an open-sided hut with a roof carved to resemble a hornbill.
*''Pambak'' resembles a stone or wooden crypt. Pambak is not buried, and sometimes valuables are placed in the crypt.

Unlike graves which is usually located some distance downriver away from the village, sandungs are located in the center of villages. Some sandungs are hundreds years old.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=61}} A collection of sandungs are kept in the [[Balanga Museum]], [[Palangkaraya]].{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=59}}

==Tiwah festival==
{{main article|Tiwah}}
The sandung is an integral part of the [[Tiwah]] dead festival. The Tiwah is the most important festival of the Ngaju people, where the soul of the dead is ensured safe journey to paradise. During the Tiwah ceremony, the bones of the dead are dug from the cemetery and carried back to the village. The bones will be purified, cleaned and anointed with oil and gold dust by their closest kin e.g. their children or their grandchildren. After the purification, the bones are carefully wrapped in cloth and placed in the sandung.{{sfn|Metcalf|Brookes|2014}}{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}}

==Modernity==
Since the mid-1960s, the increasing availability of cements means that cement ossuaries are becoming more popular. These are usually of ''sandung munduk'' type, the type of sandung which stands on ground. Fragments of tile and mirror are pressed into the drying cement to decorate it.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=60}} As more Dayak people adopt Christianity or Islam, sandung is becoming more rare. Many ancient sandung and [[sapundu]] (mortuary pole) are stolen because of its historic value.&lt;ref name="kapuas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kapuas.info/2013/02/bukan-sapundu-asli.html|publisher=kapuas.info|title=INFORMASI KAPUAS: Bukan Sapundu Asli|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Separation of church and state'''" is paraphrased from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the [[Establishment Clause]] and [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which reads: ''"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."''

The phrase "separation between church &amp; state" is generally traced to a [[s:Letter to the Danbury Baptists - January 1, 1802|January 1, 1802, letter]] by [[Thomas Jefferson]], addressed to the [[Danbury Baptists|Danbury Baptist Association]] in [[Connecticut]], and published in a Massachusetts newspaper. Jefferson wrote,

{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties."&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas. [https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists: The Final Letter, as Sent]. The Library of Congress Information Bulletin: June 1998. Lib. of Cong., June 1998. Web. Aug 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some argue that Jefferson echoes the language of the founder of the first [[Baptists|Baptist]] church in America, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] who, in 1644, wrote of

{{quote|[A] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world.}}

However, when considered in context, the relationship appears questionable.

{{quote|When they [the Church] have opened a gap in the hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world, God hath ever broke down the wall itself, removed the Candlestick, etc., and made His Garden a wilderness as it is this day. And that therefore if He will ever please to restore His garden and Paradise again, it must of necessity be walled in peculiarly unto Himself from the world, and all that be saved out of the world are to be transplanted out of the wilderness of the World. &lt;ref&gt;Church State Council[http://www.churchstate.org/index.php?id=166]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

[[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] also specifies that "[[No Religious Test Clause|no religious Test shall ever be required]] as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."

Jefferson's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]]. In ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1879) the Court wrote that Jefferson's comments "may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment." In ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote: "In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state."&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson's Danbury letter has been cited favorably by the Supreme Court several times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to separationism, the Supreme Court in ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' upheld [[accommodationism]], holding that the nation's "institutions presuppose a Supreme Being" and that government recognition of God does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.&lt;ref name="WaldCalhoun-Brown2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and Politics in the United States|last1=Wald|first1=Kenneth D.|last2=Calhoun-Brown|first2=Allison|date=16 August 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=|isbn=9781442201538|location=|pages=80–85|language=English|quote=&lt;!-- Please do not remove or change this Copyvio message until the issue is settled --&gt;{{Nobots}}{{Copyvio/core|url=Excessive quote|month = October|day = 1|year = 2018|time = 07:05|timestamp = 20181001070512}}&lt;!-- Do not use the "Copyvio/core" template directly; the above line is generated by "subst:Copyvio|url" --&gt; The clarion call for accommodation was sounded by Justice William O. Douglas in 1952: We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. ... The accommodationist perspective emphasizes rather that the First Amendment was clearly not intended to be antireligious--indeed, as already suggested, it was drafted precisely to protect the various religious practices of the states, including preferential establishments in some of them. Accomodationists therefore reinterpret the First Amendment to make of religious liberty a positive right, the exercise of which is to be encouraged by the government. By the same token, they believe that the First Amendment excludes only the direct establishment of, or preferential treatment for, a particular religion. Indeed, government should facilitate the practice of religion by both individuals and collectivities as essential to the common good. This position is very different from that of the separationists and leads to markedly different contemporary policies and practices. In addition, as the point of departure for historical interpretation, it focuses attention upon the residual religious quality of this founding period, which was hardly secularist. The same Congress that proposed the First Amendment was opened with prayer and named a chaplain. Indeed, most of the early presidents declared occasional days of thanksgiving--and even of humiliation. Provision was made for support of religion in western lands. And, in time, the resources of religious groups were utilized in making government policy for relations with Native Americans. In sum, accommodationists consider that the operative ideal of the early republic was a nonpreferentialist posture of support for religion on the part of the government. In turn, that seems to point toward a modern ideal of accommodation of government to religin in ways that secure the greater common civil good as well as serve the spiritual ends of numbers of citizens.&lt;/div&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite book|title=ABA Journal Sep 1962|quote=Much more recently, in 1952, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in ''Zorach v. Clauson'', 343 U.S. 306, 313, the Supreme Court repeated the same sentiments, saying: We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Mr. Justice Brewer in the ''Holy Trinity'' case, ''supra'', mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the ''Zorach'' case referred to&amp;nbsp;... [P]rayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamation making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; "So help me God" in our courtroom oaths – these and&amp;nbsp;... other references to the Almighty&amp;nbsp;... run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies&amp;nbsp;... the supplication with which the Court opens each session: "God save the United States and this Honorable Court" (312–313). To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the "Pray for Peace" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of ''America'' which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words "in God is our trust" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words "under God".}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Court has not always interpreted the constitutional principle as absolute, and the proper extent of separation between government and religion in the U.S. remains an ongoing subject of impassioned debate.&lt;ref&gt;''See Lynch v. Donnelly'', 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984) ("The concept of a 'wall' of separation is a useful figure of speech probably deriving from views of Thomas Jefferson. ... [b]ut the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state.")[http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/668/case.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist'', 413 U.S. 756, 760 (1973) ("Yet, despite Madison's admonition and the 'sweep of the absolute prohibitions' of the Clauses, this Nation's history has not been one of entirely sanitized separation between Church and State. It has never been thought either possible or desirable to enforce a regime of total separation.")[http://supreme.justia.com/us/413/756/case.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 312 (U.S. 1952) ("The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lemon v. Kurtzman'', 403 U.S. 602 (1971) ("Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Many early [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant groups traveled to America]] to worship freely, particularly after the [[English Civil War]] and religious conflict in [[France]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cousins' Wars'', Kevin Phillips, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]] like the [[Puritan]]s, who were Protestant [[Christian]]s fleeing [[religious persecution]] from the Anglican King of England. Despite a common background, the groups' views on [[religious toleration]] were mixed.  While some such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]] and [[William Penn]] of [[Pennsylvania]] ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others like the [[Plymouth Colony]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] had established churches. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] established the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse. Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons: the established Church was responsible for [[poor relief]], putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage. 

===Former state churches in British North America===

====Catholic colonies====
* When [[New France]] was transferred to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the [[Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by French authorities.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions "low-church" dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] came to the English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701 the Church of England was "established" in Maryland, and in the course of the eighteenth century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, and then disenfranchised. Not all of the laws passed against Catholic (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.
* [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to [[Great Britain]] in 1763. The British divided Florida into two colonies. Both East and West Florida had a policy of toleration for Catholic residents.

====Protestant colonies====
* [[Plymouth Colony]] was founded by [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], [[English Dissenters]] or Separatists, Calvinists.
* [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], [[New Haven Colony]], and the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by Puritan, Calvinist, Protestants.
* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] were officially [[Church of England]].

====Colonies with no established church====
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* [[West Jersey]], also founded by [[Quakers]], prohibited any establishment.
* [[Delaware Colony]].
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens.

{{Note|Disestablishment|Note 1:}}
In several colonies, the establishment ceased to exist in practice at the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], about 1776;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rights of the People: Individual freedom and the Bill of Rights |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/rightsof/roots.htm |date=December 2003 |publisher=US State Department |accessdate=2007-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603161945/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/rightsof/roots.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is the date of permanent legal abolition.

{{Note|GA|Note 2:}}
in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows:
"Article IV. Section 10. No person within this state shall, upon any pretense, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience, nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rate, for the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or hath voluntarily engaged to do. No one religious society shall ever be established in this state, in preference to another; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles."

{{Note|MA|Note 3:}}
From 1780 Massachusetts had a system which required every man to belong to a church, and permitted each church to tax its members, but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular denomination. This was objected to, as in practice establishing the Congregational Church, the majority denomination, and was abolished in 1833.

{{Note|NH|Note 4:}}
Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of the State legislature to be of the Protestant religion.

{{Note|NC|Note 5:}}
The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church, but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office. From 1835 to 1876 it allowed only Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI, Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/article_vi.htm Article VI of the North Carolina state constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Such clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of [[Torcaso v. Watkins]], when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendment protections.

{{Note|WFL|Note 6:}}
Religious tolerance for Catholics with an established Church of England was policy in the former Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida while under British rule.

{{Note|EWFL|Note 7:}}
In [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British ceded both East and West Florida back to Spain (see [[Spanish Florida]]).

{{Note|VA|Note 8:}}
Tithes for the support of the Anglican Church in Virginia were suspended in 1776, and never restored. 1786 is the date of the [[Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom]], which prohibited any coercion to support any religious body.

===Colonial views on establishment, accommodationism, and separationism===
The [[Library of Congress]] states that:
{{quotation|Many states were as explicit about the need for a thriving religion as Congress was in its thanksgiving and fast day proclamations. The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 declared, for example, that "the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend on piety, religion and morality." The states were in a stronger position to act upon this conviction because they were considered to possess "general" powers as opposed to the limited, specifically enumerated powers of Congress. Congregationalists and Anglicans who, before 1776, had received public financial support, called their state benefactors "nursing fathers" (Isaiah 49:23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel05.html|title=Religion and the Founding of the American Republic: Religion and the State Governments|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Flushing Remonstrance]] shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century, stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort: "The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks and Egyptians, as they are considered sons of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, so love, peace and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war and bondage."  The document was signed December 27, 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by [[persecution]] of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of [[New Netherland]], [[Peter Stuyvesant]].  Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] from being practiced in the colony, in accordance with the laws of the [[Dutch Republic]]. The signers indicated their "desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged, neither to condemn least we be condemned, but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyym.org/flushing/remons.html "Remonstrance of the Inhabitants of the Town of Flushing to Governor Stuyvesant"], Dec 27, 1657.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted.  However, [[John Bowne]] allowed the Quakers to meet in his home.  Bowne was arrested, jailed, and sent to the [[Netherlands]] for trial; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne.

[[New York Historical Society]] President and Columbia University Professor of History [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] describes the Flushing Remonstrance as "the first thing that we have in writing in the United States where a group of citizens attests on paper and over their signature the right of the people to follow their own conscience with regard to God - and the inability of government, or the illegality of government, to interfere with that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/22/sunday/main3641753.shtml "Drawing the Line Between Church and State"], CBS News, Dec 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the wide diversity of opinion on Christian theological matters in the newly independent American States, the [[Philadelphia convention|Constitutional Convention]] believed a government sanctioned ([[Establishment of religion|established]]) religion would disrupt rather than bind the newly formed union together. [[George Washington]] wrote a letter in 1790 to the country's first [[Jewish]] congregation, the [[Touro Synagogue]] in Newport, [[Rhode Island]] to state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allowing rights and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it were by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm006.html| title=To Bigotry No Sanction| author=Library of Congress| work=American Treasures of the Library of Congress| accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level.  In 1773, [[Isaac Backus]], a prominent Baptist minister in [[New England]], wrote against a state-sanctioned religion, saying: "Now who can hear Christ declare, that his kingdom is, not of this world, and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him?"  He also observed that when "church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued."  [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s influential [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] was enacted in 1786, five years before the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

Most Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans, were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. The Anglican establishment, where it had existed, largely ceased to function during the [[American Revolution]], though the new States did not formally abolish and replace it until some years after the Revolution.

===Jefferson, Madison, and the "wall of separation"===
The phrase "[A] hedge or ''wall of separation'' between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world" was first used by Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], the founder of the colony of [[Rhode Island]], in his 1644 book  ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Cotton's Letter Lately Printed, Examined and Answered," ''The Complete Writings of Roger Williams'', Volume 1, page 108 (1644).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 24 ("Williams's metaphor was rediscovered by Isaac Backus, a New England Baptist of Jefferson's generation, who believed, like Williams, that an established church—which he considered to exist in the Massachusetts of his day—would never protect religious dissenters like himself and must be opposed in order to keep religion pure.")&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase was later used by [[Thomas Jefferson]] as a description of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter&lt;ref&gt;
''To Messrs. Nehemiah Dodge and Others, a Committee of the Danbury Baptist Association, in the State of Connecticut''. January 1, 1802. Full text [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_dba.html available online].
&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state|Danbury Baptists]] (a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the [[Congregational church|Congregationalist church]] in [[Connecticut]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their "legislature" should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a ''wall of separation'' between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson's letter was in reply to a letter from the Danbury Baptist Association dated October 7, 1801.&lt;ref&gt;''Danbury Baptist Association's letter to Thomas Jefferson'', October 7, 1801. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/dba_jefferson.html Full text available online].
&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1808 letter to Virginia Baptists, Jefferson used the same theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have solved, by fair experiment, the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson and [[James Madison]]'s conceptions of ''separation'' have long been debated.  Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Letters of the Governors of the State of Virginia'' (Virginia State Library, 1928), Vol. II, pp. 64–66, November 11, 1779.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee v. Weisman]], 505 U.S. 577 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring)("President Jefferson, for example, steadfastly refused to issue Thanksgiving proclamations of any kind, in part because he thought they violated the Religion Clauses.")&lt;/ref&gt; Madison issued four religious proclamations while President,&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. Richardson]], ''[[A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents]]'' (Washington: Bureau of National Literature, 1897), Vol. II, pp. 498, 517–518, 543, 545–546.&lt;/ref&gt; but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnetworks.net/~ggarman/madison.html James Madison's veto messages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203011234/http://www.sunnetworks.net/~ggarman/madison.html |date=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html Religion and the Founding of the American Republic]; [[Library of Congress]] exhibit website. Retrieved 2007-02-07&lt;/ref&gt; Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended "Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments]&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of "total separation of the church from the state."&lt;ref&gt;(March 2, 1819 letter to [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]]), {{Cite book|last=Lambert|first=Frank|title=The founding fathers and the place of religion in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC&amp;pg=PA288 288]|isbn=978-0-691-08829-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; " "Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States," Madison wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm|title=Monopolies Perpetuities Corporations—Ecclesiastical Endowments|author=James Madison|publisher=constitution.org|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he declared, "practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;(1811 letter to Baptist Churches)&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Edward Livingston]] Madison further expanded, "We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachandteach.com/content/article.php?story=20030829111914471 Madison's letter to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822]&lt;/ref&gt; Madison's original draft of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] had included provisions binding the States, as well as the Federal Government, from an establishment of religion, but the House did not pass them.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature.&lt;ref&gt;See Morison and Commager, vol I&lt;/ref&gt; In setting up the [[University of Virginia]], Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-singleauthor?specfile=/web/data/jefferson/texts/jefall.o2w&amp;act=text&amp;offset=7021548&amp;textreg=1&amp;query=professorship+of+Divinity Jefferson's letter to Thomas Cooper, November 2, 1822]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this arrangement was "fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;"&lt;ref&gt;Dumas Malone, ''Jefferson and His Times'', 6, 393&lt;/ref&gt; however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the university would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley M. Bell, "God Save this Honorable Court": How Current Establishment Clause Jurisprudence can be Reconciled with the Secularization of Historical Religious Expressions, 50 ''Am. U.L. Rev.'' 1273, 1282 n.49 (2001) [http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/50/bell.pdf?rd=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, such as [[Mark David Hall]], attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark David. "Jeffersonian Walls and Madisonian Lines: The Supreme Court's Use of History in Religion Clause Cases." ''Oregon Law Review'' 85 (2006), 563–614&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case ''[[Reynolds v. U.S.]]'', in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison, seeking a legal definition for the word ''religion''. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]] cited Jefferson's "Letter to the Danbury Baptists" to state that "Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=98&amp;invol=145 Reynolds v. U.S.], 98 U.S. 145 (1878)&lt;/ref&gt;
Considering this, the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional.

===Patrick Henry, Massachusetts, and Connecticut===
Jefferson and Madison's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century. Jefferson's [[Statute of Religious Freedom]] was drafted in opposition to a bill, chiefly supported by [[Patrick Henry]], which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination, but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it. Similarly, the [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] originally provided that "no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience... provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship" (Article II), but also that:

{{quote|the people of this commonwealth have a right to invest their legislature with power to authorize and require, and the legislature shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion, and morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily.

And the people of this commonwealth have also a right to, and do, invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon all the subjects an attendance upon the instructions of the public teachers aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on whose instructions they can conscientiously and conveniently attend. (Article III)}}

Since, in practice, this meant that the decision of who was taxable for a particular religion rested in the hands of the [[selectmen]], usually Congregationalists, this system was open to abuse. It was abolished in 1833.  The intervening period is sometimes referred to as an "establishment of religion" in Massachusetts.

The [[James II of England|Duke of York]] had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support ''some'' church, but this was more often [[Dutch Reformed]], [[Quaker]], or [[Presbyterian]], than [[Anglican]].  Some chose to support more than one church. He also ordained that the tax-payers were free, having paid his local tax, to choose their own church. The terms for the surrender of [[New Amsterdam]] had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience, and the Duke, as an openly divine-right Catholic, was no friend of Anglicanism. The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698, though Anglicanism was more popular in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of New Jersey''; ed., William Starr Myers (1945) Vol. II, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] had a real establishment of religion. Its citizens did not adopt a constitution at the Revolution, but rather amended their Charter to remove all references to the British Government. As a result, the Congregational Church continued to be established, and [[Yale College]], at that time a Congregational institution, received grants from the State until Connecticut adopted a constitution in 1818 partly because of this issue.

===Test acts===
The absence of an establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a [[Test Act]], and several states retained them for a short time.  This stood in contrast to the Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.

For example, the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1776]] provides liberty of conscience in much the same language as Massachusetts (similarly forbidding payment of "taxes, tithes or other payments" contrary to conscience). It then provides:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That there shall be ''no establishment'' of any one religious sect in this Province, in preference to another; and that ''no Protestant inhabitant'' of this Colony shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil right, merely on account of his religious principles; but that all persons, professing a belief in the faith of ''any Protestant sect'', who shall demean themselves peaceably under the government, as hereby established, shall be capable of being elected into any office of profit or trust, or being a member of either branch of the Legislature, and shall fully and freely enjoy every privilege and immunity, enjoyed by others their fellow subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Article XIX, italics added.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This would permit a [[Test Act]], but did not require one.

The original charter of the [[Province of East Jersey]] had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic, and the proprietors of [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] were Scottish Catholic peers. The [[Province of West Jersey]] had declared, in 1681, that there should be no religious test for office.  An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the [[French and Indian War]] requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope, which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution.  That law was replaced by 1799.

The [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]] provided:

{{quote|And each member, before he takes his seat, shall make and subscribe the following declaration, viz:

I do believe in one God, the creator and governor of the universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked. And I do acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by Divine inspiration.

And no further or other religious test shall ever hereafter be required of any civil officer or magistrate in this State.}}

Again, it provided in general that all tax-paying freemen and their sons shall be able to ''vote'', and that no "man, ''who acknowledges the being of a God'', be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship."

==The U.S. Constitution==

===Article 6===
[[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] provides that "no [[religious test|religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States".  Prior to the adoption of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], this was the only mention of religion in the Constitution.

===The First Amendment===
The first amendment to the US Constitution states "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" The two parts, known as the "establishment clause" and the "free exercise clause" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the "separation of church and state" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paschal|first=George|title=The Constitution of the United States Defined and Carefully Annotated|publisher=W.H.&amp; O.H.

In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boston|first1=Rob|title=A Delicate Balance|journal=Conscience|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=12–16|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1039541028|accessdate=2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Congress' deliberations show that its understanding of the separation of church and state differed sharply from that of their contemporaries in Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} As 19th century Union Theological Seminary historian [[Philip Schaff]] observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The American separation of church and state rests upon respect for the church; the [European anticlerical] separation, on indifference and hatred of the church, and of religion itself... The constitution did not create a nation, nor its religion and institutions. It found them already existing, and was framed for the purpose of protecting them under a republican form of government, in a rule of the people, by the people, and for the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaff |first1=Philip |title=Church and State in The United States: The American Idea of Religious Liberty and its Practical Effects |date=1888 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=978-1-55635-707-7 |edition=Reprint 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An August 15, 1789 entry in Madison's papers indicates he intended for the establishment clause to prevent the government imposition of religious beliefs on individuals. The entry says: "Mr. Madison said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience. ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions53.html The Founders' Constitution] Volume 5, Amendment I (Religion), Document 53. The University of Chicago Press. Retrieved 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], theorize that Madison's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a "national religion"—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general "religion" in an effort to appease the [[Anti-Federalists]]. To both the Anti-Federalists and the [[Federalists]], the very word "national" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1407840|title = Forgotten Purposes of the First Amendment Religion Clauses|journal = The Review of Politics|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 340–367|last1 = Glenn|first1 = Gary D.|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. [[Elbridge Gerry]] of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national government, or a federal government]] (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.

Following the argument between Madison and Gerry, Rep. [[Samuel Livermore]] of New Hampshire proposed language stating that, "Congress shall make no laws touching religion or the rights of conscience." This raised an uproar from members, such as Rep. Benjamin Huntingdon of Connecticut and Rep. Peter Sylvester of New York, who worried the language could be used to harm religious practice.

Others, such as Rep. [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut, believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress [[enumerated powers|stated powers]], which did not include establishing a national religion.
Anti-Federalists such as Rep. [[Thomas Tudor Tucker|Thomas Tucker]] of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions. However, the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment.

The Senate went through several more narrowly targeted versions before reaching the contemporary language. One version read, "Congress shall make no law establishing one religious sect or society in preference to others, nor shall freedom of conscience be infringed," while another read, "Congress shall make no law establishing one particular religious denomination in preference to others." Ultimately, the Senate rejected the more narrowly targeted language.

At the time of the passage of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], many states acted in ways that would now be held unconstitutional. All of the early official state churches were disestablished by 1833 (Massachusetts), including the Congregationalist establishment in [[Connecticut]]. It is commonly accepted that, under the doctrine of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Incorporation]]—which uses the [[Due Process#Due process in the United States|Due Process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to hold the Bill of Rights applicable to the states—these state churches could not be reestablished today.

Yet the provisions of state constitutions protected religious liberty, particularly the so-called freedom of conscience. During the nineteenth century (and before the incorporation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution through the Fourteenth Amendment), litigants turned to these provisions to challenge Sunday laws ([[blue law]]s), bible-reading in schools, and other ostensibly religious regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle G. Volk, ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy'' (Oxford University Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Sehat]], professor of American Intellectual and Cultural History at [[Georgia State University]], writes that:
{{quotation|But when the First Amendment was ratified in 1791, it did not apply to the states and would not until well into the 20th century. As a result, the First Amendment did not prevent states from paying churches out of the public treasury, as Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut and South Carolina did when that amendment was written. And those states that did not fund churches still favored Christianity. Blasphemy was forbidden in Delaware in 1826, and officeholders in Pennsylvania had to swear that they believed in “the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments.” American federalism gave states enormous power to regulate the health, welfare and morals of their citizens. Because many thought religion was the foundation of American society, they used their power to imprint their moral ideals on state constitutions and judicial opinions for much of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sehat |first1=David |title=Five myths about church and state in America |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/five-myths-about-church-and-state-in-america/2011/04/21/AF2SlBQE_story.html |date=April 22, 2011 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The 14th Amendment===
{{see also|Cantwell v. Connecticut}}
The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (Amendment XIV) is one of the post-Civil War amendments, intended to secure rights for former slaves. It includes the [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] clauses among others. The amendment introduces the concept of [[incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] of all relevant federal rights against the states. While it has not been fully implemented, the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure, through the Due Process Clause and [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]], the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states.

The incorporation of the First Amendment [[establishment clause]] in the landmark case of ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' has affected the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Although upholding the state law in that case, which provided for public busing to private religious schools, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments. A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was ''[[Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet]]'' (1994).

===The "Separation" principle and the Supreme Court===
Jefferson's concept of "separation of church and state" first became a part of Establishment Clause [[jurisprudence]] in ''[[Reynolds v. U.S.]]'', 98 U.S. 145 (1878).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=98&amp;invol=145 REYNOLDS v. U.S., 98 U.S. 145 (1878) 98 U.S. 145]&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US, determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom, "The word 'religion' is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted." The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. Quoting the "separation" paragraph from Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, the court concluded that, "coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured."

The centrality of the "separation" concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools. This was the first case in which the court applied the [[Establishment Clause]] to the laws of a state, having interpreted the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] as applying the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to the states as well as the federal legislature. Citing Jefferson, the court concluded that "The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach."

While the decision (with four dissents) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools, the majority opinion (by Justice [[Hugo Black]]) and the dissenting opinions (by Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]] and Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a "wall between church and state" or a "separation of Church from State": their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall. Rutledge, on behalf of the four dissenting justices, took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case: "Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment, now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth." Writing separately, Justice Jackson argued that "[T]here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation. In fact, the undertones of the opinion, advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State, seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters."

In 1962, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] addressed the issue of officially sponsored [[prayer]] or religious recitations in public schools. In ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'', 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court, by a vote of 6-1, determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation. (The prayer required by the [[New York State]] [[Board of Regents]] prior to the Court's decision consisted of: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country. Amen.") As the Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The petitioners contend, among other things, that the state laws requiring or permitting use of the Regents' prayer must be struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs. For this reason, petitioners argue, the State's use of the Regents' prayer in its public school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church and State. We agree with that contention, since we think that the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that, in this country, it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court noted that it "is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=370&amp;page=421#422 Engel v. Vitale]'', 370 U.S. 421 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The lone dissenter, Justice [[Potter Stewart]], objected to the court's embrace of the "wall of separation" metaphor: "I think that the Court's task, in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication, is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the "wall of separation," a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution."

In ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'', 393 U.S. 97 (1968), the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime "to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals," or "to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches" this theory in any school or university that received public funds. The court's opinion, written by Justice [[Abe Fortas]], ruled that the Arkansas law violated "the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The overriding fact is that Arkansas' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group." The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion, and that "[T]he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them." &lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=393&amp;page=97 EPPERSON v.

In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause. The court's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute: "Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable," the court wrote. "Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a 'wall', is a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship."

Subsequent to this decision, the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the "[[Lemon Test]]". First, the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute or policy must not result in an "excessive entanglement" of government with religion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', 403 U.S. 602, 612–613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; (The decision in ''Lemon v. Kurtzman'' hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools, and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church's religious mission, thus the policy involved the state in an "excessive entanglement" with religion.) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause.

In 2002, a three judge panel on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional, even when students were not compelled to recite it, due to the inclusion of the phrase "under God." In reaction to the case, ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge, and condemning the panel's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_story/0,3566,56322,00.html Senate Pledges Allegiance Under God]. Fox News, Thursday, June 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004, solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue. Rather, a five-justice majority held that Newdow, a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter, lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]] to sue.

When the [[Louisiana]] state legislature passed a law requiring [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] biology teachers to give [[Creationism]] and [[Evolution]] equal time in the classroom, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it was intended to advance a particular religion, and did not serve the secular purpose of improved scientific education.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|482|578|Text of opinion in [[Edwards v.

==Early treaties and court decisions==

===The Treaty of Paris===
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}

In 1783, the United States signed a treaty with [[Great Britain]] that was promulgated "in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity".&lt;ref name="BrittkerIdlemanRavitch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bittker |first1=Boris I. |last2=Idleman |first2=Scott C. |last3=Ravitch |first3=Frank S. |title=Religion and the State in American Law |date=2015 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107071827 |page=2 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It credited "'Divine Providence' with having disposed the two parties to 'forget all past misunderstandings,' and is dated 'in the year of our Lord' 1783."&lt;ref name="BrittkerIdlemanRavitch"/&gt;

===The Treaty of Tripoli===
{{Main|Treaty of Tripoli}}

In 1797, the [[United States Senate]] ratified a treaty with [[Tripoli]] that stated in Article 11:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian Anson Phelps Stokes' noted that "those who wished to deny that the United States as a government has any special regard for the Christian religion...[have ] almost invariably failed to call attention to the fact that the treaty was superseded, less than a decade later, by another 'Treaty of Peace and Amity,' signed in Tripoli June 4, 1805, in which the clause in question...is omitted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokes|first=Anson Phelps|title=Church and State in the United States|year=1950|publisher=Harper and Brothers Publishers|location=New York|pages=1:498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States===
{{Main|Church of the Holy Trinity v. United_States#Christian_nation}}

In the 1892 case ''[[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]]'', Supreme Court Justice [[Justice David Brewer|David Brewer]] wrote for a unanimous Court that "no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation."&lt;ref name="Finkelman2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Religion and American Law: An Encyclopedia |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136919565 |page=76 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal historian [[Paul Finkelman]] writes that: {{quotation|Brewer, the son of a Congregationalist missionary to Asia Minor, quoted several colonial charters, state constitutions, and court decisions that referred to the importance of Christian belief in the affairs of the American people; cited the practice of various legislative bodies of beginning their sessions with prayer, and noted the large number of churches and Christian charitable organizations that exist in every community in the country as evidence that this is a Christian nation. In doing so, Brewer expressed the prevailing nineteenth-century Protestant view that America is a Christian nation.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2003"/&gt;}}

==Interpretive controversies==
{{main|Accommodationism}}
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of "separation of church and state", or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Whelan, [http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2Y4ZmY0MzI1ZjRjNDg4NTQ0ZDc0NGE1MjdmYWRhMDA= This Week in Liberal Judicial Activism—Week of February 5], ''[[National Review|National Review Online]]''. February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution, while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified. These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers. Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], which references the idea of a "Creator" and "Nature's God", though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a "Creator" or "Nature's God."

The issue is complex, however, as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868, at which point the first amendment's application to the state government was recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas White|title=First Freedom: The Baptist Perspective on Religious Liberty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4esKOiTWGQC|year=2007|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-4387-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U4esKOiTWGQC&amp;pg=PA107 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of [[originalism]] versus modern, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivist]] theories such as the doctrine of the [[Living Constitution]]. Other debates center on the principle of the [[law of the land]] in America being defined not just by the Constitution's [[Supremacy Clause]], but also by legal [[precedent|precedence]], making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era, and rendering the concept of [[historical revisionism]] irrelevant when discussing the Constitution.
[[File:10commandmentsAustinMN.JPG|thumb|left|Ten commandments monument at a Minnesota courthouse.]]
The "religious test" clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones, career [[civil servant]]s as well as [[politics|political]] appointees. Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution. Seven states, however, have language included in their Bill of Rights or Declaration of Rights, or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs, though some of these have been successfully challenged in court. These states are Texas, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm| title=Religious discrimination in state constitutions| publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org| accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments. ([[Tennessee Constitution]] Article IX, Section 2 is one such example.) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words "so help me God." In some cases these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court. At one time, such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of [[states' rights]]; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment, as applied to the states via the 14th amendment, and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable.

Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches, the tax-free status of church property, the fact that [[Christmas]] is a federal holiday, etc., have also been questioned, but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society. The national motto "[[In God We Trust]]" has been challenged as a violation, but the Supreme Court has ruled that [[ceremonial deism]] is not religious in nature. A circuit court ruling affirmed [[Ohio]]'s right to use as its motto a passage from the [[Bible]], "[[With God, all things are possible]]", because it displayed no preference for a particular religion.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and The Rev. Matthew Peterson v. Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Board|vol=243|reporter=F.3d|opinion=289|court=6th Cir.|date=2001|url=http://openjurist.org/243/f3d/289/american-civil-liberties-union-of-ohio-and-the-reverend-matthew-peterson-v-capitol-square-review-and|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries and Ryan (2001) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court. The central point, they argue, was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools, followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education. Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause.

Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion. Most important was "the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life," which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Critics of the modern concept of the "separation of church and state" argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it. [[Philip Hamburger]], [[Columbia Law]] school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept, maintains that the modern concept, which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence, is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and [[Nativism (politics)|Nativism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2008}} Briefs before the Supreme Court, including by the U.S. government, have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ([[Blaine Amendments]]) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;''LOCKE V. DAVEY'' 540 U.S. 712 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Brent Walker]], Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee, responded to Hamburger's claims noting; "The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle. Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture. Of course, separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools. But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/043/Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State%20Philip%20Hamburger%20Reviewed%20By%20J.%20Brent%20Walker_043_14_.htm Book Review: Separation of Church and State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Waldman notes that; "The evangelicals provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson, not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart." Frank Lambert wrote 
"Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners. New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and [[John Leland (Baptist)|John Leland]] joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lambert, ''The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Waldman [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0604.waldman.html The Framers and the Faithful: How modern evangelicals are ignoring their own history.] ''Washington Monthly'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Charles C. Haynes noted in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that:
{{quotation|For James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and other early supporters of church-state separation, authentic religious liberty requires that government remain neutral toward religion while simultaneously upholding the right of religious people and institutions to participate fully in the public square of America. Ignoring the role of religion ... is hardly “neutral.” On the contrary, such exclusion sends a message of government hostility to the religious. The First Amendment does not guarantee atheists or anyone else “freedom from religion.” Frequent exposure to religious symbols and messages is inevitable in our religiously diverse society. The First Amendment does, however, guarantee “freedom from government-imposed religion” – a core condition of liberty of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haynes |first1=Charles C. |title=Judge: Atheist group takes separation of church and state too far on ‘Ground Zero Cross’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/judge-atheist-group-takes-separation-of-church-and-state-too-far-on-ground-zero-cross/2013/04/07/9551c8be-9fb3-11e2-9c03-6952ff305f35_story.html |date=April 7, 2013 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Politics and religion in the United States===
[[Robert N. Bellah]] has written that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term "[[Civil Religion]]" to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of [[John F. Kennedy]]: "Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word 'God' at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert Neelly|last=Bellah|date=Winter 1967|title=Civil Religion in America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=96|issue=1|pages=1–21|url=http://www.robertbellah.com/articles_5.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306124338/http://www.robertbellah.com/articles_5.htm |archivedate=2005-03-06}} From the issue entitled ''Religion in America.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert S. Wood]] has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state, allowing a variety of religions to flourish.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{citation |first= Molly |last= Farmer |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705381148/US-is-model-of-how-variety-of-religions-can-flourish.html?pg=all |title= U.S. is a model of how variety of religions can flourish |newspaper= Deseret News |date= June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions, Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a "remarkable religiosity" in the United States that isn't present in other industrialized nations.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt; Wood believes that the U.S. operates on "a sort of civic religion," which includes a generally shared belief in a creator who "expects better of us." Beyond that, individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience. He calls this approach the "genius of religious sentiment in the United States."&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

{{Shinto}}
A {{nihongo|'''Shinto shrine'''|神社|jinja|archaic: ''shinsha'', meaning: "place of the god(s)"&lt;ref&gt;Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a structure whose main purpose is to house ("enshrine") one or more ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;  Its most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects, and not for worship.&lt;ref name="scheid2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/bauten.htm|title=Religiöse Bauwerke in Japan|last=[[Bernhard Scheid]]|first=|publisher=University of Vienna|language=German|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only one word ("shrine") is used in English, in Japanese [[Shinto]] shrines may carry any one of many different, non-equivalent names like ''gongen'', ''-gū'', ''jinja'', ''jingū'', ''mori'', ''myōjin'', ''-sha'', ''taisha'', ''ubusuna'' or ''yashiro''. (For details, see the section [[#Interpreting shrine names|Interpreting shrine names]].)

Structurally, a Shinto shrine is usually characterized by the presence of a ''[[honden]]''&lt;ref  group="note"&gt;(also called {{nihongo|''shinden''|神殿}})&lt;/ref&gt; or sanctuary, where the ''kami'' is enshrined.&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The ''honden'' may however be completely absent, as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated, and which is worshiped directly. The ''honden'' may be missing also when there are nearby altar-like structures called ''[[himorogi]]'' or objects believed capable of attracting spirits called  ''[[yorishiro]]'' that can serve as a direct bond to a ''kami''.&lt;ref&gt;Mori Mizue&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a {{nihongo|''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]''|拝殿|hall of worship}} and other structures as well (see below). However, a shrine's most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects rather than for worship.&lt;ref name="scheid2"/&gt;

Miniature shrines ([[hokora]]) can occasionally be found on roadsides. Large shrines sometimes have on their precincts miniature shrines ({{nihongo|''sessha''|摂社}} or {{nihongo|''massha''|末社}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Because the''sessha'' and ''massha'' once had different meanings but are now officially [[synonyms]], these shrines are sometimes called {{nihongo|''[[setsumatsusha]]''|摂末社}}, a [[neologism]] that fuses the two old names.&lt;/ref&gt; The portable shrines ([[mikoshi]]) which are carried on poles during festivals (''[[matsuri]]'') enshrine ''kami'' and are therefore true shrines.

In 927 CE, the [[Engi-shiki]] (延喜式, literally, Procedures of the Engi Era) was promulgated. This work listed all of the 2,861 Shinto shrines existing at the time, and the 3,131 official-recognized and enshrined [[Kami]].&lt;ref&gt;" Engishiki" in Stuart D. B. Pecken, ed., ''Historical Dictionary of Shinto''. Second edition. (Lanham, MD, USA: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2011) p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly, that number has grown and greatly exceeded this figure through the following generations.  In Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan placed the number of shrines at 79,467, mostly affiliated with the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]] (神社本庁).&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese Religion: A Survey by the Agency for Cultural Affairs''.  Abe Yoshiya and David Reid, translators.  (Tokyo: Kodansha International Ltd., 1972) p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some shrines, such as the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] are totally independent of any outside authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/images/pdf_files/srpski/godina3_broj2/Analiza%201.pdf |title=The Yasukuni Shrine Problem in the East Asian Context: Religion and Politics in Modern Japan: Foundation |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000.&lt;ref name="breenteeuwen"&gt;Breen, Teeuwen in ''Breen, Teeuwen'' (2000:1)&lt;/ref&gt;  This figure may, or may not, include private shrines in homes and owned by small groups, abandoned or derelict shrines, roadside [[Hokora]]. etc.

==Birth and evolution==

===Early origins ===
[[File:Mount nantai and lake chuzenji.jpg|thumb|Mount Nantai, worshiped at [[Futarasan Shrine]], has the shape of the [[phallic symbol|phallic]] stone rods found in pre-agricultural Jōmon sites.]]
Ancestors are ''kami'' to be worshiped. Yayoi-period village councils sought the advice of ancestors and other ''kami'', and developed instruments ({{nihongo|''[[yorishiro]]''|依り代}}) to evoke them. ''Yoshishiro'' means "approach substitute"&lt;ref name="Tamura20"&gt;Tamura, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; and were conceived to attract the ''kami'' to allow them physical space, thus making ''kami'' accessible to human beings.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;

Village-council sessions were held in quiet spots in the mountains or in forests near great trees or other natural objects that served as ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; These sacred places and their ''yorishiro'' gradually evolved into today's shrines, whose origins can be still seen in the Japanese words for "mountain" and "forest", which can also mean "shrine".&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; Many shrines have on their grounds one of the original great ''yorishiro'': a big tree, surrounded by a sacred rope called {{nihongo|''[[shimenawa]]''|標縄・注連縄・七五三縄}}.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Many other sacred objects  (mirrors, swords, comma-shaped jewels ([[magatama]])) were originally ''yorishiro'', and only later became ''kami'' by association.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first buildings at places dedicated to worship were surely huts built to house some ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; A trace of this origin can be found in the term {{nihongo|''hokura''|神庫}}, "deity storehouse", which evolved into ''hokora'' (written with the same characters 神庫), and is considered to be one of the first words for shrine.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A  ''hokora'' today is an extremely small shrine, of the type one sees on many roadsides.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First temporary shrines===
True shrines arose with the beginning of agriculture, when the need arose to attract ''kami'' to ensure good harvests.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; These were, however, just temporary structures built for a particular purpose, a tradition of which traces can be found in some rituals.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt;　

Hints of the first shrines can still be found here and there.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; [[Ōmiwa Shrine]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], for example, contains no sacred images or objects because it is believed to serve the mountain on which it stands. Those images or objects are therefore unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oomiwa.or.jp/eng.html Ōmiwa Shrine site]&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, it has a worship hall (a {{nihongo|''haiden''|拝殿}}) but no place to house the ''kami'' ({{nihongo|''shinden''|神殿}}).&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; Archeology confirms that, during the [[Yayoi period]], the most common {{nihongo|''[[shintai]]''|神体}} (a ''yorishiro'' actually housing the enshrined ''kami'') in the earliest shrines were nearby mountain peaks that supplied stream water to the plains where people lived.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;Cambridge History of Japan (1993:524)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the already mentioned Ōmiwa Shrine, another important example is [[Mount Nantai]], a [[phallus]]-shaped mountain in [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikko]] which constitutes [[Futarasan Shrine]]'s ''shintai''.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; Significantly, the name {{nihongo|Nantai|男体}} means "man's body".&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; The mountain not only provides water to the rice paddies below but has the shape of the [[phallic symbol|phallic]] stone rods found in pre-agricultural Jōmon sites.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

===Rites and ceremonies===

In 905 CE, [[Emperor Daigo]] ordered a compilation of Shinto rites and rules.  Previous attempts at codification are known to have taken place, but, neither the ''Konin'' nor the ''Jogan Gishiki''&lt;ref&gt;"Jogan Gishiki" in Stuart D. B. Pecken, ed., ''Historical Dictionary of Shinto''. Second edition. (Lanham, MD, USA: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2011) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  survive.  Initially under the direction of [[Fujiwara no Tokihira]], the project stalled at his death in April 909.  [[Fujiwara no Tadahira]], his brother, took charge and in 912 CE&lt;ref name="nussbaum178"&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq= "''Engi-shiki''"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 927 CE  the [[Engi-shiki]] (延喜式, literally, Procedures of the Engi Era) was promulgated in fifty volumes.  This, the first formal codification of Shinto rites and [[Norito]] (liturgies and prayers) to survive, became the basis for all subsequent Shinto liturgical practice and efforts.&lt;ref&gt;" Engishiki" in Stuart D. B. Pecken, ed., ''Historical Dictionary of Shinto''. Second edition. (Lanham, MD, USA: Scarecrow Press, Inv, 2011) p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the first ten volumes of this fifty volume work (which concerned worship and the [[Jingi-kan|Department of Worship]]), sections in subsequent volumes addressing the [[Ministry of Ceremonies (Japan)|Ministry of Ceremonies]] (治部省) and the [[Ministry of the Imperial Household]] (宮内省) also regulated Shinto worship and contained liturgical rites and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philippi|first=Donald L.|title=Norito: A Translation of the Ancient Japanese Ritual Prayers|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691014890|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felicia Gressitt Brock published a two-volume annotated English language translation of the first ten volumes with an introduction entitled ''Engi-shiki; procedures of the Engi Era'' in 1970.

==Arrival and impact of Buddhism==

The arrival of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] changed the situation, introducing to Japan the concept of the permanent shrine.&lt;ref name="NKS"&gt;Fujita, Koga (2008:20-21)&lt;/ref&gt; A great number of Buddhist temples were built next to existing shrines in mixed complexes called {{nihongo|''[[jingū-ji]]''|神宮寺|lit. shrine temple }} to help priesthood deal with local ''kami'', making those shrines permanent. Some time in their evolution, the word {{nihongo|Miya|宮}} meaning "palace" came into use, indicating that shrines had by then become the imposing structures of today.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;

Once the first permanent shrines were built, Shinto revealed a strong tendency to resist architectural change, a tendency which manifested itself in the so-called {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai''|式年遷宮祭}}, the tradition of rebuilding shrines faithfully at regular intervals adhering strictly to their original design. This custom is the reason ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day, remaining more or less intact.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; [[Ise Shrine]], still rebuilt every 20 years, is its best extant example. The tradition of rebuilding shrines or temples is present in other religions, but in Shinto it has played a particularly significant role in preserving ancient architectural styles.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]] and [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] in fact represent each a different style whose origin is believed to predate [[Buddhism in Japan]], a religion which arrived in Japan around the beginning of the sixth century.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; These three styles are known respectively as ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'', ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]'' and ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' (see description below).

Shrines weren't of course completely immune to change, and in fact show various influences, particularly that of Buddhism, a cultural import which provided much of Shinto architecture's vocabulary. The {{nihongo|''[[rōmon]]''|楼門|tower gate}},&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''rōmon'', or tower gate, is a gate which looks as a two-storied gate, but has in fact only one.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'', the {{nihongo|''[[kairō]]''|回廊|corridor}}, the ''[[tōrō]]'', or stone lantern,  and the ''[[komainu]]'', or lion dogs (see below for an explanation of these terms), are all elements borrowed from Buddhism.

===''Shinbutsu shūgō'' and the ''jingūji''===
{{main|Shinbutsu-shūgō|Jingū-ji}}
[[File:Tsurugaoka Hachimangū-ji.jpg|thumb|An example of ''jingū-ji'':[[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū]]-ji in an old drawing. In the foreground the shrine-temple's Buddhist structures (not extant), among them a [[Tō|pagoda]], a [[shōrō|belltower]]  and a ''[[niōmon]]''. The shrine (extant) is above.]]
Until the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), shrines as we know them today were rare. With very few exceptions like [[Ise Shrine]] and [[Izumo Taisha]], they were just a part of a temple-shrine complex controlled by Buddhist clergy.&lt;ref name="hardacre"/&gt; These complexes were called  {{nihongo|''[[jingū-ji]]''|神宮寺|shrine temple}}, places of worship composed of a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] and of a shrine dedicated to a local ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name=masato&gt;{{EOS|Jingūji|1126|Satō, Masato|February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexes were born when a temple was erected next to a shrine to help its ''kami''
with its karmic problems. At the time, ''kami'' were thought to be also subjected to [[karma]], and therefore in need of a salvation only [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] could provide. Having first appeared during the Nara period (710–794), the ''jingū-ji'' remained common for over a millennium until, with few exceptions, they were destroyed in compliance with the  new policies of the Meiji administration in 1868.

===''Shinbutsu bunri''===
{{main|Shinbutsu bunri}}
The Shinto shrine went through a cataclysmic change  when the Meiji  administration promulgated a new policy of separation of ''[[kami]]'' and foreign [[Hotoke|Buddhas]] (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'') with the {{nihongo |''Kami and Buddhas Separation Order''|神仏判然令|Shinbutsu Hanzenrei}}. This event is of great historical importance partly because it triggered the ''[[haibutsu kishaku]]'', a violent anti-Buddhist movement which in the final years of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and during the [[Meiji Restoration]] caused the forcible closure of thousands of Buddhist temples, the confiscation of their land, the forced return to lay life of monks, and the destruction of books, statues and other Buddhist property.&lt;ref name= "EoSHK"&gt;{{citation | title = Haibutsukishaku | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Shinto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of Edo period, local ''kami'' beliefs and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called ''[[shinbutsu shūgō]]'' (神仏習合), up to the point that even the same buildings were used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples.

After the law, the two would be forcibly separated. This was done in several stages. A first order issued by the ''Jingijimuka'' in April 1868 ordered the defrocking of ''shasō'' and ''[[bettō]]'' (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines).&lt;ref name = "Burkman"&gt;{{citation | last = Burkman | title = The Urakami Incidents and the Struggle for Religious Toleration in Early Meiji Japan | page = 175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, the 'Daijōkan' banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as ''[[gongen]]'' to Japanese ''[[kami]]'' and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines.&lt;ref name="EoSSB"/&gt;

The third stage consisted of the prohibition against applying the Buddhist term ''Daibosatsu'' (Great [[Bodhisattva]]) to the syncretic ''kami'' [[Hachiman]] at the [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]] and [[Usa Shrine|Usa Hachiman-gū]] shrines.&lt;ref name="EoSSB"&gt;{{citation | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Shinto | title = Shinbutsu Bunri}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth and final stage, all the defrocked ''bettō'' and ''shasō'' were told to become "shrine priests" (''[[kannushi]]'') and return to their shrines.&lt;ref name= "EoSSB" /&gt; Also, monks of the [[Nichiren]] sect were told not to refer to some deities as ''kami''.&lt;ref name="EoSSB"/&gt;

After a short period in which it enjoyed popular favor, the process of separation of Buddhas and ''kami'' however stalled and is still only partially completed: to this day, almost all Buddhist temples in Japan have a small shrine (''[[chinjusha]]'') dedicated to its Shinto tutelary ''kami'', and vice versa Buddhist figures (e.g. goddess [[Sarasvati|Kannon]]) are revered in Shinto shrines.&lt;ref name="Scheid"&gt;{{citation | last = Scheid | first = Grundbegriffe | title = Shinto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Shintai''==
{{main|Shintai}}
[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|left|thumb|Mount Fuji is Japan's most famous ''shintai''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For details on Mount Fuji worship, see [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=786 Fuji Shinkō], Encyclopedia of Shinto.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The defining features of a shrine are the ''kami'' it enshrines and the ''shintai'' (or ''go-shintai'' if the honorific [[prefix]] ''go-'' is used) that houses it.  While the name literally means "body of a kami", ''shintai'' are physical objects worshiped at or near Shinto shrines because a ''kami'' is believed to reside in them.&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;''Shintai'', Encyclopedia of Shinto&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of what their name may suggest, ''shintai'' are not themselves part of ''kami'', but rather just symbolic repositories which make them accessible to human beings for worship.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; It is said therefore that the ''kami'' ''inhabits'' them.&lt;ref name="scheid1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/schrein.htm|title=Schreine|last=[[Bernhard Scheid]]|first=|publisher=University of Vienna|language=German|accessdate=27 March 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shintai'' are also of necessity ''[[yorishiro]]'', that is objects by their very nature capable of attracting ''kami''.

The most common ''shintai'' are man-made objects like mirrors, swords, jewels (for example comma-shaped stones called ''[[magatama]])'', ''[[gohei]]'' (wands used during religious rites), and sculptures of ''kami'' called {{nihongo|''shinzō''|神像}},&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Kami'' are as a rule not represented in [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] or physical terms, however numerous paintings and statues representing them have appeared under Buddhist influence.&lt;/ref&gt; but they can be also natural objects such as rocks, mountains, trees and waterfalls.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; Mountains were among the first, and are still among the most important, ''shintai'', and are worshiped at several famous shrines. A mountain believed to house a ''kami'', as for example [[Mount Fuji]] or [[Mount Miwa]], is called a {{nihongo|''shintai-zan''|[[:ja:神体山]]}}.&lt;ref name="ono"&gt;Ono, Woodard (2004:100)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a man-made ''shintai'', a ''kami'' must be invited to reside in it (see the next subsection, ''Kanjō'').&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt;

The founding of a new shrine requires the presence of either a pre-existing, naturally occurring ''shintai'' (for example a rock or waterfall housing a local ''kami''), or of an artificial one, which must therefore be procured or made to the purpose. An example of the first case are the [[Nachi Falls]], worshiped at Hiryū Shrine near [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]] and believed to be inhabited by a ''kami'' called Hiryū [[Gongen]].&lt;ref name="nachi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kkr.mlit.go.jp/wakayama/rekishi/disco131.html|title=Hiryū Gongen|last=Kamizaka|first=Jirō|publisher=Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport - Kinki Regional Development Bureau|language=Japanese|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first duty of a shrine is to house and protect its ''shintai'' and the ''kami'' which inhabits it.&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt; If a shrine has more than one building, the one containing the ''shintai'' is called ''[[honden]]''; because it is meant for the exclusive use of the ''kami'', it is always closed to the public and is not used for prayer or religious ceremonies. The ''shintai'' leaves the ''honden'' only during festivals (''[[matsuri]]''), when it is put in portable shrines (''mikoshi'') and carried around the streets among the faithful.&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt; The portable shrine is used to physically protect the ''shintai'' and to hide it from sight.&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt;

===Re-enshrinement===
{{main|Kanjō}}
Often the opening of a new shrine will require the ritual division of a ''kami'' and the transferring of one of the two resulting spirits to the new location, where it will animate the ''shintai''. This process is called ''[[kanjō]]'', and the divided spirits {{nihongo|''bunrei''|分霊|divided spirit}}, {{nihongo|''go-bunrei''|御分霊}} or {{nihongo|''wakemitama''|分霊}}.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"&gt;Smyers (1999:235)&lt;/ref&gt; This process of propagation, described by the priests, in spite of this name, not as a division but as akin to the lighting of a candle from another already lit, leaves the original ''kami'' intact in its original place and therefore doesn't alter any of its properties.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; The resulting spirit has all the qualities of the original and is therefore "alive" and permanent.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; The process is used often, for example during Shinto festivals (''[[Matsuri]]'') to animate temporary shrines called ''[[mikoshi]]''.&lt;ref name="sonoda12"&gt;Sonoda (1975:12)&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer does not necessarily take place from a shrine to another: the divided spirit's new location can be a privately owned object or an individual's house.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"&gt;Smyers (1999: 156-160)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kanjō'' process was of fundamental importance in the creation of all of Japan's shrine networks ([[Inari Shrine|Inari shrine]]s, [[Hachiman Shrine|Hachiman shrine]]s, etc.).

[[File:Hokora in Yokohama.jpg|thumb|left|A roadside ''[[hokora]]'' dedicated to ''kami'' Inari]]Those worshiped at a shrine are generally Shinto ''kami'', but sometimes they can be Buddhist or [[Tao]]ist deities, as well as others not generally considered to belong to Shinto.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The opposite can also happen. [[Toyokawa Inari]] is a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] of the [[Sōtō|Sōtō sect]] in [[Toyokawa, Aichi|Toyokawa]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] and, with its [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]] branch, one of the centers of Inari's cult (Smyers 1999:26, 34).&lt;/ref&gt; Some shrines were established to worship living people or figures from [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s. A famous example are the [[Tōshō-gū]] shrines erected to enshrine [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], or the many shrines dedicated to [[Sugawara no Michizane]], like [[Kitano Tenman-gū]].

Often the shrines historically most significant do not lie in a former center of power like [[Kyoto]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] or [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. For example, [[Ise Shrine]], the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial household]]'s family shrine, is in [[Mie prefecture]]. [[Izumo-taisha]], one of the oldest and most revered shrines in Japan, is in [[Shimane Prefecture|Shimane prefecture]].&lt;ref name="schreine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/bekannteschreine.htm|title=Bekannte Schreine|last=Scheid|first=Bernhard|publisher=University of Vienna|language=German|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because their location is that of a traditionally important ''kami'', and not that of temporal institutions.

Some shrines exist only in one locality, while others are at the head of a network of {{nihongo|branch shrines|分社|bunsha}} that extends to all the country.&lt;ref name="bunpu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=776|title=Shamei Bunpu (Shrine Names and Distributions)|last=Motegi|first=Sadazumi|publisher=Encyclopedia of Shinto|language=Japanese|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spreading of a ''kami'' can be due to one or more of several different mechanisms. The normal one is an operation called  ''[[kanjō]]'' (see the ''Re-enshrinement'' section above), a propagation process through which a ''kami'' is invited to a new location and there re-enshrined. The new shrine is administratively completely independent from the one it originated from.

However, other transfer mechanisms exist. In Ise Shrine's case, for example, its network of Shinmei shrines (from {{nihongo|Shinmei|神明}}, another name for Amaterasu) grew due to two concurrent causes. During the late [[Heian period]] the cult of [[Amaterasu]], worshiped initially only at Ise Shrine, started to spread to the shrine's possessions through the usual ''kanjō'' mechanism.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Later, branches shrines started to appear further away. The first evidence of a Shinmei shrine far from Ise is given by the [[Azuma Kagami]], a [[Kamakura period]] text which refers to Amanawa Shinmei-gū's appearance in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]]. Amaterasu began being worshiped in other parts of the country also because of the so-called {{nihongo|''tobi shinmei''|飛び神明|flying Shinmei|}} phenomenon, the belief that she would fly to other locations and settle there.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Similar mechanisms have been responsible for the spreading around the country of other ''kami''.

===Notable shrines===
[[File:Jingu-sinden-otaue 01.JPG|thumb|Since 1871, Ise Grand Shrine has been the most important shrine in Japan.]] The '''[[Ise Grand Shrine]]''' in [[Mie prefecture]] is, with Izumo-taisha, the most representative and historically significant shrine in Japan.&lt;ref name="IUI"/&gt; The ''kami'' the two enshrine play fundamental roles in the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], two texts of great importance to Shinto.&lt;ref name="IUI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/ise_izumo.htm|title=Ise und Izumo|last=Scheid|first=Bernhard|publisher=University of Vienna|language=German|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because its ''kami'', [[Amaterasu]], is an ancestor of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], Ise Shrine is the Imperial Household's family shrine. Ise Shrine is, however, dedicated specifically to the Emperor and in the past, even his mother, wife and grandmother needed his permission to worship there.&lt;ref name="EOS-IS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=781|title=Ise Shinkō|publisher=Encyclopedia of Shinto|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its traditional and mythological foundation date goes back to 4 BC, but historians believe it was founded around the 3rd to 5th century.

'''[[Izumo Taisha]]''' ([[Shimane prefecture]]) is so old that no document about its birth survives, and the year of foundation is therefore unknown. The shrine is at the center of a series of popular [[sagas]] and myths.&lt;ref name="IUI"/&gt; The ''kami'' it enshrines, [[Ōkuninushi]], created Japan before it was populated by Amaterasu's offspring, the Emperor's ancestors.&lt;ref name="IUI"/&gt; Because of its physical remoteness, in historical times Izumo has been eclipsed in fame by other sites, but there is still a widespread belief that in October all Japanese gods meet there.&lt;ref name="IUI"/&gt; For this reason, this month is known also as the {{nihongo|Month Without Gods|神無月|[[Kannazuki]]}} (one of its names in the old [[Japanese calendar|lunar calendar]]), while at Izumo Taisha alone it is referred to as the {{nihongo|Month With Gods|神在月 or 神有月|Kamiarizuki}}.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fushimi Inari Taisha]]''' is the head shrine of the largest shrine network in Japan, which has more than 32 000 members (about a third of the total). [[Inari Okami]] worship started here in the 8th century and has continued ever since, expanding to the rest of the country. Located in [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]], the shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari, and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines. Another very large example is the [[Yūtoku Inari Shrine]] in [[Kashima, Saga|Kashima City]], [[Saga Prefecture]].

[[Ōita Prefecture]]'s '''[[Usa Shrine]]''' (called in Japanese Usa Jingū or Usa Hachiman-gū) is, together with Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū, the head of the Hachiman shrine network.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usajinguu.com/lineage.html|title=Yuisho|publisher=Usa Jingū|language=Japanese|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hachiman worship started here at least as far back as the [[Nara period]] (710–794). In the year 860 the ''kami'' was divided and brought to '''[[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]]''' in Kyoto, which became the focus of Hachiman worship in the capital.&lt;ref name="hachi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1083|title=Hachiman Shinkō|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on top of Mount Otokoyama, Usa Hachiman-gū is dedicated to Emperor Ojin, his mother Empress Jungū and female ''kami'' Hime no Okami.&lt;ref name="iwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiis.or.jp/kansaida/yawata/yawata01-e.html|title=Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine |publisher=Kansai Institute of Information Systems and Industrial|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Itsukushima Shrine]]''' is, together with [[Munakata Taisha]], at the head of the Munakata shrine network (see below). Remembered for his ''[[torii]]'' raising from the waters, it is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of [[Susanoo|Susano-o no Mikoto]],  ''kami'' of seas and storms and brother of the great sun ''[[kami]]''.

'''[[Kasuga Taisha]]''' is a Shinto shrine in the [[Municipality of Japan|city]] of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], in [[Nara prefecture|Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Established in 768 A.D. and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it is the shrine of the [[Fujiwara family]].  The interior is noted for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up the shrine. The architectural style ''[[Kasuga-zukuri]]'' takes its name from Kasuga Taisha's ''honden''.

The '''[[Kumano Sanzan]]''' shrine complex, head of the Kumano shrine network, includes [[Kumano Hayatama Taisha]] ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Shingū, Wakayama|Shingu]]), [[Kumano Hongu Taisha]] ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Tanabe, Wakayama|Tanabe]]), and [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]] ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Nachikatsuura, Wakayama|Nachikatsuura]]).&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt; The shrines lie at between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;km of distance one from the other.&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt; They are connected by the pilgrimage route known as {{nihongo|"Kumano Sankeimichi"|熊野参詣道}}. The great Kumano Sanzan complex also includes two Buddhist temples, [[Seiganto-ji]] and [[Fudarakusan-ji]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The presence of Buddhist temples within a Shinto shrine complex is due to an integration of Buddhism and Shinto (''[[Shinbutsu shūgō]]'') which used to be normal before the [[Meiji restoration]] and is still common. The ''kami'' which inhabits the Nachi Falls within the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex, the already mentioned Hiryū [[Gongen]], is itself [[syncretism|syncretic]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ks"&gt;[http://www.pref.wakayama.lg.jp/sekaiisan/english/e-kumano_e.html Sacred site "Kumano Sanzan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221919/http://www.pref.wakayama.lg.jp/sekaiisan/english/e-kumano_e.html |date=2009-03-03 }} accessed on June 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious significance of the Kumano region goes back to prehistoric times, and therefore predates all modern religions in Japan.&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt; The area was, and still is, considered a place of physical healing.

'''[[Yasukuni shrine]]''', in Tokyo, is dedicated to the soldiers and others who died fighting on behalf of the [[Emperor of Japan]].

===Shrine networks===
There are estimated to be about 80,000+ shrines in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Karan, Pradyumna. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=oze_mWihnU0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq= ''Japan in the 21st Century: Environment, Economy, and Society,'' p. 72]; (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ytOHbLdtSY4C&amp;pg=PA191 ''Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths,'' p. 191].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Shinto shrines are associated with a shrine network.&lt;ref name="breenteeuwen" /&gt; This counts only shrines with resident priests; if smaller shrines (such as roadside or household shrines) are included, the number would increase by at least an order of magnitude. These are highly concentrated;&lt;ref name="bunshanum" /&gt; over one-third are associated with Inari (over 30,000 shrines), and the top six networks comprise over 90% of all shrines, though there are at least 20 networks with over 200 shrines.

The next ten networks have sizes going from about 2,000 branches down to about 200 branches, and include the networks headed by [[Matsunoo-taisha]], [[Kibune Shrine]], and [[Taga-taisha]], among others.

The following six shrine networks alone account for more than 90% of all shrines in Japan.

====Inari shrines====
{{main|Inari Shrine}}
The number of branch shrines gives an approximate indication of their religious significance, and neither [[Ise Shrine]] nor [[Izumo-taisha]] can claim the first place.&lt;ref name="schreine"/&gt; By far the most numerous are shrines dedicated to [[Inari Okami|Inari]], tutelary ''kami'' of agriculture popular all over Japan, which alone constitute almost a third of the total.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Inari also protects fishing, commerce and productivity in general. For this reason, many modern Japanese corporations have shrines dedicated to Inari on their premises. Inari shrines are usually very small and therefore easy to maintain, but can also be very large, as in the case of [[Fushimi Inari Taisha]], the head shrine of the network. The ''kami'' is also enshrined in some Buddhist temples.&lt;ref name="schreine"/&gt;

The entrance to an Inari shrine is usually marked by one or more [[vermilion]] ''[[torii]]'' and two [[Kitsune|white foxes]] (See photo above).  This red color has come to be identified with Inari because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their ''torii''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers (1999:60, 177)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kitsune'' statues are at times mistakenly believed to be a form assumed by Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female, although sex is usually not obvious.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"&gt;Smyers (1999:93)&lt;/ref&gt; These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw – most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common. Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"/&gt;

====Hachiman shrines====
{{main|Hachiman Shrine}}
[[File:Sōgyō Hachiman.jpg|thumb|Hachiman in Buddhist robes]]A syncretic entity worshiped as both a ''kami'' and a Buddhist [[Bodhisattva|''daibosatsu'']], [[Hachiman]] is intimately associated with both learning and warriors.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; In the sixth or seventh century [[Emperor Ōjin]] and his mother Empress Jingū came to be identified together with Hachiman.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashkenazy|first=Michael|title=Handbook of Japanese Mythology (World Mythology) (Hardcover)|publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=November 5, 2003|isbn=978-1-57607-467-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; First enshrined at [[Usa Hachiman-gū]] in [[Ōita Prefecture]], Hachiman was deeply revered during the Heian period. According to the [[Kojiki]], it was Ōjin who invited Korean and Chinese scholars to Japan, and for this reason he is the patron of writing and learning.

Because as Emperor Ōjin he was an ancestor of the Minamoto clan, Hachiman became the {{nihongo|tutelary ''kami''|氏神|ujigami|}} of the [[Minamoto]] samurai clan&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; of Kawachi ([[Osaka]]). After [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] became ''[[shōgun]]'' and established the [[Kamakura shogunate]], Hachiman's popularity grew and he became by extension the protector of the warrior class the ''shōgun'' had brought to power. For this reason, the ''shintai'' of a Hachiman shrine is usually a [[stirrup]] or a bow.&lt;ref name="ash"/&gt;

During the Japanese medieval period, Hachiman worship spread throughout Japan among not only samurai, but also the peasantry. There are 25,000 shrines in Japan dedicated to him, the second most numerous after those of the Inari network.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Usa Hachiman-gū is the network's head shrine together with [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]]. However, [[Hakozaki Shrine]] and [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū]] are historically no less significant shrines, and are more popular.

====Munakata shrines====
Headed by Kyūshū's [[Munakata Taisha]] and [[Itsukushima Shrine]], shrines in this network enshrine the {{nihongo|Three Female Kami of Munakata|宗像三女神|Munakata Sanjoshin}}, namely Chikishima Hime-no-Kami, Tagitsu Hime-no-Kami, and Tagori Hime-no-Kami.&lt;ref name="munakata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1085|title=Munakata Shinkō|publisher=Encyclopedia of Shinto|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same three ''kami'' are enshrined elsewhere in the network, sometimes under a different name. However, while Munakata Taisha enshrines all three in separate islands belonging to its complex, branch shrines generally do not; which ''kami'' they enshrine depends on the history of the shrine and the myths tied to it.&lt;ref name="munakata"/&gt;

====Tenjin shrines====
{{main|Tenman-gū}}
The [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]] shrine network enshrines 9th-century scholar [[Sugawara no Michizane]]. Sugawara had originally been enshrined to placate his spirit, not to be worshiped.&lt;ref name="suga"&gt;{{cite book| last = John Breen| first = Mark Teeuwen (editors)| title = Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| date = July 2000| location = Honolulu| isbn = 978-0-8248-2363-4| oclc = 43487317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michizane had been unjustly exiled in his life, and it was therefore necessary to somehow placate his rage, believed to be the cause of a plague and other disasters. [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] was the first of the shrines dedicated to him. Because in life he was a scholar, he became the ''kami'' of learning, and during the [[Edo period]] schools often opened a branch shrine for him.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Another important shrine dedicated to him is [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]].

====Shinmei shrines====
While the [[ritsuryō]] legal system was in use, visits by commoners to Ise were forbidden.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; With its weakening during the [[Heian period]], commoners also started being allowed to the shrine. The growth of the Shinmei shrine network was due to two concomitant causes. During the late [[Heian period]] goddess Amaterasu, worshiped initially only at Ise Shrine, started to be re-enshrined in branch shrines in Ise's own possessions through the usual ''kanjō'' mechanism. The first evidence of a Shinmei shrine elsewhere is given by the [[Azuma Kagami]], a [[Kamakura period]] text which refers to [[Amanawa Shinmei Shrine|Amanawa Shinmei-gū]]'s appearance in Kamakura.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt; Amaterasu spread to other parts of the country also because of the so-called {{nihongo|''tobi shinmei''|飛び神明|flying Shinmei|}} phenomenon, the belief that Amaterasu flew to other locations and settled there.&lt;ref name="bunpu"/&gt;

====Kumano shrines====
{{main|Kumano Shrine}}
Kumano shrines enshrine the three Kumano mountains: Hongū, Shingū, and Nachi (the {{nihongo|Kumano [[Gongen]]|熊野権現}}).&lt;ref name="kumano"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1076 Kumano Shinkō], accessed on April 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of origin of the Kumano cult is the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex, which includes {{nihongo|[[Kumano Hayatama Taisha]]|熊野速玉大社}} ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Shingū, Wakayama|Shingu]]), [[Kumano Hongu Taisha]] ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Tanabe, Wakayama|Tanabe]]), and [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]] ([[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Nachikatsuura, Wakayama|Nachikatsuura]]).&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt; There are more than 3000 Kumano shrines in Japan.

==Structure==
[[Image:Plan of Shinto Shrine.jpg|thumb|The composition of a Shinto shrine]]

The following is a diagram illustrating the most important parts of a Shinto shrine.

#''[[Torii]]'' – Shinto gate
#Stone stairs
#''[[Sandō]]'' – the approach to the shrine
#''[[Chōzuya|''Chōzuya'' or ''temizuya'']] – purification font to cleanse one's hands and mouth
#''[[Tōrō]]'' – decorative stone lanterns
#''[[Kagura-den]]'' – building dedicated to ''[[Noh]]'' or the sacred ''[[kagura]]'' dance
#''Shamusho'' – the shrine's administrative office
#''[[Ema (Shintō)|Ema]]'' – wooden plaques bearing prayers or wishes
#''[[Setsumatsusha|Sessha''/''massha'']] – small auxiliary shrines
#''[[Komainu]]'' – the so-called "lion dogs", guardians of the shrine
#''[[Haiden (Shinto)|Haiden]]'' – oratory or hall of worship
#''[[Tamagaki]]'' – fence surrounding the ''honden''
#''[[Honden]]'' – main hall, enshrining the [[kami]]
#On the roof of the ''haiden'' and ''honden'' are visible ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' (forked roof [[finials]]) and ''[[katsuogi]]'' (short horizontal logs), both common shrine ornamentations.

The general blueprint of a Shinto shrine is Buddhist in origin.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; The presence of verandas, stone lanterns, and elaborate gates is an example of this influence. The composition of a Shinto shrine is extremely variable, and none of its possible features is necessarily present. Even the ''honden'' can be missing if the shrine worships a nearby natural ''shintai''.

However, since its grounds are sacred, they are usually surrounded by a fence made of stone or wood called ''[[tamagaki]]'', while access is made possible by an approach called ''[[sandō]]''. The entrances themselves are straddled by gates called ''[[torii]]'', which are usually the simplest way to identify a Shinto shrine.

[[Image:---File---蒙疆神社.JPG|thumb|[[Mengjiang]] shrine in [[Zhangjiakou]], [[Hebei]], [[China]] in 1952]]
A shrine may include within its grounds several structures, each destined to a different purpose.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; Among them are the  already mentioned ''[[honden]]'' or sanctuary, where the ''kami'' are enshrined,  the ''[[heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'' or hall of offerings, where offers and prayers are presented, and the ''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' or hall of worship, where there may be seats for worshippers.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt;  The ''honden'' is the building that contains the ''[[shintai]]'', literally, "the sacred body of the kami".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In spite of its name, the ''shintai'' is actually a temporary repository of the enshrined ''kami''. (Smyers, page 44)&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only the ''haiden'' is open to the [[laity]].  The ''honden'' is usually located behind the ''haiden'' and is often much smaller and unadorned. Other notable shrine features are the ''[[Chōzuya|temizuya]]'', the fountain where visitors cleanse their hands and mouth, and the {{nihongo|''shamusho''|社務所}}, the office which oversees the shrine.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt;  Buildings are often adorned by [[chigi (architecture)|''chigi'']] and ''[[katsuogi]]'', variously oriented poles which protrude from their roof (see illustration above).

As already explained above, before the [[Meiji Restoration]] it was common for a Buddhist temple to be built inside or next to a shrine, or vice versa for a shrine to include Buddhist subtemples.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;See [[Shinbutsu shūgō]] article&lt;/ref&gt; If a shrine housed a Buddhist temple, it was called a {{nihongo|''jingūji''|神宮寺}}. Analogously, temples all over Japan adopted tutelary [[kami]] ({{nihongo|chinju|鎮守/鎮主}}) and built {{nihongo|temple shrines|寺社|jisha}} to house them.&lt;ref name="BT95"&gt;Mark Teeuwen in ''Breen and Teeuwen'' (2000:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt; After the forcible separation of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines ([[shinbutsu bunri]]) ordered by the new government in the [[Meiji period]], the connection between the two religions was officially severed, but continued nonetheless in practice and is still visible today.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

==Shrine architectural styles==
{{main|Shinto architecture}}
Shrine buildings can have many different basic layouts, usually named either after a famous shrine's ''honden'' (e.g. ''hiyoshi-zukuri'', named after [[Hiyoshi Taisha]]), or a structural characteristic (e.g. ''irimoya-zukuri'', after the [[hip roof|hip]]-and [[gable]] roof it adopts. The suffix ''-zukuri'' in this case means "structure".)

The ''honden's'' roof is always gabled, and some styles also have a veranda-like aisle called ''[[hisashi (architecture)|hisashi]]'' (a 1-''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' wide corridor surrounding one or more sides of the core of a shrine or temple).
Among the factors involved in the classification, important are the presence or absence of:
*{{nihongo|''[[hirairi]]'' or ''hirairi-zukuri''|平入・平入造}} – a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled-side). The ''shinmei-zukuri'', ''nagare-zukuri'', ''hachiman-zukuri'', and ''hie-zukuri'' belong to this type.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;
*{{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]'' or ''tsumairi-zukuri''|妻入・妻入造}} – a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs perpendicular to the roof's ridge (gabled side). The ''taisha-zukuri'', ''sumiyoshi-zukuri'', ''ōtori-zukuri'' and ''kasuga-zukuri'' belong to this type.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

(The gallery at the end of this article contains examples of both styles.)

Proportions are also important. A building of a given style often  must have certain proportions measured in ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' (the distance between pillars, a quantity variable from one shrine to another or even within the same shrine).

The oldest styles are the  ''tsumairi'' ''shinmei-zukuri'', ''taisha-zukuri'', and ''sumiyoshi-zukuri'', believed to predate the arrival of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

The two most common are the  ''hirairi'' ''nagare-zukuri'' and the ''tsumairi'' ''kasuga-zukuri''.&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=248 History and Typology of Shrine Architecture], Encyclopedia of Shinto accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Larger, more important shrines tend to have unique styles.

===Most common styles===
The following are the two most common shrine styles in Japan.

====''Nagare-zukuri''====
[[File:Ujigami jinja08s3s4500.jpg|thumb|left|Ujigami Shrine in Uji, [[Kyoto Prefecture]]]]
The {{nihongo|''[[nagare-zukuri]]''|流造|flowing style}} or {{nihongo|''nagare hafu-zukuri''|流破風造|flowing gabled style}} is a style characterized by a very asymmetrical [[gable]]d roof ({{nihongo|''kirizuma-yane''|切妻屋根}} in Japanese) projecting outwards on the non-gabled side, above the main entrance, to form a portico (see photo).&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;  This is the feature which gives the style its name, the most common among shrines all over the country. Sometimes the basic layout consisting of an elevated {{nihongo|core|母屋|[[moya (architecture)|moya]]}} partially surrounded by a veranda called ''hisashi'' (all under the same roof) is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; The ''honden'' varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 ''ken'', but is never 6 or 8 ''ken''.&lt;ref name="jana"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nagarezukuri.htm Nagare-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ''ken''. The oldest shrine in Japan, [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]]'s [[Ujigami Shrine]], has a ''honden'' of this type. Its external dimensions are 5x3 ''ken'', but internally it is composed of three {{nihongo|sanctuaries|内殿|naiden}} measuring 1 ''ken'' each.&lt;ref name="jana"/&gt;

====''Kasuga-zukuri''====
[[File:Udamikumari Shr Kami detail.jpg|thumb|The ''honden'' at [[Uda Mikumari Shrine]] Kami-gū is made of 3 joined ''Kasuga-zukuri'' buildings]]{{nihongo|''[[Kasuga-zukuri]]''|春日造}} as a style takes its name from [[Kasuga Taisha]]'s ''honden''. It is characterized by the extreme smallness of the building, just 1x1 ''ken'' in size. In Kasuga Taisha's case, this translates in 1.9 m x 2.6 m.&lt;ref name="jaka"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kasugazukuri.htm Kasuga-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The roof is gabled with a single entrance at the gabled end, decorated with ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' and ''[[katsuogi]]'', covered with cypress bark and curved upwards at the eaves. Supporting structures are painted vermillion, while the plank walls are white.&lt;ref name="jaka"/&gt;

After the ''Nagare-zukuri'' (see above), this is the most common style, with most instances in the [[Kansai region]] around Nara.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;

===Styles predating the arrival of Buddhism===

The following four styles predate the arrival in Japan of Buddhism.

====Primitive shrine layout with no ''honden''====
This style is rare, but historically important. It is also unique in that the ''honden'', normally the very center of a shrine, is missing. It is believed shrines of this type are reminiscent of what shrines were like in prehistorical times. The first shrines had no ''[[honden]]'' because the ''[[shintai]]'', or object of worship, was the mountain on which they stood. An extant example is [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]'s [[Ōmiwa Shrine]], which still has no ''honden''.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; An area near the ''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (hall of worship), sacred and [[taboo]], replaces it for worship. Another prominent example of this style is [[Futarasan Shrine]] near Nikkō, whose ''shintai'' is [[Mount Nantai]]. For details, see [[Shinto shrine#Birth and evolution of Shinto shrines|Birth and evolution of Shinto shrines]] above.

====''Shinmei-zukuri''====
[[File:IseShrineBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|A shrine at Ise]]
{{nihongo|''[[Shinmei-zukuri]]''|神明造}} is an ancient style typical of, and most common at, [[Ise Grand Shrine]], the holiest of Shinto shrines.&lt;ref name=" ko"/&gt; It is most common in Mie prefecture.&lt;ref name="jashi"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shinmeizukuri.htm Shinmei-zukuri] accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by an extreme simplicity, its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the [[Kofun period]] (250–538 C.E.) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture. Built in planed, unfinished wood, the ''honden'' is either 3x2 ''ken'' or 1x1''ken'' in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof with an entry on one the non-gabled sides, no upward curve at the eaves, and decorative logs called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' and ''[[katsuogi]]'' protruding from the roof's ridge.&lt;ref name="jashi"/&gt; The oldest extant example is [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]].&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

====''Sumiyoshi-zukuri''====
[[File:Sumiyoshi Taisha Hunatama Jinja1.jpg|thumb|Sumiyoshi Taisha's Funatama Jinja]]

{{nihongo|''[[Sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''|住吉造}} takes its name from [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]'s ''honden'' in [[Ōsaka]]. The building is 4 ''ken'' wide and 2 ''ken'' deep, and has an entrance under the gable.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209043808/http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89/ Jinja Kenchiku], [[Shogakukan]] Nihon Daihyakka Zensho, accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its interior is divided in two sections, one at the front ({{nihongo|''gejin''|外陣}}) and one at the back ({{nihongo|''naijin''|内陣}}) with a single entrance at the front.&lt;ref name="jasu"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sumiyoshizukuri.htm Sumiyoshi-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Construction is simple, but the pillars are painted in vermilion and the walls in white.

The style is supposed to have its origin in old palace architecture&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the [[Sumiyoshi Sanjin]] complex in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; In both cases, as in many others, there is no veranda.

====''Taisha-zukuri''====
[[File:Kamosu jinja.jpg|thumb|left|Kamosu Jinja's ''honden'']]

{{nihongo|''[[Taisha-zukuri]]'' or ''Ōyashiro-zukuri''|大社造|}} is the oldest shrine style, takes its name from [[Izumo Taisha]] and, like Ise Grand Shrine's, has ''chigi'' and ''katsuogi'', plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar (''shin no mihashira'').&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; Because its floor is raised on stilts, it is believed to have its origin in raised-floor granaries similar to those found in [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]], Shizuoka prefecture.&lt;ref name="jata"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/taishazukuri.htm Taisha-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''honden'' normally has a 2x2 ''ken'' footprint (12.46x12.46 m in Izumo Taisha's case), with an entrance on the gabled end. The stairs to the honden are covered by a cypress bark roof. The oldest extant example of the style is Kamosu Jinja's ''honden'' in [[Shimane prefecture]], built in the 16th century.

===Other styles===
Many other architectural styles exist, most of them rare. For details, see {{slink|Shinto architecture|Other styles}}.

==Interpreting shrine names==
[[File:Hakusan gongen.jpg|thumb|A small shrine called {{nihongo|Hakusan Gongen|白山権現}}, following the pre-Meiji custom.]]
Shrine nomenclature has changed considerably since the Meiji period. Until then, the vast majority of shrines were small and had no permanent priest.&lt;ref name="hardacre"&gt;Hardacre (1986:31)&lt;/ref&gt; With very few exceptions, they were just a part of a temple-shrine complex controlled by Buddhist clergy.&lt;ref name="hardacre"/&gt; They usually enshrined a local tutelary ''kami'', so they were called with the name of the ''kami'' followed by terms like ''[[gongen]]''; ''{{nihongo|ubusuna|産土}}'', short for "ubusuna no kami", or guardian deity of one's birthplace; or {{nihongo|''myōjin''|明神|great kami}}. The term {{nihongo|''jinja''|神社}}, now the most common, was rare.&lt;ref name="hardacre"/&gt; Examples of this kind of pre-Meiji use are {{nihongo|[[Hōkai-ji (Kamakura)|Tokusō Daigongen]]}} and [[Kanda Shrine|Kanda Myōjin]].

Today, the term "Shinto shrine" in English is used in opposition to "[[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]]" to mirror in English the distinction made in Japanese between Shinto and Buddhist religious structures. This single English word however translates several non equivalent Japanese words, including {{nihongo|''jinja''|神社}} as in [[Yasukuni Jinja]]; {{nihongo|''yashiro''|社}} as in [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine|Tsubaki Ōkami Yashiro]]; {{nihongo|''miya''|宮}} as in [[Ise Shrine#Shrines and facilities|Watarai no Miya]]; {{nihongo|-''gū''|宮}} as in [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]]; {{nihongo|''jingū''|神宮}} as in [[Meiji Shrine|Meiji Jingū]]; {{nihongo|''taisha''|大社}} as in [[Izumo Taisha]];&lt;ref name="HoS"&gt;The History of Shrines&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|''mori''|杜}}; and {{nihongo|''hokora/hokura''|神庫}}.

Shrine names are descriptive, and a difficult problem in dealing with them is understanding exactly what they mean. Although there is a lot of variation in their composition, it is usually possible to identify in them two parts. The first is the shrine's name proper, or {{nihongo|''meishō''|名称}}, the second is the so-called {{nihongo|''shōgō''|称号}}, or "title".&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"&gt;Shinto Online Network Association [http://jinja.jp/modules/chishiki/index.php?content_id=56 Jinja no Shōgō ni Tsuite Oshiete Kudasai]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Meishō''===
The most common ''meishō'' is the location where the shrine stands, as for example in the case of [[Ise Shrine|Ise Jingū]], the most sacred of shrines, which is located in the city of [[Ise, Mie]] prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orias.berkeley.edu/visuals/japan_visuals/shintoC.HTM#ISE Ise, the Holiest Shrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704083054/http://orias.berkeley.edu/visuals/japan_visuals/shintoC.HTM#ISE |date=2008-07-04 }}, Berkeley University ORIAS site accessed on August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Very often the ''meishō'' will be the name of the ''kami'' enshrined. An [[Inari Shrine]] for example is a shrine dedicated to ''kami'' [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]]. Analogously, a [[Kumano Shrine]] is a shrine that enshrines the three Kumano mountains. A [[Hachiman Shrine]] enshrines ''kami'' [[Hachiman]]. Tokyo's [[Meiji Shrine]] enshrines the [[Meiji Emperor]]. The name can also have other origins, often unknown or unclear.

===''Shōgō''===
The second part of the name defines the status of the shrine.
* {{nihongo|''Jinja''|神社}} is the most general name for shrine.&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt; Any place that owns a {{nihongo|''[[honden]]''|本殿}} is a ''jinja''.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; These two characters used to be read either "kamu-tsu-yashiro" or "mori", both meaning "kami grove".&lt;ref name="BT43"/&gt; Both readings can be found for example in the [[Man'yōshū]].&lt;ref name="BT43"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|''Yashiro''|社}} is a generic term for shinto shrine like ''jinja''.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BT43"/&gt;
* A {{nihongo|''mori''|杜}} is a place where a ''kami'' is present.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; It can therefore be a shrine and, in fact, the characters 神社, 社 and 杜 can all be read "mori" ("grove").&lt;ref name="BT43"&gt;Sonoda Minoru in ''Breen, Teeuwen'' (2000:43)&lt;/ref&gt; This reading reflects the fact the first shrines were simply [[sacred grove]]s or forests where ''kami'' were present.&lt;ref name="BT43"/&gt;
* The suffix {{nihongo|''-sha'' or ''-ja''|社}}, as in ''Shinmei-sha'' or ''Tenjin-ja'', indicates a minor shrine that has received through the ''[[kanjō]]'' process a ''kami'' from a more important one.&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|''Hokora''/''hokura''|神庫}} is an extremely small shrine of the kind one finds for example along country roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/bts/bts_h.html#hokora Basic Terms of Shinto, ''Hokora''] retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|''Jingū''|神宮}} is a shrine of particularly high status that has a deep relationship with the Imperial household or enshrines an Emperor, as for example in the case of the Ise Jingū and the Meiji Jingū.&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt; The name ''Jingū'' alone, however, can refer only to the Ise Jingū, whose official name is just "Jingū".&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|''Miya''|宮}} indicates a shrine enshrining a special ''kami'' or a member of the Imperial household like the Empress, but there are many examples in which it is used simply as a tradition.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; During the period of state regulation, many ''-miya'' names were changed to ''jinja''.
* {{nihongo|-''gū''|宮}} indicates a shrine enshrining an imperial prince, but there are many examples in which it is used simply as a tradition.&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt;
* A {{nihongo|''taisha''|大社}}(the characters are also read ''ōyashiro'') is literally a "great shrine" that was classified as such under the old system of shrine ranking, the {{nihongo|[[Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines|shakaku]]|社格}}, abolished in 1946.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=260 Myōjin taisha], Encyclopedia of Shinto, retrieved on July 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many shrines carrying that ''shōgō'' adopted it only after the war.&lt;ref name="jinja.jp"/&gt;
* During the [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|Japanese Middle Ages]], shrines started being called with the name ''[[gongen]]'', a term of Buddhist origin.&lt;ref name="sos3"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=790 Gongen shinkō], accessed on October 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Eastern  Japan there are still many Hakusan shrines where the shrine itself is called  ''gongen''.&lt;ref name="sos3"/&gt; Because it represents the application of Buddhist terminology to Shinto ''kami'', its use was legally abolished by the Meiji government with the {{nihongo|[[Shinbutsu bunri|Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order]]|神仏判然令|Shin-butsu Hanzenrei}}, and shrines began to be called ''jinja''.&lt;ref name="sos3"/&gt;

These names are not equivalent in terms of prestige: a ''taisha'' is more prestigious than a ''-gū'', which in turn is more important than a ''jinja''.

==''Kannushi''==
{{main|Kannushi}}
[[Image:Guji0148.jpg|thumb|right|A [[kannushi]]]]
The {{nihongo|''[[kannushi]]''|神主|kami master}} or {{nihongo|''shinshoku''|神職|kami employee}} is a priest responsible for the shrine's maintenance and for officiating ceremonies.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; These two terms were not always [[synonyms]]. Originally a ''kannushi'' was a holy man who could work miracles and who, thanks to purificatory rites, could work as an intermediary between ''kami'' and man, but later the term evolved to being synonymous with ''shinshoku'', that is, a man who works at a shrine and holds religious ceremonies there.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/|title=Kannushi|last=Moriyasu|language=Japanese|first=Jin|website=Nihon Hyakka Zensho|publisher=Shogakukan|accessdate=2009-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfIob8e3?url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/|archivedate=2012-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, most shrines did not have a ''kannushi'' and were maintained by a committee of parishioners called Ujiko ({{lang|ja|氏子}}, clan children). In a ''jinguji'', Buddhist monks had of course to maintain both their shrine and their temple.

{{Nihongo|'''Sumiyoshi-zukuri'''|住吉造}} is an ancient [[Shinto shrine]] architectural style which takes its name from [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]'s ''[[honden]]'' in [[Ōsaka]]. As in the case of the ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'' and ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' styles, its birth predates the arrival in Japan of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].

==History==
Ancient [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] were constructed according to the style of dwellings ([[Izumo Taisha]])&lt;ref name="YY"&gt;Young &amp; Young (2007:50)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ki33"&gt;Kishida (2008:33)&lt;/ref&gt; or storehouses ([[Ise Grand Shrine]]).&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;Fletcher and Cruickshank (1996:724)&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings had [[gabled roof]]s, raised floors, plank walls, and were [[thatching|thatched]] with reed or covered with [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki cypress]] bark.&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt; Such early shrines did not include a space for worship.&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt; Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'', ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' and ''sumiyoshi-zukuri''&lt;ref name="ki34"&gt;Kishida (2008:34)&lt;/ref&gt; They are exemplified by [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] and [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]&lt;ref name="ki35"&gt;Kishida (2008:35)&lt;/ref&gt; respectively and date to before 552.&lt;ref name="ki126"&gt;Kishida (2008:126)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai|式年遷宮祭}}'', the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.&lt;ref name="ki33"/&gt;

==Structure==
The ''honden'' on the grounds at Sumiyoshi Taisha has been designated as a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure]] on the grounds that it is the oldest example of this style of architecture.
The four identical ''honden'' buildings that compose it are 4 ''ken'' wide and 2 ''ken'' deep and have an entrance under one of the [[gable]]s (a characteristic called {{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]-zukuri''|妻入造}}. The roof is simple, doesn't curve upwards at the eaves and is decorated with purely ornamental poles called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' (vertical) and ''[[katsuogi]]'' (horizontal).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209043808/http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89/ Jinja Kenchiku], [[Shogakukan]] Nihon Daihyakka Zensho, accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The building is surrounded by a fence called {{nihongo|[[tamagaki|mizugaki]]|瑞垣}}, in its turn surrounded by another called {{nihongo|''[[tamagaki]]''|玉垣}} (see image in the gallery).&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; There is no veranda, and a short stairway leads to the door.

The interior is divided in two sections, one at the front ({{nihongo|''gejin''|外陣}}) and one at the back ({{nihongo|''naijin''|内陣}}) with a single entrance at the front (see floor plan in the gallery).&lt;ref name="jasu"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sumiyoshizukuri.htm Sumiyoshi-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is simple, but brightly colored: supporting pillars are painted in vermilion and walls in white. 

This style is supposed to have its origin in old palace architecture&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the [[Sumiyoshi Sanjin]] complex in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt;

'''Udjaḥorresnet''' (or '''Wedjaḥorresnet''', and many other variants) was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian high official who lived between the end of the [[26th Dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|27th Dynasty]]. He is mainly known for his efforts in promoting the Egyptian customs to the early [[Achaemenid]] kings of the 27th Dynasty.

We know about his remarkable and controversial career thanks to his [[autobiography]], inscribed on a well known statue depicting him; the statue, commonly called ''Naoforo vaticano'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "Vatican [[Shrine|naophoros]]") was originally placed in the temple of [[Neith]] at [[Sais]] likely in Year 3 of [[Darius I]] (c.519 BCE) and is now exhibited inside the [[Vatican Museums]] (more precisely in the [[Museo Gregoriano Egizio]]) of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, op. cit., p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Hiero|Udjaḥorresnet|&lt;hiero&gt;w-DA-G5-M24-n:t:pr&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=lp}}
Early in his career, during the reigns of [[pharaoh]]s [[Amasis II]] and [[Psamtik III]], Udjahorresnet was a commander of ships (admiral), a [[physician]] and a priest of Neith in Sais.&lt;ref name=rice&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Who is who in Ancient Egypt'', 1999 (2004), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0-203-44328-4}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|defeat at Pelusium in 525 BCE]] and the subsequent conquest of Egypt by [[Cambyses II]], he eventually was relieved from his military duties.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, op. cit., pp.168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, his influence grew unexpectedly under the reign of the foreign kings, Cambyses and his successor Darius I: Udjahorresnet apparently became a sort of [[collaborationist]] for the Persians, managing to enter in the royal court as [[Treasurer (Ancient Egypt)|chancellor]] and [[Archiater|chief physician]]. From his statue is known that he used his influence to make Cambyses acknowledge and respect Egyptian customs.&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; Acculturated by Udjahorresnet, the pharaoh paid homage to the goddess Neith at Sais, not before having driven out many Persian squatters who had settled within the temple; Udjahorresnet himself composed Cambyses' [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], calling him the [[Horus name|Horus]] ''Smatawy'' (”He who unifies the [[Two Lands]]”) and the [[Prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|King of Upper and Lower Egypt]] ''Mesutire'' (“Offspring of [[Ra]]”).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, op. cit., p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After Cambyses' death (522 BCE), Udjahorresnet's mission continued with Darius I: in fact, he even escorted Darius on his return to [[Susa]]&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; and before returning to Egypt, he persuaded the new pharaoh to entrust to him the restoration of ''[[Per-ankh]]'' (“House of Life”), a well known educational and cultural institution in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, op. cit., p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bunson&gt;Bunson, Margaret, ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt''. Infobase Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|1438109970}}, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Udjahorresnet probably died later during Darius' reign. His huge [[shaft tomb]] at [[Abusir]] was excavated between 1980 and 1993, and found looted in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bares, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is still matter of debate if Udjahorresnet was indeed buried here or not;&lt;ref&gt;Bares, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; if not, it is possible that he died in Persia, and his corpse buried here instead of being repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bresciani |first=Edda|authorlink=Edda Bresciani |date=2001 |title=Nove faraoni|trans-title=Nine pharaohs|url= |location=Pisa|publisher=Edizioni Plus, Università di Pisa|page=|isbn=88-8492-095-7|access-date=}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;
