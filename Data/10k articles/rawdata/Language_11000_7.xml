{{Wiktionary}}

{{lang|la|'''Afflatus'''}} is a [[Latin]] term that was derived from [[Cicero]] in {{lang|la|[[De Natura Deorum]]}}, ("The Nature of the Gods") and has been translated as "inspiration".

Cicero's usage was a literalising of "inspiration", which had already become figurative. As "inspiration" had come to mean simply the gathering of a new idea, Cicero reiterated the idea of a rush of unexpected breath, a powerful force that would render the poet helpless and unaware of its origin.

Literally, the Latin {{lang|la|afflatus}} means "to blow upon/toward". It was originally spelt {{lang|la|adflatus}}, made up of {{lang|la|ad}} (to) and {{lang|la|flatus}} (blowing/breathing), the noun form of {{lang|la|flāre}} (to blow). It can be taken to mean "to be blown upon" by a divine wind, like its English equivalent ''inspiration'', which comes from ''inspire'', meaning "to breathe/blow onto". 

In [[English language|English]], {{lang|la|afflatus}} is used for the literal form of inspiration. It generally refers to not the usual sudden originality but the staggering and stunning blow of a new idea, which the recipient may be unable to explain. In [[Romantic literature]] and criticism, in particular, the usage of {{lang|la|afflatus}} was revived for the mystical form of poetic inspiration tied to [[genius (literature)|genius]], such as the story [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] offered for the composition of "[[Kubla Khan]]". The frequent use of the [[Aeolian harp]] as a symbol for the poet was a play on the renewed emphasis on ''afflatus''.

{{lang|la|[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]}} ('Inspired by the Holy Spirit') is an [[encyclical letter]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] dealing with [[Biblical inspiration]] and [[Biblical criticism]]. It lay out his desire to see new translations from the original language instead of the Vulgate.

{{translation WIP|Lenguas amazónicas|Spanish|es}}
 [[File:Tupi languages.png|250px|thumb|The [[Tupian languages|Tupian language family]] is the language family most widely spoken in the Amazon.]] 
'''Amazonian languages''' is the term used to refer to the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] of "Greater Amazonia." This area is significantly larger than the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and extends from the Atlantic coast all the way to the Andes, while its southern border is usually said to be the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. The region is inhabited by societies that share many cultural traits but whose languages are characterized by great diversity. There are about 330 extant languages in Greater Amazonia, almost half of which have fewer than 500 speakers. Meanwhile, only [[Wayuu language|Wayuu]] has greater than 100,000 speakers (about 300,000). Of the 330 total languages, about fifty are [[Language isolate|isolates]], while the remaining ones belong to about 25 different families. Most of the posited families have few members. It is this distribution of many small and historically unrelated speech communities that makes Amazonia one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. The precise reasons for this unusual diversity have not yet been conclusively determined, but it is noteworthy that Amazonian languages seem to have had fewer than 10,000 native speakers even before the [[European colonization of the Americas|invasion of European colonists]] wrought havoc on the societies by which they were spoken. Despite the large-scale diversity, the long-term contact among many of the languages of Greater Amazonia has created similarities between many neighboring languages that are not genetically related.&lt;ref&gt;Epps and Michael, 2015, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous Amazonian people today are bilingual or even monolingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and many Amazonian languages are [[Endangered language|endangered]] as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Linguistic diversity ==
[[File:Arawak-Languages.png|250px|thumb|The [[Arawak languages]] of South America, the second largest family of Amazonian languages. The dark blue shows Southern Arawak languages.]]
[[File:Pano-Takanan languages.png|250px|thumb|[[Pano-Tacanan languages]]: Pano (dark green) and Takana (light green), the points indicating the documented localizations of the languages.]]

A variety of macro-groupings have been suggested for the Amazonian languages families, like the one suggested by [[Joseph Greenberg]]; however, these theories are not widely supported.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Aikhenvald, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Often, similarities between languages are due to language contact rather than due to genetic relationship. This illustrates that a lack of contact between communities is not necessary to maintain linguistic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Epps and Michael, 2015, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A vast amount of linguistic research is presently being undertaken to better understand the relations between the languages of Greater Amazonia.

Of the above-mentioned 25 or so language families, the following six are the major ones:

* [[Tupi languages|Tupian]]: consisting of 70-80 languages. The languages belonging to the largest sub-group, Tupí-Guaraní, are spoken almost across the entire northern half of South America. Their most prominent typological feature is an intricate system of person marking on verbs.
* [[Macro-Jê languages|Macro-Jê]]: consisting of 30-40 languages, largely spoken in the southeast of the region, with some outliers closer to the Basin. The languages have unusually large [[vowel]] and unusually small [[consonant]] inventories.
* [[Cariban languages|Cariban]]: consisting of 40-50 languages. They are mostly found in the very north of South America, with some outliers closer to the Basin.
* [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]: consisting of 70-80 languages. They cluster in the south, west and northwest of the region. Some important typological features are possession marking on nouns and split [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitivity]] based on verb type (active vs. stative).
* [[Panoan languages|Panoan]]: consisting of 30-40 languages, mostly in the south and southwest of the region. Some of their main characteristics are [[Morphosyntactic alignment|split alignment]] and complex [[Switch-reference|switch reference]] systems.
* [[Tucanoan languages|Tukanoan]]: consisting of 20-30 languages, which are overwhelmingly spoken in the southern half of Colombia. The languages are known, amongst other things, for their extensive [[Evidentiality|evidential]] and [[Classifier (linguistics)|noun classifier]] systems.

[[Multilingualism]] was (and is) the norm among Amazonian Indians. In fact, the value that many inhabitants of Amazonia assign to multilingualism is sometimes seen as a reason for the longevity of the linguistic diversity in the region.

== History of the Amazonian villages ==



The majority of the Amazon Basin and the [[Orinoco]] are the lowlands of a [[tropical rainforest]], rich in edible vegetables and animals. Archeologists estimate that this territory has been populated for less than 12,000 years.  The entire population of the area would have arrived only a couple millennia ago.  The principal source of [[protein]] is fish, supplemented by hunting [[pecari]]s, [[tapir]]s, [[rodent]]s and [[monkey]]s. The domestication of plants, at first concentrated in the bitter [[Cassava|yuca]] root, dates back 5,000 years.  [[Neolithic revolution|Agricultural expansion]], with its version of [[shifting cultivation|slash and burn cultivation]], began in the mountainsides of the western [[Andes]] and was brought to the majority of the main rivers in the Amazon.  The villages based on [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] were pushed to the more inaccessible areas.

Each linguistic group tends to share certain characteristics relative to the type of territory they occupy, the [[mode of production]] and the [[material culture]]. For example, practically all the [[ethnic groups]] of the Arawakan, Cariban, and Tupi families occupy areas of tropical rainforest, extensively use agriculture and make canoes, hammocks, and ceramics. On the other hand, the Gê ethnic groups usually live in [[grasslands]], have little agriculture and do not make canoes, hammocks, or ceramics. Nevertheless, they have a more complex social organization. Scattered among the farming villages, in the heart of the jungle, live hunter-gatherers that belong to minor language families, such as the [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup]], [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]] and [[Guajiboan languages|Guajiboan]] families, more or less the direct descendents of the first hunter-gatherers.

Some groups, especially the agriculturally based ones, have been particularly aggressive and are prone to attack their neighbours. Nevertheless, symbiotic relations exist between different groups: for example the Tucanoans, who are agricultural based, trade with the Nadahup, who are hunter-gatherers.  The latter provide animal meat from the jungle and poison obtained from fish, and in exchange receive tapioca flour from the Tucanoan plantations, as well as ceramics.  Even so, the Nadahup are considered "inferior" by the Tucanoans and are not considered in inter-ethnic marriage as the Tucanoans do with other ethnic groups.

The [[Europe]]ans invaded the region in the 16th century, quickly taking control of the coastal areas and the main rivers as far as they were navigable.  The indigenous population began to drastically diminish around 1900; it is estimated that the population was only a 10th of what it had been in 1500 (estimated at between 2 and 5 million).&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Dixon (1999), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of this loss of life was involuntary, due to European diseases the native Amazonian population didn't have immunity to. The Europeans also used the native Amazonians as slaves. There are testimonies of the Europeans navigating upriver from the mouth of the Amazon, capturing entire tribes and carrying them downriver to the plantations where they worked under difficult conditions, dying in a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Hemming, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans, due to their superior weapons, were able to take whatever piece of land they wanted.  Previously the incursions of the colonists were motivated by the possession of resources like [[rubber]] or certain minerals, that frequently were preceded by violent actions against the indigenous Amazonians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21890">'''Anioma people''' are located primarily in [[Delta State]], [[Nigeria]]. They are referred to as Western Igbo, being separated from the Igbo in the east by the River Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://etimes.com.ng/anioma-igbos-western-nigeria/|title=ANIOMA : WE ARE IGBOS OF WESTERN NIGERIA|last=|first=|date=3 August  2017|accessdate=7 August  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make up about one-third of Delta State and, for administrative purposes, are referred to as “Delta North,” thus contrasting Delta Central and Delta South, areas densely inhabited by the [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], Isoko, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], and [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]], the other ethnic groups inhabiting Delta State. The Anioma region has a total population of 1,114,055, not including those Anioma communities located outside of Delta State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Federal Republic of Nigeria, Official gazette |issue=24 |year=2007 |volume= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Anioma populace make up small numbers in neighbouring [[Edo State]], specifically in Igbanke, Ozo and Ekpon. The term “Anioma” means "good land" in Igbo language and coincidentally, it is an acronym derived from the four original local government areas that make up Anioma, i.e., (A) for Aniocha, (N) for Ndokwa, (I) for Ika and (O) for Oshimili, M and A being common denominators found in the original four local government areas. The coinage was made by the founding father, Chief Dennis Osadebay, in 1951 and has remained the preferred indigenous name by which the people collectively refer to themselves. Sentimentally, there are also Anioma communities in parts of certain towns in [[Anambra State]], namely [[Onitsha]], Ogbaru, Akwukwu Obosi, Ozobulu and [[Ogidi, Anambra State|Ogidi]]. They can also be found in the [[Oguta]] and [[Ndoni]] areas of [[Imo State|Imo]] and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, respectively. Anioma people, who had one identity prior to the coming of the Europeans, were divided after they lost the [[Ekumeku War]] against the British imperialism, in 1914, after 31 years of fighting.

The Ekemeku War was the longest resistance against British imperialism in Nigeria.

== Geography ==
Anioma is located in the areas of the West Basin of [[River Niger]], south-south within the present Delta state of Nigeria, it encompasses a land mass of about 6,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the political matters of the state, Anioma is often referred to as Delta North as against the other peoples known as the Delta South and Delta Central in the same state. Anioma is bounded on the East by [[Anambra State]], south-east by Imo and [[Rivers State]]s, south [[Bayelsa State]], south-west by [[Isoko region|Isoko]], west by [[Urhobo people]], north-west by [[Edo State]] and north by [[Kogi State]]. Anioma may therefore be regarded as highly contiguous to very many neighbours ethnic groups. The people have drawn experiences as a result of lying contiguous to numerous other towns, communities and states which characterizes the Anioma as one of the most peaceful regions in the country. (See Kunirum Osia, Anioma Association Inc, USA, May 24, 1997)

== Languages ==
The Federal Government of Nigeria makes a distinction between Igbo, Ukwuani and Ika on cultural grounds and delineates them the status of distinct ethnic groups, yet the respective languages form part of what is known as the [[Igboid languages|Igbo language cluster]]. Nigerians can always refer to the constitution should the need arise. A pure dialect of the Igbo language, [[Enuani dialect|Enuani]], and two [[Igboid languages]], [[Ukwuani-Aboh-Ndoni language|Ukwuani]] and [[Ika language (Nigeria)|Ika]], are the primary indigenous languages. There are also small numbers of [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]], Ozzara and [[Igala language|Igala]]-speaking communities.

=== Traditional life and culture ===
Anioma social structure is dominated by the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of ''uno'', ''eboh', and ''idumu'', which are major blood lineages; while ''ogbe'' and ''obodo'' are open and much more political. ''Uno'' is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was ''Eboh'', which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and the grandchildren. The ''Ogbe'' is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the ''Idumu'' and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks like a small town; this is the ''Obodo''.&lt;ref name="Anioma"&gt;Ohadike, Don (1994). ''Anioma: A Social History of the Western Igbo People''. {{ISBN|0-8214-1073-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nigerian-Biafran war ===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}
The Biafran war caused disaster for the people of Anioma in several ways. One was the federal recapture of the Midwestern region after it was invaded and occupied by the Biafran troops commanded by Colonel Victor Banjo on August 12, 1967. Here Biafran troops encountered the Nigerian troops attempting to take over Onitsha which also caused disaster for the people of this region. The Federal troops stationed at Umunede on the main Benin-Asaba road and pushing through Isele-Uku, finally took over the Anioma town of [[Asaba, Nigeria|Asaba]] on 8 October 1967. The special Biafran force headed by Colonel Ogbugo Kalu which later grew into the 63 Brigade, from across the Niger moved northwards and westwards to take over other Anioma towns. Ogwashi-Uku, Ibusa and Oku were also reportedly captured with many enemy stores and equipment also found by the Biafran troops, many of these equipment which could not be brought into Biafra were destroyed. However, the Biafran Army was able to re-establish their presence once again in the region.

"Colonel Nwawo was quickly dispatched to assemble whatever troops he could find and organise them into a fighting force. While 2 Division was carrying out massive public execution of all adult males in Asaba..."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander A. Madiebo (1980). The Nigerian Revolution and the Biafran War. {{ISBN|978-156-117-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This region at the time of the Nigerian civil war was invaded and declared the "Republic of Benin" which lasted six weeks (8 August-20 September 1967) In essence, the Anioma region was volatile to both Biafran and Nigerian troops during the Nigerian civil war.

Some of the Biafran war commanders were of Anioma origin but the most famous of them all were Colonel Joseph Oseloka "Hannibal" Achuzie (Retd) and Capt. Anuku, who was the commander of Biafran Navy. Achuzie was a militiaman who played active roles in the invasion of Midwestern region which included his home town, Asaba. Achuzie can again be remembered for the very active roles he played in the defense of Onitsha against series of attacking efforts made by Colonel Murtala Mohammed to take over the city and constitute threat to the Biafran bids. He was often accused of propaganda gem. There was also Colonel (Later Brigadier) Conrad Nwawo another Anioma indigene who was Administrative Officer, Biafran Army Headquarters, former Divisional commander of the Biafran Army and a one time Nigerian Defence Attache in London. Others are Major Ananaba who effectively defended the main Uzuakoli-Umuahia road which was effectively achieved, Colonel Michael Okwechime was another Division commander of the Biafran army and once the Adjutant-General. Colonel Ben Nwajei formerly of the 53 Brigade was the first commander of the 14 Division, as the commander of 53 Brigade he never lost any battle for a relatively short time. He finally captured Oguta for Biafra. He was soon removed from command of 14 Division and all military duties by Colonel Ojukwu after he lost Owerri and told some members of delegates that visited him that it was so because he had no ammunition. Ojukwu accused him of demoralizing the civilians and attached him to Civilian Fuel Directorate. There still numerous numbers of Anioma indigenes who commanded the Biafran Army.

== Civil War Genocides ==
The genocide of Anioma by Gen. Murtala Mohammed and Major Gen. Ibrahim Haruna (Retd), during the Nigerian Civil War started on the 21 of September, 1967 on the recapture of Benin City from the Biafrans sweeping large Anioma towns of Asaba, Ogwashi-Uku, Ibusa, Otutu, Ishiagu, Igbodo, Aboh and Ushisha but the massacres carried out in Asaba remains the most severe and unforgettable in which mostly helpless women, youths and children were killed in rapidity by the federal troops. It has been noted that the massacres were organized and mostly carried out under the supervision of Maj Gen Ibrahim Haruna (Retd) and the reason was that Gen Murtala Muhammed was aggrieved and suspicious of the Anioma as having aided their Igbo kinsmen to invade the Mid west.

Gen. Yakubu Gowon (Retd) the then Head of State would later apologize to the Igbo community, while Major-General Ibrahim Haruna, the General officer Commanding (GOC) Two Division of the Army during the Civil War while testifying at the Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission Panel aka Oputa Panel held in 2004, insistently maintained that he had no regret for the Asaba massacres in which the Igbo were killed by his troops since it was motivated by sense of duty to protect the unity of the country, he stated this under cross examination by Ohanaeze Ndiigbo group.

=== State creation ===
After the independence of [[Nigeria]],  few Nigerian groups desired their own identity separate from forced colonial political and social institutions. The Anioma were no exception. As a wave of demand for state creation in the 1970s permeated the Nigerian political landscape, included in this movement was the yearning for Ndi-Anioma, land of the Aniomas as a separate political state for the Anioma people.&lt;ref name ="Anioma" /&gt; This agitation gave birth to the demand of Anioma State, which though remains unrealized. In 2007, the National Assembly of Nigeria announced its willingness to allow the creation of one more State for the Igbo people, a committee to adopt a State for the Igbo was set up and led by Chief Emmnauel Iwuanyawu, this committee which failed in adopting any State for the region, threw out Anioma, stating that the creation of Anioma State would amount to an additional State for South-South region of the country. The Anioma people have renewed this agitation once again following another recent announcement by the National Assembly that seven more States may be created in the country to create balance among the various geopolitical regions in the country.Among pro Anioma Activist is Henry Ogochukwu have been promoting the creation of Anioma State through Anioma Peoples Association. Henry Ogochukwu is the President General of Anioma Peoples Association

== Anioma in Delta State ==
Asaba (an Anioma city) has been the capital of Delta State since the creation of the state in August 1991, by the then Military president, Gen [[Ibrahim Babangida]] (Rtd). This development continues to generate criticism from the people of the Delta south notably Professor Itsay Sagay, an Itsekiri, Dr. Temi Akporhonor and Professor Obaro Ikime backed by Urhobo Historical Society. In an article in The Guardian, August 15, 2002 Professor Itsay Sagay openly campaigned for the relocation of the state capital from the Anioma city of Asaba to the town of Warri in Delta south. This was preceded by the reaction of Dr Cyril Uchenna Gwam published in the defunct Post Express Newspaper of June 1999 and several internet forums in reaction to the publication of Obaro Ikime in which he argued amongst others that centrality factor had never been the major criteria for the location of State or Federal capitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waado.org/organization/uhs/debates/DeltaStateCapital/Gwam.html Warri]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also followed by another article be Clem Okonji published in The Guardian, July 8, 2002 in which he maintained that Asaba had come to stay as the capital of Delta State. He further stressed that the peoples constituting the state are all located within the Delta region. Reactions in favour of the stay of Asaba as the capital of the state has since been supported by Henry Ogochukwu, Michael Ozah, Emeka Esogbue, Tony Odiadi, Emma Okocha and others alike. Dr. Temi Akporhonor would call for a political arrangement whereby governorship power would remain with what he termed 'The real Deltan' because according to him the capital of the state is located in the Igbo speaking town of Anioma. (Whither Delta state?, The Guardian, May 23, 2002) The strong resistance of this call has ensured that Asaba remains the state capital. Though all would unilaterally admit that a separate creation of another state from the present Delta State to constitute Anioma with the capital at Asaba, and Delta with state capital at Warri is necessary.

== Anioma in Ohanaeze Ndigbo ==
On November 29, 2008, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex(though, non igbo in affiliation) Igbo socio-cultural organization announced the election of Ambassador Ralph Uwechue, an Anioma indigene as its President-General to pilot its affairs for the next two years. He was nominated by Delta State branch of Ohanaeze as their consensus candidate in a resolution reached at the palace of the Asagba of Asaba after the position was zoned to Anioma, one of the seven units that make up Ohanaeze Ndigbo. But in his acceptance speech, Uwechue expressed gratitude to all and called for unity among Igbo, which is said to possess the talent to and wealth it would take to take to address national issues, while also noting that the position given to him has created confidence that the Igbo from Delta State are accepted as brothers and sisters in Ohanaeze. Finally, he promised not to disappoint Anioma people as the race is for Anioma home and abroad.

== Economic prospects ==
Anioma has abundant oil deposits particularly in Ndokwa land, Akumazi, Umunede, Ute-okpu, Ute-erume, Ute-Ogbeje, Ekuku-Agbor, Nsukwa, Olodu, Ewulu, Idumuesah, Ejeme and other Anioma regions. Records also indicate that oil was discovered in Ubulu-Uno and Ubulu-Uku in 1958 by Shell B P Petroleum Company two years after the first discovery was made in Oloibiri now in Bayelsa state, but exploration of the oil was not carried out by the Federal Government. Anioma region is also rich in other mineral resources such as rubber.

== Ethnic identity crisis ==
In recent decades, a significant number of Anioma indigenes have grown resentful towards the wider Igbo community and questioned whether or not they are “truly” Igbo, with many histories of Anioma towns being allegedly re-written to showcase a non-Igbo wave of migration and ethno-linguistic background. Many claim descent from the ancient Benin Kingdom, a movement which has been garnering more and more support following the stigmatisation that followed the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. Introspection of the Igbo denial in Delta State, however, may generally reveal that it is strongest in the [[Ukwuani people|Ndokwa]] and [[Ika people|Ika]] territories and weakest among the Enuani, the latter of whom inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili local government areas. Many theories have been postulated to explain this occurrence. Of particular interest, it has been suggested that the Ika were an aboriginal Igbo clan, with later migrations of settlers from the Benin Kingdom, owing to close proximity. The absorption of [[Edoid languages|Edoid]]-speaking ethnic groups into Ika territory may have resulted in the attendant strong influence on the aborigines, in cultural and linguistic terms, providing fertile soil for Igbo denial.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EuvtjMVuy-IC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=igbo+food+hot&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5uOL_ktnTAhWmIMAKHQa5AOwQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=igbo%20food%20hot&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The same phenomenon may apply to the Ukwuani but, by virtue of less proximity with Edo State, to a lesser extent. Although many Ika and Ukwuani people maintain distinct cultural identities, they yet speak Igbo languages. The term Igbo itself has been conceived by many as a linguistic classification, encompassing all bia-speaking clans and with ethnic identity falling secondary to linguistic designation. As earlier mentioned, they are officially recognised as distinct ethnic groups from the Igbo.

'''Asemic writing''' is a [[word]]less open [[Semantics|semantic]] form of [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works &amp; Interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemic.net/|title=Tim Gaze. Asemic Magazine|work=Asemic Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/11/tim-gaze/|title=Full Of Crow Tim Gaze interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''asemic'' means "having no specific semantic content", or "without the smallest unit of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;From [[Greek language|Greek]]: asemos (αόεμoβ) = without sign, unmarked, obscure, or ignoble.&lt;/ref&gt; With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an [[abstract art|abstract work of art]]. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses [[Writing|text]] and [[image]] into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to [[free writing]] or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across [[linguistic]] understanding; an asemic text may be "read" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Satu Kaikkonen interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple meanings for the same [[symbol]]ism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have [[zero]] meaning, [[infinity|infinite]] meanings, or its meaning can [[Evolution (term)|evolve]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samplekanon.com/?p=1946/|title=Samplekannon interview with Michael Jacobson|work=Samplekannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to [[translate]] and [[Exploration|explore]] an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.

In 1997 [[Visual poetry|visual poets]] Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first applied the word ''asemic'' to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galatearesurrects2018.blogspot.com/2018/02/featured-essay-by-jim-leftwich.html|title=Galatea Resurrects: The Nearness Of Asemic Writing by Jim Leftwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then began to distribute them to [[poetry]] [[magazines]] both [[online]] and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual [[asemia]] as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/[[art movement]]. It has especially grown in the early part of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term "pansemic" to describe this type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slowforward.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/jim-leftwich-asemic-writing-definitions-and-contexts-1998-2016/|title=Jim Leftwich: “asemic writing definitions and contexts, 1998-2016”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as author [[Travis Jeppesen]] have found the term ''asemic'' to be problematic because "it seems to infer writing with no meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleek-mag.com/2016/12/02/hans-ulrich-obrist-zhang-jeppesen-miralda/|title=Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation About Inventing New Languages|work=Sleek Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of asemic writing==
[[File:Crazyzhangxu.jpg|thumb|An example of Zhang Xu's calligraphy]]

Asemic writing exists in many different forms. It is often created with a [[pen]] or [[brush]], but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by [[photography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/arts-and-entertainment/2018-04-03-cape-town-artist-andrew-van-der-merwe-carves-out-beach-calligraphy-niche/|title=Cape Town artist Andrew van der Merwe carves out beach calligraphy niche|work=BusinessDay|author=Thelma Mort}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to works on [[canvas]], [[paper]], [[computer]] images, and [[animations]]. The key to asemic writing is that even though it is traditionally "unreadable" it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's [[eye]]. Various asemic writing includes [[pictograms]], or [[ideograms]] the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an [[abstract expressionist]] scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehandstand.org/archive//january2006/articles/nonismacemicart.htm|author=Jaime Morrison|title=Nonism: Asemic Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often [[calligraphic]] in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can be understood through aesthetic intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works &amp; Interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. [[ciphers]], [[wildstyle]], etc.). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE, Michael Jacobson interview|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influences on asemic writing are illegible, [[Constructed language|invented]], or primal [[manuscript|script]]s ([[cave painting]]s, [[doodle]]s, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global [[Postliterate society|postliterate]] style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are [[alien language in science fiction|alien languages in science fiction]], [[artistic languages]], [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] (magick), [[undeciphered scripts]], and [[graffiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/special-sections/cryptotexts/michael-jacobson-interview#.VBCXA2Nrucs|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Michael Jacobson interview| accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses for asemic writing include mental and [[Creativity|creative]] [[idea]] stimulation, [[non-verbal communication]], [[hoaxes]], and general authorial self-expression.

===History===

Offset printing, 440 copies.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Asemic writing occurs in [[avant-garde]] literature and art with strong roots in the [[Proto-writing|earliest forms of writing]]. The history of today's asemic movement stems from two [[China|Chinese]] calligraphers: "crazy" [[Zhang Xu]], a [[Tang Dynasty]] (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger "drunk" [[monk]] [[Huaisu]] who also excelled at illegible [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforbookarts.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-sense-of-asemic-writing.html|title=Center for Book Arts: Making Sense of Asemic Writing|author=Sarah Nicholls|publisher=Centerforbookarts.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese people|Japanese]] calligraphers subsequently expanded upon Chinese abstract calligraphic expression by [[Hitsuzendō]] (the way of [[Zen]] through brush), allowing their works to move past formal presentation and "breathe with the vitality of eternal experience". During the 18th century the [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Laurence Sterne]] included asemic lines in his novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759), adding the graphic device to help tell the [[Narrative|story]] "in a tolerably straight line". In the 1920s [[Man Ray]], who was influenced by [[Dada]], created an early work of wordless writing with his poem ''[[Paris]], Mai 1924'', which is nothing more than dashes on a page. Later in the 1920s, [[Henri Michaux]], who was influenced by Asian calligraphy, [[Surrealism]], and [[Automatic writing]], began to create wordless works such as ''Alphabet'' (1925) and ''Narration'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natalieferrisdotcom.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/leaking-the-squalls-the-art-and-letters-of-henri-michaux/|title=‘Leaking the Squalls': The Art and Letters of Henri Michaux|work=natalie ferris|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as "interior Gestures". The writer and artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]] was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece ''Indian Story'' (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is [[Brion Gysin]] (whose calligraphy was influenced by [[Arabic]] and Japanese calligraphy), [[Isidore Isou]] (who founded [[Lettrisme]]), [[Cy Twombly]] (a former US Army [[Cryptologist]]), and [[Morita Shiryū]]/[[Bokujin-kai]] Group (Ink Human Society)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vermillionmedia.blogspot.com/2013/08/calligraphy-bokujin-kai-group-and.html|title= Calligraphy The Bokujin-Kai Group and Shiryu Morita|publisher=infinity of utterances kathryn simon phd}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom expanded writing into illegible, abstract, and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. [[Mira Schendel]] was an artist from [[Brazil]] who created many illegible works over the course of her life, for example her piece ''Archaic Writing'' (1964). [[Mirtha Dermisache]] is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/witness-mirtha-dermisache|title=Witness Mirtha Dermisache|publisher=Jacket2.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when [[:fr:Alain Satié|Alain Satié]] released his work ''Écrit en prose ou L'Œuvre hypergraphique'' which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Satie, Écrit en Prose, Éditions PSI, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[León Ferrari]] was another artist/poet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as ''Escritura'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printmag.com/illustration/the-writing-of-art-the-art-of-writing/|author=Buzz Poole|title=The Writing of Art, The Art of Writing|publisher=Printmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1974 saw the release of [[Max Ernst]]'s work ''Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage à Dorothea Tanning''; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and [[Derek Beaulieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Barthes]] was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-écritures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/12/05/vispo/|title=Vispo|author=Tierra Innovation|publisher=Theparisreview.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drawingsonwriting.org/page25.htm|title=Drawings on Writing|publisher=Drawingsonwriting.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of asemic writing is [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' (1981). Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the [[Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles]] held on May 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Stanley|date=2010|title=To Read Images Not Words: Computer-Aided Analysis of the Handwriting in the Codex Seraphinianus (MSc dissertation)|publisher=North Carolina State University at Raleigh|pages=8–9|accessdate=9 April 2012|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6460/1/etd.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s [[Chinese people|Chinese]] artist [[Xu Bing]] created ''Tiānshū'', or ''[[A Book from the Sky]]'' which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crab.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/free-writing/|title=Free writing|work=stalker|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw artist [[Gu Wenda]] begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in [[Xi'an]] in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lacon4.wordpress.com/tag/asemic-writing-2/|title=asemic writing - Donna Tull|publisher=Lacon4.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as "Calligraphy-ism" came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims to
develop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In [[Vietnam]] during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared. To this group of young artists, “Wordless” means that which cannot be said, that which is both before and beyond the specificity of naming. To be without words is saying nothing and saying everything.

===Specialized publications===
2013 saw the release of ''An Anthology of Asemic Handwriting'' (Uitgeverij), which has over a hundred artists represented from many corners of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverij.cc/product/an-anthology-of-asemic-handwriting/ |title=An Anthology Of Asemic Handwriting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic writing has also received mention and space in ''The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/lastvispoanthology/ |title=The Last Vispo Anthology|work= Crag Hill &amp; Nico Vassilakis (editors)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a full issue of [[William Allegrezza]]'s poetry journal ''Moria'' was focused on the participants and theory of asemic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moriapoetry.com/i134v141.html|title=moria|publisher=Moriapoetry.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, John Moore Williams published an asemic issue of his journal ''The Bleed.''

Satu Kaikkonen, a contemporary asemic artist/writer from [[Finland]], had this to say about asemic writing:

{{Quotation|As a creator of asemics, I consider myself an explorer and a global storyteller. Asemic art, after all, represents a kind of language that's universal and lodged deep within our unconscious minds. Regardless of language identity, each human's initial attempts to create written language look very similar and, often, quite asemic. In this way, asemic art can serve as a sort of common language—albeit an abstract, post-literate one—that we can use to understand one another regardless of background or nationality. For all its limping-functionality, semantic language all too often divides and asymmetrically empowers while asemic texts can't help but put people of all literacy-levels and identities on equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|title=SCRIPTjr.nl|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Sterling]] comments about asemic writing on his [[Wired magazine]] blog ''Beyond the Beyond'': {{Quotation|Writing that doesn’t have any actual writing in it whatsoever. You would think that this must be some kind of ultimate literary frontier, a frozen [[Antarctica]] of writing entirely devoid of literary content, but I wonder.

What is “beyond asemic writing”? Maybe a neural brain-scan of an author *thinking about* asemic writing. Maybe *generative asemic writing*. Maybe “asemic biomimicry”. Maybe nanoasemic writing inscribed with atomic force microscopes by Artificial Intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/ |title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing |date=July 13, 2009 |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |work=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==False writing systems==
'''False writing systems''' are artificially constructed [[alphabet]]s or scripts used (sometimes within the context of a [[false document]]) to convey a degree of [[wikt:verisimilitude|verisimilitude]]. Examples of this include alien dialogue in comic strips, [[animated cartoons]], and [[graphic novel]]s (such as [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', and the ''[[Valérian and Laureline]]'' series).
The script in [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s 1981 ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' was confirmed by the author to have no occult meaning. The [[Voynich manuscript]], a mysterious work on which the ''Codex Seraphinianus'' was likely based, uses an [[undeciphered writing system]] that some speculated to be false.

[http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192109 "Bankim Chandra: The First Prominent Bengali Novelist"], ''The Daily Star'', 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was the composer of ''[[Vande Mataram]]'', originally in [[Sanskrit]] ''[[stotra]]'' [[National personification|personifying]] India as a [[mother goddess]] and inspiring the activists during the [[Indian Freedom Movement|Indian Independence Movement]]. Chattopadhyay wrote thirteen novels and many serious, serio-comic, satirical, scientific and critical treaties in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. His works were widely translated into other regional languages of India as well as in English.

Chattopadhyay is widely regarded as a key figure in literary renaissance of Bengal as well as the broader Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Some of his writings, including novels, essays and commentaries, were a breakaway from traditional verse-oriented Indian writings, and provided an inspiration for authors across India.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

When [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] decided to start a patriotic journal in August 1906, he named it ''Vande Mataram'', after Chattopadhyay's song. [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] also published a journal of the same name.

==Biography==
Chattopadhyay was born in the village Kanthalpara in the town of [[Naihati|North 24 Parganas, Near Naihati]], in an orthodox [[Bengali Brahmins|Bengali Brahmin]] family, the youngest of three brothers, to Yadav Chandra Chattopadhyaya and Durgadebi. His father, a government official, went on to become the [[Deputy Collector]] of [[Midnapur]]. One of his brothers,  [[Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was also a novelist and he is known for his famous book "Palamau". Bankim Chandra and his elder brother both had their schooling from [[Midnapore Collegiate School]] (then Governmental Zilla School), where he wrote his first poem.

He was educated at the [[Hooghly Mohsin College]] (founded by Bengali philanthropist [[Muhammad Mohsin]]) and later at [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], graduating with a degree in Arts in 1858. He later attended the [[University of Calcutta]] and was one of the two candidates who passed the final exam to become the school's first graduates.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul  |year=2012 |chapter=Chattopadhyay, Bankimchandra |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chattopadhyay,_Bankimchandra |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later obtained a degree in Law as well, in 1869.

In 1858, he was appointed a Deputy Collector (the same type of position held by his father) of [[Jessore]]. He went on to become a Deputy Magistrate, retiring from government service in 1891. His years at work were replete with incidents that brought him into conflict with the ruling British. He was, however, made a Companion in the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/Authors/Bankimchandra_Chattopadhyay.aspx |title=Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay - Penguin Books India |accessdate=26 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128084214/http://penguinbooksindia.com/Authors/Bankimchandra_Chattopadhyay.aspx |archivedate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
Chattopadhyay's earliest publications were in [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]]'s weekly newspaper ''[[Sangbad Prabhakar]]''.&lt;ref name="bankim"&gt;[http://bengalonline.sitemarvel.com/bankimchandra.asp Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (Chatterjee)], from BengalOnline.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the model of Ishwar Chandra Gupta, he began his literary career as a writer of verse. His majestic talents showed him other directions, and turned to fiction. His first attempt was a novel in Bengali submitted for a declared prize. He did not win the prize, and the [[Novella|novelette]] was never published. His first fiction to appear in print was ''Rajmohan's Wife''. It was written in English and is regarded as the first Indian novel to be written in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Meenakshi|title=Early Novels in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPJ7jqVSl34C&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=rajmohan;s+wife&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3L_yqwoxKJ&amp;sig=PNtQ9HKaWzW_trugWPDf6KKC3FA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio1ry6iqnSAhXCSSYKHfQeCtY4ChDoAQhMMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=rajmohan%3Bs%20wife&amp;f=false|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|language=en|date=1 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He couldn't gain any praise by writing his novel in English, realizing the fact that he couldn't have a smooth literary career if he wrote in English, he turned his attention towards Bengali literature. ''Durgeshnondini'', his first Bengali romance and the first ever novel in Bengali, was published in 1865.

''[[Kapalkundala]]'' (1866) is Chattopadhyay's first major publication. The heroine of this novel, named after the [[mendicant]] woman in Bhavabhuti's ''Malatimadhava'', is modelled partly after [[Kalidasa]]'s [[Shakuntala]] and partly after [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Miranda (Shakespeare)|Miranda]]''. The hero of this novel was Nabakumar.  However, the partial similarities are only inferential analysis by critics, and Chattopadhyay's heroine may be completely his original. He had chosen Dariapur in [[Contai]] Subdivision as the background of this famous novel.

His next romance, ''Mrinalini'' (1869), marks his first attempt to set his story against a larger historical context. This book marks the shift from Chattopadhyay's early career, in which he was strictly a writer of romances, to a later period in which he aimed to stimulate the intellect of the Bengali speaking people and bring about a cultural renaissance of Bengali literature.

Chattopadhyay started publishing a monthly literary magazine ''[[Bangadarshan]]'' in April 1872, the first edition of which was filled almost entirely with his own work. The magazine carried serialised novels, stories, humorous sketches, historical and miscellaneous essays, informative articles, religious discourses, literary criticisms and reviews. ''Vishabriksha'' (The Poison Tree, 1873) is the first novel of Chattopadhyay that appeared serially in ''Bangodarshan''.

''Bangodarshan'' went out of circulation after four years. It was later revived by his brother, Sanjeeb Chandra Chattopadhyay.

Chattopadhyay's next major novel was ''Chandrasekhar'' (1877), which contains two largely unrelated parallel plots. Although the scene is once shifted back to eighteenth century, the novel is not historical. His next novel was ''Rajani'' (1877), which features an autobiographical plot, with a blind girl in the title role. Autobiographical plots had been used in [[Wilkie Collins]]' "A Woman in White", and a precedent for blind girl in a central role existed in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s Nydia in "The Last Days of Pompeii", though the similarities of ''Rajani'' with these publications end there.

In ''Krishnakanter Will'' (Krishnakanta's Will, 1878) Chattopadhyay produced a complex plot. It was a brilliant depiction of contemporary India and its lifestyle and corruption. In that complexity, critics saw resemblance to Western novels.

One of the many novels of Chattopadhyay that are entitled to be termed as historical fiction is ''Rajsimha'' (1881, rewritten and enlarged 1893). ''[[Anandamath]]'' (The Abbey of Bliss, 1882) is a [[political fiction|political novel]] which depicts a Sannyasi (Hindu ascetic) army fighting the British soldiers. The book calls for the rise of Indian nationalism. The novel was also the source of the song [[Vande Mataram]] (I worship my Motherland for she truly is my mother) which, set to music by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was taken up by many Indian nationalists, and is now the National Song of India. The plot of the novel is loosely set on the [[Sannyasi Rebellion]]. He imagined untrained Sannyasi soldiers fighting and beating the highly experienced British Army; ultimately however, he accepted that the British cannot be defeated. He categorically claimed that the British are not the enemy but friends; the Muslims are the real enemy. Hence, this novel is also termed communal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/what-is-vandana-vande-mataram/articleshow/11652292.cms|title=किसकी वंदना है वंदे मातरम - Navbharat Times|date=2012-01-28|work=Navbharat Times|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel first appeared in serial form in [[Bangadarshan]], the literary magazine that Chattopadhyay founded in 1872. Vande Mataram became prominent during the Swadeshi movement, which was sparked by Lord Curzon's attempt to partition Bengal into a Hindu majority West and a Muslim majority East. Drawing from the Shakti tradition of Bengali Hindus, Chattopadhyay personified India as a Mother goddess, which gave the song a Hindu undertone that would prove to be problematic for some Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mazumdar|first1=Aurobindo|title=Vande Mataram and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YBhMfAgxIkC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=vande+mataram+partition+of+bengal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WAvmnoKEex&amp;sig=q0x6sdnFDJ5p_z0ELEpJp9Kn_Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS692qhKnSAhXCbSYKHfvSB1kQ6AEISDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=vande%20mataram%20partition%20of%20bengal&amp;f=false|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chattopadhyay's next novel, ''[[Devi Chaudhurani]]'', was published in 1884. His final novel, ''Sitaram'' (1886), tells the story of a local Hindu lord, torn between his wife and the woman he desires but unable to attain, makes a series of blunders and takes arrogant, self-destructive decisions. Finally, he must confront his self and motivate the few loyal soldiers that stand between his estate and the Muslim ''Nabab''s army about to take over.

Chattopadhyay's humorous sketches are his best known works other than his novels. ''Kamalakanter Daptar'' (From the Desk of Kamalakanta, 1875; enlarged as ''Kamalakanta'', 1885) contains half humorous and half serious sketches. Kamalakanta is an opium-addict, similar to De Quincey's ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]'', but Bankim Chandra goes much beyond with his deft handling of sarcastic, political messages that Kamalakanta delivers.

Chattopadhyay's commentary on the Gita was published eight years after his death and contained his comments up to the 19th Verse of Chapter 4. Through this work, he attempted to reassure Hindus who were increasingly being exposed to Western ideas. His belief was, that there was "No serious hope of progress in India except in Hinduism-reformed, regenerated and purified". He wrote an extensive commentary on two verses in particular - 2.12 and 2.13 - which deal with the immortality of the soul and its reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;Minor Robert(1986) Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita. State University of NY press. {{ISBN|0-88706-298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, like Pramathnath Bishi, consider Chattopadhyay as the best novelist in Bangla literature. Their belief is that few writers in world literature have excelled in both philosophy and art as Bankim has done. They have felt that in a colonised nation Bankim could not overlook politics. He was one of the first intellectuals who wrote in a British colony, accepting and rejecting the status at the same time. Bishi also rejects the division of Bankim in 'Bankim the artist' and 'Bankim the moralist' – for Bankim must be read as a whole. The artist in Bankim cannot be understood unless you understand him as a moralist and vice versa.

==Personal life==
Chattopadhyay was married at eleven. He had a son with his first wife, who died in 1859. He later married Rajalakshmi Devi with whom he had three daughters.

==Quotes==
*Once [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]], playing on the meaning of Bankim (''Bent A Little''), asked him what it was that had bent him. Bankim Chandra jokingly replied that it was the kick from the Englishman's shoe for he was a well known critic of the British and he used his excellent sense of humour and comedy to do so.
*After the ''Vishabriksha'' (''The Poison Tree'') was published in 1873, the magazine, Punch wrote,

'''Bustan''' ({{lang-fa|بوستان}}; {{lang-ar|بُسْتَان}}) is an agricultural [[garden]] - a farm near the house which includes fruit trees, [[vegetable]] seedlings, shrubs, and spices. The word in Persian  means ''a place of smell'' in English. Use of the word probably began during the Muslim empire and is equivalent to use the words' gene 'and' Pardes Jewish sources. Orchard was built usually near water, so common in the [[Middle East]] is characterized by a minority of rainfall.

In Modern orchard irrigation systems designed to have efficient consumption of water, and they include aids such as computers and pipettes. Computers can determine the time of irrigation, the irrigation time and amount of water each area in the garden. For example, irrigation can be done at night, preventing evaporation of water.

[[Orchard]] is fenced compound because it contains fruits and vegetables. If trees were planted around the orchard would be that protection from winds, which may harm the trees.

With good planning, one can gather vegetables and fruit orchard that could satisfy the needs of the family during the year. Sometimes it can be grown on an area of trees, shrubs and vegetables - depending on the nature of the ground, which determines how its possible utilization.

The '''Corrected d-exponent''', also known as cd-exponent or more correctly dc-exponent (d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent) as used in [[mud logging]] and formation pore pressure analysis in the [[oil industry]], is an extrapolation of certain drilling parameters to estimate a [[pressure gradient]] for pore pressure evaluation while drilling. Normally this is done in over-pressured zones, but most [[mud logging]] contracts require it to be done at all times. It is regarded as one of the best tools for pore pressure evaluation. See '''[[mud log]]''' for an example of the '''corrected d-exponent''' plotted on a mud log. The parameter is an extension ("correction", hence the "&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;" notation) to the '''d-exponent''' method previously used for estimating formation pore pressures. The extension consists of a correction for the mud weight in use, compared to "standard" mud for the region.

The parameters used to calculate '''d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent''' values are: [[rate of penetration|drilling rate]] (ROP), rotary speed, weight on bit, bit diameter and mud weight; it is plotted against drilled depth.

==Theory==
As a drill bit bores into rock, it will gradually encounter denser formations and therefore slower '''''[[rate of penetration|rates of penetration]]'''''. (Though there are exceptions such as sands that normally drill faster, or faulted and uplifted formations). The general trend is normally a gradually slowing ''rate of penetration''.

Sands may have above them an impermeable layer of formation, normally [[shale]], that may be hundreds of metres thick. When gas or fluids migrate up through the sand and reach this impermeable layer, pressure may build up in the sand and push up against the impermeable layer of shale. Over time the pressure can becomes so great that it begins to fracture the shale, making it weaker and easier to penetrate by a drill bit. When a hole is drilled down towards this sand, it will gradually begin to experience faster ''rates of penetration'' as it drills through this shale gets closer to the high-pressure sand. It is this trend that the dc-exponent exposes. An examination of the fractured shale that is being drilled will reveal increasingly larger [[wikt:concave|concave]] pieces.  This is where the term [[pressure shale]] comes from.

==Calculation==
The basic drillability exponent was published in 1966 by Jorden &amp; Shirley relating the action of tricone bit teeth to an inherent characteristic of the rock, the ''drillability'', or 'd' :

d = log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(R/60N)/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(12W/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;D)

where :
R=ROP (ft/hr)     N=RPM (rev/min)    W=WOB (lbs)       D=bit size (ins)

In 1971, Rehm and McClendon (1971) defined the corrected d exponent to account for changes in mud weight where  d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent is defined as

d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent = MW1/MW2 * ''d''

and where :

dc      =   modified d exponent    ;   MW1  =    normal pressure gradient  ; MW2  =   mud weight (preferably ECD)
ECD, Equivalent circulating density is the hydrodynamic pressure experienced at the cutting face of the bit due to the combination of mud density, fluid viscosity, borehole wall friction and cuttings load act to increase the pressure. This can be estimated by calculations, but it has become common in recent years to use a direct-measuring annulus probe in the [[Measurement while drilling|MWD]] tools string (if there is one).

==Caveats==
As with all matters relating to pore pressure analysis, the method cannot be applied blindly. In particular, models and constants need to be adjusted to the particular basin being drilled. The method was developed for the delta of the Mississippi/ Missouri river system in the United States, and works reasonably well there. However, basins with different sediment sources cannot be assumed to have the same compaction profiles (because they may have different depositional clay mineralogy). Basins with different pore fluid chemistry will have differing hydrostatic pressure profiles, leading to different d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent profiles. The presence of post-depositional carbonate cements in mudrocks will make formations appear abnormally hard to drill. In particular, the use of PDC-type bits with a shearing cutting action (instead of the chipping action that Jorden &amp; Shirley (1966) assumed in their chip-holddown model) will lead to d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent plots that differ from tricone or bi-cone bits in the same formations.
While doing wildcat exploration work in a region, the method can be applied "by the book", but after drilling the first well, one would need to carefully re-evaluate the data collected to try to improve the model for the particular basin in question.
While it can be used successfully, one must always validate the information presented by d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent plots by examining multiple other pore pressure indicators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1025">{{no sources|date=October 2018}}In [[landlord–tenant law]], a '''notice to cure or quit''' is issued by a [[landlord]] when a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] performs actions in violation of a [[lease]].  The notice gives a tenant the option of either fixing the offending problem or vacating the rental property.  If the tenant continues performing the action(s) and does not move out, they can be [[eviction|evicted]].

The term is sometimes also used in the [[debt collection|debt-collection]] business to indicate to an account in arrears that action may be taken against the account holder if the debt is not rectified.  The account holder may be sent a "Notice to cure or quit" to let them know the status of the account.

Depending on the jurisdiction, such a notice may be legally required before further action may take place, such as (in the case of landlord vs. tenant) being able to file an eviction suit.

'''David ben Naphtali Fränkel''' or '''David Hirschel Fränkel''' ({{lang-he|דוד בן נפתלי הירש פרנקל}}; {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1704 – 4 April 1762), was a [[Jew]]ish [[Germany|German]] [[rabbi]].

==Biography==
Born in Berlin, for a time he was rabbi of [[Dessau]]. He became [[chief rabbi]] of Berlin in 1742. Fränkel exercised a great influence as teacher over [[Moses Mendelssohn]], who followed him to the Prussian capital. It was Fränkel who introduced Mendelssohn to [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Moreh Nevuchim]],'' and it was he, too, who befriended his poor disciple, procuring for him free lodging and a few days' board every week in the house of [[Hayyim Bamberger]]. His grandson was [[Jonah Frankel (German Jewish businessman)|Jonah Frankel]], the German Jewish businessman, banker and philanthropist.

As a [[Talmudist]], Frankel was almost the first to devote himself to a study of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], which had been largely neglected.

==Writings==
He gave a great impetus to the study of this work by his ''Korban ha-Edah,'' "The Communal Sacrifice"&lt;ref&gt;[[Menachem Elon]] ''Jewish law: history, sources, principles'' Volume 3  1994 "Like [[Elijah of Fulda]], he divided his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud into two sections: an explanatory commentary that he called Korban ha-Edah [The Communal Sacrifice], and a second and distinct section consisting of novellae, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; a commentary in three parts (part 1, on the order [[Mo'ed]], Dessau, 1743; part 2, on [[Nashim]], Berlin, 1757 (see http://www.hebrewbooks.org/49590); part 3, on [[Nezikin]], ibid 1760). His additional notes on the Jerusalem Talmud and on Maimonides were published, together with the preceding work, under the title ''Shirei Korban'' (Dessau, 1743).&lt;ref&gt;''A guide to the Jerusalem Talmud'' Heshey Zelcer Page 158  2002 "His other commentary on the Yerushalmi is Shirei Korban (See below). R. Fraenkel published his work with the text of the Yerushalmi in three volumes: Volume I in Dessau, 1743, and Volumes II and III in Berlin, in 1757 and in 1762."&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the turmoil of the Seven Years' War, he delivered „Eine Danck-Predigt wegen des wichtigen und wundervollen Siegs : welchen Sr. Königl. Maj. in Preussen am 5ten December, 1757, über die, der Anzahl nach ihm weit überlegene, gesamte oesterreichische Armee in Schlesien, preisswürdig erfochten". Gehalten am Sabbath den 10ten desselben Monats in der Juden Schule zu Berlin, von David Hirschel Fränckel, Ober Rabbi ["A Thanksgiving Sermon, for the Important and Astonishing Victory Obtain’d on 5 December 1757, by the Glorious King of Prussia, over the United and Far Superior Forces of the Austrians in Silesia." Preach’d on the Sabbath of the 10th of the Said Month, at the Synagogue of the Jews in Berlin, by David Hirschel Franckel, Arch-Rabbi].

'''Demotic Greek''' ({{lang-el|δημοτική γλώσσα}}, ''dimotikí glóssa'' {{IPA-el|ðimotiˈci|}}, "language of the people") or '''dimotiki''' ({{lang-el|δημοτική}}, ''dimotikí''), is the [[Modern Greek|modern]] [[vernacular]] form of the [[Greek language]]. The term has been in use since 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Babiniotis|first= Georgios|title= Lexiko tis neas ellinikis glossas|trans-title=Dictionary of the new Greek language|language= Greek|year= 2002|location= Athens|page= 474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Demotic'' refers particularly to the form of the language that evolved naturally from [[Ancient Greek]], in opposition to the artificially archaic [[Katharevousa]], which was the official standard until 1976. The two complemented each other in a typical example of [[diglossia]] until the resolution of the [[Greek language question]] in favour of Demotic.

==Basic features of Demotic==
Demotic Greek differs from varieties of Ancient Greek and learned forms inherited from the same in several important ways. Syntactically, it favors [[parataxis]] over [[Conjunction (grammar)#Subordinating conjunctions |subordination]]. It also heavily employs [[Redundancy (linguistics) |redundancy]], such as {{wikt-lang|el|μικρό}} {{wikt-lang|el|κοριτσάκι}} (''small little girl'') and {{wikt-lang|el|ξανακοιμήθηκε}} {{wikt-lang|el|πάλι}} (''he went back to sleep again''). Somewhat in connection with this, Demotic employs the [[Diminutive#Greek |diminutive]] with great frequency,&lt;ref name="pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp |XI}} to the point that many Demotic forms are in effect [[grammatical gender |neuter]] diminutives of ancient words, especially irregular ones, e.g. {{wikt-lang|el|νησί}} or {{lang|el|νήσιον}} (''island'') from ancient {{lang|grc|ἡ νῆσος}} (''island'').

Greek noun declensions underwent considerable alteration, with irregular and less productive forms being gradually replaced by more regular forms based on the old one: {{lang|el|άντρας}} (''man'') for ancient {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}}.  Another feature was the merging of classical accusative and nominative forms, distinguishing them only by their definite articles, which continued to be declined as in Ancient Greek. This was especially common with nouns of the third declension, such as {{wikt-lang|grc|πατρίς}} (''hometown'', ''fatherland'') which became nominative {{lang|el|η πατρίδα}}, accusative {{lang|el|την πατρίδα}} in Demotic.&lt;ref name= "pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp|X}}  Another feature of the evolution of Demotic was the near-extinction of the genitive plural, which was revived in Katharevousa and is now productive again in Demotic.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A derivative feature of this regularisation of noun forms in Demotic is that the words of most native vocabulary end in a vowel, or in a very restricted set of consonants: ''s'' and ''n'' ({{lang|el|[[sigma |ς]], [[Nu (letter) |ν]]}}). Exceptions are foreign loans like {{lang|el|μπαρ}} (''bar''), and learned forms {{lang|el|ύδωρ}} (from Ancient Greek {{wikt-lang|grc|ὕδωρ}}, ''water''), and [[Interjection |exclamations]] like {{wikt-lang|el|αχ|αχ!}} (''ach!'', ''oh!'')  Many dialects  go so far as to append the vowel -''e'' ({{lang|el|ε}}) to third-person verb forms: {{wikt-lang|el|γράφουνε}} instead of {{wikt-lang|el|γράφουν}} (''they write''). Word-final [[consonant cluster]]s are also rare, again mainly occurring in learned discourse and via foreign loans: {{wikt-lang|el|άνθραξ}} (''coal'' – scientific) and {{wikt-lang|el|μποξ}} (''boxing'' – sport).&lt;ref name="comprehensivegreek"&gt;{{cite book |author1-link = Peter Mackridge| last1 = Mackridge | first1 = Peter |last2= Philippaki-Warburton|first2=Irene|date=1997|title=Greek: a Comprehensive Grammar of the Modern Language|location=New York |publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-41510002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |8–9}}

[[Indirect object]] is usually expressed by {{lang|el|σε}} with the [[accusative case |accusative]] where Ancient Greek had {{lang|grc|εἰς}} for accusative of motion toward; bare {{lang|el|σε}} is used without the article to express indefiniteness duration of time, or contracted with the definite article for [[definiteness]] especially with regard to place where or motion toward; or with the [[genitive case|genitive]], especially with regard to means or instrument.&lt;ref name="pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp|X}} Using one noun with an unmarked accusative article-noun phrase followed by {{lang|el|σε}} contracted with the definite article of a second noun distinguishes between definite direct and indirect objects, whether real or figurative, e.g. «{{lang|el|βάζω το χέρι μου στο ευαγγέλιο}}» or  «...{{lang|el|στη φωτιά}}» (lit. ''I put my hand upon the Gospel'' or ''...in the fire'', i.e. ''I swear it's true'', ''I'm sure of it''). By contrast, Katharevousa continued to employ the ancestral form, {{lang|el|εἰς}}, in place of {{lang|el|σε}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The verb system inherited from Ancient Greek gradually evolved, with the old future, perfect and pluperfect tenses gradually disappearing; they were replaced with conjugated forms of the verb {{lang|el|έχω}} (''I have'') to denote these tenses instead. The future tenses and the subjunctive and optative moods, and eventually the infinitive, were replaced by the modal/tense auxiliaries {{lang|el|θα}} and {{lang|el|να}} used with new simplified and fused future/subjunctive forms.&lt;ref name="pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp|X}} In contrast to this, Katharevousa employed older perfective forms and infinitives that had been for the most part lost in the spoken language{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, but in other cases it employed the same [[aorist]] or perfective forms as the spoken language, but preferred an archaizing form of the present indicative, e.g. {{wikt-lang|el|κρύπτω}} for Demotic {{wikt-lang|el|κρύβω}} (''I hide''), which both have the same aorist form {{lang|el|έκρυψα}}.&lt;ref name="pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp|XI}}

Demotic Greek also borrowed a significant number of words from other languages such as Italian and Turkish, something which katharevousa avoided.

==Demotic and "Standard Modern Greek"==
Demotic is often thought to be the same as the [[Modern Greek]] language, but these two terms are not completely synonymous. Although Demotic is a term applied to the naturally evolved colloquial language of the Greeks, the Modern Greek language of today ([[Standard Modern Greek]]; {{lang|el|Νεοελληνική Κοινή}}) is more like a fusion of Demotic and Katharevousa. It is not wrong to call the spoken language of today Demotic, but such a terminology ignores the fact that Modern Greek contains—especially in a written or official form—numerous words, grammatical forms and phonetical features that did not exist in colloquial speech and only entered the language through its archaic variety. Besides, even the most archaic forms of Katharevousa were never thought of as Ancient Greek, but were always called "Modern Greek", so that the phrase "Modern Greek" applies to ''Demotic'', ''Standard Modern Greek'', and even ''Katharevousa''.

==Examples of Modern Greek features that did not exist in Demotic==
The following examples are intended to demonstrate Katharevousa's features in Modern Greek. They were not present in traditional Demotic and only entered the modern language through Katharevousa (sometimes as [[neologism]]s), where they are used mostly in writing (for instance, in newspapers), but also orally, especially words and fixed expressions are both understood and actively used also by non-educated speakers. In some cases, the Demotic form is used for literal or practical meanings, while the ''Katharevousa'' is used for figurative or specialized meanings: e.g. {{wikt-lang|el|φτερό}} for the wing or feather of a bird, but {{wikt-lang|el|πτέρυξ}} for the wing of a building or airplane or arm of an organisation.&lt;ref name="pringpocket"/&gt;{{rp|180}}{{rp|203}}

===Words and fixed expressions===
* {{wikt-lang|el|ενδιαφέρων}} (''interesting'')
* {{wikt-lang|el|τουλάχιστον}} (''at least'')

===Phonological features===
Modern Greek features many letter combinations that were avoided in classical Demotic:
* {{lang|el|-πτ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|'''πτ'''αίσμα}} "misdemeanor"); Demotic preferred {{lang|el|-φτ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|'''φτ'''αίω}} "to err || to be guilty")
* {{lang|el|-κτ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|'''κτ'''ίσμα}} "building, structure"); Demotic preferred {{lang|el|-χτ-}} [e.g. {{lang|el|'''χτ'''ίστης}} "(stone)mason"]
* {{lang|el|-ευδ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|ψ'''εύδ'''ος}} "falsity, lie"); Demotic preferred {{lang|el|-ευτ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|ψ'''εύτ'''ης}} "liar")
* {{lang|el|-σθ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|ηρκέ'''σθ'''ην}} / {{lang|el|αρκέ'''σθ'''ηκα}} "I was sufficed / satisfied"); Demotic preferred {{lang|el|-στ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|αρκέ'''στ'''ηκα}})
* {{lang|el|-χθ-}} (e.g. {{lang|el|(ε)'''χθ'''ές}} "yesterday"); Demotic preferred {{lang|el|-χτ-}} [e.g. {{lang|el|(ε)'''χτ'''ές}}]
* etc.

Native Greek speakers often make mistakes in these "educated" aspects of their language; one can often see mistakes like {{lang|el|προήχθη}} instead of {{lang|el|προήχθην}} (''I've been promoted''), {{lang|el|λόγου του ότι/λόγο το ότι}} instead of {{lang|el|λόγω του ότι}} (''{{not a typo|due to the fact that}}''), {{lang|el|τον ενδιαφέρον άνθρωπο}} instead of {{lang|el|τον ενδιαφέροντα άνθρωπο}} (''the interesting person''), {{lang|el|οι ενδιαφέροντες γυναίκες}} instead of {{lang|el|οι ενδιαφέρουσες γυναίκες}} (''the interesting women''), {{lang|el|ο ψήφος}} instead of {{lang|el|η ψήφος}} (''the vote''). However, the educated ones do not make mistakes often.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Radical demoticism==
One of the most radical proponents of a language that was to be cleansed of all "educated" elements was [[Ioannis Psycharis|Giannis Psycharis]], who lived in France and gained fame through his work ''My Voyage'' (''{{lang|el|Το ταξίδι μου}}'', 1888). Not only did Psycharis propagate the exclusive use of the naturally grown colloquial language, but he actually opted for simplifying the morphology of [[Katharevousa]] forms [[linguistic prescription |prescription]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

For instance, Psycharis proposed to change the form of the neuter noun {{lang|el|το φως}} gen. {{lang|el|του φωτός}} (=''light'') into {{lang|el|το φώτο}} (gen. {{lang|el|του φώτου}}). Such radical forms had occasional precedent in Renaissance attempts to write in Demotic, and reflected Psycharis' linguistic training as a [[Neogrammarian]], mistrusting the possibility of exceptions in linguistic evolution. Moreover, Psycharis also advocated spelling reform, which would have meant abolishing the six different ways to write the vowel /i/ and all instances of double consonants. Therefore, he wrote his own name as {{lang|el|Γιάνης}}, instead of {{lang|el|Γιάννης}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The standard form of Demotic that developed over the next few decades made more compromises with [[Katharevousa]] (as is reflected in the contemporary standard), and despite acrimony between the "psycharist" ({{lang|el|ψυχαρικοί}}) radicals and the moderates, the radical strand was ultimately marginalised.  When Demotic was made official in 1976, the legislation stated that the Demotic used would be "without extremist and dialectal forms"&lt;ref name= "demoticlaw"&gt;{{ cite Greek law | law = 390 | art= 2 | clause=2 | date = 1976-04-30 | en = Concerning the organisation and administration of General Instruction | el = Περὶ ὀργανόσεως καὶ διοκήσεως τῆς Γενικῆς Ἐκπαιδεύσεως | url = http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wEE8HdDZpIXTHdtvSoClrL8qZcZTSsH80R5MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx3UnKl3nP8NxdnJ5r9cmWyJWelDvWS_18kAEhATUkJb0x1LIdQ163nV9K--td6SIueaOB3dwn5DlLtM05wKk00lXiaYh-_UdMb_Akrg5rqok}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18609">The English [[Protestant Reformation]] was imposed by the [[English Crown]], and submission to its essential points was exacted by the State with '''post-Reformation oaths'''. With some solemnity, by oath, test, or formal declaration, English churchmen and others were required to assent to the religious changes, starting in the sixteenth century and continuing for more than 250 years.

==Oath of Royal Supremacy (1534, renewed 1559)==
{{main|Acts of Supremacy|Oath of Supremacy|Submission of the Clergy}}

This oath was imposed in March 1534 (26 Henry VIII, c. 1). The title "Supreme Head" had first been introduced by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] into a decree of [[Convocation]], 11 February 1531; and had been resisted by the clergy. Though it did not as yet have any religious significance, and might be a matter of compliment only, it might, they feared, receive another interpretation later. But acting under the advice of [[John Fisher]], [[William Warham|Warham]], and others, they submitted after adding the conditional phrase, ''quantum per legem Dei licet''. Two years later a change had taken place, which had previously seemed inconceivable. The king had actually broken with the pope, and Parliament had enacted that the king should be "taken, accepted and reputed the only supreme head on Earth of the church of England" by every one of his subjects. But no formula for the oath was laid down in the Act, and great differences seem to have prevailed in practice. Many long "acknowledgments of supremacy" are extant&lt;ref&gt;Camm, "English Martyrs", I, 401.&lt;/ref&gt; but it would seem that most people were only asked to swear to the Succession, that is to the king's marriage with [[Anne Boleyn]], which the pope condemned, and which therefore involved the supremacy, though the form of the [[Oath of Succession]] preserved in The Lords' Journals, refers to the supremacy only lightly. We do not know what was its form, when Fisher and [[Thomas More]] refused to sign it. They were ready to accept the succession of Anne Boleyn's children, but refused the supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgett, infra 264-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of Supremacy was repealed in 1554 by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] (1 Ph. and M. c. 8) and revived by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] in 1559 ([[Act of Supremacy 1559|1 Eliz. c. 1]]). The formula then adopted ran:

:"I, A.B., do utterly testify and declare in my conscience, that the Queen's Highness is the only supreme Governor of the Realm . . . as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or causes as Temporal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. So help me God."

This was not to be proposed at once to every one; but was to be taken by the clergy, and by all holding office under the Crown; by others, when asked. This moderation in exacting the oath helped to prevent an outcry against it, and enabled the Government to deal with the recalcitrant in detail. Many years elapsed, for instance, before it was imposed on the graduates of the universities. The last laws passed by Elizabeth against Catholics (1592-3) enjoined a new test for [[Recusant]]s (35 Eliz. c. 2). It comprised (1) A confession of "grievous offence against God in contemning her Majesty's Government"; (2) Royal Supremacy; (3) A clause against dispensations and dissimulations, perhaps the first of its sort in oaths of this class.

Elizabeth's "settlement of religion" (see [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]) had included compromise with the [[Puritan]] party, as they were to become, and they were not in love with the supremacy. An informal test was used, asking the suspected person whether he would fight against the pope, if he sent an army to restore Catholicism. The Catholics called this the "bloody question". There was no law to enforce an answer, there was no specific penalty for refusal.

Towards the end of Elizabeth's reign, a split began in the Catholic ranks on this subject. Some of the priests who had joined in the [[Archpriest Controversy]] and Appeal against the archpriest [[George Blackwell]] had afterwards presented to Elizabeth a "Protestation of Allegiance".&lt;ref&gt;Tierney-Dodd, infra, iii, Ap. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Declarations of loyalty there had been before in plenty: those made by the martyrs being often extraordinarily touching. But the signatories of 1603, perhaps stimulated by the [[Cisalpinism|Cisalpine]] ideas, for the Protestation was drawn up in Paris, besides protesting their loyalty, went on to withhold from the pope any possible exercise of the [[deposing power]]. Before this, Catholic loyalists had only denied the validity of the deposition pronounced by [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]].

==Oath of Allegiance of James I (1606)==
{{main|Oath of Allegiance of James I of England}}

==Oath of Abjuration under the Commonwealth (1643)==

When the Puritan party had gained the upper hand during the [[English Civil War|civil wars]], the exaction of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance fell into desuetude, and they were repealed by the Act of February, 1650, and their place taken by an "engagement of allegiance" to the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. An "Oath of Abjuration was passed 19 August 1643, and afterwards, in 1656, reissued.

Everyone was to be "adjudged a Papist" who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the recusant's goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right. In practice the enactments were sparingly enforced. They checked the gallicanizing party among the English Catholics, which had at first been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which is stated (Reusch, 335) to have been condemned anew about this time by [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]. The chief writer on the Catholic side was the lawyer [[John Austin (1613-1669)|John Austin]], who generally used the pseudonym William Birchley.  The oath was also used against Quakers who refused any oath.

==The Test Oath (1672, 1678)==

(Also known as the ''Declaration of Attestation Oath''.) The first Parliament after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] revived the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, which were taken on 14 July 1660. The Catholics in England being at first in some favour at Court, managed, as a rule, to escape taking it. In Ireland the old controversy was revived through an address to the Crown, called "The Irish Remonstrance", which emphasized the principles of the condemned Oath of Allegiance. It had been drawn up by a Capuchin friar (who afterwards left the order), called [[Peter Valesius Walsh]], who published many books in its defence, which publications were eventually placed on the Index.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Maziere Brady]], "Catholic Hierarchy", Rome, 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion of [[James II of England|James]], then Duke of York, the jealousy of the Protestant party increased, and in 1672 a Test Act was carried by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], which compelled all holders of office under the Crown to make a short "Declaration against Transubstantiation", viz., to swear that "there is not any transubstantiation in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, . . . at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever" (25 Chas. II, c. 2). This test was effective: James resigned his post of Lord High Admiral. But when the country and the Parliament had gone mad over [[Popish Plot|Oates's plot]] (named for [[Titus Oates]]), 1678, a much longer and more insulting test was devised, which added a further clause that "The invocation of the virgin Mary, or any Saint and the Sacrifice of the Mass . . . are superstitious and idolatrous . . . and that I make this declaration without any evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation whatsoever, and without any dispensation already granted me by the pope, &amp;c., &amp;c. (30 Chas. II, ii. 1). In modern times, the formula has become notorious (as we shall see) under the title of "the King's Declaration". At the time it was appointed for office holders and the members of both Houses, except the Duke of York. On the death of [[Charles II of England|Charles]], [[James II of England|James II]] succeeded, and he would no doubt have gladly abolished the anti-Catholic oaths altogether. But he never had the opportunity of bringing the project before Parliament. Of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance we hear less in this reign, but the Test was the subject of constant discussion, for its form and scope had been expressly intended to hamper a reform such as James was instituting. He freed himself, however, more or less from it by the Dispensing Power, especially after the declaration of the judges, June, 1686, that it was contrary to the principles of the constitution to prevent the Crown from using the services of any of its subjects when they were needed. But the Revolution of 1688 quickly brought the Test back into greater vogue than ever. The first Parliament summoned after the triumph of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] added a clause to the Bill of Rights, which was then passed, by which the Sovereign was himself to take the Declaration (1 W. &amp; M., sess. 1, c. 8). By this unworthy device no Catholic could ever be admitted to accept the new regime, without renouncing his faith. This law marks the consummation of English anti-Catholic legislation.

==The Irish Oath of 1774 to Catholic Emancipation, 1829==

In 1770 [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]] had proposed to free Catholic soldiers from the obligations of the Test, but in vain. In 1774, however, it was necessary to pacify Canada, and the [[Quebec Act]] was passed, the first measure of toleration for Catholics sanctioned by Parliament since the days of the Tudor [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]. Soon after began the [[war of American Independence]], the difficulties of which gradually awakened English statesmen to the need of reconciling Catholics. The Irish Government took the first step by undoing William III's work of joining the profession of fidelity to the sovereign with the rejection of papal authority. In 1774 an oath was proposed of allegiance to King George (§ 1) and rejection of the Pretender (§ 2), but without prejudice to the pope's spiritual authority, or to any dogma of the Faith. The alleged malpractice of "no faith with heretics" was renounced (§ 3), so was the deposing power (§ 4), but without the objectionable words, impious, damnable and heretical." The "temporal and civil jurisdiction of the pope, direct and indirect within the realm" was also abjured (§ 5), and the promise was given that no dispensation from this oath should be considered valid (§ 6). This Irish Oath, of 1774, was accepted by the legislative authorities as proof of loyalty, and it was freely taken, though several clauses were infelicitously worded, though no advantage accrued from so doing. In 1778 however, the first Relief Bill, also called Sir George Savile's Act (after [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]]), to relieve the English Catholics from the worst consequences of the penal laws, came before the English Parliament, and in it was embodied the Irish Oath (18 George III, c. 60). This Act was passed with little difficulty, and the oath was taken without remonstrance by the clergy of all schools.

The relief given by the Bill of 1778 was so imperfect that further legislation was soon called for, and now the disadvantages of the system of tests were acutely felt. A committee of lay Catholics, with Gallican proclivities, who afterwards characteristically called themselves the Cisalpine Club were negotiating with the Government (see ). To them it was represented that if more concessions were required more assurances should be given. They were accordingly presented with a long "Protest", which not only rejected the alleged malpractices, already disowned by the Irish Oath, but declaimed against them and others of the same kind in strong but untheological language. It reintroduced, for instance, the objectionable terms "impious, heretical and damnable" of James's Oath of Allegiance. That complications might have ensued from signing such a document was not difficult to foresee. Nevertheless, the committee insisted (1) that words would be understood in a broad popular way, and (2) that, to obtain the Relief Act, it must be signed instantly. To prevent such a misfortune, it was freely signed by laity and clergy, and by the four vicars Apostolic, but two of these recalled their names. When, however, the signatures had been obtained, the new Relief Bill was brought forward by Government, with an oath annexed founded on the Protest (hence called the "Protestation Oath"), which excluded from relief those who would not swear to it, and accept the name of "Protesting Catholic Dissenters". [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]], later a bishop, argued against it.

The Second Relief Act, therefore, passed (1791) without changing the previous oath, or the name of Catholics. Though the Emancipation Bill was eventually carried without any tests, this was not foreseen at first. The Catholic Committee continued its endeavours for disarming Protestant prejudices, but their proposals (like the [[Royal veto of the appointment of bishops|Veto]]) often savoured of Gallicanism. So too did the oath annexed to the bill proposed in 1813, which from its length was styled the "Theological Oath". Eventually, owing to the growing influence exercised by [[Daniel O'Connell]] and the Irish, Catholic Emancipation was granted without any tests at all in 1829.

==Repeal of the Statutory Oaths against Catholicism (1867-1910)==

The Relief Bills, hitherto mentioned, were generally measures of relief only, leaving the old statutes, oaths, and tests still on the Statute Book, and some of the chief officers of State had still to take them. The actual repeal of the disused tests and oaths of [[William III of England|William III]] took place later.

In 1867, during the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the Declaration was repealed (30, 31 Vict., c. 75). After this, the only person bound to pronounce the oath was the king himself at the commencement of his reign. In 1871 the Promissory Oaths Bill removed all the old Oaths of Allegiance (34, 35 Vict., c. 48). In 1891 the first attempt was made by [[Lord Herries]] in the House of Lords to get rid of the king's Declaration, but the amendments offered by Government were so insignificant that the Catholics themselves voted against their being proposed at all.

In 1901 strong resolutions were passed against its retention by the [[House of Commons of Canada]], as also by its hierarchy, and these were emphasized by similar petitions from the hierarchies of [[Australia]], and the Catholics of the English colonies. In 1904, 1905, and 1908 bills or motions to the same effect were introduced by [[Baron Braye|Lord Braye]], [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Lord Grey]], [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Lord Llandaff]], the [[Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], and [[John Redmond|Mr. Redmond]], but without the desired effect. After the death of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], however, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] is believed to have urged the Government to bring in a repealing Act. This was done and public opinion, after some wavering, finally declared itself strongly on the side of the Bill, which was carried through both Houses by large majorities, and received [[Royal Assent]] on 3 August 1910, thus removing the last anti-Catholic oath or declaration from the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]].

==History of approval by the Bush administration==
Almost immediately after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Bush administration officials conferring by video link from bunkers decided to treat the attacks as acts of war, rather than merely crimes.&lt;ref name = "Yoo NPR interview"&gt;{{cite news |author=Frontline |title=Interview with John Yoo: The Torture Question |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/torture/interviews/yoo.html |quote= |work=[[NPR]] |date=December 15, 2011 |accessdate=2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The question arose: were captured prisoners to be treated as prisoners of war? Officials including Justice Department lawyer [[John Yoo]] recommended classifying them as "detainees" outside the protection of the [[Geneva Conventions]] or any other domestic or military law, and incarcerating them in special prisons instead of the barracks-like "prisoner-of-war camp you saw in [[Hogan's Heroes]] or [[Stalag 17]]."&lt;ref name = "Yoo NPR interview"/&gt; On September 17, 2001, President Bush signed a still-classified directive giving the CIA the power to secretly imprison and interrogate detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David J.

As early as November 2001, the CIA general counsel began considering the legality of torture, writing that "the Israeli example" (using physical force against hundreds of detainees) could serve as "a possible basis for arguing . . . torture was necessary to prevent imminent, significant, physical harm to persons, where there is no other available means to prevent the harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Joshua Keating|title=What America Learned About torture from Israel and Britain|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/12/15/what_america_learned_about_torture_from_israel_and_britain.html|quote= |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the SERE affiliate and two other sources familiar with the program, after September 11 several [[psychologist]]s versed in SERE techniques began advising interrogators at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere. Some of these psychologists essentially "tried to [[reverse-engineer]]" the SERE program, as the affiliate put it. "They took good knowledge and used it in a bad way", another of the sources said. Interrogators and [[BSCT]] members at Guantánamo adopted coercive techniques similar to those employed in the SERE program.&lt;ref name="Mayer SERE"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/11/the-experiment-3 |title=The Experiment – The military trains people to withstand interrogation.

A bipartisan report released in 2008 stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a February 2002 memorandum signed by President [[George W. Bush]], stating that the [[Third Geneva Convention]] guaranteeing humane treatment to [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] did not apply to [[al-Qaeda]] or [[Taliban]] detainees, and a December 2002 memo signed by former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], approving the use of "aggressive techniques" against detainees held at [[Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp|Guantanamo Bay]], as key factors that lead to the extensive abuses.&lt;ref name="bipartisan-report-2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/12/us-detainee-abuses-approved-by-senior.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216032248/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/12/us-detainee-abuses-approved-by-senior.php |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |title=US detainee abuses approved by senior officials: Senate report |first=Devin |last=Montgomery |work=[[JURIST]] |date=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the Bush administration's February 2002 memorandum had, in fact, stated that only al-Qaeda detainees were not covered by the Geneva Conventions. That same order held that Taliban detainees would be entitled to treatment under [[Geneva Conventions#Common Article 3 relating to Non-International Armed Conflict|Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]].

[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation.]]

A Congressional bipartisan report in December 2008&lt;ref name="bipartisan-report-2008"/&gt; established that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA and the U.S. military were directly adapted from the training techniques used to prepare special forces personnel to resist interrogation by enemies that torture and abuse prisoners. The techniques included [[Nudity#Imposed nudity|forced nudity]], painful stress positions, sleep deprivation, and until 2003, waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:WaterboardWithCanKhmerRouge.jpg|thumb|300px|Waterboard on display at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]: prisoners' feet were shackled to the bar on the right, wrists restrained by shackles on the left. Water was poured over the face using the [[watering can]]]] According to [[ABC News]],&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866| title=CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described| journal=ABC News| date=November 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; former and current CIA officials have come forward to reveal details of interrogation techniques authorized in the CIA. These include:

#[[Waterboarding]]: The prisoner is bound to a [[Trendelenburg position|declined board]], feet raised and head slightly below the feet. Material is wrapped over the prisoner's face and water is poured over them, [[asphyxiating]] the prisoner.
#[[Hypothermia#Water|Hypothermia]]: The prisoner is left to stand naked in a cell kept near {{convert|50|F}}, while being regularly doused with cold water in order to increase the rate at which heat is lost from the body.
#[[Stress positions]]: Prisoners are forced to stand, handcuffed and with their feet shackled to an eye bolt in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight to be placed on just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.
#Abdomen strikes: A hard, open-handed slap is dealt to the prisoner's [[abdomen]]. Doctors consulted over the matter advised against using a punch, which could cause lasting internal damage.
#[[Slapping (strike)|Insult slap]]: An open-handed slap is delivered to the prisoner's face, aimed at causing pain and triggering fear.
#Shaking: The interrogator forcefully grabs the front of the prisoner's shirt and shakes them.
In December 2007, CIA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] stated that "of about 100 prisoners held to date in the CIA program, the enhanced techniques were used on about 30, and waterboarding used on just three.".&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/washington/07interrogate.html |title=Lawmakers Back Limits on Interrogation Tactics |first=Scott |last=Shane |authorlink=Scott Shane |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayden on videotapes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011803347.html |title=Lawyers for Detainee Refer In Filing to More CIA Tapes |first=Carol D. |last=Leonnig |authorlink=Carol D.

The report, "Experiments in Torture: Human Subject Research and Evidence of Experimentation in the 'Enhanced' Interrogation Program", published by the advocacy group [[Physicians for Human Rights]], described personnel in the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) performing research on the prisoners as the above techniques were used both serially and in combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wadman|first=Meredith|title=Medics performed 'interrogation research'|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100607/full/news.2010.284.html |work=Nature.com |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was based on previously [[classified information|classified]] documents made available by the Obama administration in 2010.

According to ABC news in 2007, the CIA removed waterboarding from its list of acceptable interrogation techniques in 2006. ABC stated further that the last use of waterboarding was in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/11/exclusive-only-.html |title=Exclusive: Only Three Have Been Waterboarded by CIA |work=[[ABC News]] |date=November 2, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103132635/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/11/exclusive-only-.html |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense Intelligence Agency===
{{Main|Defense Intelligence Agency}}

In 2003, the Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s "Working Group" on interrogations requested that the DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group's consideration. According to the 2008 [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee]] report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, the DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee, a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element (ICE) Chief David Becker. Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he "was encouraged to talk about techniques that inflict pain."&lt;ref name="scasreport"&gt;{{cite report |work=[[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |format=PDF |title=Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021194943/http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}

[[File:FBI correspondence regarding DIA personnel in Guantanamo.pdf|thumb|right|150px|A declassified FBI correspondence alleging DIA use of [[gay porn]] and humiliating techniques in interrogations]]

It is unknown to what extent the agency's recommendations were used or for how long, but according to the same Senate report, the list drawn up by DIA included the use "drugs such as sodium pentothal and demerol", humiliating treatment using female interrogators and sleep deprivation. Becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency, name of which was redacted in the Senate report, had successfully used them in the past.&lt;ref name="scasreport" /&gt;{{rp|112}} According to the analysis of the [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Office of Defense Inspector General]], the DIA's cited justification for the use of drugs was to "[relax] detainee to cooperative state" and that mind-altering substances were not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |work=[[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Deputy Inspector General for Intelligence]] |url=http://www.dodig.mil/FOIA/ERR/09-INTEL-13_Redacted.pdf |title=Investigation of Allegations of the Use of Mind-Altering Drugs to Facilitate Interrogations of Detainees |date=September 23, 2009 |page=10 |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222051033/http://www.dodig.mil/FOIA/ERR/09-INTEL-13_Redacted.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some more lurid revelations of DIA's alleged harsh interrogations came from [[FBI]] officers, who conducted their own screenings of detainees in [[Guantanamo]] along with other agencies. According to one account, the interrogators of what was then DIA's Defense HUMINT Service (currently the [[Defense Clandestine Service]]), forced subjects to watch [[gay porn]], draped them with the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli Flag]] and interrogated them in rooms lit by [[strobe light]]s for 16–18 hours, all the while telling prisoners that they were from the FBI.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |url=https://www.aclu.org/files/projects/foiasearch/pdf/DOJFBI003584.pdf |title=Email &amp;#91;parties redacted&amp;#93; re: GTMO |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT-Miller"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/24/nation/na-abuse24 |title=E-Mails Show FBI Agents Fretted About Prisoner Abuse |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 24, 2006 |first=Greg |last=Miller |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real FBI operative was concerned that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the Bureau's ability to do its job properly, saying "The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy, you can imagine the result."&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers - usually a [[felony]] offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil Lewis (journalist) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/14/politics/14gitmo.html |title=Report Discredits F.B.I.

Similar activities are thought to have transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in [[Bagram]], where as recently as 2010 the organization ran the so-called "[[Black jail]]". According to a report published by [[The Atlantic]], the jail was manned by DIA's [[DCHC]] staff, who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high-value targets held at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ambinder |first=Marc |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/05/inside-the-secret-interrogation-facility-at-bagram/56678/ |title=Inside the Secret Interrogation Facility at Bagram |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention center outlived the black sites ran by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], with the DIA allegedly continuing to use "restricted" interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization. It is unclear what happened to the secret facility after the 2013 transfer of the base to Afghan authorities following several postponements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rodriguez |first=Alex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/25/world/la-fg-wn-us-bagram-prison-afghanistan-20130325 |title=U.S. hands over control of Bagram prison to Afghan government |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, former [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], in charge of [[Abu Ghraib]] prison until early 2004, told Spain's ''[[El País]]'' newspaper she had seen a letter signed by [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that allowed contractors employed by the U.S. to use techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] during interrogation.'" The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques." She said that this was contrary to the [[Geneva Conventions]] and quoted the Geneva Convention as saying, "Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written, "Make sure this is accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld/rumsfeld-okayed-abuses-says-former-u-s-general-idUSL2572641320061125 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=January 20, 2007 |title=Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. general |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/04/22/us.torture.karpinski/index.html |work=[[CNN]] |date=April 22, 2009 |title=Abu Ghraib head finds vindication in newly released memos |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on an ongoing high-level military investigation into accusations of detainee abuse at Guantánamo, conducted by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Randall M.

The FBI agents wrote in memorandums that were never meant to be disclosed publicly that they had seen female interrogators forcibly squeeze male prisoners' [[genitals]], and that they had witnessed other detainees stripped and shackled low to the floor for many hours."&lt;ref&gt;

In an interview with AP on February 14, 2008, [[Paul Rester]], chief military interrogator at Guantanamo Bay and director of the Joint Intelligence Group, said most of the information gathered from detainees came from non-coercive questioning and "rapport building", not harsh interrogation methods.&lt;ref name="Paul Rester"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jurist.org/news/2008/02/chief-guantanamo-interrogator-says-most/ |title=Chief Guantanamo interrogator says most info not forced from detainees |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805132410/https://www.jurist.org/news/2008/02/chief-guantanamo-interrogator-says-most/ |archivedate=August 5, 2018 |first=Eric |last=Firkel |work=[[JURIST]] |date=February 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reports and complaints==
In 2006, senior [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agents with the [[Criminal Investigation Task Force]] told [[MSNBC.com]] that they began to complain in 2002 inside the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] that the interrogation tactics used in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] by a separate team of [[military intelligence]] investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information, and probably illegal. Unable to get satisfaction from the army commanders running the detainee camp, they took their concerns to [[David Brant]], director of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), who alerted Navy General Counsel [[Alberto J. Mora]].&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15361458/| title=Gitmo interrogations spark battle over tactics|date=October 23, 2006| accessdate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Counsel Mora and Navy Judge Advocate General [[Michael Lohr]] believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful, and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the Defense Department to investigate, and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/images/pdfs/moramemo.pdf| title=Memorandum for Inspector General, Department of the Navy. Statement for the record: Office of General Counsel involvement in interrogation issues| format=PDF| date=July 7, 2005| accessdate = 2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on January 15, 2003, Rumsfeld suspended the approved interrogation tactics at Guantánamo Bay until a new set of guidelines could be produced by a working group headed by General Counsel of the Air Force [[Mary L. Walker|Mary Walker]].

The working group based its new guidelines on a legal memo from the [[United States Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]] written by [[John Yoo]] and signed by [[Jay S. Bybee]] in August 2002, which would later become widely known as the "[[Bybee memo|Torture Memo]]." General Counsel Mora led a faction of the Working Group in arguing against these standards, and argued the issues with Yoo in person. The working group's final report was signed and delivered to Guantánamo without the knowledge of Mora and the others who had opposed its content. Mora has maintained that detainee treatment has been consistent with the law since the January 15, 2003, suspension of previously approved interrogation tactics.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2004/12/13/tribunals-didnt-rely-on-torture/45b1560e-40b1-405a-b93e-bbc3fa2bbdb7/ |title=Tribunals Didn't Rely on Torture |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 13, 2004 |first=Alberto J. |last=Mora |authorlink=Alberto J. Mora }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not known publicly until 2008 that Yoo wrote another legal opinion, dated March 14, 2003, which he issued to the General Counsel of DOD, five days before the invasion of Iraq started. In it, he concluded that federal laws related to torture and other abuse did not apply to interrogators overseas&amp;nbsp;– which at that time the administration applied to Guantanamo as well as locations such as Iraq.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==== CIA assessment on efficacy of EITs ====

On request by the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Susan Rice]] in 2015, the CIA compiled a summary of key intelligence, which according to their records had been collected after the application of (unspecified) interrogation techniques. The memorandum lists intelligence related to the following topics: The Karachi Plot, The Heathrow Plot, The "Second Wave", The Guraba Cell, Issa al-Hindi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, [[Riduan Isamuddin|Hambali's Capture]], Jafaar al-Tayyar, [[Dirty bomb#Possibility of terrorist groups using dirty bombs|Dirty Bomb Plot]], [[Shoe bomber]], and Sh(a)kai (Pakistan). The CIA concluded that the enhanced interrogation techniques had been effective in providing intelligence and has been a key reason why al-Qa'ida has failed to launch a spectacular attack in the West since 11 September. 2001.&lt;ref name="CIA000 6541535"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/6541535 | title=

Disclosures in 2010 revealed that [[Jose Rodriguez (intelligence officer)|Jose Rodriguez Jr.]], head of the directorate of operations at the CIA from 2004 to 2007, ordered the tapes destroyed because he thought they would be "devastating to the CIA", and that "the heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain."&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Peter and Tate, Juile [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/15/AR2010041505854.html 2005 Destruction of Interrogation Tapes Caused Concern at CIA, e-mails Show."] (quoting e-mail from aide to Rodriguez that "it would be 'devastating' to us."), ''The Washington Post'', April 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that according to "some insiders," an inquiry into the [[C.I.A.'s secret detention program]] which analyzed these techniques, "might end with criminal charges for abusive interrogations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/washington/30intel.html |title=Tapes by C.I.A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a legal matter, it is not up to us to examine the C.I.A.'s failure to disclose the existence of these tapes. That is for others. What we do know is that government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one ''(of)'' the greatest tragedies to confront this country.

Responding to the so-called "torture memoranda" [[Scott Horton (lawyer)|Scott Horton]] noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the possibility that the authors of these memoranda counseled the use of lethal and unlawful techniques, and therefore face [[command responsibility|criminal culpability]] themselves. That, after all, is the teaching of [[United States v. Altstötter]], the Nuremberg case brought against German Justice Department lawyers whose memoranda crafted the basis for implementation of the infamous "[[Night and Fog Decree]].&lt;ref name="The Return of Carl Schmitt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jordan Paust]] concurred by responding to Mukasey's refusal to investigate and/or prosecute anyone that relied on these legal opinions

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the law.

===International Committee of the Red Cross report===
On March 15, 2009, [[Mark Danner]] provided a report in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' (with an abridged version in ''The New York Times'') describing and commenting on the contents of a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), ''Report on the Treatment of Fourteen "High Value Detainees" in CIA Custody'' (43&amp;nbsp;pp., February 2007). ''Report... '' is a record of interviews with [[black site]] detainees, conducted between October 6 and 11 and December 4 and 14, 2006, after their transfer to Guantánamo.&lt;ref name="ICRC report"&gt;ICRC report

Danner provides excerpts of interviews with detainees, including Abu Zubaydah, [[Walid bin Attash]], and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. According to Danner, the report contains sections on "methods of ill-treatment" including suffocation by water, prolonged stress standing, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation and use of loud music, exposure to cold temperature/cold water, prolonged use of handcuffs and shackles, threats, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food. Danner quotes the ICRC report as saying that, "in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in the CIA program, either singly or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="ICRC report"/&gt;

A heavily redacted version of the November 8, 2006 meeting was released by the CIA on June 10, 2016. The report tells that the ICRC finds the detainees stories "largely credible, having put much stock in the fact that the story each detainee told about his transfer, treatment and conditions of confinement was basically consistent, even though they had been incommunicado with each other throughout their detention by us [the CIA]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=John A Rizzo |editor= CIA|date=November 9, 2006 |title=8 November 2006 meeting with ICRC reps |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/6552081 |publisher= |page= |docket=

A bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report,&lt;ref name=scasreport /&gt; released in part in December 2008 and in full in April 2009, concluded that the legal authorization of "enhanced interrogation techniques" led directly to the abuse and killings of prisoners in US military facilities at Abu Ghraib, [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram]], and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Brutal Techniques Report"&gt;{{cite news |last=Knowlton |first=Brian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/us/politics/22report.html |title=Report Gives New Detail on Approval of Brutal Techniques |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brutal abuse [[Mind control#Korean War brainwashing debunked|believed to originate in Chinese communist torture techniques to extract false confessions from American POWs]] migrated from Guantanamo Bay to Afghanistan, then to Iraq and Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chaddock |first=Gail Russell |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0422/report-says-top-officials-set-tone-for-detainee-abuse |title=Report says top officials set tone for detainee abuse |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that some authorized techniques including "use of stress positions and sleep deprivation combined with other mistreatment" caused or were direct contributing factors in the cases of several prisoners who were "tortured to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://www.salon.com/2008/12/15/rumsfeld_2/ |title=Senate Report Links Bush to Detainee Homicides; Media Yawns |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Public Record"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pubrecord.org/torture/292/senate-panels-report-links-detainees-murders-to-bushs-torture-policy/ |title=Senate Panel's Report Links Detainees' Murders to Bush's Torture Policy |work=[[The Public Record]] |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |first=Jason |last=Leopold |authorlink=Jason Leopold }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld to Blame"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Greg |last2=Miller |first2=Julian |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/12/nation/na-interrogate-abuse12 |title=Senate Report Says Rumsfeld to Blame for Detainee Abuse |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also notes that authorizing abuse created the conditions for other, unauthorized abuse, by creating a legal and moral climate encouraging inhumane treatment.&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld to Blame"/&gt; The legal memos condoning "enhanced interrogation" had "redefined torture",&lt;ref name="Brutal Techniques Report"/&gt; "distorted the meaning and intent of anti-torture laws, [and] rationalized the abuse of detainees",&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld to Blame"/&gt; conveying the message that "physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment."&lt;ref name="The Public Record"/&gt; What followed was an "erosion of standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely."&lt;ref name="Brutal Techniques Report"/&gt;{{rp|xxix}} The report accused Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his deputies of being, according to ''The Washington Post'', directly responsible as the "authors and chief promoters of harsh interrogation policies that disgraced the nation and undermined U.S. security."&lt;ref name="Washington Post on Report"&gt;{{cite news |last=Warrick |first=Joby |authorlink=Joby Warrick |last2=De Young |first2=Karen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/11/AR2008121101969.html |title=Bipartisan Report on Detainee Abuse Blames Rumsfeld, Other Top Bush Officials |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to the Gestapo interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung'===
''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' writer [[Andrew Sullivan]] has pointed out similarities between the [[Gestapo]] interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung' and what the US called "enhanced interrogation".&lt;ref name = "Verschärfte Vernehmung"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/verschfte_verne.html |title="Verschärfte Vernehmung" |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |date=29 May 2007 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts the first use of a term comparable to "enhanced interrogation" was a 1937 memo by Gestapo Chief [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] coining the phrase "Verschärfte Vernehmung", German for "sharpened questioning", "intensified" or "enhanced interrogation" to describe subjection to extreme cold, sleep deprivation, suspension in stress positions, and deliberate exhaustion among other techniques.&lt;ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/&gt; Sullivan reports that in 1948 Norway prosecuted German officials for what trial documents termed "Verschärfte Vernehmung" including subjection to cold water, and repeated beatings.&lt;ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/&gt; Sullivan concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The very phrase used by the president to describe torture-that-isn't-somehow-torture&amp;nbsp;– "enhanced interrogation techniques"&amp;nbsp;– is a term originally coined by the Nazis. The techniques are indistinguishable. The methods were clearly understood in 1948 as war-crimes. The punishment for them was death.&lt;ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Investigation and calls for prosecution==

===Request for special counsel probe===
On June 8, 2008, fifty-six House Democrats asked for an independent investigation, raising the possibility that authorising these techniques may constitute a crime by Bush administration officials. The congressmen involved in calling for such an investigation included [[John Conyers]], [[Jan Schakowsky]], and [[Jerrold Nadler]].&lt;ref name="Probe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/07/AR2008060701194.html |title=Lawmakers Urge Special Counsel Probe of Harsh Interrogation Tactics |first=Joby |last=Warrick |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 8, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was addressed to [[Attorney General]] [[Michael B. Mukasey]] observing that

&lt;blockquote&gt;information indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented, from the top down, detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law.&lt;ref name="Probe"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter continues to state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because these apparent 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were used under cover of Justice Department legal opinions, the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious.&lt;ref name="Probe"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''The Washington Post'' the request was denied because Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey felt that

&lt;blockquote&gt;officials acted in "good faith" when they sought legal opinions, and that the lawyers who provided them used their best judgment.&lt;ref name="Carrie Johnson"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002749.html "Mukasey Rejects Inquiry"] Carrie Johnson, ''The Washington Post'', July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also reported that

&lt;blockquote&gt;He warned that criminalizing the process could cause policymakers to second-guess themselves and "harm our national security well into the future."&lt;ref name="Carrie Johnson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Cheney acknowledged his involvement in authorising these tactics&lt;ref name="Cheney on report"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=6464697&amp;page=2 |title=Transcript: Cheney Defends Hard Line Tactics |work=[[ABC News]] |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Carl Levin]], chair of the Armed Services Committee, a New York Times editorial, Glenn Greenwald and Scott Horton stressed the importance of a [[criminal investigation]]:

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
Shortly before the end of Bush's second term, news media in other countries were opining that under the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible to account under [[criminal law]].&lt;ref name="Calls for prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://harpers.org/blog/2009/01/overseas-expectations-build-for-torture-prosecutions/ |title=Overseas, Expectations Build for Torture Prosecutions |first=Scott |last=Horton |authorlink=Scott Horton (attorney) |work=[[Harper's Magazine]], ''No Comment'' |date=January 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Professor [[Manfred Nowak]], on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that, following the inauguration of [[Barack Obama]] as new President, George W. Bush has lost his [[head of state immunity]] and under international law, the U.S. is now mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment calls for prosecution

===Binyam Mohamed case===
On February 4, 2009, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of [[England and Wales]] ruled that evidence of possible torture in the case of [[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian-born British resident who was held in Guantanamo Bay until 2009, could not be disclosed to the public:

&lt;blockquote&gt;as a result of a statement by [[David Miliband]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], that if the evidence was disclosed the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain. That would directly threaten the UK's national security, Miliband had told the court.&lt;ref name="Preventing international investigation"&gt;Investigation by other countries obstructed

The judges said they found it "difficult to conceive" the rationale for the US's objections to releasing the information, which contained "no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters". Adding, "we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials".&lt;ref name="Preventing international investigation"/&gt;

Responding to the ruling, [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the Conservative MP and former [[Shadow Home Secretary]], commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ruling implies that torture has taken place in the &lt;nowiki&gt;[Binyam]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Mohamed case, that British agencies may have been complicit, and further, that the United States government has threatened our high court that if it releases this information the US government will withdraw its intelligence cooperation with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Preventing international investigation"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The High Court judges also stated in 2009, that a criminal investigation, by the UK's [[Law Officers of the Crown|Attorney General]], into possible torture had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7870049.stm |title=Ministers face torture pressure |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|UK Court of Appeal]] ruled that material held by the UK Foreign Secretary must be made public. The judges also concluded that Binyam Mohamed had been subjected to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities" and that [[MI5|British Intelligence]] knew that Mohamed was being tortured by the CIA.&lt;ref name="Court of appeal"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7204741/MI5-knew-Guantanamo-detainee-Binyam-Mohamed-was-being-tortured.html | title=MI5 knew Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed was being tortured | publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | date=10 February 2010 | accessdate=16 June 2015 |author1=Gardham, Duncan  |author2=Rayner, Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disclosure of the use of the techniques, debates arose over the legality of the techniques—whether they had violated U.S. or international law.

The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture unless they "have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering", according to a previously secret [[US Justice Department]] memo released on July 24, 2008. The interrogator's "good faith" and "honest belief" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. "Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture", [[Jay Bybee]], then the [[Assistant Attorney General]], wrote in the memo dated August 1, 2002, addressed to the CIA acting General Counsel [[John A. Rizzo]]. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others.

Another memo released on the same day advises that "the [[waterboarding|waterboard]]", does "not violate the Torture Statute." It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling "which raises possible concerns about future US [[judicial review]] of the [interrogation] Program."

A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which "enhanced interrogation techniques" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director [[George Tenet]] and dated January 28, 2003.

The memos were made public by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which obtained the three CIA-related documents under [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html |title=Previously secret torture memo released |work=[[CNN]] |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were among nearly 140,000 formerly classified documents from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the CIA that provide details on the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody in the "War on Terror" gathered by the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/george_w_bush_and_torture_america_s_highest_officials_are_responsible_for_the_enhanced_interrogation_of_prisoners_.single.html |title=How America Came To Torture Its Prisoners |date=April 20, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |author=Larry Siems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less redacted version of the August 1, 2002, memo signed by [[Assistant Attorney General]] [[Jay Bybee]] (regarding [[Abu Zubaydah]]) and four memos from 2005 signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General [[Steven G. Bradbury]] addressed to CIA and analysing the legality of various specific interrogation methods, including waterboarding, were released by [[Barack Obama]]'s administration on April 16, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abrams |first=Joseph |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/28/despite-reports-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-waterboarded-times/ |title=Despite Reports, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Was Not Waterboarded 183 Times |work=[[Fox News]] |date=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the CIA documents, [[Philip Zelikow]], a former State Department lawyer and adviser to then-Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], said that in 2005, he had written a legal memo objecting to torture. In it he argued that it was unlikely that "any federal court would agree (that the approval of harsh interrogation techniques) ... was a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution." He claimed that the Bush Administration had ordered all copies of his legal memo be collected and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103396848 |title=Was Critical Note Muzzled By Bush White House? |work=[[NPR]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Neuman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/21/the-olc-torture-memos-thoughts-from-a-dissenter/ |authorlink=Philip Zelikow |first=Philip |last=Zelikow |title=The OLC "torture memos": thoughts from a dissenter |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury authored an additional memo dated July 2007, seeking to reconcile the interrogation techniques with new developments, including intervening legislation such as the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] and the December 2005 [[Detainee Treatment Act]]. In response to this and other new legislation, the 2007 memo provided legal authorization and OLC approval for a more limited set of actions for use when interrogating high-value detainees.

The cumulative effect of Bush administration legal memos and exemption from prosecution had been to create a "law free zone" according to the former Chief Prosecutor at Guantánamo, where civilian politicians expected the military to use torture "against our will and judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Vulliamy |title=Former US chief prosecutor condemns 'law-free zone' of Guantánamo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/30/guantanamo-morris-davis |quote= |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 29, 2011 |accessdate=2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International legal bodies===
On May 19, 2006, the [[UN Committee against Torture]] issued a report stating the U.S. should stop secretly detaining, torturing, and ill-treating terror suspects, since such treatment is illegal under international law.&lt;ref name="UNCATreport"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4996798.stm |title=US 'must end secret detentions' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=May 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-us-should-close-gitmo/ |title=U.N.: U.S. Should Close Gitmo Panel On Torture Also Says U.S. Should Avoid Using Secret Prisons |work=[[CBS News]] |date=May 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA [[extraordinary rendition]] to a [[black site]] in Poland for enhanced interrogation, which the court called "torture, inhumane and degrading treatment."&lt;ref name= "European Court of Human Rights"/&gt; The court ordered the government of Poland to pay restitution to men who had been tortured there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Dan Bilesfsky |title=Court Censures Poland Over C.I.A.

===Human rights organizations===
A report by Human Rights First (HRF) and [[Physicians for Human Rights]] (PFH) stated that these techniques constitute torture.&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights"/&gt; Their press release said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The report concludes that each of the ten tactics is likely to violate U.S. laws, including the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]], the [[U.S. Torture Act]], and the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]].&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights"&gt;[[Human Rights First]] (HRF) and [[Physicians for Human Rights]] (PFH) report

The [[Constitution Project]] convened a review of interrogation and detention programs in the years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It concluded in 2013 that "it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture" and that the nation's highest officials bore ultimate responsibility for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Shane, Scott |title= U.S. Practiced Torture After 9/11, Nonpartisan Review Concludes|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/us-practiced-torture-after-9-11-nonpartisan-review-concludes.html |quote= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ban on interrogation techniques==
On December 14, 2005, the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] was passed into law, setting the Army policy as standard for all agencies and prohibiting "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/12/15/us-landmark-torture-ban-undercut |title=U.S.: Landmark Torture Ban Undercut |work=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2008, the U.S. Senate, in a 51 to 45 vote, approved a bill clarifying this language, allowing only "those interrogation techniques explicitly authorized by the [[2006 Army Field Manual]]."&lt;ref name="Senate Ban"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jurist.org/news/2008/02/senate-backs-intelligence-bill/ |title=Senate backs intelligence bill restricting CIA interrogation tactics |first=Mike |last=Rosen-Molina |work=[[JURIST]] |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The measure would effectively ban the use of simulated drowning, temperature extremes and other harsh tactics that the CIA used on [[al-Qaeda]] prisoners after the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;ref name="WaPo Ban"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302888.html |title=Senate Passes Ban On Waterboarding, Other Techniques |first=Dan |last=Eggen |authorlink=Dan Eggen |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

President [[George W. Bush]] has said in a [[BBC]] interview he would veto such a bill&lt;ref name="WaPo Ban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jurist.org/news/2008/02/bush-to-veto-intelligence-bill/ |title=Bush to veto intelligence bill restricting CIA interrogation tactics |first=Jaime |last=Jansen |work=[[JURIST]] |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after previously signing an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] that allows "enhanced interrogation techniques" and may exempt the CIA from [[Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name="Senate Ban"/&gt;

On March 8, 2008, President Bush vetoed this bill.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists", Bush said in his weekly radio address . "The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror&amp;nbsp;– the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives." Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating "lawful combatants captured on the battlefield", not the "hardened terrorists" normally questioned by the CIA. "If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives", Bush said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Massachusetts]] senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] described Bush's veto as "one of the most shameful acts of his presidency". He said, "Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/08/bush.torture.ap/index.html|title=Bush vetoes bill banning waterboarding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0736443620080308?sp=true|title=Bush vetoes bill outlawing CIA waterboarding|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080308.html |title=President's Radio Address |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311185628/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080308.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008 |work=[[whitehouse.gov]] |date=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311020720/http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-08-voa10.cfm |archivedate=March 11, 2008 |url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-08-voa10.cfm |title=President Bush Vetoes Waterboarding Ban |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Stearns }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jane Mayer]], during the transition period for then President-elect [[Barack Obama]], his legal, intelligence, and national-security advisers had met at the CIA's headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]] to discuss "whether a ban on brutal interrogation practices would hurt their ability to gather intelligence", and among the consulted experts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was unanimity among Obama's expert advisers... that to change the practices would not in any material way affect the collection of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Transition team"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-blog/behind-the-executive-orders |title=Behind the Executive Orders |first=Jane |last=Mayer |authorlink=Jane Mayer |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=January 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed [[Executive Order 13491]] requiring the CIA to use only the 19 interrogation methods outlined in the United States [[FM 2-22.3 Human Intelligence Collector Operations|Army Field Manual on interrogations]] "unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance."&lt;ref name="ObamaDirectives"&gt;Obama issues torture ban

President Obama, while condemning torture, ruled out prosecuting his Bush administration predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/11291476/Why-wont-Barack-Obama-prosecute-CIA-torturers.html |title=Why won't Barack Obama prosecute CIA torturers? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date= December 12, 2014 |author=Raf Sanchez |accessdate= June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes2009-04-17&gt;{{cite news |last1= Miller |first=Greg |last2=Meyer |first2=Josh |date=April 17, 2009 |title=Obama assures intelligence officials they won't be prosecuted over interrogations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/17/nation/na-interrogation17 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to University of California Law School Dean [[Christopher Edley Jr.]], who served on President Obama's transition team, the decision not to prosecute predated Obama's taking office and was due to concern about a backlash by leaders of the military, the [[National Security Agency]] and the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Egelko |title=Obama ally says torture probe could have prompted CIA 'revolt' |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2011/09/10/obama-ally-says-torture-probe-could-have-prompted-cia-revolt/ |quote= |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=September 10, 2011 |accessdate=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, [[Ben Rhodes (White House staffer)|Ben Rhodes]], [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] under Obama, commented on the difficult political problems that torture prosecutions would have created, both in distracting from the administration's response to the [[Great Recession]] and potentially alienating the president from his own agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Intercept]] |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/06/22/is-it-time-to-reckon-with-obamas-foreign-policy-legacy/ |title=Confronting the Consequences of Obama's Foreign Policy |date=June 22, 2018 |accessdate=June 25, 2018 |first=Mehdi |last=Hasan |authorlink=Mehdi Hasan |quote=You know, he's sitting there, he's looking at over the abyss of the Great Depression and the disruption of taking on a prosecution of U.S. officials, sorting out who is in that bucket and who isn't, would have been a consuming thing for him to do and really something that could have broken apart essentially, you know, the connective tissue of the president to his own agencies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal analysts such as [[Eric Posner]] and [[Andrew Napolitano]] have said that prosecutions would create a precedent putting Obama administration officials at risk of politically motivated prosecutions by their successors.&lt;ref name="ObamaSaysNoProsection"&gt;Commentary on why Obama won't prosecute

The US Department of Justice announced that there will be no trials even of those who went well beyond what the [[Torture Memos]] allowed, including those who tortured detainees to death.&lt;ref name="US Justice Department"&gt;US Justice Department says no prosecutions

===Foreign prosecution possible but unlikely===
There is no [[Statute of limitations#International crimes|statute of limitations for war crimes]] in international law. However, prosecutions in either the [[International Criminal Court]], or in the courts of a particular nation invoking the doctrine of [[universal jurisdiction]], are also regarded as unlikely.&lt;ref name = "International charges"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Philip Bump |title=Why Dick Cheney and the CIA don't need to worry about international criminal charges |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/12/10/why-dick-cheney-and-the-cia-dont-need-to-worry-about-international-criminal-charges/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 10, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. under the Bush administration "unsigned" the treaty that had conferred on the International Criminal Court [[jurisdiction]] over Americans.&lt;ref name = "Renounced Treaty"&gt;{{Cite news |title=US renounces world court treaty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1970312.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=May 6, 2002 |accessdate=2014-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, President Bush signed the 2002 [[American Service-Members' Protection Act]] allowing military invasion of [[The Hague]] to rescue any Americans the court might detain for war crimes trials. Some torture occurred in CIA [[black site]] prisons in countries that remain parties to the treaty, like Poland, Afghanistan, Lithuania, and Romania. But for political reasons those countries are not in a position to initiate a prosecution, nor to extradite US officials to face charges.&lt;ref name = "International charges"/&gt;

Invoking the [[universal jurisdiction]] doctrine, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former President George Bush, on behalf of four tortured detainees.

Without any prosecutions the possibility remains that a future presidential administration could claim torture is legal and revive its practice.&lt;ref name="Torturelaweviscerated"&gt;Torture becomes mere policy choice

==Prosecution of John Kiriakou==
Former CIA officer [[John Kiriakou]] in 2007 was the first official within the U.S. government to confirm the use of [[waterboarding]] of [[al-Qaeda]] prisoners as an interrogation technique, which he described as torture.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite news |first=Joby |last=Warrick |author2=Dan Eggen |date=11 December 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121002091.html |title=Waterboarding Recounted |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallas"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Davis |date=12 December 2007 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-markdavis_12edi.ART.State.Edition1.36db21e.html |title=His second guess is wrong |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2012, Kiriakou pleaded guilty to disclosing [[classified information]] about a fellow CIA officer that connected the [[covert operative]] to a specific operation. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison on January 25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21610806 |title=Ex-CIA officer Kiriakou "made peace" with leak decision |work=[[BBC]] News |date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Court of Human Rights decisions==
On July 24, 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that [[Poland]] violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when it cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture [[Abu Zubaydah]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 euros in damages. It also awarded Abu Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28460628|title=Poland 'helped in CIA rendition', European court rules|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-rules-against-poland-in-cia-rendition-case-1406193988|title=European Court Assails Poland Over Role in CIA 'Black Sites'|author=Gabriele Steinhauser and Jess Bravin|date=July 25, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2018, the ECHR ruled that [[Romania]] and [[Lithuania]] also violated the rights of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2003-2005 and in 2005-2006 respectively, and Lithuania and Romania were ordered to pay 100,000 euros in damages each to Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Nashiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44313905|title=Lithuania and Romania complicit in CIA torture - European court|date=May 31, 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Tuqan's poetry is known for her distinctive chronicling of the suffering of her people, the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]], particularly those living under [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary|author=Lawrence Joffe|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2003-12-15|accessdate=2007-07-15|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1107273,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Nablus to the wealthy Palestinian [[Tuqan clan|Tuqan family]] known for their accomplishments in many fields, she received schooling until age 13 when she was forced to quit school at a young age due to illness.  One of her brothers, [[Ibrahim Tuqan]], known as the ''Poet of Palestine'', took responsibility of educating her, gave her books to read and taught her English. He was also the one who introduced her to poetry.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Tuqan eventually attended Oxford University, where she studied [[English language|English]] and literature.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Fadwa Tuqan's eldest brother is [[Ahmad Toukan]], former Prime Minister of Jordan.

Tuqan eventually published eight poetry collections, which were translated into many languages and enjoy renown throughout the Arab World.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Her book, "Alone With the Days," focused on the hardships faced by women in the male-dominated Arab world.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; After the [[Six-Day War]], Tuqan's poetry focused on the hardships of living under the Israeli occupation. One of her best known poems, "The Night and the Horsemen," described life under Israeli military rule.
 
Tuqan died on December 12, 2003 during the height of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]], while her hometown of [[Nablus]] was under siege.&lt;ref name=Words/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pchrgaza.ps/files/W_report/English/2003/18-12-2003.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219011216/http://www.pchrgaza.ps/files/W_report/English/2003/18-12-2003.htm |archivedate=2007-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem ''Wahsha: Moustalhama min Qanoon al Jathibiya'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070212220424/http://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article.php?lab=Touqan Longing: Inspired by the Law of Gravity]) was one of the last poems she penned while largely bedridden.&lt;ref name=Words/&gt;

Tuqan is widely considered a symbol of the Palestinian cause and "one of the most distinguished figures of modern Arabic literature."&lt;ref name=Words/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Tuqan's poetry is set by [[Mohammed Fairouz]] in his Third Symphony.&lt;ref name=mohammedopera&gt;Moore, Thomas (September 12, 2010), [http://www.operatoday.com/content/2010/09/mohammed_fairou.php Mohammed Fairouz: An Interview], ''Opera Today'', retrieved 2011-04-19&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.

}}

"'''For Want of a Nail'''" is a [[proverb]], having numerous variations over several centuries, reminding that seemingly unimportant acts or omissions can have grave and unforeseen consequences.

== Analysis ==
{{quote box|border=1px|align=right|title=''"Knight" Variation''|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
for want of a shoe the horse was lost,
for want of a horse the knight was lost,
for want of a knight the battle was lost,
for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
So a kingdom was lost&amp;mdash;all for want of a nail.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' ''DC Comics, 1998''}}

The proverb has come down in many variations over the centuries. It describes a situation in which a failure to anticipate or correct some initially small dysfunction leads by successively more critical stages to an egregious outcome. The rhyme's implied small difference in initial conditions is the lack of a spare [[horseshoe]] [[Nail (fastener)|nail]], relative to a condition of its availability.&lt;ref name=everything.com/&gt; At a more literal level, it expresses the importance of [[military logistics]] in warfare.

Such chains of [[causality]] are perceived only in [[hindsight]]. No one ever lamented, upon seeing his unshod horse, that the kingdom would eventually fall because of it.&lt;ref name=everything.com&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097943 For want of a nail @ Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related sayings are is "A stitch, in time, saves nine" and "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". A somewhat similar idea is referred to in the [[metaphor]] known as [[camel's nose|the camel's nose]].

The proverb is found in a number of forms, beginning as early as the 13th century:
 
*[[Middle High German]] (positively formulated): ''Diz ſagent uns die wîſen, ein nagel behalt ein îſen, ein îſen ein ros, ein ros ein man, ein man ein burc, der ſtrîten kan.''

*"The French-men haue a military prouerbe; 'The losse of a nayle, the losse of an army'.

*In British Columbia Saw-Mill Co. v. Nettleship (1868), L.R. 3 C.P. 499 (Eng. Q.B.), a variation on the story is given a legal flavour:
**"Cases of this kind have always been found to be very difficult to deal with, beginning with a case said to have been decided about two centuries and a half ago, where a man going to be married to an heiress, his horse having cast a shoe on the journey, employed a blacksmith to replace it, who did the work so unskilfully that the horse was lamed, and, the rider not arriving in time, the lady married another; and the blacksmith was held liable for the loss of the marriage. The question is a very serious one; and we should inevitably fall into a similar absurdity unless we applied the rules of common sense to restrict the extent of liability for the breach of contract of this sort."
*‘Don't care’ was the man who was to blame for the well-known catastrophe: ‘For want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and for want of a horse the man was lost.’ (1880 [[Samuel Smiles]], Duty)&lt;ref name=answers.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smiles |first1=Samuel|authorlink1=Samuel Smiles |title=Duty : with illustrations of courage, patience, &amp; endurance |url=https://books.google.com/books?q=samuel+smiles+duty&amp;oq=samuel+smiles+du |accessdate=2 April 2010 | year=1880 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Horse! My Kingdom for a Horse!", as depicted in Act V, Scene 4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r3.org/bookcase/shaksper/act5.html#scene4 Richard III, Act V, Scene 4, from the Richard III society] (Retrieved 20100319)&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Shakespeare]] play [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]].

== Modern references ==
{{in popular culture|date=January 2017}}

Along with  the long history of the proverb listed above, it has continued to be referenced since the mid 20th century in modern culture.  Examples include:

=== Legal ===

*In his dissent in ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (549 US 497, 2007), Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cites "all for the want of a horseshoe nail" as an example of a ''possible'' chain of causation.  He claimed that, by contrast, the threshold jurisdictional issue of standing requires a ''likely'' chain of causation, which was not satisfied by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s regulation of new automobile emissions to prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;''Massachusetts v. E.P.A.'', 549 U.S. 497, 546 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his dissent in ''[[CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride]]'', Roberts again invokes the proverb, explaining that, in [[tort|tort law]], the doctrine of [[proximate cause]] is meant to "limit[] liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-235.pdf ''CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride''], No. 10-235 (U.S. 17 June 2011) (slip op., at 3) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the novel ''Rage'', by [[Stephen King]] (using the pseudonym [[Richard Bachman]]), main character Charlie Decker references the proverb: "But you can't go back. For want of a shoe the horse was lost, and all that." Stephen King's 1987 novel, ''The Tommyknockers'' also references the proverb in its first line: "For want of a nail the kingdom was lost&amp;nbsp;– that's how the catechism goes when you boil it down."
*''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' is a three-issue comic book limited series published by [[DC Comics]] in 1998 about a world where the baby Kal-El was never found by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Ma and Pa Kent]] because a nail punctured their truck tire on the day when they would have found his ship; thus the child does not grow up to become [[Superman]].  This story uses the English ("[[Knight]]") variation of the rhyme as a theme.
*''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' is a fantasy/science fiction novel by [[Madeleine L'Engle]] which was a sequel to ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]''.  The proverb is used in the novel as an explanation by [[Meg Murry]] to help Mr. Jenkins understand how a microscopic creature can affect the fate of the universe, and is the impetus for much of the action.

*[[William Golding]] quotes the whole poem at the end of chapter 9 of his novel ''[[The Spire]]''. There, the nail referred to is one of the [[Nail (relic)|Nails of the Holy Cross]].

The episode's concept itself is also based on the proverb, with the character of [[Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]] going through a convoluted process involving several camp personnel, in order to get a new boot.
* In the movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', the proverb was used by Kamata (Sonny Chiba) to explain to his nephew the result of a small detail being overlooked.
* In the movie ''[[Father Goose (film)|Father Goose]]'', Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) in his first scene of the movie, while talking to an Admiral on the telephone, uses part of the proverb by saying "For want of a nail, the war was..." in reference to finding an additional coastal plane spotter.
* In the episode of USA's ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "[[List of Monk episodes#Season 5: 2006–2007|Mr. Monk at Your Service]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0946426/ Mr. Monk at Your Service] (Retrieved 20090401)&lt;/ref&gt; Monk quotes the proverb after being challenged by an employee that suggest a fork being a centimeter off center wasn't a problem. Monk: "For the want of a nail, the kingdom was lost."
* In the 1982 movie ''[[The Verdict]]'', Ed Concannon (James Mason) uses the proverb, "for want of a shoe the horse was lost" to his disciples to describe what the case has become after Frank Galvin turned down the settlement.
* The entire proverbial rhyme is recited by the character Abraham Farlan in the 1946 motion picture ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. Here it was used to describe the chain of circumstances which formed the life of the main character, Peter Carter.
* In season two, episode three of the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', while trying to repair the timer device in a world crippled by 'anti-technology' Professor Arturo exclaims, "For want of a shoe the war was lost."
* In the 50th episode of ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Dead or Alive]]'', Man On Horseback, Josh Randall, [[Steve McQueen]]'s character, uses the proverb "''For the want of a nail, they lost the shoe. For the want of a shoe, they lost the horse. For the want of a horse, they lost the rider''" to justify the reason why he is taking with him four extra horseshoes.
* In the 1967 [[Mannix]] episode 'Turn Every Stone,' Joe Mannix alludes to the saying at  the end when he says, "It's the old horseshoe-nail bit again. For want of $10,000, a million was lost."
* In the 1954 movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'', Captain Queeg ([[Bogart]]) refers to the proverb during the following conversation with Ensign Keith after he reprimanded him for failing to enforce the untucked shirt-tails rule. "I know a man's shirt's a petty detail, but big things are made up of details. Don't forget, 'For want of a nail, a horseshoe was lost and then the whole battle.' A captain's job is a lonely one. He's easily misunderstood. Forget that I bawled you out."

The people who speak them are ethnically Tamang, but their languages are too poorly known to be sure.{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=this makes it contingent on the classification of their language instead of self-identification, but that means that they would be distinct anyway}} The two languages, [[Kutang language|Kutang]] (Bihi, Chak, Rana) and [[Ghale language|Ghale]] (Barpak, Kyaura, Laprak, Khorla, Uiya, Jagat, Philim, Nyak), might each be considered more than one language.

{{Journalism sidebar}}

'''Gonzo journalism''' is a style of [[journalism]] that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a [[first-person narrative]]. The word "gonzo" is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe [[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved|an article]] by [[Hunter S. Thompson]], who later popularized the style. It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire.{{Sfn|Bowe|2012|p=92}} It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.

Gonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly-edited product favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach; the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece. Use of [[sarcasm]], [[humor]], exaggeration, and [[profanity]] is common.

Thompson, who was among the forefathers of the [[new journalism]] movement, said in the February 15, 1973, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "If I'd written the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people—including me—would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism."&lt;ref name="Andrews1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cl5c4T9LWkC&amp;pg=PA486|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=January 1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07194-9|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term "gonzo" was first used in connection with Hunter S. Thompson by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' magazine editor [[Bill Cardoso]] in 1970. He described Thompson's article "[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]," which was written for the June 1970 edition of ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]'', as "pure Gonzo journalism."{{Sfn|Hirst|2004|p=5}} Cardoso claimed that "gonzo" was [[South Boston]] [[Irish language|Irish]] [[slang]] describing the last man standing after an all-night drinking marathon.{{Sfn|Thompson|1997}} He also claimed that it was a corruption of the [[French Canadian]] word "gonzeaux," which means "shining path," although this is disputed.{{Sfn|Hirst|2004}}

Another speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the 1960 hit song '"[[:File:Gonzo by James Booker, 1960, gonzo.ogg|Gonzo]]" by [[New Orleans]] [[rhythm and blues]] pianist [[James Booker]]. This possibility is supported by a 2007 oral biography of Thompson, which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker{{Sfn|Wenner|Seymour|2007}} but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson's journalism. The 2013 documentary ''[[James Booker#Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker|Bayou Maharaja: The Tragic Genius of James Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keber|first=Lily|title=Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker|url=http://www.bayoumaharajah.com|publisher=Mairzy Doats Productions|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Thompson's literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dosavannah.com/article/mon-12162013-2113/unplugged-new-documentary-explores-life-legacy-pianist-james-booker|title=Unplugged: New documentary explores life, legacy of pianist James Booker|work=Do Savannah, arts and entertainment news for the Creative Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JamesBooker.htm James Booker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420171707/http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JamesBooker.htm |date=2008-04-20 }}, by Greg Johnson, reprint from the February, 2002 ''BluesNotes'' at Cascade Blues Association&lt;/ref&gt; the song title "Gonzo" comes from a character in a movie called ''The Pusher'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054219/|title=The Pusher (1960)|author=goblinhairedguy|date=1 February 1960|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn may have been inspired by a 1956 [[Evan Hunter]] novel of the same title.

Thompson himself first used the term referring to his own work on page 12 of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] classic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/4284147.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Entertainment – Thompson's classic Las Vegas trip|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''. He wrote, "But what ''was'' the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on our own. Free Enterprise. The American Dream. [[Horatio Alger]] gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it ''now'': pure Gonzo journalism."{{Sfn|Thompson|1971}}

==Hunter S. Thompson==
Thompson based his style on [[William Faulkner]]'s notion that "fiction is often the best fact".{{sfn|Rolling Stone|1998}} While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true, he used satirical devices to drive his points home. He often wrote about [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] use, which added subjective flair to his reporting. The term "gonzo" has also come into (sometimes [[pejorative]]) use to describe journalism in Thompson's style, characterized by a drug-fueled [[stream of consciousness writing]] technique.

''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' followed the [[Mint 400]] piece in 1971 and included a main character by the name of [[Raoul Duke]], accompanied by his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, with defining art by [[Ralph Steadman]]. Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism, Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Hunter S. ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Other American Stories''. New York: Random House, 1996. p. 210. {{ISBN|0-679-60298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened, but he edited the book five times before publication.

Thompson would instigate events himself, often in a [[prank]]ish or belligerent manner, and then document both his actions and those of others. Notoriously neglectful of deadlines, Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late, "too late to be edited, yet still in time for the printer".&lt;ref&gt;Whitmer, Peter O. 1993. When the going gets weird: The twisted life and times of Hunter S. Thompson. New York: Hyperion.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it, in its "true Gonzo" form. Historian [[Douglas Brinkley]] said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations.{{Sfn|Thompson|2000}}

"I don't get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist's view: 'I just covered the story. I just gave it a balanced view,'" Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of ''[[The Atlantic]]''. "Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American [[politics]] has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long. You can't be objective about [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/graffiti/hunter.htm |title=Writing on the Wall: An Interview with Hunter S. Thompson |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Company |date=27 August 1997 |accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Thompson felt that [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity in journalism]] was a myth. Gonzo journalism has now become a ''bona fide'' style of writing that concerns itself with "telling it like it is", similar to the [[New Journalism]] of the 1960s, led primarily by [[Tom Wolfe]] and also championed by [[Lester Bangs]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Terry Southern]], and [[John Birmingham]], and is considered a subgenre{{cn|reason=this claim is not self-evident.|date=August 2018}} of [[New Journalism]]. When asked whether there was a difference between the two, Thompson answered, "Yeah, I think so. Unlike Tom Wolfe or [[Gay Talese]], for instance, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then I don't really think of myself as a reporter."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Hunter S. ''Ancient Gonzo Wisdom: Interviews with Hunter S. Thompson''. Da Capo Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-306-81651-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Christopher Locke]] asserted that the [[online magazine|webzine]] genre is descended from gonzo journalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Locke |first=Christopher |title=Fear and loathing on the Web |work=The Industry Standard |date=9 July 1998 |url=http://www.thestandard.net/articles/article_display/0,1449,1019,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117022847/http://www.thestandard.net/articles/article_display/0%2C1449%2C1019%2C00.html |archivedate=17 January 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that has since been extended to [[social media]].&lt;ref name=Marinelli2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Marinelli|first=Jennifer|title=Hunter S.

'''Gorum''', or '''Parengi''', is a nearly-extinct minor [[Munda language]] of India.

==Names==
The name ''Gorum'' most likely comes from an animal/people prefix ''go''- and root -''rum'' meaning 'people', and is possibly related to the ethnonym [[Bonda language|Remo]] (Anderson 2008:381).

''Parengi'', or ''Parenga'', is of obscure origin.

==Status==
'''Gorum''' is 60% endangered, it is very likely that it might soon be extinct majority of the people under 30 years cannot understand the language. In addition those who know it are likely to deny knowing it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4953 Endangered Language Project&lt;/ref&gt; This language seems to have been first researched in 1933, that being the earliest scholarly reference.&lt;ref&gt;Sitapati, G.V. 1933. “Pareng.” A Miscellany of Papers Presented to Rao Sahib Mahopadhyaya Gidugu Venkata Ramamurthi. Madras. 145-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
While '''Gorum''' is a member of the [[Munda languages|Munda]] family, it has taken some things from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], a language spoken nearby. For example, they tend to doubly inflect on certain types of [[Auxiliary verb|AVC]] structures. Another derivation from the Munda language is the use of some [[Glottal consonant|Glottals]] being "creeky voiced"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Gregory D.S. &amp; Felix Rau. 2008. “Gorum.” In: Gregory D.S. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Gorum speakers are located in the following areas of eastern India (Anderson 2008:381).
*[[Koraput district]], [[Odisha]]: the former Nandapur and Pottangi taluks
*[[Visakhapatnam district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]: Munchingput block

[[Gutob language|Gutob]] is spoken to the north of Gorum, and [[Gta language|Gta]] to the west of Gorum.

'''Guatemalan Sign Language''' is the national [[deaf sign language]] used in [[Guatemala]]. The first dictionary was published in 2000. It is distinct from the sign languages used in Mexico and other neighboring [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] countries, and from [[Mayan sign languages#Highland Maya Sign Language|Highland Maya Sign Language]], which is used among [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of rural Guatemala.

[[File:Surface type cover JIS keyboard layout blue.jpg|thumb|A [[Microsoft Surface|Surface Type Cover]] glows in the dark at night, showing the standard [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] keyboard layout used by most keyboards sold in [[Japan]].|375x375px]]
'''Japanese [[input method]]s''' are the methods used to input [[Japanese language|Japanese]] characters on a [[computer]].

There are two main methods of inputting Japanese on computers. One is via a [[romanization|romanized]] version of Japanese called ''[[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]]'' (literally "Roman character"), and the other is via keyboard keys corresponding to the Japanese ''[[kana]]''. Some systems may also work via a [[graphical user interface]], or GUI, where the characters are chosen by clicking on buttons or image maps.

==Japanese keyboards==
[[Image:SideWinder X4 Keyboard Japanese.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Microsoft]]'s gaming keyboard for the Japanese market]]
[[Image:MacBookProJISKeyboard-1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[MacBook Pro]] Japanese Keyboard]]
Japanese keyboards (as shown on the second image) have both hiragana and Roman letters indicated. The JIS, or [[Japanese Industrial Standard]], keyboard layout keeps the Roman letters in the English [[QWERTY]] layout, with numbers above them. Many of the non-[[alphanumeric]] symbols are the same as on English-language keyboards, but some symbols are located in other places. The hiragana symbols are also ordered in a consistent way across different keyboards.  For example, the ''Q, W, E, R, T, Y'' keys correspond to た, て, い, す, か, ん (''ta'', ''te'', ''i'', ''su'', ''ka'', and ''n'') respectively when the computer is used for direct hiragana input.

===Input keys===
{{See also|Language input keys}}
Since Japanese input requires switching between Roman and hiragana entry modes, and also conversion between hiragana and [[kanji]] (as discussed below), there are usually several special keys on the keyboard. This varies from computer to computer, and some OS vendors have striven to provide a consistent [[user interface]] regardless of the type of keyboard being used.  On non-Japanese keyboards, [[Option key|option-]] or [[Control key|control-]] key sequences can perform all of the tasks mentioned below.

On most Japanese keyboards, one key switches between Roman characters and Japanese characters.  Sometimes, each mode (Roman and Japanese) may even have its own key, in order to prevent ambiguity when the user is typing quickly.

There may also be a key to instruct the computer to convert the latest hiragana characters into kanji, although usually the space key serves the same purpose since Japanese writing doesn't use spaces.

Some keyboards have a ''mode'' key to switch between different forms of writing. This of course would only be the case on keyboards that contain more than one set of Japanese symbols. [[Hiragana]], [[katakana]], halfwidth katakana, halfwidth Roman letters, and fullwidth Roman letters are some of the options. A typical Japanese character is square while Roman characters are typically variable in width. Since all Japanese characters occupy the space of a square box, it is sometimes desirable to input Roman characters in the same square form in order to preserve the grid layout of the text. These Roman characters that have been fitted to a square character cell are called fullwidth, while the normal ones are called halfwidth. In some fonts these are fitted to half-squares, like some [[monospaced]] fonts, while in others they are not. Often, fonts are available in two variants, one with the halfwidth characters monospaced, and another one with proportional halfwidth characters. The name of the typeface with proportional halfwidth characters is often prefixed with "P" for "proportional".

Finally, a keyboard may have a special key to tell the OS that the last kana entered should not be converted to kanji.  Sometimes this is just the ''Return''/''Enter'' key.

===Thumb-shift keyboards===
{{main article|Thumb-shift keyboard}}
A [[thumb-shift keyboard]] is an alternative design, popular among professional Japanese typists. Like a standard Japanese keyboard, it has hiragana characters marked in addition to Latin letters, but the layout is completely different. Most letter keys have two kana characters associated with them, which allows all the characters to fit in three rows, like in Western layouts. In the place of the space bar key on a conventional keyboard, there are two additional modifier keys, operated with thumbs - one of them is used to enter the alternate character marked, and the other is used for voiced sounds. The semi-voiced sounds are entered using either the conventional shift key operated by the little finger, or take place of the voiced sound for characters not having a voiced variant.

The kana-to-kanji conversion is done in the same way as when using any other type of keyboard. There are dedicated conversion keys on some designs, while on others the thumb shift keys double as such.

==Romaji input==

As an alternative to direct input of kana, a number of Japanese [[input method editor]]s allow Japanese text to be entered using [[romaji]], which can then be converted to kana or kanji. This method does not require the use of a Japanese keyboard with kana markings.

==Mobile phones==

{{See also|Japanese mobile phone culture}}

===Keitai input===

[[Image:Keypad on Japanese phone 708SC.jpg|right|thumb|Japanese mobile phone keypad (Model [[Samsung]] 708SC)]]

The primary system used to input Japanese on mobile phones is based on the numerical keypad. Each number is associated with a particular sequence of kana, such as ''ka'', ''ki'', ''ku'', ''ke'', ''ko'' for '2', and the button is pressed repeatedly to get the correct kana – each key corresponds to a column in the [[gojūon]] (5 row &amp;times; 10 column grid of kana), while the number of presses determines the row.&lt;ref name="quora"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.quora.com/Which-Japanese-input-method-on-iPhone-is-more-popular-Kana-or-Romaji|access-date=2015-01-31|title=Which Japanese input method on iPhone is more popular, Kana or Romaji?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dakuten]] and [[handakuten]] marks, punctuation, and other symbols can be added by other buttons in the same way. Kana to kanji conversion is done via the arrow and other keys.

===Flick input===

Flick input is a Japanese input method used on smartphones. The key layout is the same as the Keitai input, but rather than pressing a key repeatedly, the user can swipe from the key in a certain direction to produce the desired character.&lt;ref name="quora"/&gt; Smartphone Japanese IMEs such as [[Google Japanese Input]], [[:ja:POBox|POBox]] and S-Shoin all support flick input.

[[File:Flick input vowels.png|thumb|Flick input]]

====Godan layout====

In addition to the industry standard QWERTY and 12 key layouts, [[Google Japanese Input]] offers a 15-key Godan keyboard layout, which is an alphabet layout optimized for romaji input. The letters fit in a five rows by three columns grid. The left column consists of the five vowels, in the same order as the columns in the Gojūon table (''a'', ''i'', ''u'', ''e'', ''o''), while the central and right column consists of letters for the nine main voiceless consonants of kanas, in the same order as the rows in the Gojūon table (''k'', ''s'', ''t'', ''n'', ''[special]''; ''h'', ''m'', ''y'', ''r'', ''w''). Other characters are typed by flick gesture:
* The other twelve Latin consonants not needed for composing kanas (''c'', ''d'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', ''j'', ''l'', ''p'', ''q'', ''v'', ''x'', ''z'') are composed on the voiceless consonants by swiping them up, or right, or even left (swiping ''k'' for ''q'' or ''g''; swiping ''s'' for ''j'' or ''z''; swiping ''t'' for ''c'' or ''d''; swiping ''h'' for ''f'', ''b'' or ''p''; swiping ''m'' for ''l''; swiping ''y'' for ''x''; swiping ''w'' for ''v'').
* The main voiced kanas are composed like in romaji, by typing (without swiping) the voiceless consonant on the two last columns, then swiping the vowel on the first column.
* The other voiced kanas letters (with [[handakuon]] or small forms) are composed by typing the voiceless consonnant, then swiping the vowel, then swiping the ''[special]'' key (in the middle of the last row) to select the [[handakuon]] (swipe to the left or right) or small kana forms (swipe up).
* Decimal digits are composed by swiping down the keys located on the first 3 rows (digits 1 to 9) or the middle of the fourth row (digit 0).
* The four main punctuation signs are composed by swiping ''r'' at end of the fourth row (swipe down for comma, left for the full stop, up for the question mark, right for the exclamation mark).
* Other signs or input controls may be composed by typing or swiping the other unused positions of other keys. But the tactile version of the layout adds keys in two additional columns for typing space, ''Enter'', ''Backspace'', moving the input cursor to the left or right, converting the previous character between hiragana and katakana, and selecting other input modes.

Unlike the 12-key input, repeating a key in Godan is not interpreted as a gesture to cycle through kana with different vowels, but rather it would be interpreted as a repeated romaji letter behaving the same as in the QWERTY layout mode.&lt;ref name="godan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/ime/japanese/answer/2700298?hl=ja|author=Google Japan|title=Godan キーボードとはなんですか?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==

Other consumer devices in Japan which allow for text entry via on-screen programming, such as [[digital video recorder]]s and [[video game consoles]], allow the user to toggle between the numerical keypad and a full keyboard (QWERTY, or ABC order) input system.

==Kana to kanji conversion==

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Mac os x ime kotoeri.jpg|thumb|left|Kana to kanji conversion using the [[Kotoeri]] input method on [[Mac OS X]]. In this image, ''{{lang|ja|日本語入力ほうほう}}'' means "Japanese input method".]] --&gt;
After the kana have been input, they are either left as they are, or converted into [[kanji]] (Chinese characters).  The Japanese language has many [[homophone]]s, and conversion of a kana spelling (representing the pronunciation) into a kanji (representing the standard written form of the word) is often a one-to-many process. The kana to kanji converter offers a list of candidate kanji writings for the input kana, and the user may use the space bar or arrow keys to scroll through the list of candidates until they reach the correct writing. On reaching the correct written form, pressing the ''Enter'' key, or sometimes the "henkan" key, ends the conversion process.  This selection can also be controlled through the GUI with a mouse or other pointing device.

If the hiragana is required, pressing the ''Enter'' key immediately after the characters are entered will end the conversion process and results in the hiragana as typed. If katakana is required, it is usually presented as an option along with the kanji choices.  Alternatively, on some keyboards, pressing the {{nihongo|''muhenkan''|無変換|}} (literally "no conversion") button switches between katakana and hiragana.

[[Image:IME demonstratie - Matsuo Bashou - Furu ikeya kawazu tobikomu mizuno oto.png|thumb|Operation of a typical IME]]
Sophisticated kana to kanji converters (known collectively as [[input method editor]]s, or IMEs), allow conversion of multiple kana words into kanji at once, freeing the user from having to do a conversion at each stage. The user can convert at any stage of input by pressing the space bar or henkan button, and the converter attempts to guess the correct division of words.  Some IME programs display a brief definition of each word in order to help the user choose the correct kanji.

Sometimes the kana to kanji converter may guess the correct kanji for all the words, but if it does not, the cursor (arrow) keys may be used to move backwards and forwards between candidate words, or digit keys can be used to select one of them directly (without pressing cursor keys multiple times and pressing ''Enter'' to confirm the choice). If the selected word boundaries are incorrect, the word boundaries can be moved using the control key (or shift key, ''e.g.'' on [[Intelligent Input Bus#Available Input Method Engines|iBus-Anthy]]) plus the arrow keys.

===Learning systems===

Modern systems learn the user's preferences for conversion and put the most recently selected candidates at the top of the conversion list, and also remember which words the user is likely to use when considering word boundaries.

====Predictive systems====

The systems used on mobile phones go even further, and try to guess entire phrases or sentences. After a few kana have been entered, the phone automatically offers entire phrases or sentences as possible completion candidates, jumping beyond what has been input.  This is usually based on words sent in previous messages.

The '''Karaboro languages''' are spoken in Burkina Faso by approximately 65,000 people (SIL 1995/1991). They belong to the [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] subfamily, but are separated from other Senufo languages by a small band of unrelated languages. Within Senufo they are thought to be most closely related to the [[Senari languages]].

'''Knaanic''' (also called '''Canaanic''', '''Leshon Knaan''', '''Judaeo-Czech''', '''Judeo-Slavic''') is an extinct [[West Slavic language|West Slavic]] [[Jewish language]], formerly spoken in the lands of the [[Western Slavs]], notably the [[Czech lands]], but also the lands of modern [[Poland]], [[Lusatia]], and other [[Sorbs|Sorbian regions]]. It became extinct in the [[Late Middle Ages]].

==Etymology==
The name comes from the land of Knaan, a geo-ethnological term denoting the Jewish populations living east of the [[Elbe]] River (as opposed to the [[Ashkenazi Jews]], living to its west, or the [[Sephardi Jews]] of the Iberian Peninsula).&lt;ref name="Datner"&gt;{{cite book | author =various authors |author2=[[Szymon Datner]]  | title =Z dziejów Żydów w Polsce | year =1983 | editor =Witold Tyloch | pages =6 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Interpress | location =Warsaw | isbn=83-223-2095-7|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the land is often translated as simply ''Slavonia'' or [[Slavic Europe]].&lt;ref name="Weinreich2"&gt;{{cite book | author =Max Weinreich | author2=[[Paul Glasser]] | author3=Shlomo Noble | author4=[[Yivo Institute for Jewish Research]] (corporate)  | title =History of the Yiddish Language | volume=1 | editor = | pages =525 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | location =New Haven | isbn=0-300-10887-7 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from ancient [[Canaan]] ([[Hebrew]]: כנען "kəna'an").

==History==
The language became extinct some time in the [[Middle Ages]], possibly because of the expansion of the [[Ashkenazi]] culture and its own [[Yiddish language]], based on [[German language|German]]. That hypothesis is often backed, but the large number of Yiddish loanwords of Slavic origin, many of which were no longer in use in [[Slavic languages]] themselves at the time of the Ashkenazi expansion. They are believed to come from Knaanic rather than from [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]]. The linguist [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] has hypothesised that Knaanic is actually the direct predecessor of Yiddish and that the language later became [[Germanisation|Germanised]].&lt;ref name="Wexler"&gt;{{cite book | author =Paul Wexler | title =Two-tiered relexification in Yiddish: The Jews, Sorbs, Khazars and the Kiev-Polessian dialects| year =2002 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Mouton de Gruyter | location =Berlin | isbn=3-11-017258-5 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the Knaanim, that is, the people speaking the Judaeo-Slavic languages, were the main cause of changes in Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Mark Louden | year =2000 | title =Contact-induced phonological change in Yiddish: Another look at Weinreich's riddles 
 | journal =Diachronica | volume =17 | issue =1 | pages =85–110 | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | doi =10.1075/dia.17.1.05lou}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view has been dismissed by nearly all mainstream academics, however, and contrasts with the more widely-accepted theories of [[Max Weinreich]], who argued that Slavic loanwords were assimilated only after Yiddish had already been fully formed.&lt;ref name="Weinreich"&gt;for instance {{cite book | author =Max Weinreich | title =For [[Roman Jakobson]]: Essays on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, 11 October 1956. | year =1956  | editor = | pages =622–632 | chapter =Yiddish, Knaanic, Slavic: The basic relationships | chapterurl = | publisher =Mouton | location =The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinreich3"&gt;''History of the Yiddish Language'', op.cit., pp. 727&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coinage===
A possible early example of Knaanic is a 9th-century letter for a Jewish community of [[Ruthenia]].&lt;ref name="Datner"/&gt; One of the very few commonly-accepted examples of Knaanic is inscriptions on [[bracteate]] coins issued under [[Mieszko the Old]] and [[Leszek the White]], two [[Poland|Polish]] rulers of 12th and 13th century. The last evidence of usage of the language (written with the [[Hebrew script]]) comes from the 16th century.

[[Image:Brakteat01.jpg|200px]]
[[Image:Brakteat02.jpg|200px|]]

The reason that Knaanic inscriptions, which use Hebrew letters, appear on coins minted for a Polish duke is that at the time, he leased some mints to Jews. The mint masters were responsible for collecting bullion and striking coins as well as periodically taking in and restriking existing coins.&lt;ref name=Bankoteka&gt;''Bankoteka'', p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscriptions on the coins range widely. Some are Hebrew names, possibly those of the mintmasters. Some are the names of the towns in which the mint operated, for instance [[Kalisz]], the burial place of Mieszko the Old. Some have the duke's name. One in the [[National Bank of Poland]]'s numismatic collection bears the word ''[[Bberakhah|bracha]]'', Hebrew for blessing.&lt;ref name=Bankoteka/&gt;

The Constitution of [[Mauritius]] mentions no official language. It only contains a statement in Article 49 that "The official language of the Assembly shall be English but any member may address the chair in French,"&lt;ref&gt;Article 49 in the [http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_126778.pdf Constitution of Mauritius]. ilo.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/abtmtius/menuitem.42f3149f267522984d57241079b521ca| title=Republic of Mauritius, Government Portal (Mauritius)}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that English and French are official languages of the [[National Assembly (Mauritius)|National Assembly (parliament)]].

In reasoning to [[argument|argue]] a claim, a [[fallacy]] is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]] of the argument and permits its recognition as [[soundness|unsound]]. Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.

Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006" /&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies.{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=This needs examples, and/or to be broken into different sentences—this is difficult to follow, and "in turn" to what? The previous sentence? Things within this long sentence?}} Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=fallacy |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |publisher= Encyclopedia Brittanica |website= Brittanica.com |accessdate= 13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty inferences in [[deductive reasoning]] are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of [[inductive reasoning]] is based on [[probability]], a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as "weak".

The conscious or habitual use of fallacies as [[rhetorical device]]s are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hornby |first1=A.S. |title= Oxford advanced learner's dictionary of current English |date=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [England] |isbn= 978-0194799003 |edition=8th |quote= sophist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal fallacies ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}
A formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the [[argument form|argument's form]].{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067957_ss1-95 "formal fallacy"]}} All formal fallacies are specific types of [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequiturs]].

* [[Argument from fallacy]] (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – assumption that if an ''argument'' for some conclusion is fallacious, then the ''conclusion'' is false.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/fallfall.html "Fallacy Fallacy"]}}
* [[Base rate fallacy]] – making a probability judgment based on [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]], without taking into account the effect of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Base%20Rate%20Fallacy |title=Base Rate Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=Psychology Glossary |publisher=AlleyDog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conjunction fallacy]] – assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/conjunction_fallacy.htm |title=Conjunction Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=ChangingMinds.org |last=Straker |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Masked-man fallacy]] (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/illisubs.html "The Masked Man Fallacy"]}}

=== Propositional fallacies ===
A propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: &lt;and&gt;, &lt;or&gt;, &lt;not&gt;, &lt;only if&gt;, &lt;if and only if&gt;). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.
&lt;br /&gt;Types of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] fallacies:
* [[Affirming a disjunct]] – concluding that one disjunct of a [[logical disjunction]] must be false because the other disjunct is true; ''A or B; A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Affirming the consequent]] – the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the [[consequent]] is true; ''if A, then B; B, therefore A''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Denying the antecedent]] – the [[consequent]] in an [[indicative conditional]] is claimed to be false because the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false; ''if A, then B; not A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}

=== Quantification fallacies ===
A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.
&lt;br /&gt; Types of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] fallacies:
* [[Existential fallacy]] – an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}

=== Formal syllogistic fallacies ===
[[Syllogistic fallacy|Syllogistic fallacies]] – logical fallacies that occur in [[syllogisms]].
* [[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]] (illicit negative) – a categorical [[syllogism]] has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of exclusive premises]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of four terms]] (''quaternio terminorum'') – a categorical syllogism that has four terms.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|pp=133–36}}
* [[Illicit major]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not [[distribution of terms|distributed]] in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Illicit minor]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]] (illicit affirmative) – a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of the undistributed middle]] – the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=316–17}}
* [[Modal fallacy]] – confusing possibility with necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/127/Modal_Scope_Fallacy|title=Modal (Scope) Fallacy|last=Bennett|first=Bo|date=|website=Logically Fallacious|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal fallacies ==
{{Main|Informal fallacy}}
Informal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679510_ss1-120 "informal fallacy"]}}
* [[Argument to moderation]] (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad temperantiam}}'') – assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=150}}
* [[Continuum fallacy]] (fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, sorites fallacy, fallacy of the heap, bald man fallacy) – improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise.{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Line-Drawing "Line-Drawing"]}}
* [[Correlative-based fallacies]]
** [[Suppressed correlative]] – a correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Theory: An Anthology |chapter=Psychological Egoism |page=193 |first=Joel |last=Feinberg |editor-first=Russ |editor-last=Shafer-Landau |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |series=Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3320-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By9nCkAvS6EC&amp;pg=PT211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Divine fallacy]] (argument from incredulity) – arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Robert T.|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|url=http://skepdic.com/dvinefal.html|title=divine fallacy (argument from incredulity)|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double counting (fallacy)|Double counting]] – counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding [[unity (number)|unity]].
* [[Equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time).{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=121}}
** [[Ambiguous middle term]] – a common ambiguity in syllogisms in which the [[middle term]] is equivocated.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=206}}
** Definitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word to deal with an objection raised against the original wording.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirie|first=Madsen|authorlink=Madsen Pirie|title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=10 September 2015|year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Motte-and-bailey fallacy – The arguer conflates two similar positions, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial (the "bailey"). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position.&lt;ref name="mott-and-bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackel|first1=Nicholas|title=The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]|date=2005|volume=36|issue=3|quote=For my purposes the desirable but only lightly defensible territory of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|Motte and Bailey castle]], that is to say, the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or position with similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible. The Motte is the defensible but undesired position to which one retreats when hard pressed...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Accent (fallacy)|Fallacy of accent]] – a specific type of ambiguity that arises when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual prosodic stress, or when, in a written passage, it's left unclear which word the emphasis was supposed to fall on.
** {{crossref|printworthy=y|(See also the [[#If-by-whiskey|if-by-whiskey]] fallacy, below.)}}
* [[Ecological fallacy]] – inferences about the nature of specific individuals are based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which those individuals belong.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=119}}
* [[Etymological fallacy]] – reasoning that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=70}}
* [[Fallacy of composition]] – assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=31}}
* [[Fallacy of division]] – assuming that something true of a thing must also be true of all or some of its parts.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=53}}
* [[False attribution]] – an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.
** [[Fallacy of quoting out of context]] (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) – refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=97}}
* [[False authority]] (single authority) – using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to sell a product or idea.  Related to the [[appeal to authority]] (not always fallacious).
* [[False dilemma]] (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) – two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options when in reality there are more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html |title=Fallacy – False Dilemma |accessdate=2011-02-01 |publisher=The Nizkor Project |work=Nizkor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[False equivalence]] – describing a situation of logical and apparent equivalence, when in fact there is none.
* [[Historian's fallacy]] – the assumption that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=209}} (Not to be confused with [[presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], which is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas, such as moral standards, are projected into the past.)
* [[Historical fallacy]] – a set of considerations is thought to hold good only because a completed process is read into the content of the process which conditions this completed result.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology", John Dewey, ''The Psychological Review'', Vol. III. No. 4. July 1896. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homunculus fallacy]] – a "middle-man" is used for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. Explains without actually explaining the real nature of a function or a process. Instead, it explains the concept in terms of the concept itself, without first defining or explaining the original concept. Explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker, a sort of [[homunculus]] inside the head, merely explains it as another kind of thinking (as different but the same).{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120113200604/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?query=homunculus&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;book_id=g9781405106795_9781405106795&amp;from=search&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;type=std&amp;id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067959_ss1-77&amp;slop=1 "Homunculus"]}}
* {{vanchor|Inflation of conflict}} – arguing that if experts of a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point, the experts must know nothing, and therefore no conclusion can be reached, or that the legitimacy of their entire field is put to question.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments"&gt;{{cite web|title=A List Of Fallacious Arguments|url=http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{vanchor|[[If-by-whiskey]]}} – an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are selectively emotionally sensitive.
* [[Incomplete comparison]] – insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison.
* [[Inconsistent comparison]] – different methods of comparison are used, leaving a false impression of the whole comparison.
* [[Intentional Fallacy|Intentionality fallacy]] – the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so.)&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K. Wimsatt|Wimsatt, William K.]] and [[Monroe Beardsley|Monroe C. Beardsley]]. "The Intentional Fallacy." ''[[Sewanee Review]]'', vol. 54 (1946): 468–88.

* [[Kettle logic]] – using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position.{{dubious|Kettle logic|date=August 2016}}
* [[Ludic fallacy]] – the belief that the outcomes of non-regulated random occurrences can be encapsulated by a statistic; a failure to take into account [[there are known knowns|unknown unknowns]] in determining the probability of events taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nassim |last=Taleb |title=The Black Swan |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |isbn=1-4000-6351-5 |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMuF4A4XF8C&amp;pg=PA127 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[McNamara fallacy]] (quantitative fallacy) – making a decision based only on quantitative observations, discounting all other considerations.
* [[Mind projection fallacy]] – subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perceptions of that object.
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]. For instance, inferring ''is'' from ''ought'' is an instance of moralistic fallacy. Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy defined below.
* [[Moving the goalposts]] (raising the bar) – argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded.
* [[Nirvana fallacy]] (perfect-solution fallacy) – solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.
* ''[[Philosophic burden of proof|Onus probandi]]'' – from the Latin ''onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat'' the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions the claim). It is a particular case of the ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad ignorantiam}}'' fallacy, here the burden is shifted on the person defending against the assertion. Also known as "[[shifting the burden of proof]]".
* [[Proof by assertion]] – a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with [[argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'')
* [[Prosecutor's fallacy]] – a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of {{em|some}} false match being found.
* [[Proving too much]] – using a form of argument that, if it were valid, could be used to reach an additional, invalid conclusion.
* [[Psychologist's fallacy]] – an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.
* [[Direct reference theory|Referential fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics Glossary R, [http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/semiotics/glossaryR/section81/main.html ''Referential fallacy or illusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; – assuming all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object or that the meaning of words often comes from how they are used.
* [[Reification (fallacy)|Reification]] (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity. In other words, it is the error of treating as a "real thing" something that is not a real thing, but merely an idea.
* [[Retrospective determinism]] – the argument that because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made its occurrence inevitable.
* [[Special pleading]] – a proponent of a position attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption.

=== Improper premise ===
* [[Begging the question]] (''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'') – providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question|title=Your logical fallacy is begging the question|work=Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html|title=Fallacy: Begging the Question|work=nizkor.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/61-begging-the-question|title=Begging the Question|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Begging-the-Question.html|title=Begging the Question|work=txstate.edu|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of [[begging the question]] fallacy.  When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion.  For example, an organic foods advertisement that says "Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives." Use of the term "unhealthy additives" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John D. Ramage|author2=John C. Bean|author3=June Johnson|title=Writing Arguments: A Rhetoric with Readings, Concise Edition, MLA Update Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-HEjwEACAAJ|year=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-458649-6|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in demonstrando}}'') – the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with; sometimes called ''assuming the conclusion''.
* [[Loaded question|Fallacy of many questions]] (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, ''{{lang|la|plurium interrogationum}}'') – someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda.

=== Faulty generalizations ===
[[Faulty generalization]] – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.
* [[Accident (fallacy)|Accident]] – an exception to a generalization is ignored.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=5}}
** [[No true Scotsman]] – makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample.{{sfn|Flew|1984|loc="No-true-Scotsman move"}}
* [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) – act of pointing at individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=155}}
** [[Survivorship bias]] – a small number of successes of a given process are actively promoted while completely ignoring a large number of failures
* [[False analogy]] – an [[argument by analogy]] in which the analogy is poorly suited.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=151}}
* [[Hasty generalization]] (fallacy of insufficient statistics, fallacy of insufficient sample, fallacy of the lonely fact, hasty induction, ''secundum quid'', converse accident, [[jumping to conclusions]]) – basing a broad conclusion on a small sample or the making of a determination without all of the information required to do so.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=134}}
* [[Inductive fallacy]] – A more general name to some fallacies, such as hasty generalization. It happens when a conclusion is made of premises that lightly support it.
* [[Misleading vividness]] – involves describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is an exceptional occurrence, to convince someone that it is a problem; this also relies on the [[appeal to emotion]] fallacy.
* [[Overwhelming exception]] – an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=127}}
* [[Thought-terminating cliché]] – a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell [[cognitive dissonance]], conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. – but in any case, to end the debate with a cliché rather than a point.

=== Questionable cause ===
[[Questionable cause]] - Is a general type error with many variants.  Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation.  Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect.  
* ''{{lang|la|[[Cum hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "with this, therefore because of this"; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) – a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=41}}
** ''{{lang|la|[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"; temporal sequence implies causation) – X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=180}}
** [[Wrong direction]] (reverse causation) – cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=135}} The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause.
** [[Ignoring a common cause]]
* [[Fallacy of the single cause]] (causal oversimplification{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=178}}) – it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.&lt;!-- Damer describes this in more general terms. --&gt;
* [[Furtive fallacy]] – outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers.
* [[Gambler's fallacy]] – the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is "due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails" is incorrect.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=186}}
** [[Inverse gambler's fallacy]]
* [[Magical thinking]] – fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In [[anthropology]], it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In [[psychology]], it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.
* [[Regression fallacy]] – ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of ''post hoc'' fallacy.

=== Relevance fallacies ===
* [[Appeal to the stone]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad lapidem}}'') – dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2709600|title=Johnson's Refutation of Berkeley: Kicking the Stone Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from ignorance]] (appeal to ignorance, ''argumentum ad ignorantiam'') – assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false, or vice versa.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=165}}
* [[Argument from incredulity]] (appeal to common sense) – "I cannot imagine how this could be true; therefore, it must be false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toolkit for Thinking|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/denial-arguments/argument-from-personal-incredulity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ad nauseam|Argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'') – repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/repetition.htm|title=Repetition|work=changingminds.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/ad-nauseam|title=Ad nauseam – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes confused with [[proof by assertion]]
* [[Argument from silence]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ex silentio}}'') – assuming that a claim is true based on the absence of textual or spoken evidence from an authoritative source, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/argument-from-silence|title=Argument from silence – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/55-argument-from-silence|title=Argument from Silence|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'' (irrelevant conclusion, missing the point) – an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=105}}

==== Red herring fallacies ====
A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/redherrf.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Red Herring|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/red-herring/|title=Logical Fallacies|work=logicalfallacies.info|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red herring]] – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=208}} Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. ''See also [[ignoratio elenchi|irrelevant conclusion]].''
* ''{{lang|la|[[Ad hominem]]}}'' – attacking the arguer instead of the argument.
**''[[Ad hominem#Circumstantial|Circumstantial ad hominem]]'' - stating that the arguers personal situation or perceived benefit from advancing a conclusion means that their conclusion is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/circumstantial-ad-hominem.html |title=Circumstantial Ad Hominem |author=Nizkor |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Poisoning the well]] – a subtype of ''{{lang|la|ad hominem}}'' presenting adverse information about a target person with the intention of discrediting everything that the target person says.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=187}}
** [[Abusive fallacy]] – verbally abusing the opponent rather than arguing about the originally proposed argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/10-ad-hominem-abusive|title=Ad Hominem (Abusive)|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to motive]] – dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer.
** [[Kafka-trapping]] – a sophistical and unfalsifiable form of argument that attempts to overcome an opponent by inducing a sense of guilt and using the opponent's denial of guilt as further evidence of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/wendy-mcelroy-beware-of-kafkatrapping/ |title= Beware of Kafkatrapping |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |date=14 August 2014 |website=The Daily Bell |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Tone policing]] – focusing on emotion behind (or resulting from) a message rather than the message itself as a discrediting tactic.
** [[Ergo decedo|Traitorous critic fallacy]] (''{{lang|la|ergo decedo}}'', 'thus leave') – a critic's perceived affiliation is portrayed as the underlying reason for the criticism and the critic is asked to stay away from the issue altogether.  Easily confused with the [[association fallacy]] ("guilt by association"), below.
**Empathy justifies the argument -  using personal empathy with the exponent of a view to justify the view. (Cf. ''argumentum ad misericordiam'', the "argument from pity.")
**Identify politics - reducing a view down to the identity of the exponent determines their right or lack of right to speak on the topic. For example, "Only a person of the African-American race has the  right to speak on African-American racial topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/theminefield/francis-fukuyama-and-the-problem-of-identity-politics/10558930|title=Francis Fukuyama and the problem of identity politics|date=2018-11-27|website=Radio National|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it.{{sfn|Clark|Clark|2005|pp=13–16}}{{sfn|Walton|1997|p=28}} The term is also used more broadly to describe arguments that are not always fallacious; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see entry in the [[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]] section}}.
** [[Appeal to accomplishment]] – an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/19-appeal-to-accomplishment|title=Appeal to Accomplishment|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below).
** [[Courtier's reply]] – a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
* [[Appeal to consequences]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad consequentiam}}'') – the conclusion is supported by a premise that asserts positive or negative consequences from some course of action in an attempt to distract from the initial discussion.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=27}}
* [[Appeal to emotion]] – an argument is made due to the manipulation of emotions, rather than the use of valid reasoning.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=111}}
** [[Appeal to fear]] – an argument is made by increasing fear and prejudice towards the opposing side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/32-appeal-to-fear|title=Appeal to Fear|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_fear.htm|title=Appeal to Fear|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to flattery]] – an argument is made due to the use of flattery to gather support.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=12}}
** [[Appeal to pity]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad misericordiam}}'') – an argument attempts to induce pity to sway opponents.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=128}}
** [[Appeal to ridicule]] – an argument is made by incorrectly presenting the opponent's argument in a way that makes it appear ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_ridicule.htm|title=Appeal to Ridicule|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/42-appeal-to-ridicule|title=Appeal to Ridicule|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[Judgmental language]] – insulting or pejorative language to influence the audience's judgment.
** [[Pooh-pooh]] – dismissing an argument perceived unworthy of serious consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munson |first1=Ronald |last2=Black |first2=Andrew |date=2016 |title=The Elements of Reasoning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr4aCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257 |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=257 |isbn=1305886836}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Wishful thinking]] – a decision is made according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=146}}
* [[Appeal to nature]] – judgment is based solely on whether the subject of judgment is 'natural' or 'unnatural'.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnature.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Appeal to Nature|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sometimes also called the "naturalistic fallacy", but is not to be confused with the other fallacies by that name.)
* [[Appeal to novelty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum novitatis}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatis}}'') – a proposal is claimed to be superior or better solely because it is new or modern.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=116}}
* [[Appeal to poverty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad Lazarum}}'') – supporting a conclusion because the arguer is poor (or refuting because the arguer is wealthy). (Opposite of [[appeal to wealth]].){{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=104}}
* [[Appeal to tradition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatem}}'') – a conclusion supported solely because it has long been held to be true.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=14}}

* [[Association fallacy]] (guilt by association and honor by association) – arguing that because two things share (or are implied to share) some property, they are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/guiltbya.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Guilt by Association|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* {{lang|la|[[Ipse dixit]]}} (bare assertion fallacy) – a claim that is presented as true without support, as self-evidently true, or as dogmatically true. This fallacy relies on the implied expertise of the speaker or on an unstated truism.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179 "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B.

The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bulverism]] (psychogenetic fallacy) – inferring why an argument is being used, associating it to some psychological reason, then assuming it is invalid as a result. The assumption that if the origin of an idea comes from a biased mind, then the idea itself must also be a falsehood.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments" /&gt;
* [[Chronological snobbery]] – a thesis is deemed incorrect because it was commonly held when something else, known to be false, was also commonly held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidlavery.net/Barfield/Encyclopedia_Barfieldiana/Lexicon/Chronological.html|title=Encyclopedia Barfieldiana|work=davidlavery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021701/http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{visible anchor|Fallacy of relative privation}} (also known as "appeal to worse problems" or "not as bad as") – dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument. [[First World problem]]s are a subset of this fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZXSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22first+world%22+%22relative+privation%22|title=All about Them: Grow Your Business by Focusing on Others|first=Bruce|last=Turkel|date=6 September 2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genetic fallacy]] – a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=93}}
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises, in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]; e.g. making statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. This is the inverse of the naturalistic fallacy.
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Naturalistic "Naturalistic"]}}&lt;ref name="nat-fal"&gt;{{cite web |work=TheFreeDictionary.com |title=Naturalistic fallacy |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/naturalistic+fallacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of [[fact–value distinction]].  ''Naturalistic fallacy'' in the stricter sense defined in the section "[[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]]" (below) is a variety of this broader sense. Naturalistic fallacy (sometimes confused with [[appeal to nature]]) is the inverse of [[moralistic fallacy]].
** [[Is–ought problem|Is–ought fallacy]]{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Is-Ought "Is-Ought"]}} – statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. 
* {{sic|hide=y|reason=This is not a typo; the naturalistic fallacy fallacy and the naturalistic fallacy are different.|''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy}}&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183201 How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is']", ''The Philosophical Review'', '''73''':1 (January 1964), 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; (anti-naturalistic fallacy)&lt;ref&gt;Alex Walter, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209025135/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep043348.pdf The Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts]", ''Evolutionary Psychology'', '''4''' (2006), 33–48&lt;/ref&gt; – inferring an impossibility to infer any instance of ''ought'' from ''is'' from the general invalidity of ''is-ought fallacy'', mentioned above. For instance, ''is'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; does imply ''ought'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, although the ''naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy would falsely declare such an inference invalid. ''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy is a type of [[argument from fallacy]].
* [[Straw man]] fallacy – an argument based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=22}}
* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] – improperly asserting a cause to explain a cluster of data.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/texsharp.html "The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"]}}
* ''[[Tu quoque]]'' ('you too' – appeal to hypocrisy, [[whataboutism]]) – the argument states that a certain position is false or wrong or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with that position.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=164}}
* [[Two wrongs make a right]] – occurs when it is assumed that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will rectify it.{{sfn|Johnson|Blair|1994|p=122}}
* [[Vacuous truth]] – a claim that is technically true but meaningless, in the form of claiming that no ''A'' in ''B'' has ''C'', when there is no ''A'' in ''B''. For example, claiming that no mobile phones in the room are on when there are no mobile phones in the room at all.

== Conditional or questionable fallacies ==
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – a form of [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. The argument may actually be cogent when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. {{crossref|See the [[#Red herring fallacies|Red herring fallacies]] section, above, for the fallacious variant.}}
* [[Broken window fallacy]] – an argument that disregards lost opportunity costs (typically non-obvious, difficult to determine or otherwise hidden) associated with destroying property of others, or other ways of externalizing costs onto others. For example, an argument that states breaking a window generates income for a window fitter, but disregards the fact that the money spent on the new window cannot now be spent on new shoes.
* [[Definist fallacy]] – involves the confusion between two notions by defining one in terms of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Naturalistic Fallacy |first=W. K. |last=Frankena |work=Mind |volume=48 |date=October 1939 |pages=464–77 |publisher=Oxford University Press |jstor=2250706 |issue=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ends justify the means – an assertion that may or may not be defensible depending on the ends and means in question. The various approaches to this sort of question are the subject of the normative ethical theories of [[consequentialism]].
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – attempts to prove a claim about ethics by appealing to a definition of the term "good" in terms of either one or more claims about natural properties. The naturalistic fallacy also has a more general version, covered in the [[#Informal fallacies|"Red herring fallacies" section]], above.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org" /&gt;
* [[Slippery slope]] (thin edge of the wedge, [[camel's nose]]) – asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact/event that should not happen, thus the first step should not happen. It is, in its essence, an appeal to probability fallacy.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=315}}

The titles of some books are self-explanatory. Good books on critical thinking commonly contain sections on fallacies, and some may be listed below.&lt;!--The list will definitely provide citation material for some, perhaps even most, but probably not all, of the article text, if anyone cares enough to capitalise on my effort.

In [[theoretical linguistics]], '''m-command''' is a syntactic relation between two elements in a tree structure. It is a broader version of [[c-command]], and like c-command, it is defined over the constituency-based trees associated with the [[phrase structure grammar]]s (= constituency grammars) of the Chomskyan tradition ([[government and binding]], [[minimalist program]]); it is therefore not applicable to the structures that other theories of syntax assume. For instance, it is not (or hardly) applicable to the dependency-based structures of [[dependency grammar]]s. Aoun and Sportiche's (1983) definition of [[c-command]] in fact corresponds to what is now known as "m-command". Chomsky (1986) established the standard definition of m-command. If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two nodes in a [[parse tree|syntactic tree]], ''X'' m-commands ''Y'' if and only if:

* ''X'' does not [[dominance (linguistics)|dominate]] ''Y'',
* ''Y'' does not dominate ''X'', and
* the [[maximal projection]] of ''X'' dominates ''Y''.

The notion of maximal projection is adopted from [[X-bar theory]]. The difference between c-command and m-command is that ''X'' m-commands everything that it c-commands, and in addition, it m-commands the element in the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] position of the [[phrase]] that it heads. M-command is used in the formulation of the syntactic relation [[government (linguistics)|government]].

==Description==
Locally known as ''padagu'' or ''salangu'' among the fisher folks, the masula boat is a large, flat-bottomed, high-sided, open boat with a clumsy design consisting of [[mango]] wood planks sewed together with strands of [[coir]] which cross over a wadding of the same material, but without frames or ribs, so that the shock due to [[Breaking wave|surf]] is much reduced. It is specially designed for use where there are no harbours of refuge, chiefly upon the surf-beaten [[Coromandel Coast]] of India. It is used in shooting shore [[seines]] and also as a cargo lighter. Its range extends along the whole of the eastern coast of India northwards of [[Cape Calimere]]. The equivalent type of boats used on the west coast are the beach lighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The pattern varies across the coast, namely, padava on the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra coast]] and bar boat in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] coast. A variant found in the region between [[Kakinada]] and [[Machilipatnam]] has ribs inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the Coromandel Coast, it is distinctly short, measuring as short as about 28 feet in length. In the northern region of the coast, chiefly in [[East Godavari district|Godavari]] and [[Visakhapatnam district|Visakhapatnam]] districts of the Andhra coast, it exceeds 40 feet in length. However, the beam and the depth measures about 8 feet and 4 feet, respectively, across the region. An oculus is sometimes painted on the bows of the masula boats in the Madras region. They are rowed by a crew varying from 8 to 12 men using [[bamboo]] or [[casuarina]] paddles, which consist of a board measuring about 10 inches in width and 14 inches in length, fixed at the end of a bamboo or young casuarina tree. They are steered by one or two tindals (coxwains), and two men are constantly kept to bale out the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Matija Majar.jpg|thumb|Matija Majar]]
'''Matija Majar''', also spelled '''Majer''' (7 February 1809 – 31 July 1892), pseudonym  '''Ziljski''', was a [[Carinthian Slovene]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest and political activist, best known as the creator of the idea of a [[United Slovenia]].

==Biography==
Majar was born in the small village of Wittenig ({{lang-sl|Vitenče}}) southwest of [[Hermagor-Pressegger See|Hermagor]] in the [[Gail (river)|Gail]] Valley ({{lang-sl|Ziljska dolina}}) in southern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. He grew up in a bilingual, [[Slovene language|Slovene]]-German environment and then attended the lyceum in [[Klagenfurt]] and in [[Graz]]. During his studies in Klagenfurt, he came under the influence of [[Anton Martin Slomšek]], a Roman Catholic priest and author who propagated the use of [[Slovene language|Slovene]] in the public sphere.

Majar served as a priest in Slovene-speaking parishes in Carinthia, first in [[Rosegg]] and then  in the settlement of Camporosso near [[Tarvisio]] in the [[Canale Valley]] (now in Italy). In 1837, he moved back to Klagenfurt, where he first worked in the administration of the [[Diocese of Gurk]], and from 1843 as the chaplain of Klagenfurt Cathedral. During his Klagenfurt years, Majar came into contact with several Slovene ethnographers and authors who worked on the revival of the Slovene language and culture, such as [[Urban Jarnik]], [[Anton Janežič]], [[Matija Ahacel]], and [[Davorin Trstenjak]]. Influenced by the [[Illyrian Movement]] in [[Croatia]], especially by the Slovene-Croatian poet and activist [[Stanko Vraz]], Majar started developing [[Pan-Slavic]] ideals.

In the early days of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848]], Majar formulated and published a political manifesto demanding the unification of all [[Slovene Lands]] into one single politically autonomous administrative entity, called [[Slovenia]]. In the following months, Majar's manifesto was elaborated into a program known under the name of ''[[United Slovenia]]''.

Because of his radical political activity, Majar was transferred from Klagenfurt to the remote parish of [[Hohenthurn]] ({{lang-sl|Straja vas}}) on the border with [[Friuli]]. After more than decade in isolation, in 1867 Majar took part in a journey to Moscow later nicknamed the "Slavic Pilgrimage", where he presented the Gail Valley at the Ethnographic Exhibition. Through this four-week absence without leave from his parish he completely fell out with the church authorities. Majar then returned to public life.  He even tried to introduce the [[Cyrillic script]] among Slovenes. He published his ethnographic research in several Russian journals, and in 1870, he was offered tenure as professor  in [[Odessa]], in the [[Russian Empire]]. However, since he was still a Roman Catholic priest, this plan  failed  as the Russian authorities did not grant him entry to the country. Nevertheless, Majar continued to propagate radical pan-Slavic ideas through the magazine ''Slavjan'' (The Slav), which he had founded in 1873. The magazine had limited success and was closed in 1875. In 1885, Majar moved to [[Prague]], where he lived until his death in 1892.

'''Naomi Sager''' (born 1927) is an American [[computational linguistics]] research scientist. She is a former research professor at [[New York University]], now retired.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She is a pioneer in the development of [[natural language processing]] for computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shortliffe|first1=Edward H.|last2=Cimino|first2=James J.

==Early life and education==
Sager was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1927. In 1946 she earned a bachelor of philosophy degree from the [[University of Chicago]]. She obtained a [[bachelor of science]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/sager/|title=Naomi Sager|publisher=New York University|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from Columbia, Sager worked for five years as an electronics engineer in the Biophysics Department of the [[Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1959 she moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where she worked on [[natural language processing|natural language computer processing]]. She was part of the team that developed the first English language parsing program, running on the [[UNIVAC I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQdxIfrff0oC&amp;pg=PA15|title=Extended Finite State Models of Language, Volume 1|editor1-first=Andras|editor1-last=Kornai|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=15|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-63198-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sager developed an algorithm to deal with [[syntactic ambiguity]] (where a sentence can be interpreted several ways due to ambiguity in its structure) and to convert [[sublanguage]] texts into suitable data formats for retrieval.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aQGE6MGJmY8C&amp;pg=PA297|title=Aspects of Automated Natural Language Generation: 6th International Workshop on Natural Language Generation Trento, Italy, April 5&amp;ndash;7, 1992|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|p=297|year=1992|isbn=978-3-540-55399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was "one of the first major practical applications of sublanguage analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittredge|first1=Richard|last2=Lehrberger|first2=John (eds.)|title=Sublanguage: Studies of Language in Restricted Semantic Domains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaLsYuzT3uwC&amp;pg=PA2|year=1982|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|isbn=3-11-008244-6|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work formed the basis for a PhD thesis, and in 1968 she was awarded a PhD in [[linguistics]] from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Her work in linguistics led her to New York University, where she collaborated with James Morris and Morris Salkoff to develop a parsing program based on natural language processing. In 1965 NYU launched the [[Linguistic String Project]] under Sager's leadership. It was aimed at developing computer methods to access information in the scientific and technical literature, based on linguistic principles. In particular, the team drew on [[Zellig Harris]]'s [[discourse analysis]] methodology to develop a system for computer analysis of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Sager, Naomi, and Nhan, Ngo Than, "The computability of strings, transformations, and sublanguage", pp. 78&amp;ndash;120. Chapter in ''The Legacy of Zellig Harris'', Vol. 2, ed. by Bruce Nevin and Stephen M. Johnson, John Benjamins Publishing Co. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Sager managed the project for 30 years until her retirement in 1995.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

At NYU she taught classes in natural language processing and advised doctoral students, many of whom (such as [[Jerry Hobbs]] and [[Carol Friedman]]) are now leaders in the field of natural language processing.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

Hector Amarilla was born July 24, 1980 in Colonia Genaro Romero, near the town of [[Coronel Oviedo]] in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=emol&gt;{{cite news|title=Escritor paraguayo de 30 años es el favorito para alzar el Nobel de Literatura |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2010/10/01/439047/escritor-paraguayo-de-30-anos-es-el-favorito-para-alzar-el-nobel-de-literatura.html|work=El Mercurio|date=1 October 2010|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was persecuted by the regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]].&lt;ref name=Born/&gt;  When he was 17 years old he went to the US to study on a scholarship; he completed the US high school requirements then enrolled in [[Metropolitan State University]] in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=emol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drobac|first1=JC|title=Paraguayan Metropolitan State University student rolls difficult and impoverished life experiences into intriguing plays|url=http://themetropolitan.metrostate.edu/September2005/092005001.html|work=The Metropolitan Online|date=September 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904075122/http://themetropolitan.metrostate.edu/September2005/092005001.html|archivedate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 his play, “La Pruebera”, was staged in Minneapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=“La Pruebera” se estrena hoy en el “Salazar”|url=http://www.lanacion.com.py/articulo.php?la-pruebera-se-estrena-hoy-en-el-salazar&amp;edicion=2&amp;sec=9&amp;art=19998|work=La Nacion|date=19 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003002255/http://www.lanacion.com.py/articulo.php?la-pruebera-se-estrena-hoy-en-el-salazar&amp;edicion=2&amp;sec=9&amp;art=19998|archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he co-authored a play with Yacoub Aljaffery called "Born in Iraq" that describes life under the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]], and the two formed a production company called Earth Speak that presented the play at the Mixed Blood Theater in Minneapolis.  Amarilla had met Aljaffery while tutoring him in Spanish at Minneapolis Community and Technical College; Aljaffery had grown up under the regime and his father had been murdered by soldiers.&lt;ref name=Born&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/07/05/borniniraq |title="Born in Iraq" gives a different perspective on conflict|work=Minnesota Public Radio|date=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608194703/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/07/05/borniniraq/ |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |first=Ambar |last=Espinoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 he authored another play called "Saved by a Poem", based on the story of his grandmother saving his father's life by submitting a poem to a national competition to honor Stroessner's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=David|title=Political Theatre (a Teatro del Pueblo festival at Intermedia Arts)|url=http://www.liberatormagazine.com/content/5.2/political.htm|work=Liberator Magazine|date=July-August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He authored a play about his own experiences under the Stroessner regime called "Fecha Feliz" that was performed in Paraguay in 2009, following some problems with [[Canal 13 (Paraguay)|Canal 13]] preventing its star from performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DOliveira dejó   Fecha Feliz por exigencias de su canal|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/doliveira-dejo-fecha-feliz-exigencias-su-canal-n192738.html|work=UltimaHora|date=1 February 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=D’Oliveira fue obligado a dejar elenco de teatro|url=http://archivo.abc.com.py/2009-02-01/articulos/491890/doliveira-fue-obligado-a-dejar-elenco-de-teatro|work=Digital abc|date=1 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909064637/http://archivo.abc.com.py/2009-02-01/articulos/491890/doliveira-fue-obligado-a-dejar-elenco-de-teatro|archivedate=9 September 2010|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El amor en tiempos de dictadura|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/el-amor-tiempos-dictadura-n195688.html|work=UltimaHora|date=February 11, 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Portuguese Wikipedia''' ({{lang-pt|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Portuguese language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]] (written Wikipédia, in Portuguese), the free encyclopedia. It was started on 11 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-May/000116.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently (October 2017) [[List of Wikipedias|the fourteenth largest Wikipedia by article count]], containing {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|pt|N}} articles.

== History ==

From late 2004, the edition grew rapidly. During May 2005, it overtook both the [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish]] and [[Italian Wikipedia|Italian]] language Wikipedias. By comparison, in May 2004 it was only the 17th Wikipedia by the number of articles.

Portuguese articles can contain variations of writing, as [[European Portuguese]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese]] have differences in vocabulary and usage. Articles can contain written characteristics of one or the other variant depending on who wrote the article.

The Portuguese [[Wikipedia community]] decided not to split a separate [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version off from the Portuguese Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Required secondary source--&gt; In 2005, a proposal to [[fork (software development)|fork]] Portuguese Wikipedia and create a Brazilian Portuguese (''pt-br'') version was voted down by the [[Wikimedia community]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Brazilian Portuguese]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 another one to create [[European Portuguese]] was rejected too by the Wikimedia community.&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia European Portuguese]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 another one to create in Brazilian Portuguese was rejected, but this time by language committee, according to new policies to create new Wikipedia editions,&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Language proposal policy]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the following explanation: ''"Brazilian Portuguese is not a separate language.. this is a requirement."''&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Brazilian Portuguese 2]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;In coincidence with a stalling of editing activity rates across all projects combined, see [[stats:EN/PlotEditsZZ.png]].&lt;/ref&gt; the project experienced a decrease of the share of edits by unregistered users (from around 20 to around 15%) and an increase of the share of such edits being reverted, from about 15% to a peak of 25% in late 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[[stats:EN/EditsRevertsPT.htm]] and in particular [[stats:EN/PlotRevertsTrendsPT.png]]; no data available after early 2010, as of June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests an increase of disruptive editing.
In the same month, a [[JavaScript]] was added that forced all unregistered users to preview their edit before saving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Diff|pt:MediaWiki:Monobook.js|diff=4843695|oldid=4842530|label= MediaWiki:Monobook.js}}, 2007-01-31; removed from {{Diff|pt:MediaWiki:Common.js|diff=9098432|oldid=7868882|label= MediaWiki:Common.js}} in 2008-01-25, the same day of introduction of an [[bugzilla:41745#c0|"emergency captcha" for all edits]].{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the Portuguese Wikipedia overtook the [[Dutch Wikipedia|Dutch language Wikipedia]] in number of articles, but in the first quarter of 2011 it was surpassed by the [[Russian Wikipedia|Russian]] and Dutch language Wikipedias, ranking in the tenth position. It is currently (2016) the 14th Wikipedia version by number of articles.

In April 2016, the project had 1388 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Portuguese Wikipedia – Most popular edition of Wikipedia by country – Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report – 1 Jul 2009-31 Oct 2013.svg|thumb|right|The countries in which the Portuguese Wikipedia is the most popular language version of Wikipedia are shown in red.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryTrends.htm|title=Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report - Wikipedia Page Views Per Country - Trends|author=Erik Zachte|date=14 November 2011|publisher=Wikimedia Statistics|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Portuguese language Wikipedia is different from the English one in a number of aspects.
* The articles for deletion process is not headed towards a consensus, but towards a proportion of votes. If the proportion of delete/keep votes reaches 2/3, the page is deleted, and the reverse applies just the same. This was decided via another voting process.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Votações/Nova proporção para a WP:PE|Wikipedia:Votações/Nova proporção para a WP:PE]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion page is kept for at least seven days, after which an administrator or eliminator will close the debate if the proportion has been reached. In case not, the discussion is prolonged for seven more days.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Ajuda:Guia Prático/Colocar páginas para eliminar|Ajuda:Guia Prático/Colocar páginas para eliminar]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors do not necessarily need to provide a reason for their vote, although they need to have the "right to vote". To earn this right, editors must be logged in, must have done a valid (undeleted and unreverted) edit at least 90 days ago, and must have at least 300 valid edits.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Direito ao voto|Wikipedia:Direito ao voto]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fair use images have always been forbidden. However, debates have been raised&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Votações/Imagens e copyright|Wikipedia:Votações/Imagens e copyright]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Votações/Revisão do uso do Fair Use na pt.wikipedia|Wikipedia:Votações/Revisão do uso do Fair Use na pt.wikipedia]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the fair use policy, all of them failing to have the uploading of such images allowed. Actually, uploading pictures at the Portuguese Wikipedia has been fully disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Votações/Impedir carregamento de imagens|Wikipedia:Votações/Impedir carregamento de imagens]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to have a picture at an article, one must create an account at the Wikimedia Commons and then link it to the page. On-going campaigns are reuniting people in favour&lt;ref name="Pro-fair use campaign"&gt;[[:pt:Usuário:Campani/Campanha-Fair-use|Usuário:Campani/Campanha-Fair-use]], Retrieved 2009-02-22{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against&lt;ref name="Against Fair Use campaign"&gt;[[:pt:Usuário:Manuel Anastácio/Contra o Fair-Use|Usuário:Manuel Anastácio/Contra o Fair-Use]], Retrieved 2009-02-22{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; the usage of fair use. As of February 2009, the number of editors in favour is higher than the number of editors against it.&lt;ref name="Pro-fair use campaign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Against Fair Use campaign"/&gt; In August 2009, though, a new debate was raised in order for users to approve or deny the creation of a policy of uploading fair use media (named "Uso Restrito de Conteúdo" there, which translates as ''Restricted Use of Contents''). This debate resulted in 142 votes for "yes" against 120 votes for "no", which means the policy was approved.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Votações/Uso Restrito de Conteúdo (fair-use)|Wikipedia:Votações/Uso Restrito de Conteúdo (fair-use)]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, it is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Uso Restrito de Conteúdo/Implementação|Wikipedia:Uso Restrito de Conteúdo/Implementação]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As much as the English language, Portuguese language also has significant regional differences on vocabulary, grammar and spelling. It is accepted that an article written in Brazilian Portuguese should be kept as it is, and the same applies to articles in European Portuguese. However, if one rewrites the article in another variant (provided content was changed, not merely the language), but leave some words in the former variant, these words should be rewritten in accordance with the new version's variant of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Wikipedia:Versões da língua portuguesa|Wikipedia:Versões da língua portuguesa]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=WP:PRIMARY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Completion of a [[CAPTCHA]] image was required for a user to make any edit if the user wa not using a registered username. It was disabled on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/104660/ Gerrit 104660]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Procedural rhetoric''' or simulation rhetoric&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative"&gt;[[Gonzalo Frasca|Frasca, Gonzalo]] (2003). “Simulation versus Narrative: Introduction to Ludology.” In ''The Video Game Theory Reader''. Ed. by Mark J. P. Wolf and Bernard Perron. New York: Routledge. 221–37  {{ISBN|9780415965798}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a rhetorical concept that explains how people learn through the authorship of rules and processes. The theory argues that games can make strong claims about how the world works—not simply through words or visuals but through the processes they embody and models they construct.The term was first coined by Ian Bogost in his 2007 book Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"&gt;[[Ian Bogost|Bogost, Ian]] (2008). "The Rhetoric of Video Games." ''[https://mitpress.mit.edu/index.php?q=books/ecology-games The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning]''. Ed. by Katie Salen. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. 117–40. {{ISBN|9780262693646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Bogost|Bogost]] is a professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication and in Interactive Computing in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Chair in Media Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

Bogost argues that games make strong claims about how the world works by the processes they embody. Procedural rhetoric analyzes the art of persuasion by rule based representations and interactions rather than spoken or written word.  Procedural rhetoric focuses on how gamemakers craft laws and rules within a game to convey a particular ideology.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

==A New Rhetorical Theory==
The term “procedural rhetoric” was developed by [[Ian Bogost]] in his book ''Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames''.&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games"&gt;[[Ian Bogost|Bogost, Ian]] (2007). ''Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.  {{ISBN|978-0262514880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost defines procedural rhetoric as “the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures”&lt;ref&gt;‘Persuasive Games’ p ix&lt;/ref&gt; and “the art of using processes persuasively.”&lt;ref&gt;‘Persuasive Games’ p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Gonzalo Frasca]]’s preferred term of “simulation rhetoric” uses different language, the concept is the same: he envisions the authors of games as crafting laws&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 229&lt;/ref&gt; and that these authors convey ideology “by adding or leaving out manipulation rules.”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 231&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca defines simulations as “to model a (source) system through a different system which maintains (for somebody) some of the behaviors of the original system,”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 223"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 223&lt;/ref&gt; a definition that shows the importance of systemic procedures.

In coining this term, Bogost borrows [[Janet Murray]]’s definition of procedural from her book ''Hamlet on the Holodeck''—“a defining ability to execute a series of rules”&lt;ref name="Hamlet on the Holodeck"&gt;Murray, Janet (1997). ''Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace''. The Free Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;—to theorize that a different system of learning and persuasion could be found in computerized media. As Bogost suggests, “This ability to execute computationally a series of rules fundamentally separates computers from other media.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122"&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca likewise sees the need for new rhetorical theory because “simulations can express messages in ways that narrative simply cannot.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 225&lt;/ref&gt; In procedural rhetoric, these rules of behavior then create “possibility spaces, which can be explored through play.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122"/&gt;

Procedural rhetoric also views games as strongly rhetorical—we “read games as deliberate expressions of particular perspectives.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 119&lt;/ref&gt;  The exploration of possibility spaces becomes rhetorical and instructive as soon as games make claims about aspects of human experience, whether they do so intentionally or inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 123&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca concurs that “video games are capable of conveying the ideas and feelings of an author”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 224&lt;/ref&gt; and “offer distinct rhetorical possibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 222&lt;/ref&gt; Game laws represent “the designer's agenda.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 233"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 233&lt;/ref&gt; As Bogost traces the history of rhetoric back to classical Greece, he argues that, as theories of rhetoric have expanded from examining only verbal to including written and visual media, an expansion of rhetoric is now necessary to include the properties of procedural expression: “A theory of procedural rhetoric is needed to make commensurate judgments about the software systems we encounter everyday and to allow a more sophisticated procedural authorship with both persuasion and expression as its goal […] Procedural rhetoric affords a new and promising way to make claims about how things work.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125"&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Matt King summarizes the procedural and rhetorical sides of this theory, “By embodying certain processes and not others, by structuring a playing experience around particular rules and logics, videogames make claims about the world and how it works–or how it does not work, or how it should work.”&lt;ref name="Rhetoric's Procedures: Rhetorical Peaks and What It Means to Win the Game"&gt;King, Matt (2010). “Procedural Rhetorics - Rhetoric's Procedures: Rhetorical Peaks and What It Means to Win the Game.” ''Currents in Electronic Literacy: Gaming across the Curriculum''. {{cite web |url=http://currents.cwrl.utexas.edu/2010/king_procedural_rhetorics_rhetorics_procedures |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026035307/http://currents.cwrl.utexas.edu/2010/king_procedural_rhetorics_rhetorics_procedures |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogost overwhelmingly uses video games as the medium to clarify this concept because “they embody processes and rely upon players to enact them.”&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 44, 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does suggest that this theory could apply to other types of “play” and their possibility spaces: “For example, consider a game of hide-and-seek in which an older player must count for a longer time to allow younger players a better chance to hide more cleverly. This rule is not merely instrumental; it suggests a value of equity in the game and its players.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 121&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, procedural rhetoric would apply to board games such as Elizabeth Magie’s ''The Landlord Game'', a forerunner of ''[[Monopoly (game)]]'', that was designed to educate players on the negative outcomes of capitalism.&lt;ref name=Inventor&gt;Pilon, Mary (February 13, 2015). "Monopoly’s Inventor: The Progressive Who Didn’t Pass 'Go.'" ''New York Times''. Retrieved February 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca is much more explicit about the historical use of procedural rhetoric: “Simulation is not a new tool. It has always been present through such common things as toys and games but also through scientific models or cybertexts like the ''[[I-Ching]]''.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 223"/&gt;

==Procedural vs. Simulation Rhetoric==
Although Bogost and Frasca use different terms, their descriptions of this new type of rhetoric should be considered synonymous. Bogost sees procedural rhetoric in contrast to theories of verbal, written, and visual rhetoric,&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125"/&gt; while Frasca coins the term “simulation rhetoric” to compare with narrative and drama as a form of representational storytelling. As he explains, “It is common to contrast narrative and drama because the former is the form of the past, of what cannot be changed, while the latter unfolds in present time. To take the analogy further, simulation is the form of the future. It does not deal with what happened or is happening, but with what may happen. Unlike narrative and drama, its essence lays on a basic assumption: change is possible.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 233"/&gt; The ways in which they discuss their concepts are nevertheless almost identical.

==Further Concepts of Procedural Rhetoric==
Expanding from the fundamental concepts of '''Procedural Rhetoric''', where the core concepts deal with rhetoric as means of learning through rules and processes,&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games" /&gt; there are extensions of other theories that contribute to the functionality of Procedural Rhetoric. In her article ''Game-based Pedagogy in the Writing Classroom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shultz Colby|first=Rebekah|title=Game-based Pedagogy in the Writing Classroom|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compcom.2016.11.002|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=43|pages=55–72|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2016.11.002|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebekah Schultz Colby, outlines how "games" can essentially be beneficial towards improving an individual's skill due to the nature of ''[[Multimodal interaction]],'' or better defined as ''Multimodal Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869461917|title=An evaluation framework for multimodal interaction : determining quality aspects and modality choice|last=Ina,|first=Wechsung,|isbn=9783319038094|location=Hedielberg|oclc=869461917}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article. Though Schultz, only focuses on core principles of games and the effect of game instructions, this approach relates to [[Ian Bogost]]'s theory on how a pedagogical rule-based system can effect the outcome of a persons performance. Moreover, between the similarities of Bogost and Schultz's theories, it can be noted that there is a correlation between the rule based system, and the improvements of a persons skills.

==The Rhetoric of Gaming==
[[Rhetoric]] is the art of discourse wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular audiences in specific situations. Procedural rhetoric focuses on the composition of gameplay, more specifically how simulation games are constructed to make claims about how the world should work.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

James Gee, Professor at University of Wisconsin - Madison outlined the importance of video games for learning in his essay Why Video Games are Good For Learning, Gee describes commercial games as “worlds in which variables interact through time” .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gee|first1=James P.|title=What Video Games Have To Teach Us About Learning and Literacy?|date=December 26, 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=1403984530|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game-makers compose video games with a series of predetermined rules and processes that the play must follow in order to win. The player must learn the rules of the virtual world and deduce what is possible and impossible in order to solve problems and carry out the ultimate goal of winning. The requirement of learning the rules of video games is the baseline of the procedural rhetoric theory.

Researchers Jens Seiffert and Howard Nothhaft found that computer games are powerful persuasive tools that act as a manipulating force for society.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seiffert|first1=Jens|last2=Nothhaft|first2=Howard|title=The Missing Media: The Procedural Rhetoric of Computer Games|journal=Public Relations Review|date=June 2015|volume=41|issue=2|pages=254–263|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2014.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers cited a 2009 study finding that military computer games transferred to the players understanding of warfare. In particular, the logic of the game revealed by the procedural and structural rules guided players with a deeper comprehension of the rules of warfare and tactics in real life.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

Through the processes and rules of a simulation, game-makers have the ability to persuade players to view the world according to the procedures of a particular game. While contemporary rhetorics focuses on discourse as the art of persuasion, procedural rhetorics focuses on the gaming system, processes, rules, and procedures as a mean to persuade the audience, that being players.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

==Procedural Rhetoric in Other Settings==
Elements of Procedural Rhetoric can also be found outside of video games. For example, Bogost references Bureaucratic processes that involve computers, such as banking. In banking, the actions available to account holders are limited and directed by the procedures built into the banking system such as interest, fees, credit, and money transfers. These factors incentivise account holders to take a variety of specific actions, such as spending to improve credit, saving to accrue interest, and more.&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games" /&gt;

Alec Slade Baker of San Diego State University argues that procedural rhetoric be used to study capitalist systems as well. In his masters dissertation, ''Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Alec Slade|title=Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|date=2017|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1986814804/abstract/AAF7687CA8704464PQ/1?accountid=14696|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he examines the rhetorical arguments created by customer service return policies at a variety of commercial businesses. According to him, forgiving return policies, Nordstrom’s communicate to customers a willingness to help and accommodate. On the other hand, strict return policies such as that of Dollar Tree reflect a hostile distrust of the customer that impacts the way they interact with those businesses.

Lucille A. Jewel of the University of Tennessee College of Law theorizes uses for procedural rhetoric in the courtroom setting in her scholarly article, ''The Bramble Bush of Forking Paths: Digital Narrative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewel|first1=Lucille A.|title=The Bramble Bush of Forking Paths: Digital Narrative, Procedural Rhetoric, and the Law|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Technology|date=2011|volume=14|pages=66–105|url=http://heinonline.org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/yjolt14&amp;div=4&amp;start_page=66&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, games or other interactive media could be used in the future to help explain complex legal concepts to juries, taking over the role that videos or other supplemental media now hold. This is because interactive media that uses procedural rhetoric can better illustrate the complexities of law on a case-by-case basis than static media.

==Critical Discourse==
Along with the development of Procedural Rhetoric in the greater Digital Rhetoric discourse, several counter-arguments critiquing the theory have been made as well. For example, Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas of the University of California, Santa Cruz critiqued the concept of procedural rhetoric in their conference paper, ''Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treanor|first1=Mike|last2=Mateas|first2=Michael|title=Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons|journal=DiGRA '09 - Proceedings of the 2009 DiGRA International Conference: Breaking New Ground: Innovation in Games, Play, Practice and Theory|date=September 2009|volume=5|url=http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/newsgames-procedural-rhetoric-meets-political-cartoons/|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the concept gave too much credit to game creators who often didn’t take the rhetoric supported by their systems into account during game design. For example, the 2004 flash game ''Madrid'' by Gonzalo Frasca,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frasca|first1=Gonzalo|title=Madrid|url=http://www.newsgaming.com/games/madrid/|website=Newsgaming.com|publisher=Newsgaming.com|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; created as a procedural rhetoric device discussing the 2004 Madrid train bombings, features a gameplay system that promotes frenetic, consistent, stressful action which is in direct opposition to the goal of creating empathy between the players and the people who were harmed.

Another major critique of Procedural Rhetoric is expressed by Miguel Sicart of the IT University of Copenhagen in his journal article, ''Against Procedurality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sicart|first1=Miguel|title=Against Procedurality|journal=The International Journal of Computer Game Research|date=December 2011|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap/|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sicart disagrees with Procedural Rhetoric because of how it focuses completely on the creator’s engineered experiences and systems, while ignoring the ability of the player to interact and change procedural systems in unforeseen ways. Specifically, he claims that the unique interests and goals of each player have the power to radically change the play experience, regardless of the author’s intent.

==Examples of Procedural Rhetoric==
Bogost describes three prominent categories through which procedural rhetoric manifests itself in video games: politics, advertising, and education. Frasca also suggests examples of rhetoric in each of these categories.

'''Politics'''

Although perhaps not overwhelmingly common, a number of games have made political arguments. Bogost shows the potential effect of procedural rhetoric on political values through ''The Howard Dean for Iowa Game''. He discusses how this game represents the “procedural rhetoric of politics,” claiming that “one amasses supporters in support of nothing more than support.”&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 328&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost also sees political content in the government-funded [[first-person shooter]] ''[[America’s Army]]'', arguing that the game “serves as a convincing procedural rhetoric for the chain of command, the principle structure new recruits must understand immediately.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 130&lt;/ref&gt; America’s Army therefore privileges government values and authority, suggesting to players that they should uncritically accept the missions they are provided. Frasca cites a 2002 CBS report that Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura considered using video games for propaganda and mentions the wave of anti-Osama video games that erupted online after September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 226&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising'''
 
Rhetoric focuses on persuasion, so it is no surprise that advertising would be present in some examples of procedural rhetoric. Bogost describes a possible effect of advertising procedural rhetoric in the game ''[[Animal Crossing]]''. Although the game is targeted to children, there are certain rare things in the game that can only be found during the late hours of the night, meaning that the child would have to ask permission to acquire this rare item or enlist the help of parent(s) to acquire it. Bogost argues that this could be incentivized by the parents—for example, “do your chores and I will let you stay up to get it”—which shows the persuasive effect video games could have on both the parent and the child.&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 334-335&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca sees advertising as especially prevalent in procedural rhetoric, arguing that advertisers “see in games a tool for persuasion” and noting the prevalence of product-based “[[advergames]].”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt; Advergames make it especially clear that games in general contain ideological content because players understand that advergames have an explicit agenda.&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt;

'''Education'''

Education and instruction is an inherent theme of procedural rhetoric; players learn from seeing their behaviors rewarded or punished. Bogost uses the ''[[SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon]]'' game (one of a number of simulation games about managing business franchises) as an example of the educational value of procedural rhetoric. In these games the player is tasked with creating a theme park, zoo, or other business and making it profitable. Although such games allow players to develop their businesses as they see fit, they ultimately require a successful business to progress and keep playing. This feedback process forces the player to learn how to manage a business and grow in knowledge as they play.&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 335&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca mentions the simulation games ''[[SimCity]]'' and ''[[The Sims]]'' as examples of procedural rhetoric and uses the handling of same-sex relationships as an example:
“[T]he way that ''The Sims'''s designers dealt with gay couples was not just through representation (for example, by allowing players to put gay banners on their yards), they also decided to build a rule about it. In this game, same-gender relationships are possible. […] By incorporating this rule, the designers are showing tolerance towards this sexual option.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''productivity''' is the degree to which [[native speaker]]s use a particular grammatical process, especially in [[word formation]]. It compares grammatical processes that are in frequent use to less frequently used ones that tend towards [[lexicalization]]. Generally the test of productivity concerns identifying which grammatical forms would be used in the coining of new words: these will tend to only be converted to other forms using productive processes.

==Examples in English==
In [[standard English]], the formation of [[preterite]] and past [[participle]] forms of [[verb]]s by means of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (for example, ''sing''&amp;ndash;''sang''&amp;ndash;''sung'') is no longer considered productive. Newly coined verbs in English overwhelmingly use the 'weak' (regular) ending ''-ed'' for the past tense and past participle (for example, ''[[spam (electronic)|spammed]]'', ''[[electronic mail|e-mailed]]''). Similarly, the only clearly productive [[English plural|plural ending]] is ''-(e)s''; it is found on the vast majority of English [[count noun]]s and is used to form the plurals of neologisms, such as ''[[FAQ]]s'' and ''[[Muggle]]s''. The ending ''-en'', on the other hand, is no longer productive, being found only in ''oxen'', ''children'', and the now-rare ''brethren''. Because these old forms can sound incorrect to modern ears, [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] can wear away at them until they are no longer used: ''brethren'' has now been replaced with the more regular-sounding ''brothers'' except when talking about religious orders. It appears that many strong verbs were completely lost during the transition from [[Old English]] to [[Middle English]], possibly because they sounded archaic or were simply no longer truly understood.

In both cases, however, occasional exceptions have occurred. A false analogy with other verbs caused ''dug'' to become thought of as the 'correct' preterite and past participle form of ''dig'' (the conservative King James Bible preferred ''digged'' in 1611) and more recent examples, like ''snuck'' from ''sneak'' and ''dove'' from ''dive'', have similarly become popular. Some American English dialects also use the non-standard ''drug'' as the past tense of ''drag''.

==Significance==
Since use to produce novel (new, non-established) structures is the clearest proof of usage of a grammatical process, the evidence most often appealed to as establishing productivity is the appearance of novel forms of the type the process leads one to expect, and many people would limit the definition offered above to exclude use of a grammatical process that does not result in a novel structure. Thus in practice, and, for many, in theory, productivity is the degree to which native speakers use a particular grammatical process ''for the formation of novel structures''.  A productive grammatical process defines an '''open class''', one which admits new words or forms.  Non-productive grammatical processes may be seen as operative within '''closed classes''': they remain within the language and may include very common words, but are not added to and may be lost in time or through regularization converting them into what now seems to be a correct form.

Productivity is, as stated above and implied in the examples already discussed, a matter of degree, and there are a number of areas in which that may be shown to be true. As the example of ''-en'' becoming productive shows, what has apparently been non-productive for many decades or even centuries may suddenly come to some degree of productive life, and it may do so in certain dialects or sociolects while not in others, or in certain parts of the vocabulary but not others. Some patterns are only very rarely productive, others may be used by a typical native speaker several times a year or month, whereas others (especially [[syntax|syntactic]] processes) may be used productively dozens or hundreds of times in a typical day. It is not atypical for more than one pattern with similar functions to be comparably productive, to the point that a speaker can be in a quandary as to which form to use —e.g., would it be better to say that a taste or color like that of raisins is ''raisinish'', ''raisiny'', ''raisinlike'', or even ''raisinly''? 

It can also be very difficult to assess when a given usage is productive or when a person is using a form that has already been learned as a whole. Suppose a reader comes across an unknown word such as ''despisement'' meaning "an attitude of despising". The reader may apply the verb+''ment'' noun-formational process to understand the word perfectly well, and this would be a kind of productive use. This  would be essentially independent of whether or not the writer had also used the same process productively in coining the term, or whether he or she had learned the form from previous usage (as most English speakers have learned ''government'', for instance), and no longer needed to apply the process productively in order to use the word. Similarly a speaker or writer's use of words like ''raisinish'' or ''raisiny'' may or may not involve productive application of the noun+''ish'' and noun+''y'' rules, and the same is true of a hearer or reader's understanding of them. But it will not necessarily be at all clear to an outside observer, or even to the speaker and hearer themselves, whether the form was already learnt and whether the rules were applied or not.

==English and productive forms==
Developments over the last five hundred years or more have meant English has developed in ways very different from the evolution of most world languages across history. English is a language with a long written past that has preserved many words that might otherwise have been lost or changed, often in fixed texts such as the [[King James Version]] of the Bible which are not updated regularly to modernise their language. English also has many conventions for writing polite and formal prose, which are often very different from how people normally speak. As literacy among native English speakers has become almost universal, it has become increasingly easy for people to bring back into life archaic words and grammar forms, often to create a comic or humorously old-fashioned effect, with the expectation that these new coinings will be understandable. These processes would be much rarer for languages without a culture of literacy.

English has also borrowed extensively from other languages because of technology and trade, often borrowing plural forms as well as singular ones into standard English. For example, the plural of ''radius'' (from Latin) has not decisively settled between ''radiuses'' and the original Latin ''radii'', though educated opinion prefers the latter. In some cases, new words have been coined from these bases (often Latin) on the same rules.

==Examples in other languages==
One study, which focuses on the usage of the Dutch suffix -heid (comparable to -ness in English) hypothesizes that -heid gives rise to two kinds of abstract nouns: those referring to concepts and those referring to states of affairs. It shows that the referential function of -heid is typical for the lowest-frequency words, while its conceptual function is typical for the highest-frequency words. It claims that high-frequency formations with the suffix -heid are available in the mental lexicon, whereas low-frequency words and neologisms are produced and understood by rule.&lt;ref&gt;BAAYEN, R. &amp; NEIJT, A. (2009). Productivity in context: a case study of a Dutch suffix. Linguistics, 35(3), pp. 565-588. Retrieved 24 Oct. 2017, from doi:10.1515/ling.1997.35.3.565&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5441">'''Sliding window based part-of-speech tagging''' is used to [[part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech tag]] a text. 

A high percentage of words in a [[natural language]] are words which out of context can be assigned more than one part of speech. The percentage of these ambiguous words is typically around 30%, although it depends greatly on the language. Solving this problem is very important in many areas of [[natural language processing]]. For example in [[machine translation]] changing the part-of-speech of a word can dramatically change its translation.

Sliding window based part-of-speech taggers are programs which assign a single part-of-speech to a given lexical form of a word, by looking at a fixed sized "window" of words around the word to be [[word-sense disambiguation|disambiguated]].

The two main advantages of this approach are:

* It is possible to automatically train the tagger, getting rid of the need of manually tagging a corpus.
* The tagger can be implemented as a [[finite-state machine|finite state automaton]] ([[Mealy machine]])

==Formal definition==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \{ \gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}, \ldots, \gamma_{|\Gamma|} \}&lt;/math&gt;

be the set of grammatical tags of the application, that is, the set of all possible tags which may be assigned to a word, and let

:&lt;math&gt;W = \{ w1, w2, \ldots \}&lt;/math&gt;

be the vocabulary of the application. Let 

:&lt;math&gt; T : W \rightarrow P ( \Gamma )&lt;/math&gt; 

be a function for morphological analysis which assigns each &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; its set of possible tags, &lt;math&gt;T ( w ) \subseteq \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, that can be implemented by a full-form lexicon, or a morphological analyser. Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{ \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \ldots, \sigma_{|\Sigma|} \}&lt;/math&gt; 

be the set of word classes, that in general will be a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; with the restriction that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; all of the words &lt;math&gt;w, \Sigma, \sigma&lt;/math&gt; will receive the same set of tags, that is, all of the words in each word class &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; belong to the same ambiguity class.

Normally, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is constructed in a way that for high frequency words, each word class contains a single word, while for low frequency words, each word class corresponds to a single ambiguity class. This allows good performance for high frequency ambiguous words, and doesn't require too many parameters for the tagger.

With these definitions it is possible to state problem in the following way: Given a text &lt;math&gt;w[1] w[2] \ldots w[L] \in W^*&lt;/math&gt; each word &lt;math&gt;w[t]&lt;/math&gt; is assigned a word class &lt;math&gt;T ( w[t] ) \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (either by using the lexicon or morphological analyser) in order to get an ambiguously tagged text &lt;math&gt;\sigma[1] \sigma[2] \ldots \sigma[L] \in W^*&lt;/math&gt;. The job of the tagger is to get a tagged text &lt;math&gt;\gamma[1] \gamma[2] \ldots \gamma[L]&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\gamma[t] \in T(\sigma[t])&lt;/math&gt;) as correct as possible.

A statistical tagger looks for the most probable tag for an ambiguously tagged text &lt;math&gt;\sigma[1] \sigma[2] \ldots \sigma[L]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^*[1] \ldots \gamma^*[L] = \operatorname{\arg\,max}_{\gamma[t] \in T(\sigma[t])} p(\gamma[1] \ldots \gamma[L] \sigma[1] \ldots \sigma[L]) &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Bayes formula]], this is converted into:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^*[1] \ldots \gamma^*[L] = \operatorname{\arg\,max}_{\gamma[t] \in T(\sigma[t])} p(\gamma[1] \ldots \gamma[L]) p(\sigma[1] \ldots \sigma[L] \gamma[1] \ldots \gamma[L])&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(\gamma[1] \gamma[2] \ldots \gamma[L])&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a particular tag (syntactic probability) and &lt;math&gt;p(\sigma[1] \dots \sigma[L] \gamma[1] \ldots \gamma[L])&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that this tag corresponds to the text &lt;math&gt;\sigma[1] \ldots \sigma[L]&lt;/math&gt; (lexical probability).

In a [[Markov model]], these probabilities are approximated as products. The syntactic probabilities are modelled by a first order Markov process:

:&lt;math&gt;p(\gamma[1] \gamma[2] \ldots \gamma[L]) = \prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\gamma[t+1] \gamma[t])&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma[0]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma[L+1]&lt;/math&gt; are delimiter symbols.

Lexical probabilities are independent of context:

:&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma[1] \sigma[2] \ldots \sigma[L] \gamma[1] \gamma[2] \ldots \gamma[L]) = \prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\sigma[t] \gamma[t])&lt;/math&gt;

One form of tagging is to approximate the first probability formula:

:&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma[1] \sigma[2] \ldots \sigma[L] \gamma[1] \gamma[2] \ldots \gamma[L]) = \prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\gamma[t] C_{(-)}[t] \sigma[t] C_{(+)}[t])&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{(-)}[t] = \sigma[t - N_{(-)}] \sigma [t - N_{(-)}] \ldots \sigma[t - 1]&lt;/math&gt; is the right context of the size &lt;math&gt;N_{(+)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this way the sliding window algorithm only has to take into account a context of size &lt;math&gt;N_{(-)} + N_{(+)} + 1&lt;/math&gt;. For most applications &lt;math&gt;N_{(-)} = N_{(+)} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For example to tag the ambiguous word "run" in the sentence "He runs from danger", only the tags of the words "He" and "from" are needed to be taken into account.

The '''Table of Opposites''' ({{lang-el|συστοιχία}} ''sustoichia'')&lt;ref&gt;Barry Sandywell, ''Presocratic Reflexivity: The Construction of Philosophical Discourse c. 600-450 B.C.: Logological Investigations: Volume Three'', Routledge, 2002, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Pythagoras]] is the oldest surviving of many such tables propounded by philosophers.  [[Aristotle]] is the main source of our knowledge of the Pythagorean table.

Here follows a rough translation of the Table of Opposites, although like all translations the precise meaning does not necessarily carry over from the original Greek.  For example, "crooked" has connotations in English that it may lack in the original.

* finite, infinite
* odd, even
* one, many
* right, left
* rest, motion
* straight, crooked
* [[light and darkness|light, darkness]]
* [[good and evil|good, evil]]
* square, oblong

Some sources add:

* male, female

Of these nine or ten opposites, many philosophers have seized on the third pair as one of the most profound questions in philosophy.  Is the universe one?  Then how is it diverse?  Is the universe many?  Then how is it unified?  This has historically been known as the [[mereology|problem of the one and the many]], about which no small amount of ink has been spilled.

The '''Tocharian alphabet''' is a version of [[Brahmi script]] used to write the Central Asian Indo-European [[Tocharian languages]], mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese [[paper]], preserved by the extremely dry climate of the [[Tarim Basin]]. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.

Tocharian A and B are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Properly speaking, based on the tentative interpretation of ''twqry'' as related to ''Tokharoi'', only Tocharian A may be referred to as ''Tocharian'', while Tocharian B could be called ''Kuchean'' (its native name may have been ''kuśiññe''), but since their grammars are usually treated together in scholarly works, the terms A and B have proven useful. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the 1st millennium BC. Given the small geographical range of and the lack of secular texts in Tocharian A, it might alternatively have been a [[liturgical language]], the relationship between the two being similar to that between [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is by no means definite, due to the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.

The alphabet the [[Tocharians]] were using is derived from the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) and is referred to as ''slanting Brahmi''. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] works in [[Sanskrit]] and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, and medical and magical texts, and one love poem. Many Tocharians embraced Manichaean duality or Buddhism.

In 1998, Chinese linguist [[Ji Xianlin]] published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian [[Maitreyasamiti-Nataka]] discovered in 1974 in [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County|Yanqi]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/01/29/fragments_of_the_tocharian/index.html Fragments of the Tocharian]", Andrew Leonard, ''How the World Works'', [[Salon.com]], January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107526 Review of 'Fragments of the Tocharian A Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Xinjiang Museum, China. In Collaboration with Werner Winter and Georges-Jean Pinault by Ji Xianlin']", J. C. Wright, ''[[Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]'', [[University of London]], Vol. 62, No. 2 (1999), pp. 367–370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/3110149044 Fragments of the Tocharian a Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Zinjiang Museum, China]", Ji Xianlin, Werner Winter, Georges-Jean Pinault, ''Trends in Linguistics, Studies and Monographs''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocharian script probably died out after 840, when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] were expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], retreating to the Tarim Basin. This theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur. During Uyghur rule, the peoples mixed with the Uyghurs to produce much of the modern population of what is now [[Xinjiang]].

==The Tocharian Script==

The Tocharian script is based on Brahmi, where each consonant has an inherent vowel, which can be altered by adding a vowel mark, or removed with a special nullifying mark, the [[virama]]. Like Brahmi, Tocharian uses stacking for conjunct consonants, and has irregular conjunct forms of [[File:Tocharian letter ra.gif|30px]], ra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gippert|first=Jost|title=Tocharian Brahmi Script|url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/idg/toch/tochbr.htm|publisher=TITUS Didactica|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other library classification schemes that have started their life as national systems, the UDC was conceived and maintained as an international scheme. Its translation in world languages started at the beginning of the 20th century and has since been published in various printed editions in over 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=editions UDC Editions], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=UDC Translations: a 2004 Survey Report and Bibliography |journal=Extensions &amp; Corrections to the UDC |date=November 2004 |volume=26 |issue=2004 |pages=58–80 |ref=harv  |language=en|hdl=10150/106363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDC Summary, an abridged Web version of the scheme is available in over 50 languages.&lt;ref name="UDCS" /&gt; The classification has been modified and extended over the years to cope with increasing output in all areas of human knowledge, and is still under continuous review to take account of new developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=major_revisions Major Revisions of the UDC 1993-2013], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic, A. |last2=Cordeiro, M.

Albeit originally designed as an indexing and retrieval system, due to its logical structure and scalability, UDC has become one of the most widely used knowledge organization systems in libraries, where it is used for either shelf arrangement, content indexing or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=UDC implementation: from library shelves to a structured indexing language |journal=International Cataloguing and Bibliographic Control |date=2004 |volume=33.3 |issue=2004 |pages=60–65 |ref=harv |language=en|hdl=10150/105685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDC codes can describe any type of document or object to any desired level of detail. These can include textual documents and other media such as [[film]]s, [[video]] and [[sound]] recordings, [[illustration]]s, [[map]]s as well as [[realia (library science)|realia]] such as [[museum]] objects.

== History ==

The UDC was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] bibliographers [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] at the end of the 19th century. In 1895, they created the Universal Bibliographic Repertory (''Répertoire Bibliographique Universel'') (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive classified index to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist [[Herbert Haviland Field]], who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. Boyd: From the index card to the World City: knowledge organization and visualization in the work and ideas of Paul Otlet. IN: A. Slavic, A. Akdag Salah and S. Davies (Eds.): Proceedings of the International UDC Seminar 2013: Classification &amp; Visualization: Interfaces to Knowledge, The Hague (Netherlands), 24–25 October 2013. Wurzburg: Ergon Verlag, 2013, pp. 1-41&lt;/ref&gt; A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely enumerative classification (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French "Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel" (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special auxiliary tables with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.

The Universal Bibliographic Repertory itself has developed into a remarkable information resource. In the period before World War I it grew to more than 11 million records. The catalogue and its content organized by UDC can still be seen in [[Mundaneum]] in Mons, Belgium (in 2013 recommended for inclusion in the UNESCO [[Memory of the World Register]]&lt;ref name="UNESCO Memory of the World Register"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-9/universal-bibliographic-repertory/ UNESCO Memory of the World Register], "Universal Bibliographic Repertory - UNESCO Memory of the World Register"&lt;/ref&gt;).

== The application of UDC ==

UDC is used in around 150,000 libraries in 130 countries and in many bibliographical services which require detailed content indexing. In a number of countries it is the main classification system for information exchange and is used in all types of libraries: public, school, academic and special libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slavic |first1=A. |title=Use of the Universal Decimal Classification: a worldwide survey |journal=Journal of Documentation |date=2006 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=211–228 |ref=harv |language=en|hdl=10150/105579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UDC Users Worldwide"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=users_worldwide  UDC Users Worldwide], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UDC Countries"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/countries.htm UDC Countries], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;

UDC is also used in national bibliographies of around 30 countries. Examples of large databases indexed by UDC include:&lt;ref name="Large collections"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=collections Collections indexed by UDC], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt; 
: NEBIS (The Network of Libraries and Information Centers in Switzerland) — 2.6 million records
: COBIB.SI (Slovenian National Union Catalogue) — 3.5 million records
: Hungarian National Union Catalogue (MOKKA) — 2.9 million records
: [[VINITI RAS]] database (All-Russian Scientific and Technical Information Institute of Russian Academy of Science) with 28 million records
: Meteorological &amp; Geoastrophysical Abstracts (MGA) with 600 journal titles
: PORBASE (Portuguese National Bibliography) with 1.5 million records

UDC has traditionally been used for the indexing of scientific articles which was an important source of information of scientific output in the period predating electronic publishing. Collections of research articles in many countries covering decades of scientific output contain UDC codes.  Examples of journal articles indexed by UDC:

== UDC structure ==

=== Notation ===
A notation is a code commonly used in classification schemes to represent a class, i.e. a subject and its position in the hierarchy, to enable mechanical sorting and filing of subjects. UDC uses [[Arabic numerals]] arranged decimally. Every number is thought of as a decimal fraction with the initial decimal point omitted, which determines the filing order. An advantage of decimal notational systems is that they are infinitely extensible, and when new subdivisions are introduced, they need not disturb the existing allocation of numbers. For ease of reading, a UDC notation is usually punctuated after every third digit:
{| 
|- 
| style="width:18%; font-weight:bold;" | Notation || style="font-weight:bold;" | Caption (Class description)
|-
| 539.120 ||Theoretical problems of elementary particles physics. Theories and models of fundamental interactions
|-
| 539.120.2 || Symmetries of quantum physics
|-
|539.120.22 ||  Conservation laws
|-
| 539.120.222 ||   Translations. Rotations
|-
| 539.120.224 ||   Reflection in time and space
|-
|539.120.226 ||   Space-time symmetries
|-
| 539.120.23 ||  Internal symmetries
|-
| 539.120.3 || Currents
|-
| 539.120.4 || Unified field theories
|-
|539.120.5 || Strings
|}

In UDC the notation has two features that make the scheme easier to browse and work with: 
* '''hierarchically expressive''' – the longer the notation, the more specific the class: removing the final digit automatically produces a broader class code.
* '''syntactically expressive''' – when UDC codes are combined, the sequence of digits is interrupted by a precise type of punctuation sign which indicates that the expression is a combination of classes rather than a simple class e.g. the colon in 34:32 indicates that there are two distinct notational elements: 34 Law. Jurisprudence and 32 Politics; the closing and opening parentheses and double quotes in the following code 913(574.22)"19"(084.3) indicate four separate notational elements: 913 Regional geography, (574.22) North Kazakhstan (Soltüstik Qazaqstan); "19" 20th century and (084.3) Maps (document form)

=== Basic features and syntax ===
UDC is an analytico-synthetic and [[faceted classification]]. It allows an unlimited combination of attributes of a subject and relationships between subjects to be expressed. UDC codes from different tables can be combined to present various aspects of document content and form, e.g. 94(410)"19"(075) History ''(main subject)'' of United Kingdom ''(place)'' in 20th century ''(time)'', a textbook ''(document form)''. Or: 37:2 Relationship between Education and Religion. Complex UDC expressions can be accurately parsed into constituent elements.

UDC is also a disciplinary classification covering the entire universe of knowledge.&lt;ref name="UDC Subject Coverage"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=subject_coverage UDC Subject Coverage], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt; This type of classification can also be described as ''aspect'' or ''perspective'', which means that concepts are subsumed and placed under the field in which they are studied. Thus, the same concept can appear in different fields of knowledge. This particular feature is usually implemented in UDC by re-using the same concept in various combinations with the main subject, e.g. a code for language in common auxiliaries of language is used to derive numbers for ethnic grouping, individual languages in linguistics and individual literatures. Or, a code from the auxiliaries of place, e.g. ''(410) United Kingdom'', uniquely representing the concept of United Kingdom can be used to express ''911(410) Regional geography of United Kingdom'' and ''94(410) History of United Kingdom''.

=== Organization of classes ===

Concepts are organized in two kinds of tables in UDC:&lt;ref name="UDC Structure"&gt;[http://www.udcc.org/index.php/site/page?view=about_structure UDC Structure and Tables], UDC Consortium website&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Common auxiliary tables''' (including certain auxiliary signs). These tables contain facets of concepts representing, general recurrent characteristics, applicable over a range of subjects throughout the main tables, including notions such as place, language of the text and physical form of the document, which may occur in almost any subject. UDC numbers from these tables, called common auxiliaries are simply added at the end of the number for the subject taken from the main tables. There are over 15,000 of common auxiliaries in UDC.
*'''The main tables or main schedules''' containing the various disciplines and branches of knowledge, arranged in 9 main classes,  numbered from 0 to 9 (with class 4 being vacant). At the beginning of each class there are also series of special auxiliaries, which express aspects that are recurrent within this specific class. Main tables in UDC contain more than 60,000 subdivisions.

==== Main classes ====
*0 [[Science]] and [[Knowledge]]. [[Organization]]. [[Computer Science]]. [[Information Science]]. [[Documentation]]. [[Librarianship]]. [[Institutions]]. [[Publications]]
*1 [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]]. [[Outline of psychology|Psychology]]
*2 [[Outline of religion|Religion]]. [[Outline of theology|Theology]]
*3 [[Outline of social science|Social Sciences]]
*4 ''vacant''
*5 [[Outline of mathematics|Mathematics]]. [[Outline of natural science|Natural Sciences]]
*6 [[Outline of applied science|Applied Sciences]]. [[Outline of medicine|Medicine]], [[Outline of technology|Technology]]
*7 [[The arts|The Arts]]. [[Outline of entertainment|Entertainment]]. [[Outline of sports|Sport]]
*8 [[Outline of linguistics|Linguistics]]. [[Outline of literature|Literature]]
*9 [[Outline of geography|Geography]]. [[Outline of history|History]]

The vacant class 4 is the result of a planned schedule expansion. This class was freed by moving linguistics into class 8 in the 1960s to make space for future developments in the rapidly expanding fields of knowledge; primarily natural sciences and technology.

==== Common auxiliary tables ====
''Common auxiliaries'' are aspect-free concepts that can be used in combination with any other UDC code from the main classes or with other common auxiliaries. They have unique notational representations that makes them stand out in complex expressions. Common auxiliary numbers always begin with a certain symbol known as a facet indicator, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; (equal sign) always introduces concepts representing the language of a document; (0...) numbers enclosed in parentheses starting with zero always represent a concept designating document form. Thus (075) Textbook and =111 English can be combined to express, e.g.(075)=111 Textbooks in English, and when combined with numbers from the main UDC tables they can be used as follows: 2(075)=111 Religion textbooks in English, 51(075)=111 Mathematics textbooks in English etc.

*=...	Common auxiliaries of language. Table 1c
*(0...)	Common auxiliaries of form. Table 1d
*(1/9)	Common auxiliaries of place. Table 1e
*(=...)	Common auxiliaries of human ancestry, ethnic grouping and nationality. Table 1f
*"..."	Common auxiliaries of time. Table 1g helps to make minute division of time e.g.:  "1993-1996''
*-0...	Common auxiliaries of general characteristics: Properties, Materials, Relations/Processes and Persons. Table 1k.
*-02	Common auxiliaries of properties. Table 1k
*-03	Common auxiliaries of materials. Table 1k
*-04	Common auxiliaries of relations, processes and operations. Table 1k
*-05	Common auxiliaries of persons and personal characteristics. Table 1k this table is repeated

==== Connecting signs ====
In order to preserve the precise meaning and enable accurate parsing of complex UDC expressions, a number of connecting symbols are made available to relate and extend UDC numbers. These are:
{| class="wikitable"
!Symbol !! Symbol name !! Meaning !! Example
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Plus and minus signs|plus]] || coordination, addition || e.g. 59+636 [[zoology]] and [[animal breeding]]
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Slash (punctuation)|stroke]] || consecutive extension || e.g. 592/599 Systematic zoology (everything from 592 to 599 inclusive)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] || relation || e.g. 17:7  Relation of [[ethics]] to [[art]]
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;[ ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; || square [[bracket]]s || subgrouping || e.g. 311:[622+669](485) [[statistics]] of [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] in [[Sweden]] (the auxiliary qualifiers 622+669 considered as a unit)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; || asterisk || Introduces non-UDC notation  || e.g. 523.4*433 Planetology, minor planet Eros ([[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] authorized number after the asterisk)
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;A/Z&lt;/nowiki&gt; || alphabetical extension || Direct alphabetical specification  || e.g. 821.133.1MOL French literature, works of Molière

====6 [[Outline of applied science|Applied sciences]]. [[Outline of medicine|Medicine]]. [[Outline of technology|Technology]]====

&lt;small&gt;Class 6 occupies the largest proportion of UDC schedules. It contains over 44,000 subdivisions. Each specific field of technology or industry usually contains more than one special auxiliary table with concepts needed to express operations, processes, materials and products. As a result, UDC codes are often created through the combination of various attributes. Equally, some parts of this class enumerate concepts to a great level of detail e.g.  ''621.882.212 Hexagon screws with additional shapes. Including: Flank screws. Collar screws. Cap screws''

====8 Language. [[Outline of linguistics|Linguistics]]. [[Outline of literature|Literature]]====

&lt;small&gt;Tables for class 8 are fully faceted and details are expressed through combination with common auxiliaries of language (Table 1c) and a series of special auxiliary tables to indicate other facets or attributes in Linguistics or Literature. As a result, this class allows for great specificity in indexing although the schedules themselves occupy very little space in UDC. The subdivisions of e.g. ''811 Languages'' or ''821 Literature'' are derived from common auxiliaries of language =1/=9 (Table 1c) by substituting a point for the equals sign, e.g. 811.111 English language (as a subject of a linguistic study) and ''821.111 English literature'' derives from ''=111 English language''. Common auxiliaries of place and time are also frequently used in this class to express place and time facets of Linguistics or Literature, e.g. ''821.111(71)"18" English literature of Canada in 19th century''
&lt;/small&gt;

===Character lengths===
Beginning with the single-bit code "1", valid varicode values may be formed by prepending a "1" or "10" to a shorter code.  Thus, the number of codes of length ''n'' is equal to the [[Fibonacci number]] ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Varicode uses the 88 values of lengths up to 9 bits, and 40 of the 55 codes of length 10.

As transmitted, the codes are two bits longer due to the trailing delimiter 00.

The founding director was noted journalist and author [[Todd Brewster]], who served in that capacity from 2008-2013. Brewster remains a member of the Center's distinguished advisory board, which includes, among others, [[Ken Burns]], [[Sebastian Junger]], [[Martha Raddatz]], [[Brent Scowcroft]], and [[Jack H. Jacobs|Jack Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Oral History|title=About COH &gt; Leadership|url=http://www.westpointcoh.org/westpointcoh/about/leadership|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center officially launched in October 2011 with its website and its first documentary film, ''[[Into Harm's Way]]''. This film was produced by The Documentary Group, a New York City based film production company founded by [[Tom Yellin]] and [[Kayce Freed Jennings]], with Brewster serving as Executive Producer of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IMBD|title=Into Harm's Way (2011)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1980991/|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Collection ==
The Center contains hundreds of interviews from soldiers, policy makers, politicians, and others whose lives have touch the profession of arms. Its interview subjects currently include veterans of [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Desert Storm]], [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], and the recent conflicts in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2490">'''Whitetopping''' is the covering of an existing [[asphalt]] pavement with a layer of [[Portland cement]] [[concrete]]. Whitetopping is divided into types depending on the thickness of the concrete layer and whether the layer is bonded to the asphalt substrate. Unbonded whitetopping, also called conventional whitetopping, uses concrete thicknesses of eight inches or more that is not bonded to the asphalt. Bonded whitetopping uses thicknesses of two to six inches bonded to the asphalt pavement and is divided into two types, thin and ultrathin. The bond is made by texturing the asphalt. Thin whitetopping uses a bonded layer of concrete that is four to six inches thick while an ultrathin layer is two to four inches thick. Ultrathin whitetopping is suitable for light duty uses, such as roads with low traffic volume, [[parking lot]]s and small [[airport]]s. [[Fiber reinforced concrete]] is used in some thin whitetopping overlays and almost all ultrathin whitetopping overlays.

Whitetopping is suitable for asphalt pavement with little deterioration, although repairs can be made to the asphalt if necessary. If the pavement is badly damaged, it should be completely removed and a new concrete pavement should be installed. The pavement should be relatively hard, as well. Deterioration of overlays is significantly increased on asphalt bases with high [[viscosity]]. If a grade or a distance between the pavement and a [[bridge]] needs to be preserved, the asphalt can be milled so that the height of the pavement does not change. However, whitetopping requires the asphalt layer to be at least three inches thick. If necessary, a section of new concrete roadway can be placed under a bridge with gentle slopes on either side that meet up with the whitetopped portions of the road.
