[[File:Apotropaic pentagram at Niemala.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Apotropaic marking on a farmhouse from Niemelä Tenant Farm, now exhibited at [[Seurasaari|Seurasaari Open Air Museum]] in [[Finland]]]]

'''Apotropaic marks''' are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building [[Apotropaic magic|to keep witches out]]. They are sometimes called witches' marks, a term also used to denote [[witches' mark|identifying marks once thought to be found on the bodies of witches]].

==Marks on buildings==
Apotropaic marks (from Greek ''apotrepein'' "to ward off" from ''apo-'' "away" and ''trepein'' "to turn") are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building with the intention of keeping witches out through [[apotropaic magic]].&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil was thought to be held at bay through a wide variety of apotropaic objects such as [[amulet]]s and [[talisman]]s against the [[evil eye]]. Marks on buildings were one application of this type of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Asuni |first1=John |title=Apotropaic Talisman Against the “Evil Eye” |url=http://archaeologicalmuseum.jhu.edu/the-collection/object-stories/the-roman-house-at-hopkins/the-art-of-light/apotropaic-talisman-against-the-evil-eye/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Archaeological Museum |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks have been found at [[Shakespeare's Birthplace]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], at the [[Tower of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tower of London staff 'used magic to repel the forces of the Devil'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/tower-of-london-staff-used-magic-to-repel-the-forces-of-the-devil-a6697476.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many churches, but little effort has been made to find them on secular buildings.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; The marks are most common near places where witches were thought to be able to enter, whether doors, windows or chimneys.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; For example, during works at [[Knole House]] in 1609, oak beams beneath floors, particularly near fireplaces, were scorched and carved with scratched witch marks to prevent witches and demons from coming down the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title= Ritual Protection Marks and Witchcraft at Knole, Kent |url=https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/ritual-protection-marks-and-witchcraft-at-knole-kent|publisher=[[Gresham College]] |date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/05/witch-marks-king-james-i-knole-sevenoaks-national-trust |title=Witch marks fit for a king beguile archaeologists at Knole |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2014-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Witch marks, both scratched and in the form of chalk circles in front of fireplaces, are still made as a tradition, as found at [[The Fleece Inn]] in Worcestershire, England.{{cn|date=October 2016}}--&gt; At the [[Bradford-on-Avon Tithe Barn]], a [[overlapping circles grid|flower-like pattern of overlapping circles]] is incised into a stone in the wall.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; Similar marks of overlapping circles have been found on a window cill dated about 1616 at [[Owlpen Manor]] in Gloucestershire.

Other types of mark include the intertwined letters V and M or a double V (for the protector, the [[Virgin Mary]], alias ''Virgo Virginum''), and crisscrossing lines to confuse any spirits that might try to follow them.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here Be Witchcraft|url=http://www.lassco.co.uk/lassco-news/2013/10/29/here-be-witchcraft/|publisher=Lassco|accessdate=31 October 2016|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birchills''''' is a historic, ‘Joey’ boat with a small day cabin, built in 1953 by Ken Keay of Walsall, ''Birchills'' is one of the last wooden day boats made and was used to carry coal to [[Wolverhampton Power Station]].

This boat is double-ended and the mast and rudder could be changed from one end to the other. This enabled its use in narrow canals or basins where there was no room to turn the boat around. 

It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in Dudley, where it is based and can be seen dockside in the Lord Ward’s Canal Arm. ''Birchills'' underwent major restoration in early 2015 following £62,000 worth of donations.

The '''Catalan declaration of independence''' ({{lang-ca|Declaració d'independència de Catalunya}}; {{lang-es|Declaración de independencia de Cataluña}}) was a resolution that was passed by the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] on 27 October 2017, which declared the independence of [[Catalonia]] from [[Spain]] and the founding of an independent '''Catalan Republic'''. The declaration did not receive recognition from the international community.

On 10 October, in the aftermath of the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|1 October 2017 Catalan independence referendum]], a document establishing Catalonia as an independent republic was signed by the members of Catalonia's pro-independence parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/spain-braced-possible-catalonian-independence-declaration/|title=Catalan leader puts declaration of independence on hold to allow time for talks|first1=James|last1=Badcock|first2=James|last2=Crisp|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=12 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/catalonia-independence-carles-puigdemont_uk_59dd0ae4e4b0b26332e72356|title=Catalan President Signs Declaration Of Independence, But Will Seek Talks With Madrid|date=10 October 2017|website=huffingtonpost.co.uk|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/10/10/catalan-leader-signs-declaration-document|title=Catalan leader signs declaration document|date=10 October 2017|website=euronews.com|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same document was voted for on 27 October by a majority of 70 out of 135 MPs in a [[plenary session]] (10 voted against, 2 abstained and 53 had left the Parliament before the voting as a sign of protest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|last2=Burgen|first2=Stephen|last3=Graham-Harrison|first3=Emma|title=Spain dissolves Catalan parliament and calls fresh elections|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/spanish-pm-mariano-rajoy-asks-senate-powers-dismiss-catalonia-president|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty-three MPs from the opposition refused to be present during the 27 October voting, after the legal services of the Catalan Parliament advised that the voting could not take place as the law on which it was based had been suspended by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Spanish Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alandete|first1=David|title=Análisis {{!}} Is Catalonia independent?|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/27/inenglish/1509117264_660083.html|work=[[El País]]|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Piñol|first1=Pere Ríos, Àngels|title=El Parlament de Cataluña aprueba la resolución para declarar la independencia|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2017/10/27/catalunya/1509105810_557081.html|work=[[El País]]|date=27 October 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hours later, [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] of [[Spain]] dismissed [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan President]] [[Carles Puigdemont]] and his cabinet, and called for fresh [[Catalan regional election, 2017|Catalan elections on 21 December 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spanish PM dissolves Catalan parliament|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41783289|work=[[BBC News]]|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Prime Minister of Spain [[Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría]] was assigned to be the acting president of Catalonia until the December elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/10/28/59f42746ca474133228b4689.html |title=Declaración de Independencia Cataluña: Rajoy delega en Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría la Presidencia de la Generalitat |publisher=El Mundo |date=2017-10-25 |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===10 October: Signing and suspension===
==== Puigdemont's address ====
[[File:Carles Puigdemont el 10 d'octubre de 2017.jpg|thumb|Puigdemont before the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] on 10 October 2017]]
[[File:Carles Puigdemont el 10 d'octubre de 2017 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Carles Puigdemont|Carles Puigdemont's]] address led to mass confusion on whether Catalonia declared independence on 10 October or not.]]
The [[Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia]] contained the provision that, in case of an outcome in favour of independence, independence was to be declared within 48 hours after all votes were counted. [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan President]] [[Carles Puigdemont]] confirmed this on October 3 during an exclusive interview with the BBC, saying "we are going to declare independence 48 hours after all official results are counted".&lt;ref name="France 24 English"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuWHJh3rV3s|title=Catalonia leader: "We're going to declare independence 48 hours after official results are counted"|date=4 October 2017|website=youtube.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Final results were published by the Catalan government on October 6,&lt;ref name="Ara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/simposa-vots_0_1882611904.html|title= Final tally of the referendum: 90,18% Yes votes on a 43% turnout|date=6 October 2017|website=ara.cat|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Puigdemont announced he would formally address the Parliament on October 10.

Puigdemont was widely expected to declare the independence of Catalonia, which led to worldwide coverage of the parliament session.

After saying that he considered the referendum valid and binding, Puigdemont chose to use the wording "I assume the mandate of the people for Catalonia to become an independent state in the shape of a republic", before adding that he would "ask Parliament to suspend the effects of the declaration of independence so that in the coming weeks we can undertake a dialogue".

After Puigdemont's speech, a document titled "Declaration from the representatives of Catalonia" declaring Catalonia's independence was signed publicly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKHmfQZxgok=Puigdemont|title=Forcadell and Junqueras sign the proposal of declaration of independence (in Catalan)|website=youtube.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the members of parliament of the pro-independence political parties in the auditorium of the Parliament. The document, titled "Declaration from the representatives of Catalonia", sought to establish Catalonia as an independent state, and called on the international community to recognize it. It was read publicly, but it was not voted or published on the Catalan government's official journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/JxSi-CUP-proposta-declaracio-dindependencia_0_1885011710.html|title=JxSí and the CUP sign the proposal of declaration of independence (in Catalan)|website=ara.cat|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spanish government's reaction ====
The immediate reaction from the Spanish government was that "it was inadmissible to declare independence implicitly and suspend it explicitly". [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Minister of Justice]] [[Rafael Catalá]] called it a "non-declaration of independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.com/noticias/espana/catala-resta-validez-a-una-no-declaracion-de-independencia_2017101059dd1c9e0cf27ece4d38f5ea.html|title=Minister of Justice gives no validity to Puigdemont's "non-declaration of independence"|website=antena3.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Spain|Spanish Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] gave a short news conference on the following day, giving Puigdemont five days to confirm whether he had declared Catalonia’s independence or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-mariano-rajoy.html|title=Spain asks Catalonia: did you declare independence or not?|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were the answer to be affirmative, the document provided another deadline ending on Thursday, October 19, allowing for Catalan authorities to rectify and prevent the application of Section 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would authorise Madrid to temporarily take over Catalonia’s internal affairs.

According to Spain's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Alfonso Dastis]], the written declaration was legally void, as it was not voted and it was signed outside of a parliamentary session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dastis afirma que Puigdemont no declaró la independencia de Cataluña porque "no se hizo en un pleno"|url=http://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/dastis-afirma-que-puigdemont-no-declaro-la-independencia-de-cataluna-porque-no-se-hizo-en-un-pleno_2017101259df5a7b0cf27ece4d3d582f.html|work=[[laSexta]]|agency=[[EFE]]|date=12 October 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
On 2 November, the judge [[Carmen Lamela]] of the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Spanish National Court]] ordered that eight members of the deposed Catalan government including the ex-vice-president [[Oriol Junqueras]] be remanded in custody without bail. Additionally, [[Santi Vila]], who was the Business Minister that resigned over the unilateral declaration of independence, was granted a €50,000 bail. The prosecution requested issuing [[European Arrest Warrant]]s for Puigdemont and four other members who left Catalonia for [[Brussels]] shortly after the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catalan ex-ministers held by Spain court|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41850094|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|title=Spanish judge jails eight members of former Catalan government|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/02/spanish-court-question-catalonia-separatists-except-puigdemont|work=The Guardian|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and description==

The ''Childcraft'' series was originally created in the 1930s by W. F. Quarrie &amp; Company, then publishers of the ''[[World Book]]'' encyclopedia. The series' title was ''Childcraft – The How and Why Library.''

''Childcraft'' was created as a sort of encyclopedia for young children. With simple texts and illustrations, the volumes were designed to make learning fun. Each volume addressed different subjects, including literature — such as short stories and poetry, including fairy tales and nursery rhymes — as well as mathematics and the sciences.

Starting out as seven volumes in the late 1930s, the series was re-issued in a new edition every few years, sometimes incorporating new volumes and re-arranging existing ones. It grew to 15 volumes in the 1950s, and remained there, though further changes were made in later editions.

The ''Childcraft'' set also added a separate, optional, special annual volume each year, starting in 1965. Some of these were later incorporated as regular volumes.

In addition, by the 1980s the series had broadened its reach to a dozen foreign language editions, with editions shipped to over 50 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;World Book, Inc. Answers.com.

The '''''Chronicon Compostellanum''''' ({{lang-gl|Cronicón compostelán}}, {{lang-es|Cronicón compostelano}}) is a narrative [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] [[chronicle]] of the [[history of Spain]] from the arrival of the [[Visigoths]] (which it dates to 362) until the death of [[Urraca of León and Castile|Queen Urraca of León]] on 8 March 1126.{{efn|Although it dates it to ''sexto Idus Martii in Era MCLXIIII'', that is, 10 March 1126.}} It was probably written shortly after this date, and probably in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. It covers the history of the Visigothic kingdom and their successors, the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], rapidly, incorporating the ''Laterculum regum ovetensium'' ("List of the kings of Oviedo"), a regnal list of the Asturian monarchy from [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] to [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] written sometime after 791 and also incorporated in the ''[[Chronicon Iriense]]'' and the ''[[Annales Portugalenses veteres]]''. For the eleventh-century [[Kingdom of León]] it is the earliest surviving source after the ''[[Historia silense]]'' (1109–18). The cause of Urraca's death—in labour with the child of her lover, [[Pedro González de Lara]]—is recorded in the ''Chronicon''. Its first editor and publisher, [[Enrique Flórez]], in his twenty-eighth preliminary note to the appendix of Latin documents in the twenty-third volume of his ''España Sagrada'', described the text thus:
{|
|
:''Este documento fue escrito en unas copias de la Historia Compostelana, que tuve al tiempo de publicar aquella Historia, y por esto le doy nombre de Chronicon, tomado de uno de aquellos Codices, porque tampoco está en todos, pues no es obra de sus Autores, sino de algun posterior, y nada afecto a la Reyna D. Urraca, madre de D. Alfonso VII. Su copia salió muy errada en los numeros del principio: pero tiene muchas individualidades acerca de los hijos de D. Fernando I. por lo que, y habiendole ya citado en otras partes, le damos con los otros.''
|
:This document was written in some copies of the ''[[Historia Compostelana]]'', that I had at the time of publishing that ''Historia'', and for this reason I gave it the name of ''Chronicon'', taken from one of those codices, because neither is it in all of them, nor is it the work of its authors, rather of one writing later and with no affection for the queen Doña Urraca, mother of [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Don Alfonso VII]]. Its copying has left it quite erroneous in the numbers towards the beginning: but it has many unique facts about the sons of Don Ferdinand I for which, having already cited them in other places, they are given with the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19360">'''DNS hijacking''' or '''DNS redirection''' is the practice of subverting the resolution of [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) queries.  This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.

These modifications may be made for malicious purposes such as [[phishing]], or for self-serving purposes by [[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) and public/router-based online [[Name server|DNS server providers]] to direct users' web traffic to the ISP's own [[web server]]s where advertisements can be served, statistics collected, or other purposes of the ISP; and by DNS service providers to block access to selected domains as a form of [[Internet censorship#Technical censorship|censorship]]. 

==Technical background==
One of the functions of a DNS server is to translate a [[domain name]] into an [[IP address]] that [[Application software|applications]] need to connect to an Internet resource such as a [[website]]. This functionality is defined in various formal [[Internet Standard|internet standards]] that define the [[Communications protocol|protocol]] in considerable detail. DNS servers are implicitly trusted by internet-facing computers and users to correctly resolve names to the actual addresses that are registered by the owners of an internet domain.

===Rogue DNS server===
A rogue DNS server translates domain names of desirable websites (search engines, banks, brokers, etc.) into IP addresses of sites with unintended content, even malicious websites. Most users depend on DNS servers automatically assigned by their [[ISP]]s. [[Zombie computer]]s use DNS-changing [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] to invisibly switch the automatic DNS server assignment by the ISP to manual DNS server assignment from rogue DNS servers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} A router's assigned DNS servers can also be altered through the remote exploitation of a vulnerability within the router's firmware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNS hijacking flaw affects D-Link DSL router, possibly other devices|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2876292/dns-hijacking-flaw-affects-d-link-dsl-router-possibly-other-devices.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When users try to visit websites, they are instead sent to a bogus website. This attack is termed [[pharming]]. If the site they are redirected to is a malicious website, masquerading as a legitimate website, in order to fraudulently obtain sensitive information, it is termed [[phishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/rogue-domain-name-system-servers-5breposted5d/

Dutch ISP's XS4ALL and Ziggo use DNS hijacking by court order: they were ordered to block access to [[The Pirate Bay]] and display a warning page instead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.xs4all.nl/xs4all-moet-adressen-pirate-bay-voorlopig-blokkeren/|title=XS4ALL blokkeert adressen Pirate Bay voorlopig {{!}} XS4ALL Weblog|last=Digined|website=blog.xs4all.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These practices violate the [[Request for Comments|RFC]] standard for DNS (NXDOMAIN) responses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2308|title=Negative Caching of DNS Queries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can potentially open users to [[cross-site scripting]] attacks.&lt;ref name="wired-isps-error-page" /&gt;

The concern with DNS hijacking involves this hijacking of the NXDOMAIN response. Internet and [[intranet]] applications rely on the NXDOMAIN response to describe the condition where the DNS has no entry for the specified host. If one were to query the invalid domain name (for example www.example.invalid), one should get an NXDOMAIN response - informing the application that the name is invalid and taking the appropriate action (for example, displaying an error or not attempting to connect to the server). However, if the domain name is queried on one of these non-compliant ISPs, one would always receive a fake IP address belonging to the ISP. In a [[web browser]], this behavior can be annoying or offensive as connections to this IP address display the [[ISP redirect page]] of the provider, sometimes with advertising, instead of a proper error message. However, other applications that rely on the NXDOMAIN error will instead attempt to initiate connections to this spoofed IP address, potentially exposing sensitive information.

Examples of functionality that breaks when an ISP hijacks DNS:
*Roaming laptops that are members of a [[Windows Server domain]] will falsely be led to believe that they are back on a corporate network because resources such as [[domain controller]]s, [[Message transfer agent|email servers]] and other infrastructure will appear to be available. Applications will therefore attempt to initiate connections to these corporate servers, but fail, resulting in degraded performance, unnecessary [[Internet traffic|traffic on the internet connection]] and [[Timeout (computing)|timeouts]].
*Many small office and home networks do not have their own DNS server, relying instead on [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] name resolution. Many versions of Microsoft Windows default to prioritizing DNS name resolution above NetBIOS name resolution broadcasts; therefore, when an ISP DNS server returns a (technically valid) IP address for the name of the desired computer on the LAN, the connecting computer uses this incorrect IP address and inevitably fails to connect to the desired computer on the LAN. Workarounds include using the correct IP address instead of the computer name, or changing the DhcpNodeType registry value to change name resolution service ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtonetworking.com/netbios&amp;wins.htm#How+to+modify+Node+Type|title=NetBIOS and WINS|website=www.howtonetworking.com|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Browsers such as [[Firefox]] no longer have their 'Browse By Name' functionality (Where keywords typed in the address bar take users to the closest matching site.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earobinson.org/2009/08/01/using-firefox-noredirect-extension-to-avoid-dns-hijacking/ |title=Using Firefox + NoRedirect Extension to Avoid DNS Hijacking |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303235841/http://www.earobinson.org/2009/08/01/using-firefox-noredirect-extension-to-avoid-dns-hijacking/ |archivedate=3 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The local DNS client built into modern operating systems will cache results of DNS searches for performance reasons. If a client switches between a home network and a [[Virtual private network|VPN]], false entries may remain cached, thereby creating a service outage on the VPN connection.
*[[DNSBL]] anti-spam solutions rely on DNS; false DNS results therefore interfere with their operation.
*Confidential user data might be [[Internet leak|leaked]] by applications that are tricked by the ISP into believing that the servers they wish to connect to are available.
*User choice over which search engine to consult in the event of a URL being mistyped in a browser is removed as the ISP determines what search results are displayed to the user; functionality of applications like the [[Google Toolbar]] do not work correctly.
*Computers configured to use a [[Split tunneling|split tunnel]] with a VPN connection will stop working because intranet names that should not be resolved outside the tunnel over the public Internet will start resolving to fictitious addresses, instead of resolving correctly over the VPN tunnel on a private DNS server when an NXDOMAIN response is received from the Internet. For example, a mail client attempting to resolve the DNS A record for an internal mail server may receive a false DNS response that directed it to a paid-results web server, with messages queued for delivery for days while retransmission was attempted in vain.&lt;ref name="ICANN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/nxdomain-substitution-harms-24nov09-en.pdf|title=Harms Caused by NXDOMAIN Substitution in Toplevel and Other Registry-class Domain Names|date=2009-11-24|accessdate=2010-09-23|publisher=[[ICANN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It breaks [[Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol]] (WPAD) by leading web browsers to believe incorrectly that the ISP has a [[proxy server]] configured.
*It breaks monitoring software. For example, if we periodically contact a server to determine its health, a monitor will never see a failure unless the monitor tries to verify the server's cryptographic key.

In some cases, the ISPs provide subscriber-configurable settings to disable hijacking of NXDOMAIN responses.  Correctly implemented, such a setting reverts DNS to standard behavior. Other ISPs, however, instead use a web browser [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] to store the preference. In this case, the underlying behavior is not resolved: DNS queries continue to be redirected, while the ISP redirect page is replaced with a counterfeit dns error page. Applications other than web-browsers cannot be opted out of the scheme using cookies as the opt-out targets only the [[HTTP]] protocol, when the scheme is actually implemented in the protocol-neutral DNS system.

==Response==
In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office have acknowledged that the practice of involuntary DNS hijacking contravenes [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|PECR]], and EC Directive 95/46 on Data Protection which require explicit consent for processing of communication traffic. However they have refused to intervene, claiming that it would not be sensible to enforce the law, because it would not cause significant (or indeed any) demonstrable detriment to individuals.&lt;ref name="dpiforumthread"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://nodpi.org/forum/index.php/topic,2390.msg25643/topicseen.html
|title=ICO: We won't stop Advanced Network Error Search
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dpipdf"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nodpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/virgin_anes.pdf|title=Case Reference Number ENQ0265706|quote="I am not convinced that there is any likelihood of detriment or harm to subscribers or users that would justify taking formal action in this case."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ICANN]], the international body responsible for administering top-level domain names, has published a memorandum highlighting its concerns, and affirming:&lt;ref name="ICANN"/&gt; {{quote|ICANN strongly discourages the use of DNS redirection, wildcards, synthesized responses and any other form of NXDOMAIN substitution in existing gTLDs, ccTLDs and any other level in the DNS tree for registry-class domain names.}}

==Remedy==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
End users, dissatisfied with poor "opt-out" options like cookies, have responded to the controversy by finding ways to avoid spoofed NXDOMAIN responses.  DNS software such as [[BIND]] and [[Dnsmasq]] offer options to filter results, and can be run from a gateway or router to protect an entire network.  Google, among others, run open DNS servers that currently do not return spoofed results.  So a user could use [[Google Public DNS]] instead of their ISP's DNS servers if they are willing to accept that they use the service under [[Criticism of Google#Privacy|Google's privacy policy]] and potentially be exposed to another method by which Google can track the user.  One limitation of this approach is that some providers block or rewrite outside DNS requests. [[OpenDNS]], owned by Cisco, is a similar popular service which does not alter NXDOMAIN responses.

Google in April 2016 launched  [https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https DNS-over-HTTPS] service. This scheme can overcome the limitations of the legacy DNS protocol. It performs remote DNSSEC check and transfers the results in a secure HTTPS tunnel.

There are also application level work-arounds, such as the NoRedirect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/noredirect/|title=NoRedirect – Add-ons for Firefox|website=addons.mozilla.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[add-on (Mozilla)|Firefox extension]] that mitigate some of the behavior.  An approach like that only fixes one application (in this example, Firefox) and will not address any other issues caused.  Website owners may be able to fool some hijackers by using certain DNS settings.  For example, setting a TXT record of "unused" on their wildcard address (e.g. *.example.com).  Alternatively, they can try setting the CNAME of the wildcard to "example.invalid", making use of the fact that '.invalid' is guaranteed not to exist per the RFC.  The limitation of that approach is that it only prevents hijacking on those particular domains, but it may address some VPN security issues caused by DNS hijacking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">'''David Daniels Keck''' (October 24, 1903 &amp;ndash; March 10, 1995) was an American botanist who was notable for his work on [[angiosperm]] taxonomy and genetics.

Keck was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. He completed undergraduate studies at [[Pomona College]] in 1925 and was awarded a Ph.D. in botany from the [[University of California]] in 1930.

From 1925 to 1950 he was based at the Carnegie Institute of Washington, at [[Stanford University]], where he worked on plant species concepts with [[Jens Clausen]] and [[William Hiesey]]. In 1949, the three of them were co-recipients of the [[Mary Soper Pope Memorial Award]] in botany.&lt;ref name=cranbrook&gt;[http://www.cranbrook.edu/sites/default/files/ftpimages/120/misc/misc_35342.pdf "Cranbrook Institute of Science Director's Papers"]. Cranbrook website. Retrieved Dec. 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 he was appointed head curator of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and remained there until 1958.

In 1959, he co-published ''A California Flora'' with [[Philip A. Munz]].

He was Program Director for Systematic Biology at the [[National Science Foundation]] until 1970, after which he moved to New Zealand. He returned to the United States in 1978 and lived in [[Medford, Oregon]].

[[File:EAD card 2017.jpg|right|thumb|Example EAD card (2017 version)]]
[[File:EAD-Not-Valid-Both-Sides.jpg|right|thumb|Example EAD card (2011 version)]]
A '''Form I-766 employment authorization document''' ('''EAD'''; [https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/list-documents/form-i-9-acceptable-documents]) or '''EAD card''', known popularly as a '''[[work permit]]''', is a document issued by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) that provides temporary employment authorization to noncitizens in the United States.

Currently the Form I-765 Employment Authorization Document is issued in the form of a standard credit card-size plastic card enhanced with multiple security features. The card contains some basic information about the immigrant: name, birth date, sex, immigrant category, country of birth, photo, immigrant registration number (also called "A-number"), card number, restrictive terms and conditions, and dates of validity. This document, however, should not be confused with the [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]].

== Obtaining an EAD ==
To request an Employment Authorization Document, noncitizens who qualify may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Applicants must then send the form via mail to the USCIS Regional Service Center that serves their area. If approved, an Employment Authorization Document will be issued for a specific period of time based on alien's immigration situation.

Thereafter, USCIS will issue Employment Authorization Documents in the following categories: 
* '''Renewal Employment Authorization Document''': the renewal process takes the same amount of time as a first-time application so the noncitizen may have to plan ahead and request the renewal 3 to 4 months before expiration date.
* '''Replacement Employment Authorization Document''': Replaces a lost, stolen, or mutilated EAD. A replacement Employment Authorization Document also replaces an Employment Authorization Document that was issued with incorrect information, such as a misspelled name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-765instr.pdf|title=Instructions for I-765, Application for Employment Authorization|date=2015-11-04|website=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For employment-based green card applicants, the priority date needs to be current to apply for Adjustment of Status (I-485) at which time an Employment Authorization Document can be applied for. Typically, it is recommended to apply for [[Advance parole|Advance Parole]] at the same time so that visa stamping is not required when re-entering US from a foreign country.

== Interim EAD ==

An '''interim Employment Authorization Document''' is an Employment Authorization Document issued to an eligible applicant when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has failed to adjudicate an application within 90 days of receipt of a properly filed Employment Authorization Document application or within 30 days of a properly filed initial Employment Authorization Document application based on an asylum application filed on or after January 4, 1995.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The interim Employment Authorization Document will be granted for a period not to exceed 240 days and is subject to the conditions noted on the document.

An interim Employment Authorization Document is no longer issued by local service centers. One can however take an INFOPASS appointment and place a service request at local centers, explicitly asking for it if the application exceeds 90 days and 30 days for asylum applicants without an adjudication.

== Restrictions ==
The eligibility criteria for employment authorization is detailed in the Federal Regulations section 8 C.F.R. §274a.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/8cfr274a.12.htm

| accessdate = November 17, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only aliens who fall under the enumerated categories are eligible for an employment authorization document. Currently, there are more than 40 types of immigration status that make their holders eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document card.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are nationality-based and apply to a very small number of people. Others are much broader, such as those covering the spouses of [[E-1 visa|E-1]], [[E-2 visa|E-2]], [[E-3 visa|E-3]], or [[L-1 visa|L-1]] visa holders.

=== Qualifying EAD categories ===
The category includes the persons who either are given an Employment Authorization Document incident to their status or must apply for an Employment Authorization Document in order to accept the employment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* Asylee/Refugee, their spouses, and their children
* Citizens or nationals of countries falling in certain categories
* Foreign students with active
** [[F visa|F-1 status]] who wish to pursue
*** Pre- or Post-[[Optional Practical Training]], either paid or unpaid, which must be directly related to the students' major of study
*** Optional Practical Training for designated [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] degree holders, where the beneficiary must be employed for paid positions directly related to the beneficiary's major of study, and the employer must be using [[E-Verify]]
*** The internship, either paid or unpaid, with authorized [[International Organization]]
*** The off-campus employment during the students' academic progress due to significant economic hardship, regardless of the students' major of study
** [[M-1 visa|M-1 status]] who wish to pursue practical training which is directly related to the students' vocational training from the school
*J-1 Summer Work/Travel visa holders
* Spouses of [[J visa|exchange visitors]] with certain regulation
* Eligible dependents of employees of diplomatic missions, International Organization, or [[NATO]]
* Certain employment-based nonimmigrants; limits may apply
* Certain family-based nonimmigrants
* Persons within the adjustment-of-status categories
* Other eligible categories

=== Persons who do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document ===
The following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, nor can they accept any employment in the United States, unless the incident of status may allow.

* [[Visa waiver program|Visa waived persons]] for pleasure
* [[B visa|B-2 visitors for pleasure]]
* [[C-1 visa|Transiting passengers via U.S. port-of-entry]]

The following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, even if they are authorized to work in certain conditions, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service regulations (8 CFR Part 274a).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Background: immigration control and employment regulations ==
Undocumented immigrants have been considered a source of low-wage labor, both in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. However, in the late 1980s with an increasing influx of un-regulated immigration, many worried about how this would impact the economy and, at the same time, citizens. Consequently, in 1986, Congress enacted the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] "in order to control and deter illegal immigration to the United States" resulting increasing patrolling of U.S. borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web

=== I-9 qualifying citizenship or immigration statuses ===

* A citizen of the United States
* A noncitizen national of the United States 
* A lawful permanent resident 
* An alien authorized to work
** As an "Alien Authorized to Work," the employee must provide an "A-Number"  present in the EAD card, along with the expiration day of the temporary employment authorization. Thus, as established by form I-9, the EAD card is a document which serves as both an identification and verification of employment eligibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Conccurrently, the [[Immigration Act of 1990]] “increased the limits on lawful immigration to the United States," [...] "established new nonimmigrant admission categories," and revised acceptable grounds for deportation. Most importantly, it brought to light the "authorized temporary protected status" for aliens of designated countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Through the revision and creation of new classes of nonimmigrants, qualified for admission and temporary working status, both IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 provided legislation for the regulation of employment of noncitizen.

The 9/11 attacks brought to the surface the weak aspect of the immigration system. After the [[September 11 attacks]], the United States intensified its focus on interior reinforcement of immigration laws to reduce illegal immigration and to identify and remove criminal aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Temporary worker: Alien Authorized to Work ==
Undocumented Immigrants are individuals in the United States without lawful status. When these individuals qualify for some form of relief from deportation, individuals may qualify for some form of legal status. In this case, temporarily protected noncitizens are those who are granted "the right to remain in the country and work during a designated period". Thus, this is kind of an "in-between status" that provides individuals temporary employment and temporary relief from deportation, but it does not lead to permanent residency or citizenship status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, an Employment Authorization Document should not be confused with a legalization document and it is neither U.S. permanent resident status nor U.S. citizenship status. The Employment Authorization Document is given, as mentioned before, to eligible noncitizens as part of a reform or law that gives individuals temporary legal status

=== Examples of "Temporarily Protected" noncitizens (eligible for an Employment Authorization Document) ===

* [[Temporary protected status|Temporary Protected Status]]
** Under Temporary Protected Status, individuals are given relief from deportation as temporary refugees in the United States. Under Temporary Protected Status, individuals are given protected status if found that "conditions in that country pose a danger to personal safety due to ongoing armed conflict or an environmental disaster". This status is granted typically for 6 to 18 month periods, eligible for renewal unless the individual's Temporary Protected Status is terminated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status occurs, the individual faces exclusion or deportation proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Greenland halibut''' or '''Greenland turbot''' (''Reinhardtius hippoglossoides'') belongs to the [[Pleuronectidae]] family (the right eye flounders), and is the [[monotypic|only species]] of the genus '''''Reinhardtius'''''. It is a deep water fish, ranging between about {{convert|200|and|1600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, and is found in the northern Atlantic and northern Pacific Oceans. It has a variety of other English vernacular names including black halibut, blue halibut, lesser halibut and Newfoundland turbot.&lt;ref name = FAO/&gt;

The Greenland halibut is a flatfish, and the left eye has migrated during the fish's development so that it is on the right side of the head. However, in this fish, it has not moved as far as in bottom-dwelling flatfish and the fish can probably see forwards. The Greenland halibut can swim in a vertical position and both sides of its body are a speckled brown colour, but the left side is rather paler than the right. This fish is used for human consumption and is caught mostly by [[trawling]]. [[Greenpeace]] considers the [[fishery]] unsustainable and has added the Greenland halibut to its seafood red list. This designation is widely considered to be based upon limited and unverifiable data.

==Description==
Its morphology with the left eye positioned on the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] ridge of the forehead gives it an appearance of a [[cyclops]]  when looking straight at it. The central position of the left eye in the Greenland halibut probably gives it a much wider range of [[peripheral vision]] in comparison to other flatfish where the eye has migrated completely. The body shape is elongated and compressed dorsal-ventrally and muscles on both sides are equally developed. Both sides are pigmented; however the left blind side is slightly lighter in color than the right side. The maximum length is about 120&amp;nbsp;cm and the maximum weight is about 45&amp;nbsp;kg, the normal length is 80–100&amp;nbsp;cm and they usually weigh 11–25&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name = FAO/&gt;

Its physical appearance suggests it to be a vigorous swimmer that can swim in a vertical position. Vertical swimming has been observed during tagging experiments. However, video analyzing of Greenland halibut behavior in front of a bottom trawl showed no sign of swimming in a vertical position. Even though most Greenland halibut are caught in bottom fishing gears (trawl, longline and [[gillnet]]) they have also been caught in surface drift nets which indicates that they can have a [[pelagic]] occurrence. Stomach analysis has also shown that the diet consists mostly of pelagic or [[bathypelagic]] organisms. Even though the Greenland halibut is a flatfish it does at times behave more like a roundfish.&lt;ref name = Partner&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.partner-seafood.com/greenland-halibut.html | title = Greenland Halibut | accessdate = 26 March 2018 | publisher = Partner Seafood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
It is a deepwater fish distributed mostly from 200 to 1600 m, but has been caught in deeper depths of {{convert|2200|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. It is mainly found in waters with temperatures from 1-4&amp;nbsp;°C, but has also observed at sub-zero temperatures down to -2.1&amp;nbsp;°C. It has a circumpolar distribution in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and is found in both the [[North Atlantic]] and the [[North Pacific]] oceans. In the North Pacific it ranges from the [[Sea of Japan]] near [[Honshu]] northwards to the [[Chukchi Sea]], east through the [[Aleutian Islands]], and south as far as northern [[Baja California]] in Mexico.&lt;ref name = FB/&gt; In the North Atlantic it occurs from England to northern Norway, Iceland and eastern Greenland in the east and from [[Newfoundland]] to north-western Greenland in the west.&lt;ref name = FAO&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2544/en | title = ''Reinhardtius hippoglossoides'' (Walbaum, 1792) | accessdate = 26 March 2018 | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Fisheries and Aquaculture Department | work = FAO Specie Factsheets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and biology==
The Greenland halibut is an arctic species which is found at depths of 200–2000 m, mainly between 500m and 1000m. However, it is often caught pelagically and it is thought that it swims on its ventral edge rather than on the blind side. It is an active, mid-water predator which feeds on prawns, fish such as [[Atlantic cod]], [[Arctogadus glacialis|Artic cod]], [[eelpout]]s, [[capelin]] and [[redfish]]), and [[squid]]. It spawns at depths of 700–1500 m during spring and summer, from April to July at temperatures of 3-5&amp;nbsp;°C. Its eggs, larvae, and postlarvae are free-floating in deep water. The larvae complete their [[metamorphosis]] on attaining a length of 6-8.5&amp;nbsp;cm; the young fish tend to occur in the shallower areas than the adults.&lt;ref name = FAO/&gt;

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the Greenland halibut to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable [[fisheries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2017 the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] certified that the fishery for Greenland halibut was sustainable.&lt;ref name = MSC&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.msc.org/newsroom/news/artic-greenland-halibut-certified-as-sustainable | title = Arctic Greenland halibut certified as sustainable| date = 31 October 2017 | accessdate = 26 March 2018 | publisher = Marine Stewardship Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species is mainly caught using long lines. The meat is regarded as inferior to that of the [[Atlantic halibut]] and it is marketed fresh or frozen and is normally consumed either steamed or fried. In 1999 the total landings reported to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] was 115,326 tonnes. The largest catches were reported from Greenland (34,481 t) and Norway (18,810 t).&lt;ref name = FAO/&gt; In 2001 1.078 tonnes were landed in [[Scotland]] with a value estimated at £1,885,000 but the [[Scottish Government]] reports that 33% of the catch is lost as the species has thick skin, high fat content and a low meat yield.&lt;ref name = Alba&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/marine-environment/species/fish/deepwater/halibut | title = Greenland Halibut | accessdate = 26 March 2018 | publisher = Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Old Witch.jpg|thumb|184x184px|A painting of a hag]]
A '''hag''' is a [[wikt:wizened|wizened]] old woman, or a kind of [[fairy]] or goddess having the appearance of such a woman, often found in [[folklore]] and children's tales such as [[Hansel and Gretel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Briggs, Katharine]] (1976) ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Hags", p.216. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Hags are often seen as malevolent, but may also be one of the chosen forms of shapeshifting deities, such as the [[Morrígan]] or [[Badb]], who are seen as neither wholly beneficent nor malevolent.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"&gt;Lysaght, Patricia (1986) ''The Banshee: The Irish Death Messenger''. Roberts Rinehart Publishers. {{ISBN|1-57098-138-8}}. p.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Rosalind (1991) ''The Great Queens: Irish Goddesses from the Morrígan to Cathleen Ní Houlihan'' (Irish Literary Studies, Book 34) Savage, Maryland, Barnes and Noble (reprint) pp.5, 8, 17, 25&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
The term appears in Middle English, and was a shortening of ''hægtesse'', an [[Old English language|Old English]] term for ''[[Witchcraft|witch]]'', similarly the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''heks'' and [[German language|German]] ''Hexe'' are also shortenings, of the [[Middle Dutch]] ''haghetisse'' and [[Old High German]] ''hagzusa'' respectively.&lt;ref name="etym" /&gt; All of these words are derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*hagatusjon-''&lt;ref name="etym" /&gt; which is of unknown origin, however the first element may be related to the word "hedge".&lt;ref name="etym"&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hag&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/84/H0008400.html hag&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428151019/http://bartleby.com/61/84/H0008400.html |date=28 April 2005 }} ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[stock character]] in fairy or folk tale, the hag shares characteristics with the [[crone]], and the two words are sometimes used as if interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a Google Book search of the exact phrase [https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=hag+or+crone&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;lr=&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_sub=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_isbn=&amp;as_issn= "hag or crone"] and [https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=crone+or+hag&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;lr=&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_sub=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_isbn=&amp;as_issn= "crone or hag"]. Retrieved 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the word "hag" to translate terms found in non-English (or non-modern English) is contentious, since use of the word is often associated with [[misogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==In folklore==
A hag, or "the Old Hag", was a [[nightmare]] spirit in English and anglophone North American folklore. This variety of hag is essentially identical to the [[Old English]] ''mæra''&amp;mdash;a being with roots in ancient Germanic superstition, and closely related to the Scandinavian ''[[mara (folklore)|mara]]''. According to folklore, the Old Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent [[nightmare]]s to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. In the Swedish film [[Marianne (2011 film)|''Marianne'']], the main character suffers from these nightmares. This state is now called [[sleep paralysis]], but in the old belief the subject had been "hagridden".&lt;ref&gt;Ernsting, Michele (2004) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20041126201638/http://www2.rnw.nl/rnw/en/features/cultureandhistory/041119vh Hags and nightmares: sleep paralysis and the midnight terrors]" Radio Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; It is still frequently discussed as if it were a [[paranormal]] state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa112000a.htm The "Old Hag" Syndrome] from About: Paranormal Phenomena&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories about hags seem to have been used to frighten children into being good. The [[Northern England|Northern English]] [[Peg Powler]], for example, was a river hag who lived in the [[River Tees]] and had skin the colour of green pond scum.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful'' by Elliott O'Donnell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Folklore'' by [[Marian Roalfe Cox]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Darlington, in the Bishoprick'' by William Hylton Dyer Longstaffe, 1854&lt;/ref&gt;  Parents who wanted to keep their children away from the river's edge told them that if they got too close to the water she would pull them in with her long arms, drown them, and sometimes eat them.  This type of [[Neck (water spirit)|nixie or neck]] has other regional names, such as Grindylow&lt;ref name=19th&gt;''The Nineteenth century and after, Volume 68'', Leonard Scott Pub. Co., 1910. Page. 556&lt;/ref&gt; (a name connected to [[Grendel]]),&lt;ref name=19th/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Grammar of the Dialect of Oldham'' by Karl Georg Schilling, 1906. Page. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jenny Greenteeth]] from [[Yorkshire]], and [[Nelly Longarms]] from several English counties.&lt;ref&gt;Froud, Brian and Lee, Alan (1978) ''Faeries''. New York, Peacock Press {{ISBN|0-553-01159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tales about hags do not describe them well enough to distinguish between an old woman who knows magic or a supernatural being.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 66-7 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slavic folklore]], [[Baba Yaga]] was a hag who lived in the woods in a house on chickens legs. She would often ride through the forest on a mortar, sweeping away her tracks with a broom.&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Folk-Tales'' W. R. S. Ralston, Forgotten Books, {{ISBN|1-4400-7972-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4400-7972-6}}. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Though she is usually a single being, in some folktales three Baba Yagas are depicted as helping the hero in his quest, either by giving advice or by giving gifts.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. S. Ralston ''Songs of the Russian People'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/srp/srp07.htm Section III.--Storyland Beings].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Irish mythology|Irish]] and [[Scottish mythology]], the [[cailleach]] is a hag goddess concerned with creation, harvest, the weather and sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;{{cite book | first =F. Marian | last =McNeill | authorlink = | year =1959 | month = | title =The Silver Bough, Vol.2: A Calendar of Scottish National Festivals, Candlemas to Harvest Home  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =20–1 | publisher =William MacLellan | location =Glasgow| isbn =978-0-85335-162-7 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In partnership with the goddess [[Brigid|Bríd]], she is a seasonal goddess, seen as ruling the winter months while Bríd rules the summer.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;  In Scotland, a group of hags, known as ''The Cailleachan'' (The Storm Hags) are seen as personifications of the elemental powers of nature, especially in a destructive aspect.  They are said to be particularly active in raising the windstorms of spring, during the period known as ''A Chailleach''.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2"&gt;{{cite book | first =F. Marian | last =McNeill | authorlink = | year =1959 | month = | title =The Silver Bough, Vol.1: Scottish Folklore and Folk-Belief  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =119 | publisher =William MacLellan | location =Glasgow| isbn =978-0-85335-161-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hags as sovereignty figures abound in Irish mythology. The most common pattern is that the hag represents the barren land, who the hero of the tale must approach without fear, and come to love on her own terms. When the hero displays this courage, love, and acceptance of her hideous side, the sovereignty hag then reveals that she is also a young and beautiful goddess.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

The [[Moirai|Three Fates]] (particularly Atropos) are often depicted as hags.

In [[Persian people|Persian]] folklore, the Bakhtak &lt;!--(in IPA2 script: Baxtak) let's put this in actual IPA --&gt; has the same role as that of "the Old Hag" in English folklore. The Bakhtak sits on a sleeper's chest, awakening them and causing them to feel they are unable to breathe or even to move. Bakhtak also is used metaphorically to refer to "[[nightmare]]" in the [[modern Persian]] language.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

She is similar to [[Lilith]].

==In Western literature==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In mediaeval and later [[literature]], the term "hag", and its relatives in European languages, came to stand for an unattractive, older woman. Building on the mediaeval tradition of such women as portrayed in comic and [[burlesque]] literature,  specifically in the Italian [[Renaissance]] the hag represented the opposite of the lovely lady familiar from the poetry of [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The hag as a fantastic creature has also been used in some [[fantasy]] novels such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J.K. Rowling]], where Hags are depicted as a species of ugly, child-eating women with numerous warts.

==In neurobiology==
The expression ''Old Hag Attack'' refers to a [[hypnagogic state]] in which [[Sleep paralysis|paralysis]] is present and, quite often, it is accompanied by terrifying [[hallucination]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} When excessively recurrent, some consider this to be a disorder; however, many populations treat them as simply part of their culture and mythological world-view, rather than any form of disease or pathology.

'''Hensleigh Wedgwood''' (21 January 1803 – 2 June 1891) was a British [[etymologist]], [[philologist]] and [[barrister]], author of ''[[A Dictionary of English Etymology]]''. He was a cousin of [[Charles Darwin]], whom his sister [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] married in 1839.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Herford|first=C.H.|author2=Rev. John D. Haigh|title=Wedgwood, Hensleigh (1803–1891)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28965|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wedgwood was born at [[Tarrant Gunville]] in Dorset, the fourth son of [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] and Elizabeth Allen of Cresselly, Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

He was educated at [[Rugby School]], then entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1820 but switched to [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WGWT820H|name=Wedgewood (or Wedgwood), Hensleigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did well in maths, graduating as 8th [[wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]], he finished bottom in the [[classics|classical]] [[tripos]] at Cambridge in 1824, for which he was awarded the first "wooden wedge", equivalent to the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]],&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; and jokingly named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Five years in an English university|first=Charles Astor|last=Bristed|publisher=G.P. Putnam|year=1852|page=253|authorlink=Charles Astor Bristed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving Cambridge, Wedgwood read for the [[Court of Chancery|chancery bar]]. In 1828, he qualified as a barrister, but never practised.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Between 1831 and 1837, he served as a [[police magistrate]] and sat at the Surrey magistrates' court at Union Hall, Southwark.

A notable case that came before him during his tenure was that of [[James Pratt and John Smith]] in 1835, whom he [[Committal procedure|committed to trial]] after their arrest for homosexual acts. After their trial and conviction at the [[Central Criminal Court (England and Wales)|Central Criminal Court]], the two became the last to be executed for sodomy in England. This was in spite of Wedgwood himself calling for a commutation of their death sentences in a letter to the Home Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cocks (2010) p.38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upchurch (2009), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedgwood resigned from the magistracy after deciding that one of his duties, the administrations of [[oath]]s, was inconsistent with the commandments of the New Testament. Between 1838 and 1849, he held the post of Registrar of Metropolitan Public Carriage.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

His main fields of study were [[philology]] and [[etymology]]. His ''Dictionary of Etymology'' was published in 1857. He was a founding member of the [[Philological Society]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==Spiritualism==

Wedgwood became interested in [[spiritualism]] and attended [[séance]]s. In 1874, he attempted to get [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] involved in spiritualism by sending him an alleged [[Spirit photography|spirit photograph]]. Huxley was not impressed and suggested the photograph had been produced fraudulently by the use of a second image placed on the plate inside the camera. Hensleigh refused to believe this explanation and considered the photograph to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, E. Janet. (2003). ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place, Volume 2''. Princeton University Press. p. 404. {{ISBN|978-0691114392}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wedgwood was a member of the [[British National Association of Spiritualists]] and a vice-president of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Janet. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Frances Emma Elizabeth "Fanny" Mackintosh (1800-1889) in 1832, his first cousin, the daughter of Sir [[James Mackintosh]] and his second wife Catherine "Kitty" Allen.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; They had six children:

* [[Frances Julia Wedgwood]] (1833-1913), feminist philosopher and writer known as "Snow".

'''Hierarchical INTegration''', or '''HINT''' for short, is a computer [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] that ranks a computer system as a whole (i.e. the entire computer instead of individual components). It measures the full range of performance, mostly based on the amount of work a computer can perform over time. A system with a very fast processor would likely be rated poorly if the [[Computer bus|buses]] were very poor compared to those of another system that had both an average processor and average buses. For example, in the past, [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers with relatively slow processor speeds (800&amp;nbsp;MHz) used to perform better than [[x86]] based systems with processors running at nearly 2&amp;nbsp;GHz.

HINT is known for being almost immune to artificial optimization and can be used by many computers ranging from a calculator to a supercomputer. It was developed at the [[U.S. Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy's]] [[Ames Laboratory]] and is licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

HINT is intended to be "scalable" to run on any size computer, from small serial systems to highly parallel supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Hodgson Brothers v South African Railways and Harbours 1928 CPD 257''''' was an important case in the [[South Africa]]n [[Contract law|law of contract]], which represented one of the first clear deployments of reliance theory or the doctrine of quasi-mutual assent.

== Facts ==
Hodgson Brothers, a small undertaking, informed [[South African Railways and Harbours]] that it had a [[lorry]] to sell for 500 pounds. Negotiations ensued between the parties, at no stage during which was the price disputed. SA Railways made a complete and definite offer to buy the lorry. Hodgson Brothers received the offer and accepted by post. Five days later, however, SA Railways sent a [[telegram]] notifying Hodgson Brothers that it had forgotten in their prior negotiations to mention that it would only pay 300 pounds for the lorry. Hodgson Brothers refused accept this, arguing that they had already agreed on the price. SA Railways contended that it had made a mistake.

== Finding ==
Although the court held that there was no subjective [[meeting of the minds]] between the two parties,—no ''animus contrahendi'', in other words—it found that South African Railways and Harbours, by its conduct, had created in the mind of Hodgson Brothers a reasonable belief that there is [[consensus]] and therefore contract had occurred. The contract accordingly was upheld.

[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to the ''[[Chronicles of Hainaut|Chroniques de Hainaut]]'' held in [[Royal Library of Belgium]]. Full page: 43.2 × 28.8&amp;nbsp;cm]]

'''''Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good''''' is a [[presentation miniature]] believed to have been painted by the Flemish artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (or if not actually from his hand then certainly by his workshop to his designs). It decorates the [[Frontispiece (architecture)|frontispiece]] to the ''[[Chronicles of Hainaut|Chroniques de Hainaut]]'', MS KBR.9242, a translation from Latin into French of a three volume history in of the [[County of Hainaut]] by [[Jean Wauquelin]]. The Latin text was originally written  by the 14th century [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] historian [[Jacques de Guyse]]. 

The majority, if not all, of the figures (described in the text as "[[Knight|Chevaliers]], [[Adviser|conseillers]], et [[Chamberlain (office)|chambellans]]", are portraits of historical figures. The decorative border of the presentation miniature includes the arms of the various territories making up Philip's dukedom, which he had considerably expanded, interspersed with his personal emblem of sparks being struck from a [[flint]].

The translation had been commissioned by Philip, and the manuscript that both contains the miniature and shows it being presented was at that point the only one existing.  From the court accounts the progress of the translation (though not the decoration of the manuscript) can be traced, and the miniature is presumed to date from around the time of the actual presentation to Philip in March 1448.&lt;ref name="Gay; Kren, 91"&gt;Gay; Kren, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire set of three volumes are now in the [[Royal Library of Belgium]].

It is well preserved, and the only known [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript]] miniature by van der Weyden.&lt;ref name="Gay; Kren, 91"/&gt;

==Chronicles of Hainaut==
{{main|Chronicles of Hainaut}}
The "Chronicles of Hainaut" is an [[illuminated manuscript]] in three volumes, tracing the history of the [[county of Hainaut]] to the end of the 14th century. The text of Philip's book is a French translation made c 1446-50 by [[Jean Wauquelin]], from the ''Annales historiae illustrium principum Hannoniæ'', a three-volume Latin work produced by [[Jacques de Guise]] c 1390-96. The book was commissioned by Simon Nockart, a councilor to Philip the Good, as a means to legitimise Philip territorial claims. It is now in the [[Bibliothèque royale de Belgique]] in [[Brussels]]. It contains ten other miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Bousmanne, Bernard; Delcourt,Thierry (ed.). ''Miniatures flamandes''. Bibliothèque nationale de France &amp; Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, 2011, p. 464,  pp. 178-181{{ISBN|978-2-7177-2499-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Figures===
[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242 (b).jpg|thumb|260px|Left to right: [[Simon Nockart]], Secretary of the province of Hainaut, [[Jean Chevrot]], Bishop of Tournai, and [[Nicolas Rolin]], Chancellor of the Duke of Burgundy.&lt;ref name="nyc"&gt;"[http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth214_folder/burgundy_intro.html The Frontispiece to the Chroniques de Hainaut: An Introduction to Valois Burgundy]". State University of New York. Retrieved 28 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The frontpiece praises the contemporary fashion at Burgundian court, which it claims is ahead even of that of the French. Broadly the miniature can be divided into three horizontal sections, with four clerics positioned to the left, two members of royalty and Wauquelin at the center, and eight advisers and courtiers to the right. The main figures are dressed in finely tailored gowns, with pipe [[pleat|folds]] extending from the shoulders, that become tightly [[girdle|girdled]] at the waist, before they spread out into the [[skirt]]. In most cases the skirts end before the knees. Most wear a [[bodice]], which is open from the neck to waist, and worn over a white shirt. The tops of their sleeves rise unnaturally over their shoulders, most likely due to the support of small cushions (''mahewters'') place inside the garments.&lt;ref name="vb174" /&gt;  

[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242 (c).jpg|left|thumb|180px|Philip the Good in black, with Charles de Charolais, the future Charles the Bold]]
The men's head-dress is intended to denote their social position, with the highest ranked wearing variants of the [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a garment then at the peak of its popularity. Philip the Good wears a black looped chaperon, Rolin a less exuberant version; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the [[Bishop of Tournai]], standing next to Rolin, all the other men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, despite the fact that several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].&lt;ref name="vb174"&gt;Van Buren (2011), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; But as far as can be seen, all have hats. The young Charles the Bold, then around 12 or 13 years old&lt;ref name="lc90"&gt;Campbell (2007), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; wears his patte, or strap, wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right, identified as [[Jean II de Croÿ|Jean de Croÿ]], has his [[bourrelet]] further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging from it. The man in grey seems to be carrying a different  typle of hat made of black fur,&lt;ref name="vb174" /&gt; but all the other ones visible are also chaperons, mostly with the cornettes to the front. 

Philip stands in front of his throne positioned under a golden or salmon coloured canopy or [[baldachin]], lined with what appears to be green [[satin]].&lt;ref name="lc89" /&gt;  He is, as usually in depictions of him, dressed almost entirely in black. He wears a black burlet (rolled) chaperon with the [[cornette]] wrapped around this neck. He holds a small hammer as a symbol of his authority in his left hand, and a baton of power in his right,&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; while a dog sleeps at his feet. His tight chaussembles (leggings) end in long [[Crakow (shoe)|pouleines]] (the type of shoe with very long, pointed toes). His clothes are lined with brown fur, which is turned out to [[Trim (sewing)|trim]] the cuffs and [[hem]].&lt;ref name="vb174" /&gt; His son Charles de Charolais stands to his right, dressed in a salmon gown, foreshadowing the crown he is due to inherit.&lt;ref name="vb174" /&gt;  Jean Wauquelin kneels before Philip, presenting a large book bound in brown leather; his translation of the Chroniques de Hainaut which he had completed in 1446. Van der Weyden some took artistic licence here, probably to vary the tonality of the dark colours; the surviving Chroniques bound in black satin.&lt;ref name="lc89" /&gt; 

[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242 (d).jpg|thumb|220px|Left to right: Either [[Antoine I de Croÿ|Antoine de Croÿ]] or  [[Anthony, bastard of Burgundy]] (in blue), unidentified old man (behind), unidentified man (in grey with chain), [[Jean II de Croÿ|Jean de Croÿ]] (in green gown and chain)&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt;]]
Philip's preference for black is imitated by a number of the other men to the right, particularly the older nobleman at the head of the group, who is generally identified as Antoine I de Croÿ, first chamberlain of the ducal household.&lt;ref name="vb174" /&gt; Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.&lt;ref name="IR"&gt;Kren; McKendrick, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The miniature bears a close resemblance to the presentation miniature by [[Simon Marmion]] for Philip's copy of the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'', in which Philip accepts many of the same figures present in the Hainaut miniature.&lt;ref&gt;Voronova; Sterligov (2003)
, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  A book for Charles the Bold of 1468–70 includes a rather crude and simplified version of van der Weyden's scene.&lt;ref&gt;Kren; McKendrick (2003), pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borders===
The richly decorated borders of the miniature detail Philip's territorial control over large areas of Northern Europe. The top of the page show his arms, mottoes, and devices, while along the sides are the arms of the different territories under his rule. They are laid out with including duchies on the left side (including Burgundy, [[Lotharingia]] and [[Limbourg]]), and counties on the right (including [[Flanders]], [[Artois]] and [[Franche-Comté]]).&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt;

===Condition===
It is well preserved but with some losses. There is some small amounts of decay to the paint to the head of the unidentified old man behind Antoine de Croÿ, as well as to the head of the white haired knight. Over time some of the colours have darkened, especially on some of the brighter elements of Philip's garments.&lt;ref name="lc92"&gt;Campbell (2007), 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
[[File:Simon-Marmion_-_Les_grandes_Chroniques_des_France.JPG|180px|left|thumb|180px|Philip the Good, with Rolin and [[Charles the Bold]], accepts the ''Grandes Chroniques de France'' from [[Simon Marmion]] on January 1, 1457]]

There are no extant examples of manuscript miniatures by Van der Weyden, excepting a single tapestry, all of the attributed works are panel painting. Yet in the early to mid 14th century, artists often worked in a variety of mediums. In both [[Tournai]] and [[Brussels]], where he is known to have been active, illuminators and panel painters were part of the same [[guild]]. He studied under [[Robert Campin]] and alongside [[Jacques Daret]], both of whom are known to have produced miniatures.&lt;ref name="lc87"&gt;Campbell (2007), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; 

The miniature is about the same size of van der Weyden smallest panel works. The workmanship is of the very highest quality and precision. An example of the attention to detail are the several concentric contour lines added to the tail of the dozing dog, making it appear to wag.&lt;ref&gt;Watteeuw (2009), pp. 180–3&lt;/ref&gt; It was copied in other presentation miniatures, some showing [[Charles the Bold]] older or in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Gay; Kren, 91"/&gt;

The association with van der Weyden was first established by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] and is now is generally accepted by art historians.&lt;ref name="lc89"&gt;Campbell (2007), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; His attribution was based not only on the quality of execution, but also on the portrait evidence of some of the figures. Most of these can be identified, and among them Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Chevrot|2=fr|3=Jean Chevrot|preserve=1}} (2nd from left), Chancellor [[Nicolas Rolin]] (3rd from left), [[Philip the Good]] (centre, 4th from left), and Charles the Bold (5th from left) appear in portraits by van der Weyden or his workshop, although in the case of Charles the Bold he appears as just an 11-year-old boy in the miniature. The group on the right probably include [[Anthony, bastard of Burgundy]] and [[Antoine I de Croÿ|Antoine de Croy]].

'''Sir John Knox Laughton''' (23 April 1830 – 14 September 1915) was a British [[Naval history|naval historian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Laughton, John Knox|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1023|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably the first to argue for the importance of the subject as an independent field of study.  Beginning his working life as a mathematically trained civilian instructor for the [[Royal Navy]], he later became Professor of Modern History at [[King's College London]] and a co-founder of the [[Navy Records Society]].  A prolific writer of lives, he penned the biographies of more than 900 naval personalities for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. R. Callender (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34420 'Laughton, Sir John Knox (1830–1915)'], rev. Andrew Lambert, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]), {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/34420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of National Biography 1912–1921 by Oxford pages 324 + 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Laughton was born in [[Liverpool]] on 23 April 1830, the second son and youngest child of a former [[Master Mariner]], James Laughton of Liverpool (1777–1859).

In 1866 Laughton married his first wife, Isabella, daughter of John Carr of Dunfermline. They had one son and three daughters. In 1886 Laughton married his second wife, Maria Josefa, daughter of Eugenio di Alberti, of Cadiz, Spain; they had three sons and two daughters, one of whom was [[Vera Laughton Mathews]].

He died at home at Wimbledon in his eighty-sixth year on 14 September 1915.

==Academic career==
Laughton was educated at the Royal Institution School, Liverpool, and then at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], graduating BA (34th [[wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]) in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LTN848JK|name=Laughton, John Knox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the Royal Navy as a civilian shipboard instructor teaching mathematics, science and navigation, and saw combat in the Baltic and Far East campaigns.&lt;ref name=JMH&gt;Adamiak, Stanley J. 'The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession', Review of book by Professor [[Andrew Lambert]], ''[[Society for Military History|Journal of Military History]]'' Vol. 64, No. 4 (October 2000) pp. 1169–1170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 he finished his sea days by going ashore to teach at the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]] in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]].  When the College moved to the new [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], in 1873, Laughton moved with it to become Head of the Department of [[Meteorology]] and [[Marine surveyor|Marine Surveying]].

In the 1870s Laughton turned more and more to teaching and lecturing on history, delivering a now famous lecture to the [[Royal United Services Institute]] (RUSI) in 1874 on the importance of actually analysing historical events, rather than merely reporting events chronologically. This was a new idea at the time and would not have been seen then as stating the obvious, as perhaps it would today.&lt;ref name=Caird&gt;[[John Hattendorf]], ''The Caird Lecture, 2000: The Anglo-French Naval Wars (1689–1815) in twentieth century naval thought'' Journal for Maritime Research.  http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conJmrArticle.30/viewPage/2 – URL last accessed 3 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  With this new approach, Laughton ‘acted as a catalyst for [the] entire intellectual development' of naval history as an independent discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lambert (1998) ''The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession'' (London: Chatham House), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as a lecturer in naval history, Laughton was undoubtedly an influence on the more famous naval historian-strategists of his age – [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], [[Julian Corbett]] and [[Herbert Richmond]]. Mahan, who has been described as "one of Laughton's disciples", wrote of him that "He probably knows more naval history than any English speaking man living".&lt;ref name=IHR&gt;[[R.J.B. Knight]] (2000)  ''The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession'', Review of book by Professor [[Andrew Lambert]] in the Institute for Historical Research's ''Reviews in History'' series. (London: Institute for Historical Research) http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/knight.html – URL last accessed 3 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885 he left the Royal Navy to accept the position of Professor of Modern History at [[King's College, London]].  He succeeded in convincing the [[Admiralty]] to allow limited public access to their archives. Together with [[Admiral Cyprian Bridge]], Laughton co-founded the [[Navy Records Society]] in 1893. He was the Society's first Secretary, and was knighted for his work in 1907.&lt;ref name=IHR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28044|page=5118|date=26 July 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laughton died at the age of 85 on 14 September 1915 and was buried at sea in the [[Thames Estuary]] from the decks of [[HMS Conqueror (1911)|HMS ''Conqueror'']].

==Legacy and Influence==

Laughton's contributions to naval history were largely forgotten until the pioneering work by Canadian naval historian [[D. M. Schurman|Donald Mackenzie Schurman]] ''The Education of a Navy: The Development of British Naval Strategic Thought, 1867–1914'' (1965) resurrected his memory. Professor [[Andrew Lambert]] has since added to this with a work, ''The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession''.

Unlike Mahan and Corbett, Laughton never wrote a major work, and the body of work that he did leave behind went out of print and until online editions became available was very difficult to come by. The measure of his significance comes by looking at the people he influenced and the institutions which he left behind after his death. Through 'long-term influence and personal contact' with other thinkers in the field and British admirals, he managed to sow the seeds in influential people’s minds that naval history was a subject worth studying, something which had relevance and bearing on modern naval affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1998), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Navy Records Society]] remains a key part of the discipline of naval history.

In recognition of his importance, King's College Department of War Studies has named its naval history chair as the ''Laughton Professor'', and naval historians in the department belong to the [[Laughton Unit]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/research/groups/lnu/index.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Kafka Brief an den Vater 001.jpg|thumb|The first of the 103 pages of Kafka's handwritten "letter"]]
'''''Letter to His Father''''' ({{lang-de|'''Brief an den Vater'''}}) is the name usually given to the letter [[Franz Kafka]] wrote to his father [[Hermann Kafka|Hermann]] in November 1919, indicting him for his [[emotionally abusive]] and hypocritical behavior towards him.

Kafka hoped the letter would bridge the growing gap between him and his father, though in the letter he provides a sharp criticism of both:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Dearest Father,
: You asked me recently why I maintain that I am afraid of you. As usual, I was unable to think of any answer to your question, partly for the very reason that I am afraid of you, and partly because an explanation of the grounds for this fear would mean going into far more details than I could even approximately keep in mind while talking. And if I now try to give you an answer in writing, it will still be very incomplete..."&lt;ref&gt;Kafka, Franz. ''Letter to His Father''. New York: Schocken Books, 1966. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Max Brod]], Kafka actually gave the letter to his mother to hand on to his father.  His mother never delivered the letter but returned it to her son.  The original letter, 45 pages long, was typewritten by Kafka and corrected by hand. Two and a half additional pages were written by hand.&lt;ref&gt;"Publisher's Note" Kafka, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, translated into English by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins, was published in a bilingual edition by [[Schocken Books]] in 1966, and included in several Schocken collections of Kafka's works. A new translation by Hannah and Richard Stokes was published by [[Oneworld Publications|Oneworld Classics]] in 2008 under the title ''Dearest Father''.

The '''''Libellus constructionis Farfensis''''' ("Little Book of the Construction of Farfa"), often referred to simply as the ''Constructio'' in context, is a [[recorded history|written history]] of the [[Abbey of Farfa]] from its foundation by [[Thomas of Maurienne]] ''circa'' 700 until the death of [[Hilderic of Farfa|Abbot Hilderic]] in 857. It is about the "construction" of a powerful abbey with vast landholdings. It was used as a source for two later histories, which are basically continuations: the ''Destructio monasterii Farfensis'' of [[Hugh of Farfa|Abbot Hugh]] (died 1039) and the ''Chronicon Farfense'' by [[Gregory of Catino]] (died 1133).&lt;ref name=costambeys&gt;Marios Costambeys, ''Power and Patronage in the Early Medieval Italy: Local Society, Italian Politics, and the Abbey of Farfa, c.700–900'' (Cambridge: 2007), 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The surviving ''Libellus'' is fragmentary, and appears only in one eleventh-century [[lectionary]] from Farfa, now in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma]], but which was probably not the ''Libellus'' which Hugh and Gregory worked from.&lt;ref&gt;MS [manuscript] Farfense 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Libellus'' partly relies on the earlier ''Vita'' of the founders of [[San Vincenzo al Volturno]] by its abbot [[Autpert Ambrose]] (770s). It also records the epitaph of [[Sichard|Abbot Sichard]] (died 842), which was only re-discovered in 1959, but which authenticated the ''Libellus''. Although the anonymous author was apparently a good copyist, it is impossible to properly assess his historical accuracy for many details he chronicles, but a comparison with the ''Regestum Farfense'' (a massive register of Farfa's charters, compiled by Gregory of Catino) shows that his outlines are correct.&lt;ref name=costambeys/&gt;

{{lang|ga|'''Long Éireannach'''}} ([[Irish language|Irish]] for "Irish ship") is the [[Ship prefix|designation given to ships]] in the [[Naval Service (Ireland)|Irish Naval Service]]'s fleet. In this context it is abbreviated to '''''LÉ''''', as in [[LÉ Eithne (P31)|LÉ ''Eithne'']] or [[LÉ Deirdre (P20)|LÉ ''Deirdre'']].
It has been used since December 1946 when Irish Naval Service was established with purchase of 3 [[corvette]]s from the [[Royal Navy]].

The '''New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries''' is a system of [[library classification]] developed by Yung-Hsiang Lai since 1956.  It is modified from "[[:zh:中国图书分类法|A System of Book Classification for Chinese Libraries]]" of [[Liu Guojun]], which is based on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. 

The scheme is developed for Chinese books, and commonly used in [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

The '''PC System Design Guide''' (also known as the '''PC 97''', '''PC 98''', '''PC 99''', or '''PC 2001''' specification) is a series of hardware design requirements and recommendations for [[IBM PC compatible]] [[personal computer]]s, compiled by [[Microsoft]] and [[Intel Corporation]] during 1997–2001. They were aimed at helping manufacturers provide hardware that made the best use of the capabilities of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, and to simplify setup and use of such computers.

Every part of a standard computer and the most common kinds of peripheral devices are defined with specific requirements. Systems and devices that meet the specification should be automatically recognized and configured by the [[operating system]].

==Versions==

Four versions of the PC System Design Guide were released. Within each version, a distinction was made between the requirements of a ''Consumer PC'', an ''Office PC'' and an ''Entertainment PC''.

===PC 2001===
Final version. First to require IO-[[Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller|APIC]]s to be enabled on all desktop systems. Places a greatly increased emphasis on legacy-reduced and [[legacy-free PC|legacy-free]] systems. Some "legacy" items such as ISA expansion slots and device dependence on MS-DOS are forbidden entirely, while others are merely strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeopenbook.com/pc-hardware-nutshell-3/pchardnut3-chp-1-sect-1.html |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711032416/http://www.freeopenbook.com/pc-hardware-nutshell-3/pchardnut3-chp-1-sect-1.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011|isbn=0-596-00513-X|page=1.1 PCs Defined|edition=3rd|title=PC Hardware in a Nutshell|publisher=O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.|authors=Robert Bruce Thompson, Barbara Fritchman Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports ==
Perhaps the most end-user visible and lasting impact of PC 99 was that it introduced a [[color code]] for the various standard types of plugs and connectors used on PCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pcguides.mspx PC 99 System Design Guide], Intel Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, 14 July 1999. Chapter 3: PC 99 basic requirements ([http://download.microsoft.com/download/win2000pro/PCG/1.0/NT5/EN-US/pc99v1a.exe PC 99 System Design Guide (Self-extracting .exe archive)]. Requirement 3.18.3: Systems use a color-coding scheme for connectors and ports. Accessed 2009-02-05&lt;/ref&gt; As many of the connectors look very similar, particularly to a novice PC user, this made it far easier for people to connect peripherals to the correct ports on a PC. This color code was gradually adopted by almost all PC and [[PC motherboard|motherboard]] manufacturers. Some of the color codes have also been widely adopted by peripheral manufacturers.

The '''Party of Kanak Liberation''' ({{lang-fr|Parti de libération kanak}}, Palika) is a [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Secession|pro-independence]] [[political party]] in [[New Caledonia]]. It is a component of the [[National Union for Independence]], which in turn is one of the two components of the [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS).

==History==

Palika started on the radical left, with [[Marxist]] rhetoric, in the 1970s. It participated, like the [[Caledonian Union]] (UC), in the Nationalist Front and later the FLNKS as the smaller, but more radical element. After the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Accords]], the division between Palika and UC heightened, and in 1995 [[Paul Néaoutyine]] led a dissident list ([[National Union for Independence]], UNI) from the FLNKS' united list in the [[North Province, New Caledonia|North Province]]. In 1999, the Palika and UC ran separate lists in all provinces. At the same time, the Palika became more moderate, favouring talks with loyalists but still having as a final goal full independence (as opposed to [[Associated state|Free association]] supported by UC).

The '''Peplos Kore''' is a statue of a girl and one of the most well-known examples of [[Archaic Greek art]]. The {{convert|118|cm|0|abbr=on|adj=mid|-high}} high white marble statue was made around 530 BC and originally was colourfully painted.&lt;ref name="Neer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Neer|title=The Emergence of the Classical Style in Greek Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oInWi4dvzgcC&amp;pg=PA119|date=22 October 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-57065-5|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was found, in three pieces, in an 1886 excavation north-west of the [[Erechtheion]] on the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis]] and is now in the [[Acropolis Museum]] in [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridgway|first1=Brunilde Sismondo|title=The Peplos Kore, Akropolis 679|journal=The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery|date=1977|volume=36|pages=46–61|jstor=20168947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peplos Kore (''[[peplos]]'' being the type of robe or shawl-like fabric draped over the figure and ''kore'' meaning a girl or young female) stands at approximately {{cvt|1.18|m}} high.  It is carved from fine grained [[Parian marble]].&lt;ref name="Peplos Kore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peplos Kore|url=http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/museum/collections/peplos-kore|website=Faculty of Classics|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces remain of the original paint.

== Description ==
The name of the statue comes from the heavy woolen garment worn by the girl ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: κόρη, ''[[Kore (sculpture)|kore]]''), the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[peplos]], which was no longer actually in fashion when the marble statue was made. Underneath it, the girl wears a thin [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] which peeps out from the sleeves and hem.&lt;ref name="Stieber2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Stieber|title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-77349-3|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bore holes on the head and shoulders indicate that the statue was decorated with bronze head decorations (probably a wreath) and shoulder [[fibula]]e. The left arm was made of a separate piece of stone and is now lost.

The Peplos Kore is ascribed to the ''Rampin Master'' who is named for another head, very similar in style, which was in the Rampin Collection and is now on display in the [[Louvre]].

In Brinkmann's opinion, this statue type does not depict mortal girls but goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Vinzenz Brinkmann, ''Mädchen oder Göttin? Das Rätsel der ›Peploskore‹ von der Athener Akropolis'', in Vinzenz Brinkmann and [[Raimund Wünsche]] (Ed.), ''Bunte Götter. Die Farbigkeit antiker Skulptur'', [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] and [[Glyptothek]], München 2003, pp. 53–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Her posture does not correspond to the late archaic Kore, "who steps forward with her left leg, holds her skirt with her left hand and holds fruit in the crook of her right arm.""&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann 2003, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; On the Peplos Kore, there are bore holes in the lowered right arm and the bent left arm which suggest she held a bow and arrows&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Mostra sul colore nell'antichità 01 - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|Crowned female statue with bow and arrows]]&lt;/ref&gt; or a shield and helmet. &lt;!-- The bore holes on the head which are usually interpreted as being for a wreath could perhaps have accommodated a loose fitting crown. &lt;Is this interpretation part of the above reference, or original research?&gt;--&gt;

A number of other similar kore statues (plural ''korai'') have been discovered at the Acropolis, dating to as early as the early 6th century BCE. Some have suggested that patrons commissioned the kore statues to serve as offerings to worshiped deities, as [[votive]] figures who stand in their place. Wealthier individuals used the kore statues as grave markers for deceased family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kore / Korai|url=http://ancient-greece.org/art/korai.html|website=Ancient-Greece. org|publisher=© 2002- 2015 Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure's “perfect symmetry and unearthly expression" suggests that the Peplos Kore may represent an ideal youthful embodiment of the deceased person's soul, rather than a physical likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noble|first1=Bonnie|title=The declaration of Peplos kore|url=http://declaration.net/article/peplos-kore|website=Declaration|publisher=Declaration Archive LLC © 2015 Brooklyn, New York|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Peplos Kore has distinct differences from the other discovered kore figures; the work is dressed in a particular manner, leading some archaeologists to suggest that the statue was a goddess representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker and Harris|first1=Dr. Steven and Dr. Beth|title=Peplos Kore from the Acropolis|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/daedalic-archaic/v/peplos-kore|website=KhanAcademy|publisher=© 2015 +Khan Academy|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is carved in the round, but designed to be seen from the front, with many details, especially in the facial features. The face displays an “[[archaic smile]]” similar to many Greek statues from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. [[Webster's Dictionary]] has defined an archaic smile as “an expression that resembles a smile and is characteristic of early Greek sculpture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaic Smile|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/archaic%20smile|website=Merriam Webster|publisher=© 2015 Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kore statues depict young, clothed female figures, in contrast to their male counterparts, the [[kouros]] figures which are presented as muscular nude males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kore / Korai|url=http://ancient-greece.org/art/korai.html|website=Ancient-Greece.org|publisher=© 2002- 2015 Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the [[Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge|Museum of Classical Archaeology]] attempted to replicate the sculpture’s original appearance by painting a cast of the figure. The replica was then displayed next to a second, unpainted cast to demonstrate the difference between the pure white marble that is commonly associated with Greek sculpture and the brightly-painted version that is probably closer to reality.&lt;ref name="Peplos Kore"/&gt;

[[Image:Rail Car Grand Isle, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Rail Car Grand Isle&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Rail Car "Grand Isle"''' was a [[private railroad car]] operated as part of the [[Rutland Railroad]] and then the [[Central Vermont Railway]] from 1899-1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lepkey|first1=Gay|title=A companion to Canadian National Railways : an annotated historical roster of passenger equipment|date=1999|publisher=Bytown Railway Society|location=Ottawa|isbn=9780921871033|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now an exhibition building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==History==
The Wagner Palace Car Company fabricated the rail car ''Grand Isle'' in April 1899 for Dr. [[William Seward Webb]], president of the company from 1885 to 1899. The wood clad business car was initially listed as Rutland RR 500 Grand Isle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaughnessy|first1=Jim|title=The Rutland Road|date=1964|publisher=Howell-North Books|location=Berkeley, CA|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Webb was trained as a physician, his father-in-law, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], persuaded him to give up the medical profession and join the family’s railroad enterprise instead. As president of the Wagner Palace Car Company and then the Rutland Railroad from 1902-1905, Webb lived for part of the year in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], from whence he commuted with relative ease to [[New York City]]. ''Grand Isle'' was one of a group of rail cars owned by Webb. Among them, others made by Wagner included the ''Ellsmere'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wait|first1=John C.|title=Car-builder's Dictionary|date=1895|publisher=The Railroad Gazette|location=New York|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1PAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA35&amp;ots=7h9VboUt0H&amp;dq=private%20car%20Ellsmere&amp;pg=RA1-PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=private%20car%20Ellsmere&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed in 1888, and the ''Mariquita'', converted to a nursery car for a trip with family and friends between California and Alaska in 1888-89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=William S.|title=California and Alaska and over the Canadian Pacific Railway|date=1890|publisher=G.P.

Webb later presented the ''Grand Isle'' to former Vermont Governor and Central Vermont Railway president [[Edward Curtis Smith|Edward C. Smith]]. The car’s mahogany-paneled parlor, elegant dining room, staterooms, and plush furnishings typified the private luxury cars that became important symbols of rank to railroad men, business tycoons, and public figures in the final quarter of the 19th century.

When the Museum purchased the ''Grand Isle'' in 1960, its paneling had been painted, its fixtures replaced, and its lush fittings removed to convert it to use as a business car. [[J. Watson Webb, Jr.]], Dr. Webb’s grandson, supervised the car’s renovation ensuring that it would once again embody the days of luxury rail travel and commemorate his family’s role in the railroad industry.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia''''' is a book published yearly by [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] magazine. 

''Ring'' editor [[Nat Fleischer]], noting that other sports had record books and that [[boxing]] did not have any books specialized in keeping fans up to date as far as the participants' records, began writing the first ''Ring'' boxing encyclopedia in 1941. It was published for the first time in 1942. Fleischer wanted to create a book that would keep fans informed about the history of boxing and their favorite fighters, and, at the same time, help fighters' managers and promoters choose who their protégé's next opponent should be. It also included a detailed history of title fights for each division, and a section of a list of boxing record setters.

With time, the book would also include round by round scoring for each title fight held on the year prior. At its peak, the book consisted of close to 600 pages of records and stats. 

After Fleischer died in 1972, [[Stanley Weston]] took over the production and edition of the yearly encyclopedia book. During this period, ''Ring Record book and boxing Encyclopedia''s were hard-cover books, with a glossy, outside cover that had color photos of famous modern fighters of the era.

In 1990, ''The Ring'' magazine went bankrupt, and the ''Ring Encyclopedia'' stopped being produced. In 1992, ''The Ring'' magazine returned to the stands, but it wasn't until 1994 that the encyclopedia returned.

The new version of the ''Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia'' is a smaller, pocket sized book with a different context separating it from the original one. It is a soft cover book that covers the history of each division, but including only the fights where world titles changed hands. It also includes a recap of title fights held the year before, but without the judges' scorecards for any of the fights. It only has the records of current world champions (except [[WBO]] ones, as ''The Ring'' magazine has always refused to recognize WBO world champions as such), and of leading contenders. It also has a recap of ''Ring'''s articles of the past twelve months. Currently, the encyclopedic books are edited by [[Steve Farhood]].

The original version of the encyclopedia, which was a mail-order item, topped at a price of 25 [[US dollar|dollars]]. Many books in the original format are now collector's items, and as such, their prices have gone up. The new version usually sells for 5 dollars at many [[List of supermarkets|supermarkets]] and other stores.

'''Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation''' (RGANTD) created by Decree of the Government of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] No. 575 from 9 June 1995, on the basis of the Russian research center for space documentation (RNITSKD)in  Moscow and the Russian state scientific and technical archives (RGNF) in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

== History of creation ==
13 January 1960 by the decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet abolished the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR is created by the Ministry of public order. In this regard, HAU (Main Archival Administration) of the interior is transformed into GOW under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] of the USSR. 28 July 1961 the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 669 approved “Regulations on the state University of management under the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the network of Central state archives of the USSR”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alppp.ru/law/informacija-i-informatizacija/43/postanovlenie-sovmina-sssr-ot-28-07-1961--669.rtf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 in Moscow created the Central state archive of the national economy of the USSR (ZHANG USSR). On the basis of the Department of scientific-technical documentation ZHANG USSR Resolution no 431 of the USSR Council of Ministers in Moscow was created the Central state archive of scientific-technical documentation of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (RGANTD USSR). In 1992 TSGANTD the USSR by the RF Government Decree No. 430 renamed the Russian state scientific and technical archives in (RGNTA) with a branch office in Moscow in 1992, renamed in Russian scientific research center for space documentation (RNITSKD). RNITSKD formed their Fund documents of organizations-participants of space activities, documents of space subjects of media organizations, personal archives of specialists on rockets, astronauts, memories of the workers of science and technology. RGANTD offers specialized stores are equipped with special cabinets and racks (for the documents on tape media), automatic control systems of temperature-humidity conditions, security and fire alarm systems.

== Information about documents ==
The basic directions of activity of the archive are:
# Acquisition of the archive documents of organizations of the defense complex and the civilian branches of the economy; documents, personal archives of workers of science and technology, and documents created by specialists of the archive in the order of the initiative documenting the memories of veterans of space industry, events and facts, reflecting the development of [[Space industry of Russia|cosmonautics]] [[Russia]].
# State registration and storage of documents.
# Creation and management of the scientific-reference apparatus to the archive documents and implementation of the automated archival technologies.
# Scientific use and publication of documents of the archive.
# Ensuring physical-chemical safety of documents of the archive.
# [[Microform|Microfilming]] and [[Cultural conservation|restoring]] documents of Federal archives located, in Moscow.
By the end of 2012 in [http://rgantd.ru/fondy-rgantd.shtml archives] RGANTD (G. Moscow) is more than 580 thousand units of storage of documents, reflecting the activities of more than 500 organizations included in the aerospace, defense and scientific-technical complex of the country, and private persons.

{{Journalism sidebar}}
In [[journalism]], a '''source''' is a person, publication, or other record or document that gives timely [[information]]. Outside journalism, sources are sometimes known as "news sources". Examples of sources include official records, publications or broadcasts, officials in government or business, organizations or corporations, [[witness]]es of crime, accidents or other events, and people involved with or affected by a news event or issue.

According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), there are a multitude of factors that tend to condition the acceptance of sources as bona fide by investigative journalists. [[Reporter]]s are expected to develop and cultivate sources, especially if they regularly cover a specific topic, known as a "beat". Beat reporters must, however, be cautious of becoming too close to their sources. Reporters often, but not always, give greater leeway to sources with little experience. For example, sometimes a person will say they don't want to talk, and then proceed to talk; if that person is not a public figure, reporters are less likely to use that information. Journalists are also encouraged to be skeptical without being cynical as per the saying "If your mother says she loves you, check it out." popularized by the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/qa_blur_author_tom_rosenstiel.php |title=Q&amp;A: Blur Author Tom Rosenstiel |accessdate=2015-10-02 |publisher=cjr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule of thumb, but especially when reporting on controversy, reporters are expected to use multiple sources.

==Using confidential information==
Off-the-record material is often valuable and reporters may be eager to use it, so sources wishing to ensure the confidentiality of certain information are generally advised to discuss the "terms of use" before actually disclosing the information, if possible. Some journalists and news organizations have policies against accepting information "off the record" because they believe it interferes with their ability to report truthfully, or because they suspect it may be intended to mislead them or the public.

Even if they cannot report certain information directly, journalists can use "off the record" information to uncover related facts, or to find other sources that ''are'' willing to speak on the record. This is especially useful in [[investigative journalism]]. Information about a surprise event or breaking [[news]], whether on or off the record, is known as a "tip-off". Information that leads to the uncovering of more interesting information is called a "lead".

==Anonymous sources==
The identity of anonymous sources is sometimes revealed to senior editors or a news organization's lawyers, who would be considered bound by the same confidentiality. (Lawyers are generally protected from [[subpoena]] in these cases by [[attorney–client privilege]].) Legal staff may need to give counsel about whether it is advisable to publish certain information, or about court proceedings that may attempt to learn confidential information. Senior editors are in the loop to prevent reporters from fabricating non-existent anonymous sources and to provide a second opinion about how to use the information obtained, how or how not to identify sources, and whether other options should be pursued.

The use of anonymous sources has always been controversial. Some news outlets insist that anonymous sources are the only way to obtain certain information, while others hold strict prohibitions against the use of unnamed sources at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shedden |first=David |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=49&amp;aid=64013 |title=Anonymous Sources &amp;#124; Poynter |publisher=Poynter. |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; News organizations may impose safeguards, such as requiring that information from an anonymous source be corroborated by a second source before it can be printed.

Nonetheless, prominent reports based on anonymous sources have sometimes proven to be incorrect. For instance, much of the [[O.J. Simpson|O. J. Simpson]] reporting from unnamed sources was later deemed inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shepard |first=Alicia C. |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1596 |title=American Journalism Review |publisher=Ajr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' retracted a story about a [[Qur'an 2|Qur'an]] being flushed down a toilet that led to riots in the Middle East; the [[Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005]] was based upon one unnamed military source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/16/AR2005051601262.html |title=Newsweek Retracts Guantanamo Story |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2005-05-17|accessdate=2015-02-28 |first=Howard |last=Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' retracted an article that implicated [[Sean "Diddy" Combs]] in the beating of [[Tupac Shakur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-naw-quad17mar17,0,7227999.story |title=Times retracts Shakur story |publisher=LA Times |date= 2008-04-07|accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original article was based on documents and several unnamed sources. When reporting on the original story, the [[Associated Press]] noted that "[n]one of the sources was named".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/entertainment/music/16786106.html |title=News &amp;#124; The Advocate — Baton Rouge, Louisiana |publisher=2theadvocate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the embarrassment, a news organization will often "clamp down" on the guidelines for using unnamed sources, but those guidelines are often forgotten after the scandal dies down.{{needs citation|date=July 2018}} One study found that large newspapers' use of anonymous sources dropped dramatically between 2003 and 2004. The [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]], a research group found use of anonymous sources dropped from 29 percent of all articles in 2003 to just 7 percent in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/business/media/14reporter.html|title=Fewer Sources Go Nameless in the Press, Survey Shows|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-02-28|first=Katharine Q.|last=Seelye|date=2005-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not on tape==
Whether in a formal, sit-down interview setting or an impromptu meeting on the street, some sources request that all or part of the encounter not be captured in an audio or video recording ("tape"), but continue speaking to the reporter. As long as the interview is not confidential, the reporter may report the information given by the source, even repeating direct quotes (perhaps scribbled on a notepad or recalled from memory). This often shows up in broadcasts as "John Brown declined to be interviewed on camera, but said" or simply "a spokesperson said".

Some interview subjects are simply uncomfortable being recorded. Some are afraid that they will be inarticulate and make fools of themselves when the interview is broadcast. Others might be uncooperative or distrust the motives or competence of the journalist, and wish to prevent them from being able to broadcast an unflattering [[sound bite]] or part of the interview out of context. Professional [[public relations]] officers know that having the reporter repeat their words, rather than being on the air themselves, will blunt the impact of their words.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The audience need not see or hear them being uncomfortable (if they have unpleasant news), and not being on air also allows them to be anonymous or identified only by title.

==Attribution==
In journalism, '''attribution''' is the identification of the source of reported information. [[Journalism ethics and standards|Journalists' ethical codes]] normally address the issue of attribution, which is sensitive because in the course of their work journalists may receive information from sources who wish to remain anonymous. In [[investigative journalism]] important news stories often depend on such information. For example, the [[Watergate]] scandal that led to the downfall of U.S. president Richard Nixon was in part exposed by information revealed by an anonymous source ("[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]") to investigative reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]].

===Ethics===
Divulging the identity of a confidential source is frowned upon by groups representing journalists in many democracies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/ethicnet/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025620/http://www.uta.fi/ethicnet/ |date=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spj.org/ethics_code.asp |title=Society of Professional Journalists &amp;#124; Improving and protecting journalism since 1909 |publisher=Spj.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caj.ca/principles/principles-statement-2002.htm |title=You are being redirected |publisher=Caj.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, journalists have no special legal status, and may be required to divulge their sources in the course of a criminal investigation, like any other citizen would be. Even in jurisdictions which grant journalists special legal protections, journalists are typically required to testify if they bear witness to a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcfp.org/digital-journalists-legal-guide/sources-and-subpoenas-reporters-privilege |title=Sources and Subpoenas (Reporter's Privilege) &amp;#124; Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press |publisher=Rcfp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists defend the use of anonymous sources for a variety of reasons:
*'''Access'''. Some sources refuse to share stories without the shield of anonymity, including many government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shepard |first=Alicia C. |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=1596 |title=American Journalism Review |publisher=Ajr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Protection from reprisal or punishment'''. Other sources are concerned about reprisal or punishment as a result of sharing information with journalists.&lt;ref name="gawker1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5627330/new-york-times-warns-newsroom-on-anonymous-sources |title=New York Times Warns Newsroom on Anonymous Sources |publisher=Gawker.com |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Illegal activity'''. Sources which are engaged in illegal activity are usually reluctant to be named in order to [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|avoid]] [[self-incrimination]]. This includes sources which are leaking classified information or details of court proceedings which are sealed from the public.&lt;ref name="gawker1"/&gt;

However, the use of anonymous sources is also criticized by some journalists and government officials:
*'''Unreliability'''. It is difficult for a reader to evaluate the reliability and neutrality of a source they cannot identify, and thus diminishes the reliability of the news as a whole when it relies upon information from anonymous sources.&lt;ref name="gawker1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firstamendmentcenter1"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/press-pays-a-price-for-anonymous-sources |title=Press pays a price for anonymous sources &amp;#124; First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition |publisher=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=2005-05-22 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Misinformation and propaganda'''. Anonymous sources may be reluctant to be identified because the information they are sharing is uncertain or known to them to be untrue, but they want attention or to spread propaganda via the press, such as in the case of the [[Iraqi aluminum tubes]], where tubes known to be useless for uranium refinement were presented as evidence of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s nuclear weapons program by anonymous sources in the [[U.S. intelligence community]] in order to build public support for an attack on [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="firstamendmentcenter1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-calderone/ny-times-reporter-defends-anonymous-source_b_2918508.html |title=NY Times Reporter Defends Anonymous Sourcing: Government Is Not A 'Unified Entity' &amp;#124; Michael Calderone |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gordon |first=Michael R. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/world/threats-responses-iraqis-us-says-hussein-intensifies-quest-for-bomb-parts.html |title=Threats And Responses - The Iraqis - U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest For A-Bomb Parts |location=IRAQ |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2002-09-08 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abqtrib.com/news/2006/sep/11/wilson-i-probed-iraq-proof/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194352/http://abqtrib.com/news/2006/sep/11/wilson-i-probed-iraq-proof/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used to attack political enemies and present opinions as facts.&lt;ref name="firstamendmentcenter1"/&gt; Several journalists, including [[Paul Carr (writer)|Paul Carr]], have argued that if an off-the-record briefing is a deliberate lie journalists should feel permitted to name the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carr|first1=Paul|title=The off-the-record gravy train stops here|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/nsfw-dont-bullshit-a-reformed-bullshitter-the-off-the-record-gravy-train-stops-here/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Post identified a source who had offered a story in an attempt to discredit media and to distract from the issue at hand with respect to a case of sexual impropriety. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html|title=A woman approached The Post with dramatic — and false — tale about Roy Moore.

*'''Illegal activity'''. The use of anonymous sources encourages some sources to divulge information which it is illegal for them to divulge, such as the details of a legal settlement, [[grand jury]] testimony, or classified information.

==="Speaking terms"===
There are several categories of "speaking terms" (agreements concerning attribution) that cover information conveyed in conversations with journalists. In the UK the following conventions are generally accepted:

*'''"On the record"''': all that is said can be quoted and attributed.
*'''"Unattributable"''': what is said can be reported but not attributed.
*'''"Off the record"''': the information is provided to inform a decision or provide a confidential explanation, not for publication.

However, confusion over the precise meaning of "unattributable" and "off-the-record" has led to more detailed formulations:

|'''"[[Chatham House Rule]]"'''
|Named after [[Chatham House]] (the Royal Institute of International Affairs), which introduced the rule in 1927: "When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed".
|-
|'''"Lobby terms"''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82525.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; Lobby correspondents |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] accredited journalists are allowed in to the otherwise restricted [[Members' Lobby]] on the basis that information received there is never attributed and events there are not reported. "Lobby terms" are agreed to extend this arrangement to cover discussions that take place elsewhere.
|-
|'''"Not for attribution"'''&lt;ref name="CAJ"&gt;as described by the [[Canadian Association of Journalists]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|The comments may be quoted directly, but the source may only be identified in general terms (e.g., "a government insider"). In practice such general descriptions may be agreed with the interviewee.
|-
|'''"On background"'''&lt;ref name="CAJ"/&gt;
|The thrust of the briefing may be reported (and the source characterized in general terms as above) but direct quotes may not be used.
|-
|'''"Deep background"'''
|A term that is used in the United States, though not consistently. Most journalists would understand "deep background" to mean that the information may not be included in the article but is used by the journalist to enhance his or her view of the subject matter, or to act as a guide to other leads or sources. Most deep background information is confirmed elsewhere before being reported. Alternative meanings exist; for instance, a White House spokesman said, "Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can't be quoted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/05/white-house-holds-offrecord-benghazi-briefing-163704.html?ml=bp |title=White House holds 'deep background' Benghazi briefing |work=Politico |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep background can also mean the information received can be used in the story, but cannot be attributed to any source. Depending on the publication, information on deep background is sometimes attributed in terms such as "[Publication name] has learned" or "It is understood by [publication name]." &lt;!--I've deleted the Deep Throat reference, because there's some confusion over whether Deep Throat started as deep background but then moved to background so the info could be used. Will check. --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  They focused primarily on digital cameras, consumer electronics, and computer components like disk drives and RAM, with some coverage of other shopping categories.  

StreetPrices offered comparison shopping with merchant ratings and tax/shipping calculation.    Major categories like digital cameras and TVs let users "search by specs".  StreetPrices also offered price graphs, now showing the daily high and low price for each item, with data going back as far as two years.

Also available were an AIM bot (streetpricesbot), and price comparison widgets that publishers could put on their web pages.

'''''The Genius of Victory''''' is a 1532–1534 marble sculpture by [[Michelangelo]], produced as part of a design for the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]]. It is 2.61 m high and is now in the [[Salone dei Cinquecento]] of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]].

== History ==
The exact date of execution of the statue is unknown, but it is usually related to the project for the [[tomb of Julius II]]. It is thought to have been intended for one of the lower niches of one of the last projects for the tomb, perhaps that of 1532 for which the ''Slaves'' now in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] of Florence were also made. On the other hand, the monument may have been coupled with a similar pair of fighters, a clay model in the [[Casa Buonarroti]] – the so-called [[:it:Ercole-Sansone|Hercules-Samson]].

With the famous statue unfinished, ''Victory'' forms an interesting footnote in history: left in the artist's studio after his final departure from Florence in 1534, it became the property of his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti, who first tried to sell it in 1544 without obtaining the necessary authorization from his uncle. Then, at the suggestion of [[Daniele da Volterra]], he tried to place it on Michelangelo's tomb in Santa Croce (1564), but [[Giorgio Vasari]], who was redesigning the church's interior, was against it being used there. Vasari suggested giving the statue to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, as in fact happened that year. If the Slaves from Julius's tomb ended up in Buontalenti's Grotto in the [[Boboli Gardens]], the ''Victory'' came to decorate the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio. It was placed along the wall, among the statues of the Labors of Hercules by Vincenzo de' Rossi and others.&lt;br /&gt;

In 1868, three years after the opening of the National Museum of the [[Bargello]], the statue was included in the collection of Florentine sculpture gathered in the museum. It was returned to the Palazzo Vecchio on 6 November 1921, now placed in a niche in the modern center of the back wall of the room, where, since the time Florence had been the capital of Italy (1865), the 19th-century [[Monument to Savonarola in Piazza Savonarola|statue of Savonarola]] had stood (now in Piazza Savonarola). Only in recent years has the ''Victory'' been restored to its former position along the right wall.

==Description and style==
The dating and attribution of the statue to the project of the tomb are based on stylistic elements that link the work to the Slaves: the twisting of the body and the vigorous anatomy, as well as comparable proportions. In addition, the head has a crown of oak leaves that allude to the Della Rovere emblem.
The sculpture does not represent a moment of fighting, but rather serves as an allegory of victoriousness. It depicts the winner who dominates the submissive loser with great agility, with one leg that blocks the body of the captive, who is folded and chained. The young man who is the genius is beautiful and elegant, while the dominated man is old and bearded, with a flabby body and a resigned expression. The surfaces are treated expressively to enhance the contrast between the two figures: the young polished to perfection, the old rough and incomplete, still retaining the impression of the heavy stone from which it was made.

According to some scholars, the model for the titular figure was [[Tommaso dei Cavalieri]] , a young Roman nobleman known by Michelangelo in Rome in 1532, to whom he dedicated love poems, and the older figure alludes to Michelangelo himself. &lt;ref&gt;Roy Doliner, Benjamin Blech, ''I segreti della Sistina.

'''''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''''' is an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] of music and musicians. Along with the German-language ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'', it is one of the largest reference works on western music. Originally published under the title '''''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians''''', and later as '''''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians''''', it has gone through several editions since the 19th century and is widely used. In recent years it has been made available as an electronic resource called '''''Grove Music Online''''', which is now an important part of '''''Oxford Music Online'''''.

== ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' ==
''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' was first published in four volumes (1879, 1880, 1883, 1889) edited by [[George Grove]] with an Appendix edited by [[John Alexander Fuller Maitland|J. A. Fuller Maitland]] in  the fourth volume. An Index edited by Mrs. E. Wodehouse was issued as a separate volume in 1890. In 1900, minor corrections were made to the plates and the entire series was reissued in four volumes, with the index added to volume 4. The original edition and the reprint are now freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;The volumes of the first edition were published as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 1 (1879) A - Impromptu&lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 2 (1880) Improperia – Plain Song&lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 3 (1883) Planché – Sumer is icumen in&lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 4 (1889) Sumer is icumen in – Z, Appendix, Supplement&lt;br /&gt;
Index (1890)&lt;br /&gt;

== ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' ==
The second edition (''Grove II''), in five volumes, was edited by Fuller Maitland and published from 1904 to 1910, this time as ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. The individual volumes of the second edition were reprinted many times. An ''American Supplement'' edited by Waldo Selden Pratt and Charles N. Boyd was added in 1920. This edition removed the first edition's beginning date of 1450,&lt;ref&gt;Grove II, vol. 1, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; though important earlier composers and theorists are still missing from this edition. These volumes are also now freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;The volumes of the second edition were published as follows: &lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 1 (1904) A–E ({{OCLC|250954613}})&lt;br /&gt;
Vol. 2 (1906) F–L ({{OCLC|250954626}})&lt;br /&gt;

The third edition (''Grove III''), also in five volumes, was an extensive revision of the 2nd edition; it was edited by [[H. C. Colles]] and published in 1927.&lt;ref name=Blom1970&gt;Blom 1954 (1970 reprint), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth edition (''Grove IV''), also edited by Colles, was published in 1940 in five volumes (a reprint of the third edition, with some corrections). In addition to the ''American Supplement'',&lt;ref&gt;For the 4th edition ''American Supplement'' published in New York, see {{OCLC|74811413}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan also published (in New York&lt;ref&gt;For the 4th edition ''Supplementary Volume'' published in New York, see {{OCLC|248932279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and London&lt;ref&gt;For the 4th edition ''Supplementary Volume'' published in London, see {{OCLC|493270221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) a ''Supplementary Volume'' edited by Colles.

The fifth edition (''Grove V''), in nine volumes, was edited by [[Eric Blom]] and published in 1954. This was the most thoroughgoing revision of the work since its inception, with many articles rewritten in a more modern style and a large number of entirely new articles.  Many of the articles were written by Blom personally, or translated by him.  An additional Supplementary Volume, prepared for the most part by Eric Blom, followed in 1961. Blom died in 1959, and the Supplementary Volume was completed by [[Denis Stevens]].  The fifth edition was reprinted in 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The New Grove'' ==

=== First edition ===
The next edition was published in 1980 under the name ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' and was greatly expanded to 20 volumes with 22,500 articles and 16,500 biographies.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Kennedy, ''Reference Sources for Small and Medium-sized Libraries'' (1999) p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Its senior editor was [[Stanley Sadie]] with [[Nigel Fortune]] also serving as one of the main editors for the publication.

It was reprinted with minor corrections each subsequent year until 1995, except 1982 and 1983. In the mid-1990s, the hardback set sold for about $2,300.  A paperback edition was reprinted in 1995 which sold for $500.

===Spin-offs===
Some sections of ''The New Grove'' were also issued as small sets and individual books on particular topics. These typically were enhanced with expanded and updated material and included individual and grouped composer biographies,&lt;ref name=oestreich20010121/&gt; a four-volume dictionary of American music (1984; revised 2013, 8 vols.),&lt;ref&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of American Music'', 4 volumes, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-333-37879-3}}; 2013 (8 volumes): {{ISBN|9780195314281}} .&lt;/ref&gt; a three-volume dictionary of musical instruments (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments'', 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-333-37878-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera|four-volume dictionary of opera]] (1992).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-333-48552-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second edition ===
The second edition under this title (the seventh overall) was published in 2001, in 29 volumes.  It was also made available by subscription on the internet in a service called Grove Music Online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grovemusic.com/ Grove Music Online] – online version of the 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt;  It was again edited by [[Stanley Sadie]], and the executive editor was [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]].  It was originally to be released on CD-ROM as well, but this plan was dropped.  As Sadie writes in the preface, "The biggest single expansion in the present edition has been in the coverage of 20th-century composers".

This edition has been subject to negative criticism (e.g. in ''[[Private Eye]]'') owing to the significant number of typographical and factual errors that it contains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2013/04/franz-schubert-in-new-grove-dictionary.html "'Franz Schubert' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001)"] (Vienna, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Two volumes were re-issued in corrected versions, however, after production errors originally caused the omission of sections of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s worklist and [[Richard Wagner]]'s bibliography.

Publication of the second edition of ''The New Grove'' was accompanied by a Web-based version, ''Grove Music Online''. It too, attracted some initial criticism, for example for the way in which images were not incorporated into the text but kept separate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Hoaxes and parodies==
Two non-existent composers have appeared in the work:

'''Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup''' was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 ''New Grove''. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb of Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrum-hellerup.dk/Hjemmeside/navnet.htm Foreign-language webpage showing the original dictionary entry]{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2009}}  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122632/http://www.esrum-hellerup.dk/Hjemmeside/navnet.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer of the entry was Robert Layton. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Esrum-Hellerup appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed and the space filled with an illustration.&lt;ref name=oestreich20010121&gt;{{cite news |first=James R. |last=Oestreich |date=21 January 2001 |title=Words on Music, 25 Million of Them |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/21/books/words-on-music-25-million-of-them.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian |last1=Levison |first2=Frances |last2=Farrer |chapter=How the Danes Discovered a New Composer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjsulsePxWUC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Classical Music's Strangest Concerts: Extraordinary But True Stories From Over Five Centuries of Harmony and Discord |publisher=Robson Books |location=London |year=2007 |pages=40–43 |isbn=978-1-86105-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the Danish organist Henry Palsmar founded an amateur choir, the Esrum-Hellerup Choir, along with several former pupils of the Song School, St. Annae Gymnasium in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrum-hellerup.dk/Hjemmeside/Koret.htm Foreign-language webpage for the Choir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825101429/http://www.esrum-hellerup.dk/Hjemmeside/Koret.htm |date=25 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guglielmo Baldini''' was the name of a non-existent composer who was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 edition. Unlike Esrum-Hellerup, Baldini was not a modern creation: his name and biography were in fact created almost a century earlier by the renowned German musicologist [[Hugo Riemann]]. The ''New Grove'' entry on Baldini was supported by a fictional reference in the form of an article supposedly in the ''Archiv für Freiburger Diözesan Geschichte''. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Baldini appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed.&lt;ref name=oestreich20010121/&gt;

Seven [[parody]] entries, written by contributors to the 1980 edition, and full of musical puns and dictionary [[in-joke]]s, were published in the February 1981 issue of ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (which was also edited by Stanley Sadie at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[Stanley Sadie and others] [https://www.jstor.org/pss/960856 "The New Grove"], in ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 122, no. 1656 (February 1981), pp. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt; These entries never appeared in the dictionary itself and are:
* '''[[Knees Up Mother Brown|Brown, "Mother" (Mary)]]''' (''b.'' 1550; ''d.'' Wapping, 3 January 1611)
* '''Ear-flute'''
* '''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Hameln]]''' [Hamelin]
* '''[[Genghis Khan|Khan't, Genghis]] ([[Tamurlane|Tamburlaine]])''' (''b.'' Ulan Bator, c. 1880; ''d.'' New York, 22 November 1980)
* '''Stainglit (Nevers), Sait d'Ail''' (''[[Floruit|fl]]'' Middle Ages) &amp;ndash; i.e. "Stanley Sadie", following the [[Mots d'Heures|example]] of [[Luis van Rooten]]
* '''[[Toblerone]]'''
* '''[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Lasagne]]''' ['Il Bolognese'] (''b.'' Bologna, 10 October 1813; ''d.'' Naples, 15 March 1867)

{{Hermeticism}}
'''Theurgy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|ɜr|dʒ|i}}; from {{lang-grc|θεουργία}}, ''theourgía'') describes the practice of [[ritual]]s, sometimes seen as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] in nature,  performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the [[divine presence|presence]] of one or more [[deity|deities]], especially with the goal of achieving [[henosis]] (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.

== Definitions ==
*[[Proclus]] (c. 480): theurgy is "a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation and in a word all the operations of divine possession"&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''On the theology of Plato'', 1.26.63. [[E. R. Dodds]], ''The Greeks and the Irrational'', University of California Press, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]]: "Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971), Penguin, 1973, 320-321.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pierre A. Riffard]]: "Theurgy is a type of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them, for instance by forcing them to  animate a statue, to inhabit a human being (such as a medium), or to disclose mysteries."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre A. Riffard]], ''Dictionnaire de l'ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 1983, 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoplatonism==
''Theurgy'' means "divine-working". The first recorded use of the term is found in the mid-second-century neo-Platonist work the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' (Fragment 153 des Places (Paris, 1971): 'For the theourgoí do not fall under the fate-governed herd').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Lewy"&gt;Lewy, Hans, ''Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy'', Cairo 1956, pp. 421–466 (mostly consulted and quoted from the revised edition by Michel Tardieu, Revue des Études Augustiniennes 58 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt; The source of [[Western culture|Western]] theurgy can be found in the philosophy of late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], especially [[Iamblichus]]. In late Neoplatonism, the spiritual [[Universe]] is regarded as a series of [[emanation]]s from the [[Neo-Platonism#The One|One]]. From the One emanated the Divine Mind (Nous) and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the [[Anima mundi|World Soul]] (Psyche). Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower, which remained unchanged by the lower emanations.

Although the Neoplatonists are considered [[polytheism|polytheists]], they embraced a form of [[monism]].

For [[Plotinus]], and Iamblichus' teachers [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], the emanations are as follows:
* '''[[The All|To Hen]]''' (τό ἕν), The One: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.
* '''[[Nous]]''' (Νοῦς), Mind: The Universal [[consciousness]], from which proceeds
* '''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psychē]]''' (Ψυχή), [[Soul (spirit)|Soul]]: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to
* '''[[Physis]]''' (Φύσις), [[Nature]].

Plotinus urged [[contemplation]]s for those who wished to perform theurgy, the goal of which was to reunite with the Divine (called henosis). Therefore, his school resembles a school of [[meditation]] or [[contemplation]]. Iamblichus, a student of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (who himself was a student of [[Plotinus]]) taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved [[invocation]] and religious, as well as magical, ritual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/&lt;/ref&gt; Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods, and in his major work, ''[[On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians]]'', he described theurgic observance as "ritualized [[cosmogony]]" that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.

Iamblichus' analysis was that the transcendent cannot be grasped with mental contemplation because the transcendent is supra-rational. Theurgy is a series of rituals and operations aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine 'signatures' through the layers of being.&lt;ref&gt;SIORVANES, LUCAS (1998). Iamblichus. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved September 17, 2013, from http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A062&lt;/ref&gt; Education is important for comprehending the scheme of things as presented by Aristotle, Plato and Pythagoras. The theurgist works 'like with like': at the material level, with physical symbols; at the higher level, with mental and purely spiritual practices. Starting with correspondences of the divine in matter, the theurgist eventually reaches the level where the soul's inner divinity unites with The Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Shaw"&gt;Shaw, Gregory, ''Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus'', Penn State Press, 1971, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor Julian==
The Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (332-363) embraced Neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace [[Christianity]] with a version of Neoplatonic [[paganism]].  Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time, this was ultimately unsuccessful, but he did produce several works of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]], including a popular [[hymn]] to the sun.  In his theology, [[Helios]], the sun, was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light, a symbol of divine emanation.  He also held the [[mother goddess]] [[Cybele]] in high esteem.

Julian favored ritual theurgy, with an emphasis on [[sacrifice]] and [[prayer]]. He was heavily influenced by [[Iamblichus]]' ideas.

==Esoteric Christianity==
[[Esoteric Christianity]] accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person. The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of [[God]] (see [[Raziel]]) and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God's relationship to individual consciousness. Theurgy, in the esoteric tradition, uses this knowledge to heighten one's own spiritual nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Mysticism: An Introduction to Contemporary Theoretical Approaches'' by Louise Nelstrop, Kevin Magill, Bradley B. Onishi, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009, pages 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In Esoteric Christianity, theurgy usually is the practice of trying to gain the knowledge and conversation of one's [[higher self]], or [[Inner God]], to teach one spiritual truths and wisdom from God that one couldn't learn from man (see [[alchemy]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] or [[Theosophist]] practices it, he or she could potentially rise to the degree of [[Magi#Esoteric Christianity and Magi|Magus]] or [[Adept]] after a certain level of spiritual attainment. In a traditional and magical sense, theurgy is seen as the opposite of [[Goetia]], even though many argue that they overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Secrets of the Magickal Grimoires By:Aaron Leitch  pgs. 241 - 278 (chapter 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] claim to teach a type of theurgy that would help one ascend spiritually as well as understand the true nature of the self and its relation to the Divine and the Universe. The Golden Dawn has a somewhat significant historical following and influence;&lt;ref&gt;Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn tradition: Chic and Tabatha Cicero, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; while it is held that many theurgists are usually solitary practitioners and seek the divine light alone through ritual and inner spiritual and psychological equilibration. Theurgy in this hermetic sense stresses the need for the individual to separate and analyze the individual components that constitute everyday consciousness and reunite them in a way that changes one's personal awareness into a state that understands and partakes in spiritual grace.&lt;ref&gt;The Tree of Life: an Illustrated Study in Magic By: Israel Regardie, Revised by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Following a pattern very similar to the Neoplatonists,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the Medieval Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah developed the concept that the [[Universe]] is regarded as a series of [[emanation]]s from the [[Godhead in Judaism|Godhead]], namely, the 10 [[sefirot]]. It is said that God created the world using the sephirot, pouring Divinity into creation through these "vessels," which also have personality traits. The highest sefirah, [[Keter]] "Crown", holds the most divine light and is the least accessible to humanity. The lowest sefirah, Malkuth, is still higher than [[matter]] itself, so the parallel with Neoplatonism is not complete, but Malkuth is considered that aspect of God that can be perceived in the material world. It is also known as the [[Shekhinah]].

For the Kabbalist, God is a single oneness, not separate "gods". The teaching avoids [[polytheism]] by insisting that the sephirot are not to be prayed to, but rather, to be meditated on and experienced as manifestations of how God acts in the world. They are envisioned as arranged in three columns, in a pattern called the Tree of Life. By meditating on the sephirot and praying for their unification, Kabbalists seek the theurgic goal of healing a shattered world.

For Kabbalists, the sefirot are as follows: Keter; [[Chokhmah]] "Wisdom"; [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] "Understanding"; [[Chesed]] "loving-kindness"; [[Gevurah]] "Strength"; [[Tiferet]] "Beauty"; [[Netzach]] "Endurance"; [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] "Glory"; [[Yesod]] "Foundation"; and [[Malkuth]] "Kingdom, Sovereignty".

A '''turnaround document''' is a document that has been output from a computer, some extra information potentially added to it, and then returned to become an input document.  For example, meter cards are produced for collecting readings from [[gas meter]]s, photocopiers, water meters etc. These are filled in by the customer and then returned to the company for [[image scanner|scanning]] using ICR ([[Intelligent Character Recognition]]) so that the system can produce the [[Bill (payment)|bill]]s for the customer. Earlier versions used [[punched card]]s, sometimes with [[mark sense]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/53248/turnaround-document&lt;/ref&gt;
