      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3886">'''ACP 125''' is the short name for ''Allied Communications Publication 125: Communications Instructions—Radiotelephone Procedures'', developed and published by the [[Combined Communications Electronics Board]], for use by the [[Five Eyes]] nations and the rest of [[NATO]]. According to the latest version, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The aim of ACP 125 is to prescribe the voice procedure for use by the armed forces of Allied nations on secure and non-secure tactical voice nets. Its purpose is to provide a standardized way of passing speech and data traffic as securely as possible consistent with accuracy, speed and the needs of command and control."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.k1chr.org/ACP%20125%20%28G%29%20Radio%20Telephone%20Procedures%20NOV%202016.pdf|title=Allied Communications Publication 125: Communications Instructions—Radiotelephone Procedures|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The standard defines the procedures for communicating by voice over two-way radio, and has served as the basis for radio communications procedures for many non-military organizations, as well as numerous U.S. government organizations, including the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[Civil Air Patrol]]. 

First published as ACP 125(A) in about 1951, the current version is ACP 125(G), published in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The standard itself is ACP 125, with the letter in parenthesis indicating the major revision level. There are at least two supplements, including: 

* ACP 125 U.S. SUPP-1: HF Air-Ground Radiotelephone Procedures U.S. Supplement 1 to ACP 125(B) 
* ACP 125 (US SUPP-2): Radiotelephone Procedures for the Conduct of Artillery and Naval Gunfire (U) 

== International use ==
Although the standard is designed for use by all NATO countries, especially when operating in conjunction with each other, some efforts have been made in the past to translate the [[Procedure word|procedure words]] into the native language of member countries. For example, NATO memo SGM-623-56 from 1956, ''French Equivalents to English Expressions Used in ACP 125(B)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nato.int/uploads/r/null/1/2/128226/SGM-0623-56_ENG_PDP.pdf|title=SGM-623-56: French Equivalents to English Expressions Used in ACP 125(B)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the following table of prowords:

'''Alert Standard Format''' ('''ASF''') (also sometimes referred to as ''Alert Standard Forum'', ''Alerting Specifications Forum'', ''Alert Specification Function'', etc.) is a [[DMTF]] standard for remote monitoring, management and control of computer systems in both OS-present and OS-absent environments. These technologies are primarily focused on minimizing on-site I/T maintenance, maximizing system availability and performance to the local user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmtf.org/standards/asf/ |title=ASF |publisher=DMTF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASF, unlike other DMTF standards, defines both external-facing network protocols (for use with Remote Management Consoles and Alert Sending Devices) '''and''' system-internal protocols and data models (for use in System Firmware, Remote Control Devices, Alert Sending Devices, and Sensors).

ASF v1.0 (DSP0114) was published by the DMTF Pre-OS Working Group in June 2001.

ASF v2.0 (DSP0136), adding secure remote authentication and data integrity, was published by the DMTF Pre-OS Working Group in April 2003.

== Network protocols ==
* [[RMCP]] (Remote Management and Control Protocol) transmitted by the Remote Management Console and received by the Alert Sending Device via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 623
* RSP (RMCP Security-Extensions Protocol) transmitted by the Remote Management Console and received by the Alert Sending Device via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 664 (added in ASF 2.0)
* [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|PET]] (Platform Event Traps) transmitted by the Alert Sending Device and received by the Remote Management Console via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 162 ([[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]-Traps)

== Internal protocols and data models ==
* [[SMBus]] 2.0 Messages (between the System Firmware, Alert Sending Device, Remote Control Device, and Sensors)
* [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] System Description Table (sometimes referred to as the "ASF!" table) to be populated by the System Firmware and used by the Alert Sending Device

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17324">The '''anomalous photovoltaic effect''' ('''APE'''), also called the '''bulk photovoltaic effect''' in certain cases, is a type of a [[photovoltaic effect]] which occurs in certain [[semiconductor]]s and insulators. The "anomalous" refers to those cases where the photovoltage (i.e., the open-circuit voltage caused by the light) is larger than the [[band gap]] of the corresponding [[semiconductor]]. In some cases, the voltage may reach thousands of volts.

Although the voltage is unusually high, the short-circuit current is unusually low. Overall, materials that exhibit the anomalous photovoltaic effect have very low power generation efficiencies, and are never used in practical power-generation systems.

There are several situations in which APE can arise.

First, in polycrystalline materials, each microscopic grain can act as a photovoltaic. Then the grains [[Series and parallel circuits|add in series]], so that the overall open-circuit voltage across the sample is large, potentially much larger than the bandgap.

Second, in a similar manner, certain [[ferroelectric]] materials can develop stripes consisting of parallel ferroelectric domains, where each domain acts like a photovoltaic and each domain wall acts like a contact connecting the adjacent photovoltaics (or vice versa). Again, domains add in series, so that the overall open-circuit voltage is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |author=S.Y. Yang |author2=J. Seidel |author3=S.J. Byrnes|author4=P.

Third, a perfect single crystal with a [[Centrosymmetry|non-centrosymmetric structure]] can develop a giant photovoltage. This is specifically called the bulk photovoltaic effect, and occurs because of non-centrosymmetry. Specifically, the electron processes—photo-excitation, scattering, and relaxation—occur with different probabilities for electron motion in one direction versus the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=Fridkin1991 /&gt;

=== History ===

'''158''', 28 (1946). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/158028a0 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later observed on other semiconducting [[polycrystalline]] films including [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = B. |last1 =Goldstein |first2= L. |last2 = Pensak|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|volume= 30|issue = 2|pages =  155-161|date = 1959|doi = 10.1063/1.1735125 |title = High‐Voltage Photovoltaic Effect|url = https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1735125|bibcode = 1959JAP....30..155G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silicon]],&lt;ref name="Kallmann"&gt;H.

D. Uspenskii, N. G. Ivanova, and I. E. Malkis, Sov. Phys.- Semicond. 1, 1059 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on [[amorphous silicon]] films &lt;ref&gt;E. I. Adirovich and L. M. Gol'Dshtein, Sov. Phys. Dokl. 9, 795 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Reuter and H. Schmitt, J. Appl. Phys. 77, 3209 (1995). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.358674 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[nanocrystalline]] silicon systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Levi Aharoni | first = Hadar |author2= Azulay, Doron|author3= Millo, Oded|author4= Balberg, Isaac | date = 2008 | title = Anomalous photovoltaic effect in nanocrystalline Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites | journal = Applied Physics Letters | volume = 92 | issue = 11 | issn = 0003-6951 | doi = 10.1063/1.2897294 | pages = 112109 |bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92k2109L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observed photovoltages were found to reach hundreds, and in some cases even thousands of volts. The films in which this effect was observed were generally thin semiconducting films that were deposited by vacuum [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation]] onto a heated insulating [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]], held at an angle with respect to the direction of the incident vapor. However, the photovoltage was found to be very sensitive to the conditions and procedure at which the samples were prepared.&lt;ref&gt;J. I. Pankove, Optical Processes in Semiconductors, (Dover Publications,New York, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; This made it difficult to get reproducible results which is probably the reason why no satisfactory model for it has been accepted thus far. Several models were, however, suggested to account for the extraordinary phenomenon and they are briefly outlined below.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;H. R. Johnson, R. H. Williams, and C. H. B. Mee, and references therein, J. Phys. D Appl. Phys. 8, 1530 (1975). {{doi|10.1088/0022-3727/8/13/015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oblique deposition can lead to several structure [[Asymmetry|asymmetries]] in the films. Among the first attempts to explain the APE were few that treated the film as a single entity, such as considering the variation of sample thickness along its length&lt;ref&gt;V. M. Lyubin and G. A. Fedorova, Sov. Phys. Dokl. 135, 1343 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; or a non-uniform distribution of electron traps.&lt;ref&gt;G. Brincourt and S. Martinuzzi, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 266, 1283 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies that followed generally supported models that explain the effect as resulting from a series of microelements contributing additively to the net photovoltage. The more popular models used to explain the photovoltage are reviewed below.

=== The Dember effect ===
{{Main|Dember effect}}
When photogenerated electrons and holes have different [[Electron mobility|mobilities]], a potential difference can be created between the illuminated and non-illuminated faces of a semiconductor slab.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Ryvkin, Photoelectric Effects in Semiconductors, page 296, (Consultants Bureau, New York, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this potential is created through the depth of the slab, whether it is a bulk semiconductor or a polycrystalline film. The difference between these cases is that in the latter, a photovoltage can be created in each one of the microcrystallites. As was mentioned above, in the oblique deposition process inclined crystallites are formed in which one face can absorb light more than the other. This may cause a photovoltage to be generated along the film, as well as through its depth. The transfer of [[Charge carrier|carriers]] at the surface of crystallites is assumed to be hindered by the presence of some unspecified layer with different properties, thus cancellation of consecutive Dember voltages is being prevented. To explain the polarity of the PV which is independent of the illumination direction one must assume that there exists a large difference in [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] rates at opposite faces of a crystallite, which is a weakness of this model.

===The structure transition model===
This model suggests that when a material [[crystallizes]] both in [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] and [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] structures, an asymmetric barrier can be formed by a residual [[dipole]] layer at the interface between the two structures. A potential barrier is formed due to a combination of the band gap difference and the electric fields produced at the interface. One should remember that this model can be invoked to explain anomalous PV effect only in those materials that can demonstrate two types of crystal structure.

===The p-n junction model===
{{Main|p-n junction}}
It was suggested by Starkiewicz &lt;ref name = "Starkiewicz"/&gt; that the anomalous PV is developed due to a distribution gradient of positive and negative [[impurity ions]] through the microcrystallites, with an orientation such as to give a non-zero total photovoltage. This is equivalent to an array of [[p-n junction]]s. However, the mechanism by which such p-n junctions may be formed was not explained.

===The surface photovoltage model===
{{Main|surface photovoltage}}
The interface between crystallites may contain traps for charge carriers. This may lead to a [[surface charge]] and an opposite [[space charge]] region in the crystallites,&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; in case that the crystallites are small enough. Under illumination of the inclined crystallites [[Electron hole|electron-hole]] pairs are generated and cause a compensation of the charge in the surface and within the crystallites. If it is assumed that the optical absorption depth is much less than the space charge region in the crystallites, then, because of their inclined shape more light is absorbed in one side than in the other. Thus a difference in the reduction of the charge is created between the two sides. This way a photovoltage parallel to the surface is developed in each crystallite.

== Bulk photovoltaic effect in a non-centrosymmetric single crystal ==
A perfect single crystal with a [[Centrosymmetry|non-centrosymmetric structure]] can develop a giant photovoltage. This is specifically called the '''bulk photovoltaic effect''', and occurs because of non-centrosymmetry.&lt;ref name=Fridkin1991&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulk photovoltaic effect in noncentrosymmetric crystals |author=V.M. Fridkin |date=2001 |journal=Crystallography Reports |doi=10.1134/1.1387133 |volume=46 |pages=654–658|bibcode = 2001CryRp..46..654F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=V.I. Belincher |author2=B.I. Sturman |title=The photogalvanic effect in media lacking a center of symmetry |journal=Sov. Phys. Usp. |volume=23 |date=1980 |page=199 |doi=10.1070/PU1980v023n03ABEH004703 |url=http://www.physics.uci.edu/~sasha/VI/Review_Usp.pdf|bibcode = 1980SvPhU..23..199B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electron processes like photo-excitation, scattering, and relaxation may occur with different probabilities for electrons moving one direction versus the opposite direction.

This effect was first discovered in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Fridkin1991 /&gt; It has been observed in [[lithium niobate]] (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name=Glass1974&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=25 |page=233 |date=1974 |title=High‐voltage bulk photovoltaic effect and the photorefractive process in LiNbO3 |author=A.

=== Simple example ===
[[File:ExampleOfBulkPhotovoltaicEffect.svg|thumb|right|400px|An example of a simple system that would exhibit the bulk photovoltaic effect. See text for description.]]
Shown at right is an example of a simple system that would exhibit the bulk photovoltaic effect. There are two electronic levels per unit cell, separated by a large energy gap, say 3 [[electron volt|eV]]. The blue arrows indicate radiative transitions, i.e. an electron can absorb a UV photon to go from A to B, or it can emit a UV photon to go from B to A. The purple arrows indicate nonradiative transitions, i.e. an electron can go from B to C by emitting many phonons, or can go from C to B by absorbing many phonons.

When light is shining, an electron will occasionally move right by absorbing a photon and going from A to B to C. However, it will almost never move in the reverse direction, C to B to A, because the transition from C to B cannot be excited by photons, but instead requires an improbably large thermal fluctuation. Therefore, there is a net rightward photocurrent.

Because the electrons undergo a "shift" each time they absorb a photon (on average), this photocurrent is sometimes called a "shift current".&lt;ref name=Rappe2012 /&gt;

=== Distinguishing features ===
There are several aspects of the bulk photovoltaic effect that distinguish it from other kinds of effects: In the power-generating region of the I-V curve (between open-circuit and short-circuit), electrons are moving in the ''opposite direction'' that you would expect from the [[drift-diffusion equation]], i.e. electrons are moving towards higher fermi level or holes are moving towards lower fermi level. This is unusual: For example, in a normal silicon solar cell, electrons move in the direction of decreasing electron-quasi-fermi level, and holes move in the direction of increasing hole-quasi-fermi-level, consistent with the [[drift-diffusion equation]]. Power generation is possible ''only'' because the quasi-fermi-levels are split. A bulk photovoltaic, by contrast, can generate power without any splitting of quasi-fermi-levels.

This also explains why large open-circuit voltages tend to be seen only in crystals that (in the dark) have very low conductivity: Any electrons that can freely move through the crystal (i.e., not requiring photons to move) will follow the drift-diffusion equation, which means that these electrons will ''subtract'' from the photocurrent and reduce the photovoltaic effect.

Each time one electron absorbs one photon (in the power-generating region of the I-V curve), the resulting electron displacement is, on average, ''at most'' one or two unit cells or mean-free-paths (this displacement is sometimes called the "anisotropy distance").&lt;ref name=Koch1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=vonBaltz1981&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physical Review B |volume=23 |pages=5590–5596 |date=1981 |title=Theory of the bulk photovoltaic effect in pure crystals |author= Ralph von Baltz |author2= Wolfgang Kraut |last-author-amp= yes |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.23.5590|bibcode = 1981PhRvB..23.5590V }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is required because if an electron is excited into a mobile, delocalized state, and then it scatters a few times, then its direction is now randomized and it will naturally start following the drift-diffusion equation. However, in the bulk photovoltaic effect, the desired net electron motion is ''opposite'' the direction predicted by the drift-diffusion equation.

For example, it might be the case that when an electron absorbs a photon, it is disproportionately likely to wind up in a state where it is moving leftward. And perhaps each time a photon excites an electron, the electron moves leftward a bit and then immediately relaxes into ("gets stuck in") an immobile state—until it absorbs another photon and the cycle repeats. In this situation, a leftward electron current is possible ''despite'' an electric field pushing electrons in the opposite direction. However, if when a photon excites an electron, it does ''not'' quickly relax back to an immobile state, but instead keeps moving around the crystal and scattering randomly, then the electron will eventually "forget" that it was moving left, and it will wind up being pulled rightward by the electric field. Again, the total leftward motion of an electron, per photon absorbed, cannot be much larger than the mean free path.

A consequence is that the quantum efficiency of a thick device is extremely low. It may require millions of photons to bring a single electron from one electrode to the other. As thickness increases, the current goes down as much as the voltage goes up.

In some cases, the current has different signs depending on the light polarization.&lt;ref name=Koch1975&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bulk photovoltaic effect in BaTiO3 |author=W.T.H. Koch |author2=R. Munser |author3=W. Ruppel|author4=P. Würfel |journal=Solid State Communications |volume=17 |issue=7 |date=October 1975 |pages=847–850 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038109875907358 |doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90735-8|bibcode = 1975SSCom..17..847K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would not occur in an ordinary solar cell like silicon.

=== Applications ===
The bulk photovoltaic effect is believed to play a role in the [[photorefractive effect]] in [[lithium niobate]].&lt;ref name=Glass1974 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">'''Archives management'''  is the area of management concerned with the maintenance and use of archives. It is concerned with acquisition,  care, arrangement,  description and retrieval of records once they have been transferred from an organisation to the archival repository.  Once records have been selected and transferred to archival custody, they become [[archive|archives]].&lt;ref&gt;https://library.unm.edu/cswr/docs/archives-and-records-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives-management&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managing archives==
The steps involved in managing archives include acquiring and receiving from the office of the origin, arranging and describing according to archival principles and practices, providing easy retrieval and access to archives.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hw.ac.uk/services/docs/ArchivesManagement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/terminology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives and Accessibility==
An increasingly relevant aspect of archives management is ensuring the accessibility of archives and archive materials to all users regardless of physical ability. Most archivist and library associations now include resources on educating archivists on how to manage their archives to be more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.archivists.org/groups/amrtrmrt-working-group-on-accessibility/a-quick-guide-to-accessibility-and-archives&lt;/ref&gt; Both archivists and [[special collections]] librarians are faced with the issue of making their resources more accessible to the public, as their items were created prior to the consideration of accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/2015/oclcresearch-making-special-collections-accessible-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">The '''Bankcard-Servicenetz''' (''bank card service network'') is a German [[ATM card]] [[interbank network]] group provided by the [[Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken|Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken]] services group. Technically it is not an [[interbank network]] but uses the pre-existing [[girocard]] network. Member banks of this cash credit group charge [[ATM usage fees]] at a low level and most customers of the co-operative banks enjoy free withdrawal from their accounts. With 19,200 ATMs the Bankcard-Servicenetz group is the second largest ATM group in Germany (after the savings banks network). 

In March 2012 more than 99% of the co-operative banks associated in the [[Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken|Federal Association of German 'Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken' Co-operative Banks]] participated in the Bankcard-Servicenetz network. The federal association publishes a list of banks that are ''not'' offering this service.

Unlike other ATM groups like the [[Cash Group]] and [[CashPool]], the ATM service network of Bankcard-Servicenetz is not free of charge – the service fee is not waived but the compact restricts the service fee to a common low level (usually 1,02 Euro and in some locations 2,05 Euro). However, in most tariffs of checking accounts, the service fee is taken over by the bank making the usage of the Bankcard-Servicenetz to be effectively free of charge to the customers. Some banks will show this by presenting a line of "Übernahme Gebühr: 1,02 EUR" (''"Takeover (of) Fees: 1,02 EUR"'') on the statement of account.

Some banks with a very scattered structure of customers choose to not join the ATM group as the share of paying other bank's service fees would be significantly larger than being able to charge service fees within the interbank network. This is often the case with some industry trades co-operatives and most of the ecclesiastical banks.

Banks that are not "Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken" but still members of the Bankcard-Servicenetz:
* [[Deutsche Apotheker- und Ärztebank]]
* [[BBBank]]
* [[PSD Bank]]
* [[GLS Gemeinschaftsbank]]
* [[Sparda-Bank]]
* [[KD-Bank|Bank für Kirche und Diakonie eG - KD-Bank]]
* [[Bank für Sozialwirtschaft]]
* [[Bank im Bistum Essen]]
* [[Edekabank]]
* [[MKB Mittelstandskreditbank AG]]
* [[Pax-Bank]]
* [[DKM Darlehnskasse Münster]]
* [[LIGA Bank]]

Some [[CashPool]] member banks have chosen to join also the Bankcard-Servicenetz. However, they point their customers to use CashPool ATMs for free withdrawal while offering to use the Bankcard-Servicenetz ATMs as a fallback option that allows depositors to withdraw cash money at a low fee that is actually charged to customers. This is the case for [[BBBank]] (2 times per month the fee is taken over), [[Bank für Sozialwirtschaft]], and [[Sparda-Bank]].

== Opt-out list ==
The list of 'Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken' institutes that do not participate in the Bankcard-Servicenetz is listed on the homepage of the [[Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken]] (BVR). As of July 2015 the list did include only the

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9606">A '''binary repository manager''' is a software tool designed to optimize the download and storage of binary files used and produced in software development. It centralizes the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization to overcome the complexity arising from the diversity of binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the dependencies between them.

A binary repository is a [[software repository]] for packages, artifacts and their corresponding metadata. It can be used to store binary files produced by an organization itself, such as product releases and nightly product builds, or for third party binaries which must be treated differently for both technical and legal reasons.

== Introduction ==
Software development can be a complex process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biggert|first1=Johnny|title=SUSTAINABLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, PART 2: MANAGING COMPLEXITY|url=http://www.johnnybigert.se/blog/2012/02/sustainable-software-development-managing-complexity/|website=Developers Dilemma|publisher=Johnny Biggert|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Complexity|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3423238|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving many developers, or teams of developers working on shared code bases, accessing the same build tools, downloading and using a shared set of binary resources, and deploying components into the same software product. To manage the source files used in software development, organizations will typically use [[revision control]]. The many source files used in software development are eventually built into the [[artifact (software development)|binary artifact]]s (also known as “binaries”) which constitute the components of a software product. In addition, in order to provide their functionality and feature set, software products may use many 3rd party artifacts downloaded from free open source repositories or purchased from commercial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eighth Annual Future of Open Source Survey Finds OSS Powering New Technologies, Reaching New People, and Creating New Economics|url=https://www.blackducksoftware.com/news/releases/2014-future-open-source-survey-results-revealed|website=blackducksoftware.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, a software product may comprise tens, hundreds and even thousands of individual binary artifacts which must be managed in order to efficiently maintain a coherent and functional software product. This function of managing the binary artifacts is done by a binary repository manager. A binary repository manager can be thought of as being to binaries what revision control is to source files.

==Universal package manager==
The software and technology industry continues to change and grow, binary repository managers are no different. They are beginning to shift towards positioning as a universal package managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://adtmag.com/articles/2015/09/08/jfrog-repository.aspx |title= JFrog Releases ‘Universal’ Artifact Repository |last=Waters |first= John K.| date= 8 September 2015|website=ADT Mag| publisher=Application Development Trends Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; These package managers aim to standardize the way enterprises treat all package types used in the [[software development process]]. They give users the ability to apply security and compliance metrics across all artifact types. Universal package managers have been referred to as being at the center of a [[DevOps toolchain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.codeproject.com/Reference/628210/An-Overview-of-the-NuGet-Ecosystem | title=An Overview of the NuGet Ecosystem | last=Decoster | first=Xavier | date= 18 August 2013| website=CodeProject.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sonatype Nexus

== Relationship to continuous integration ==
As part of the development lifecycle, source code is continuously being built into binary artifacts using [[continuous integration]]. This may interact with a binary repository manager much like a developer would by getting artifacts from the repositories and pushing builds there. Tight integration with CI servers enables the storage of important metadata such as:
* Which user triggered the build (whether manually or by committing to revision control)
* Which modules were built
* Which sources were used (commit id, revision, branch)
* Dependencies used
* Environment variables
* Packages installed

=== Artifacts and packages  ===
Artifacts and packages inherently mean different things. Artifacts are simply an output or collection of files (ex. JAR, WAR, DLLS, RPM etc.) and one of those files may contain metadata (e.g. POM file).  Whereas packages are a single archive file in a well-defined format (ex. [[NuGet]]) that contain files appropriate for the package type (ex. DLL, PDB).&lt;ref name="sharedlibrary"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chris | first = Tucker | title = Optimal Package Install/Uninstall Manager | publisher = UC San Diego | date = 2007-03-15| page=1 | url = http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/papers/opium.pdf | accessdate = 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many artifacts result from builds but other types are crucial as well. Packages are essentially one of two things: a library or an application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Linux repository classification schemes | url=http://braintickle.blogspot.com/2006/01/linux-repository-classification.html|publisher=braintickle.blogspot.com | accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to source files, binary artifacts are often larger by orders of magnitude, they are rarely deleted or overwritten (except for rare cases such as snapshots or nightly builds), and they are usually accompanied by lots of metadata such as id, package name, version, license and more.

=== Metadata ===
[[Metadata]] describes a binary artifact, is stored and specified separately from the artifact itself, and can have several additional uses. The following table shows some common metadata types and their uses:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Metadata type !! Used for 
|-
| Versions available || Upgrading and downgrading automatically
|-
| Dependencies || Specify other artifacts that the current artifact depends on
|-
| Downstream dependencies || Specify other artifacts that depend on the current artifact
|-
| License || Legal compliance
|-
| Build date and time || Traceability
|-
| Documentation || Provide offline availability for contextual documentation in IDEs
|-
| Approval information || Traceability
|- 
| Metrics || Code coverage, compliance to rules, test results
|-
| User-created metadata || Custom reports and processes
|}

== Key features of repository managers==
Key factors and features when considering the adoption of a package manager include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/cwdn/2015/11/how-to-find-real-devops-look-for-binary-artifact-repository-control.html |title= How to find real DevOps, look for binary artifact repository control |last=Bridgewater | first=Adrian | date=  1 November 2015 |website=ComputerWeekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Caching''' – Caching simply stores local copies of packages. This increases performance for slow internet connections by allowing the user to pull from the local repository instead of externally. Caching locally allows frequently used packages to be available even during times of external repository outages.
*'''Retention policies''' - Repository managers can be used and configured to support organization purging policies to ensure reasonable disk space usage. Local repositories for third party artifacts may also be purged after not being used by any release for a specified time.
*'''License filtering''' - Third party artifacts may be subject to approval processes due to licensing and legal issues. Package managers allow for the restriction of only approved artifacts into deployment.
*'''High availability''' - Since a binary repository manager maintains all the development dependencies, it is vital to always maintain access to these artifacts. Any down-time of the binary repository manager can halt development with all the significant consequences to the organization. A [[high availability]] instance allows an enterprise to overcome the risk associated with downtime, through automatic failover. This is achieved by having a redundant set of repository managers work against the same database and file storage. Maintaining enterprise wide stability and performance at all times
*'''User restrictions''' - Repository managers can be integrated with other organizational systems such as LDAP or Single Sign-On servers to simplify and centralize user management. This gives an enterprise granular control over who has access to vital software components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3235">The '''Bor S. Luh International Award''' has been awarded every year since 1956. Before 2005, this award was named the International Award. It is given to an individual or institution that had outstanding efforts in one of the following areas in [[food technology]]: 1) International exchange of ideas, 2) better international understanding, and/or 3) practical successful technology transfer to an economically depressed area in a developed or developing area.

The award was renamed for [[Bor S. Luh]] (1916-2001), who was born and educated in [[China]] before completing his education in the [[United States]]. Luh was the first president of the [[Chinese American Food Society]] in 1974-5 and received its Professional Achievement Award in 1984.

Award winners receive a plaque from the Bor S. Luh Endowment Fund of the [[Institute of Food Technologists]] Foundation and a [[USD]] 3000 [[honorarium]].

A '''breast implant''' is a [[prosthesis]] used to change the size, shape, and contour of a woman's [[breast]]. In reconstructive plastic surgery, breast implants can be placed to restore a natural looking breast mound for post–[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]] patients or to correct [[congenital defect]]s and [[Congenital abnormality|deformities]] of the chest wall. They are also used cosmetically to enhance or enlarge the appearance of the breast through [[breast augmentation|breast augmentation surgery]].
[[File:Breast Implant Markings.ogg|thumb|(video) A doctor marking the chest for implants.]]

There are three general types of '''breast implant devices''', defined by their filler material: saline solution, silicone gel, and composite filler. The saline implant has an [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] during surgery; the silicone implant has an elastomer silicone shell pre-filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel; and the alternative composition implants featured miscellaneous fillers, such as [[soy|soy oil]], [[String breast implant|polypropylene string]], etc. Composite implants are typically not recommended for use anymore and, in fact, their use is banned in the United States and Europe due to associated health risks and complications.

In surgical practice, for the reconstruction of a breast, the [[tissue expansion|tissue expander]] device is a temporary breast prosthesis used to form and establish an implant pocket for the future permanent breast implant. For the correction of male breast defects and deformities, the pectoral implant is the breast prosthesis used for the reconstruction and the aesthetic repair of a man's chest wall (see: [[gynecomastia]] and [[mastopexy]]).

==History==
[[Image:Vincenz Czerny.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Vincenz Czerny (1842–1916), a surgical pioneer in [[breast reconstruction]].]]

===19th century===

Since the late nineteenth century, breast implants have been used to [[Plastic surgery|surgically]] augment the size (volume), modify the shape (contour), and enhance the feel (tact) of a woman's breasts. In 1895, surgeon [[Vincenz Czerny]] effected the earliest breast implant emplacement when he used the patient's autologous [[adipose tissue]], harvested from a benign [[lumbar]] [[lipoma]], to repair the asymmetry of the breast from which he had removed a tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Czerny V | title = Plastischer Ersatz der Brusthus durch ein Lipoma | journal = Zentralblatt für Chirurgie | year = 1895 | volume = 27 | pages = 72 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, surgeon Robert Gersuny experimented with [[Alkane|paraffin]]&lt;!--?--&gt; injections, with disastrous results.{{explain|date=October 2018}}

===The 20th century===
From the first half of the twentieth century, physicians used other substances as breast implant fillers—[[ivory]], glass balls, ground [[rubber]], [[ox]] [[cartilage]], [[Terylene]] [[wool]], [[gutta-percha]], Dicora, [[polyethylene]] chips, Ivalon ([[polyvinyl alcohol]]—formaldehyde polymer sponge), a polyethylene sac with Ivalon, polyether foam sponge (Etheron), polyethylene tape (Polystan) strips wound into a ball, [[polyester]] (polyurethane foam sponge) Silastic rubber, and teflon-silicone prostheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Bondurant S, Ernster V, Herdman R (eds); Committee on the Safety of Silicone Breast Implants | title = Safety of Silicone Breast Implants | publisher = Institute of Medicine | year = 1999 | url = http://www.nap.edu/books/0309065321/html/21.html | isbn = 0-309-06532-1 | page = 21 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070313091328/http://www.nap.edu/books/0309065321/html/21.html | archivedate = 2007-03-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-twentieth century, Morton I. Berson, in 1945, and Jacques Maliniac, in 1950, each performed flap-based breast augmentations by rotating the patient's chest wall tissue into the breast to increase its volume. Furthermore, throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, plastic surgeons used synthetic fillers—including [[silicone]] injections received by some 50,000 women, from which developed silicone [[granuloma]]s and breast hardening that required treatment by [[mastectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson N| title = Lawsuit Science: Lessons from the Silicone Breast Implant Controversy | journal = New York Law School Law Review | year = 1997 | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 401–07 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], developed the first silicone breast prosthesis, filled with silicone gel; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962 using the Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963. In 1964, the French company Laboratoires Arion developed and manufactured the saline breast implant, filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]], and then introduced for use as a [[medical device]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stevens WG, Hirsch EM, Stoker DA, Cohen R | title = In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–349 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16874200 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000227674.65284.80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are two types of breast implants commonly used for [[mammaplasty]], [[breast reconstruction]], and [[breast augmentation]] procedures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpsmn.com/breast-procedures/choosing-breast-implants/ |title=Choosing Your Breast Implants |publisher=Minneapolis Plastic Surgery, LTD |format=Web |access-date=23 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124092228/http://mpsmn.com/breast-procedures/choosing-breast-implants/ |archivedate=24 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saline implants===
The saline breast implant—filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] (biological-concentration salt water 0.90% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], ca. 300 [[Osmolality|mOsm]]/L.)—was first manufactured by the Laboratoires Arion company, in France, and was introduced for use as a prosthetic [[medical device]] in 1964. The contemporary models of saline breast implant are manufactured with thicker, room-temperature [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] (RTV) shells made of a [[silicone]] [[elastomer]]. The study ''In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants'' (2006) reported that the rates of deflation (filler leakage) of the pre-filled saline breast implant made it a second-choice prosthesis for corrective breast surgery.&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; Nonetheless, in the 1990s, the saline breast implant was the [[medical device|prosthesis]] most common device used for breast augmentation surgery in the United States, because of the U.S. FDA's restriction against the implantation of silicone-filled breast implants outside of clinical studies. Saline breast implants have enjoyed little popularity in the rest of the world, possessing negligible market share.

The technical goal of saline-implant technology was a physically less invasive surgical technique for emplacing an empty breast implant device through a smaller surgical incision.&lt;ref name="Arion1965"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arion HG|title=Retromammary Prosthesis |journal=C R Societé Française de Gynécologie | year=1965|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surgical praxis, after having emplaced the empty breast implants to the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then filled each device with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]], and, because the required insertion-incisions are short and small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller and shorter than the surgical scars usual to the long incisions required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants.

When compared to the results achieved with a silicone-gel breast implant, the saline implant can yield acceptable results, of increased breast-size, smoother hemisphere-contour, and realistic texture; yet, it is likelier to cause cosmetic problems, such as the rippling and the wrinkling of the breast-envelope skin, accelerated lower breast pole stretch, and technical problems, such as the presence of the implant being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. The occurrence of such cosmetic problems is likelier in the case of the woman with very little [[breast]] tissue, and in the case of the woman who requires [[Mastectomy|post-mastectomy]] breast reconstruction; thus, the silicone-gel implant is the technically superior [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] device for breast augmentation, and for [[breast reconstruction]]. In the case of the woman with much breast tissue, for whom sub-muscular emplacement is the recommended surgical approach, saline breast implants can produce an aesthetic result much like that afforded by silicone breast implants, albeit with greater implant palpability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg TS | title = Silicone Gel Implants Are Back — So What? | journal = American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery | year = 2009 | volume = 26 | pages = 5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicone gel implants===
As a [[medical device]] [[technology]], there are five generations of silicone breast implant, each defined by common model-manufacturing techniques.
 {{Citation needed |date=October 2014}}

The modern prosthetic breast was invented in 1961 by the American [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]] Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and manufactured by the [[Dow Corning Corporation]]; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962.

====First generation====
The Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963, was a silicone rubber envelope-sac, shaped like a teardrop, which was filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce the rotation of the emplaced breast implant upon the chest wall, the model 1963 prosthesis was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch, made of Dacron material ([[Polyethylene terephthalate]]), which was attached to the rear of the breast implant shell.&lt;ref name=Cronin_1963&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cronin TD, Gerow FJ | title = Augmentation Mammaplasty: A New "natural feel" Prosthesis | journal = Excerpta Medica International Congress Series | year = 1963 | volume = 66 | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation====
In the 1970s, manufacturers presented the second generation of breast implant prostheses that featured functional developments and aesthetic improvements to the technology:

* the first technological developments were a thinner-gauge device-shell, and a filler gel of low-cohesion silicone, which improved the functionality and the verisimilitude (size, appearance, and texture) of the silicone-gel breast implant. Yet, in clinical practice, second-generation breast implants proved fragile, and suffered greater incidences of shell rupture, and of filler leakage ("silicone-gel bleed") through the intact device shell. The consequent, increased incidence-rates of medical complications (e.g. [[capsular contracture]]) precipitated faulty-product, [[Class action|class action-lawsuits]], by the U.S. government, against the Dow Corning Corporation, and other manufacturers of breast prostheses.
* the second technological development was a [[polyurethane|polyurethane foam coating]] for the shell of the breast implant; the coating reduced the incidence of [[capsular contracture]], by causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] that impeded the formation of a capsule of fibrous [[collagen]] tissue around the breast implant. Nevertheless, despite that prophylactic measure, the medical use of polyurethane-coated breast implants was briefly discontinued, because of the potential health-risk posed by 2,4-toluenediamine (TDA), a [[carcinogen]]ic by-product of the chemical breakdown of the polyurethane foam coating of the breast implant.&lt;ref name="Luu11998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luu HM, Hutter JC, Bushar HF | title = A Physiologically based Pharmacokinetic Model for 2,4-toluenediamine Leached from Polyurethane foam-covered Breast Implants | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 106 | issue = 7 | pages = 393–400 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9637796 | pmc = 1533137 | doi = 10.2307/3434066 | jstor = 3434066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:After reviewing the medical data, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] concluded that TDA-induced [[breast cancer]] was an infinitesimal health-risk to women with breast implants, and did not justify legally requiring physicians to explain the matter to their patients. In the event, polyurethane-coated breast implants remain in plastic surgery practice in Europe and in South America; and no manufacturer has sought FDA approval for medical sales of such breast implants in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hester TR, Tebbetts JB, Maxwell GP | title = The Polyurethane-covered Mammary Prosthesis: Facts and Fiction (II): A Look Back and a "peek" Ahead | journal = Clinical Plastic Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 579–86 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11471963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the third technological development was the double lumen breast implant device, a double-cavity prosthesis composed of a silicone breast implant contained within a saline breast implant. The two-fold, technical goal was: (i) the cosmetic benefits of silicone-gel (the inner lumen) enclosed in saline solution (the outer lumen); (ii) a breast implant device the volume of which is post-operatively adjustable. Nevertheless, the more complex design of the double-lumen breast implant suffered a device-failure rate greater than that of single-lumen breast implants. The contemporary versions of second-generation breast implant devices (presented in 1984) are the "Becker Expandable" models of breast implant, which are primarily used for [[Reconstructive surgery|breast reconstruction]].

====Third and Fourth generations====
In the 1980s, the models of the Third and of the Fourth generations of breast implant devices were sequential advances in manufacturing technology, such as [[elastomer]]-coated shells that decreased gel-bleed (filler leakage), and a thicker (increased-cohesion) filler gel. [[Sociology of health and illness|Sociologically]], the manufacturers of prosthetic breasts then designed and made anatomic models (natural breast) and shaped models (round, tapered) that realistically corresponded with the breast- and body- types of women. The tapered models of breast implant have a uniformly textured surface, which reduces the rotation of the prosthesis within the implant pocket; the round models of breast implant are available in smooth-surface- and textured-surface- types.

====Fifth generation====
Since the mid-1990s, the fifth generation of silicone-gel breast implant is made of a high-strength, highly cohesive silicone gel that mostly eliminates the occurrences of filler leakage (“silicone gel bleed”) and of the migration of the silicone filler from the implant pocket to elsewhere in the woman's body. These implants are commonly referred to as "gummy bear breast implants" for their firm, pliant consistency, which is similar to gummy candies. The studies ''Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery'' (2004) and ''Cohesive Silicone gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery'' (2005) reported low incidence-rates of [[capsular contracture]] and of device-shell rupture; and greater rates of improved medical-safety and technical-efficacy than that of early generation breast implant devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown MH, Shenker R, Silver SA | title = Cohesive silicone gel breast implants in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 768–779; discussion 779–1 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16141814 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000176259.66948.e7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fruhstorfer BH, Hodgson EL, Malata CM | title = Early experience with an anatomical soft cohesive silicone gel prosthesis in cosmetic and reconstructive breast implant surgery | journal = Annals of Plastic Surgery | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 536–542 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15602249 | doi = 10.1097/01.sap.0000134508.43550.6f }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hedén P, Jernbeck J, Hober M | title = Breast augmentation with anatomical cohesive gel implants: The world's largest current experience | journal = Clinics in plastic surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 531–552 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11471959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{further|Body dysmorphic disorder|Body image|Beauty}}

The [[breast augmentation]] patient usually is a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her bodily [[self image]], and a history of having endured criticism (teasing) about the [[aesthetics]] of her person.&lt;ref name="Brinton2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brinton LA, Brown SL, Colton T, Burich MC, Lubin J | title = Characteristics of a Population of Women with Breast Implants Compared with Women Seeking other Types of Plastic Surgery | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 919–927 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10724251 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-200003000-00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies ''Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients'' (2003) and ''Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery'' (2006) reported that the woman who underwent [[breast augmentation]] surgery also had undergone [[psychotherapy]], suffered low [[self-esteem]], presented frequent occurrences of [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]], had attempted [[suicide]], and suffered [[body dysmorphia]], a type of mental illness.

Post-operative patient surveys about mental health and quality-of-life, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory [[sexual attraction|sexual functioning]]. Furthermore, the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implant outcomes; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8 per cent of [[breast augmentation]] patients had a pre-operative history of psychiatric hospitalization.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen PH 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen PH, Hölmich LR, McLaughlin JK, Johansen C, Olsen JH, Kjøller K, Friis S | title = Mortality and suicide among Danish women with cosmetic breast implants | journal = Arch.

In 2008, the [[longitudinal study]] ''Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2007), reported that women who sought breast implants are almost 3 times as likely to commit [[suicide]] as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained constant until 10-years post-implantation, yet, it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death-risk from [[alcoholism]] and the abuse of prescription and recreational drugs.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0836919020070808?feedType=RSS&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Breast Implants Linked with Suicide in Study | date=2007-08-08 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140806/http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0836919020070808?feedType=RSS&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true | archivedate=2008-12-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-06-breast-implants_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Breast Implants Linked to Higher Suicide Rates | first=Anita | last=Manning | date=2007-08-06 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318150357/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-06-breast-implants_N.htm | archivedate=2011-03-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman's breast augmentation to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that breast augmentation surgery does not increase the death rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the [[psychopathology|psychopathologically]]-inclined woman who is more likely to undergo a [[breast augmentation]] procedure.&lt;ref name="pmid11306343"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brinton LA, Lubin JH, Burich MC, Colton T, Brown SL, Hoover RN | title = Cancer risk at sites other than the breast following augmentation mammoplasty | journal = Ann Epidemiol | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 248–56 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11306343 | doi = 10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00223-4| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12623911"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koot VC, Peeters PH, Granath F, Grobbee DE, Nyren O | title = Total and cause specific mortality among Swedish women with cosmetic breast implants: prospective study | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7388 | pages = 527–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12623911 | pmc = 150462 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7388.527 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14520056"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pukkala E, Kulmala I, Hovi SL, Hemminki E, Keskimäki I, Pakkanen M, Lipworth L, Boice JD, McLaughlin JK | title = Causes of death among Finnish women with cosmetic breast implants, 1971-2001 | journal = Ann Plast Surg | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–42; discussion 343–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14520056 | doi = 10.1097/01.sap.0000080407.97677.A5 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16777929"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villeneuve PJ, Holowaty EJ, Brisson J, Xie L, Ugnat AM, Latulippe L, Mao Y | title = Mortality among Canadian women with cosmetic breast implants | journal = Am.

The study ''Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis'' (2007), reported that the women attributed their improved [[self image]], [[self-esteem]], and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases that ranged from 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]], which data supported the 78.6 per cent increase in the woman's [[libido]], relative to her pre-operative level of libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/03/23/plastic-surgery-helps-self-esteem/703.html|title=Plastic Surgery Helps Self-Esteem|work=Psych Central.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619034928/http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/03/23/plastic-surgery-helps-self-esteem/703.html|archivedate=2010-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, before agreeing to any surgery, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman's [[mental health]] to determine if breast implants can positively affect her self-esteem and [[Sexual attraction|sexual functioning]].

==Surgical procedures==

===Indications===
A [[mammoplasty]] procedure for the placement of breast implant devices has three (3) purposes:

# primary reconstruction: the replacement of breast tissues damaged by trauma ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease ([[breast cancer]]), and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast deformity]]).
# revision and reconstruction: to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# primary augmentation: to aesthetically [[Breast augmentation|augment]] the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The [[operating room]] (OR) time of post–[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]], and of [[breast augmentation]] surgery is determined by the procedure employed, the type of incisions, the breast implant (type and materials), and the pectoral locale of the implant pocket.

Recent research has indicated that mammograms should not be done with any increased frequency than used in normal procedure in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast implant, augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reducation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |author1-link=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |date=24 April 2014 |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page= |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-plastic-surgeons/ |accessdate=25 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719103909/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-plastic-surgeons/ |archivedate=19 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incision types===
Breast implant emplacement is performed with five (5) types of surgical incisions:

# Inframammary: an incision made to the [[infra-mammary fold|inframammary fold]] (natural crease under your breast), which affords maximal access for precise dissection of the tissues and emplacement of the breast implants. It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because it better exposes the [[breast|breast tissue]]–[[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis muscle]] interface; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical [[scar]]s.
# Periareolar: a border-line incision along the periphery of the [[areola]], which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a [[mastopexy]] (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In periareolar emplacement, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola's circumference. Silicone gel implants can be difficult to emplace via periareolar incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0&amp;nbsp;cm) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola's border (periphery), they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae; when compared to cutaneous-incision scars, the modified [[epithelium|epithelia]] of the areolae are less prone to (raised) hypertrophic scars.
# Transaxillary: an incision made to the [[axilla]] (armpit), from which the dissection tunnels medially, to emplace the implants, either bluntly or with an [[endoscope]] (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; yet, it is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision.
# Transumbilical: a trans-umbilical breast augmentation ([[Trans-umbilical breast augmentation|TUBA]]) is a less common implant-device emplacement technique wherein the incision is at the umbilicus ([[navel]]), and the dissection tunnels superiorly, up towards the bust. The TUBA approach allows emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast proper; but makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly—without the endoscope's visual assistance—and is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell of the breast implant during its manual insertion through the short (~2.0&amp;nbsp;cm) incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson GW, Christ JE | title = The Endoscopic Breast augmentation: The Transumbilical Insertion of Saline-filled Breast Implants | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 92 | issue = 5 | pages = 801–8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8415961 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-199392050-00004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Transabdominal: as in the TUBA procedure, in the transabdominoplasty breast augmentation (TABA), the breast implants are tunneled superiorly from the abdominal incision into bluntly dissected implant pockets, whilst the patient simultaneously undergoes an [[abdominoplasty]].&lt;ref name="TABA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wallach SG | title = Maximizing the Use of the Abdominoplasty Incision | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 411–417 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14707667 | doi = 10.1097/01.PRS.0000091422.11191.1A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] approaches to emplacing a breast implant to the implant pocket are described in [[Human anatomy|anatomical]] relation to the [[pectoralis major muscle]].

# Subglandular: the breast implant is emplaced to the [[retromammary space]], between the [[Mammary gland|breast tissue]] (the mammary gland) and the [[pectoralis major muscle]] (major muscle of the chest), which most approximates the plane of normal breast tissue, and affords the most aesthetic results. Yet, in women with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the [[capsular contracture]] incidence rate is slightly greater with subglandular implantation.
# Subfascial: the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[fascia]] of the [[pectoralis major muscle]]; the subfascial position is a variant of the subglandular position for the breast implant.&lt;ref name="Graf"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graf RM, Bernardes A, Rippel R, Araujo LR, Damasio RC, Auersvald A | title = Subfascial Breast Implant: A New Procedure | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 904–908 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12560720 | doi = 10.1097/01.PRS.0000041601.59651.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical advantages of the subfascial implant-pocket technique are debated; proponent surgeons report that the layer of [[Fascia|fascial tissue]] provides greater implant coverage and better sustains its position.&lt;ref name="subfascial"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tebbetts JB | title = Does Fascia Provide Additional, Meaningful Coverage over a Breast Implant? | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 777–779 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14758271 | doi = 10.1097/01.PRS.0000104516.13465.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Subpectoral (dual plane): the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], after the surgeon releases the inferior muscular attachments, with or without partial dissection of the subglandular plane. Resultantly, the upper pole of the implant is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle, while the lower pole of the implant is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal coverage of the upper pole of the implant, whilst allowing the expansion of the implant's lower pole; however, “animation deformity”, the movement of the implants in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients.&lt;ref name="Tebbettsdual"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tebbetts JB | title = A System for Breast Implant Selection Based on Patient Tissue Characteristics and Implant-soft tissue Dynamics | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 109 | issue = 4 | pages = 1396–1409 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11964998 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-200204010-00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Submuscular: the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], without releasing the inferior origin of the muscle proper. Total muscular coverage of the implant can be achieved by releasing the lateral muscles of the chest wall—either the [[serratus muscle]] or the [[pectoralis minor muscle]], or both—and [[Surgical suture|suturing]] it, or them, to the pectoralis major muscle. In [[breast reconstruction]] surgery, the submuscular implantation approach effects maximal coverage of the breast implants. This technique is rarely used in cosmetic surgery due to high risk of animation deformities.

===Post-surgical recovery===
The [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] [[scar]]s of a [[breast augmentation]] [[mammoplasty]] develop approximately at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week post-operative. Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) usually have a longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because of the healing of the incisions to the chest muscles. Usually, she does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial post-operative recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, [[analgesic]] indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain&lt;ref name="pmid19083538"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacik PT, Nelson CE, Werner C | title = Pain control in augmentation mammaplasty: safety and efficacy of indwelling catheters in 644 consecutive patients | journal = Aesthet Surg J | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–84 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19083538 | doi = 10.1016/j.asj.2008.02.001 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19083591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacik PT, Nelson CE, Werner C | title = Pain control in augmentation mammaplasty using indwelling catheters in 687 consecutive patients: data analysis | journal = Aesthet Surg J | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 631–41 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19083591 | doi = 10.1016/j.asj.2008.09.001 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support brassières, or [[narcotic]] pain medication.&lt;ref name="pmid11964998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tebbetts JB | title = A system for breast implant selection based on patient tissue characteristics and implant-soft tissue dynamics | journal = Plast.

==Complications==
The [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgical]] emplacement of breast implant devices, either for [[breast reconstruction]] or for [[Plastic surgery|aesthetic purpose]], presents the same health risks common to [[surgery]], such as adverse reaction to [[anesthesia]], [[Breast hematoma|hematoma]] (post-operative bleeding), late hematoma (post-operative bleeding after 6 months or more),&lt;ref name="Grippaudo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grippaudo FR, Renzi L, Costantino B, Longo B, Santanelli F | title = Late unilateral hematoma after breast reconstruction with implants: case report and literature review | journal = Aesthetic Surgical Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 830–834 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23864111 | doi = 10.1177/1090820X13496249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[seroma]] (fluid accumulation), incision-site breakdown (wound infection).  Complications specific to breast augmentation include breast pain, altered sensation, impeded breast-feeding function, visible wrinkling, asymmetry, thinning of the breast tissue, and [[symmastia]], the “bread loafing” of the bust that interrupts the natural plane between the breasts. Specific treatments for the complications of indwelling breast implants—[[capsular contracture]] and capsular rupture—are periodic [[MRI]] monitoring and physical examinations. Furthermore, [[Complications (medical)|complications]] and re-operations related to the implantation surgery, and to [[Tissue expansion|tissue expanders]] (implant place-holders during surgery) can cause unfavorable [[scar]]ring in approximately 6–7 per cent of the patients.

===Implant rupture===
Because a breast implant is a [[Medical device|Class III medical device]] of limited product-life, the principal rupture-rate factors are its age and design; Nonetheless, a breast implant device can retain its mechanical integrity for decades in a woman's body.&lt;ref name="Brown2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown SL, Middleton MS, Berg WA, Soo MS, Pennello G | title = Prevalence of Rupture of Silicone gel Breast Implants Revealed on MR Imaging in a Population of Women in Birmingham, Alabama | journal = American Journal of Roentgenology | volume = 175 | issue = 4 | pages = 1057–1064 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11000165 | doi = 10.2214/ajr.175.4.1751057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, and thus can be readily explanted (surgically removed). The follow-up report, ''Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study'' (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.&lt;ref name="Walker2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker PS, Walls B, Murphy DK | title = Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study | journal = Aesthetic Surgery Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19233001 | doi = 10.1016/j.asj.2008.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ruptured implant.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A breast implant failure: the parts of a surgically explanted breast implant are the red, fibrous capsule (left), the ruptured silicone implant (center), and the transparent filler-gel that leaked with the capsule (right).]]

When a silicone breast implant ruptures it usually does not deflate, yet the filler gel does leak from it, which can migrate to the implant pocket; therefore, an intracapsular rupture (in-capsule leak) can become an extracapsular rupture (out-of-capsule leak), and each occurrence is resolved by explantation. Although the leaked silicone filler-gel can migrate from the chest tissues to elsewhere in the woman's body, most clinical [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] are limited to the [[breast]] and [[axilla|armpit]] areas, usually manifested as [[granuloma]]s (inflammatory nodules) and axillary [[lymphadenopathy]] (enlarged [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] in the armpit area).&lt;ref name="Holmich2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hölmich LR, Vejborg IM, Conrad C, Sletting S, Høier-Madsen M, Fryzek JP, McLaughlin JK, Kjøller K, Wiik A, Friis S | title = Untreated Silicone Breast Implant Rupture | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 204–214 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15220594 | doi = 10.1097/01.PRS.0000128821.87939.B5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Katzin 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Katzin WE, Centeno JA, Feng LJ, Kiley M, Mullick FG |title=Pathology of Lymph Nodes From Patients With Breast Implants: A Histologic and Spectroscopic Evaluation |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |year=2001 |pmid=15767806 |doi=10.1097/01.pas.0000155145.60670.e4 |url=http://www.ajsp.com/pt/re/ajsp/abstract.00000478-200504000-00013.htm;jsessionid=G3QMCQKJ6hM5VsXLk60GQByjJfkSq7rzMMVZwKbyvpwxmmZXrQpK!-1734750035!-949856144!8091!-1 |format=—&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3APathology+of+Lymph+Nodes+From+Patients+With+Breast+Implants%3A+A+Histologic+and+Spectroscopic+Evaluation&amp;as_publication=American+Journal+of+Surgical+Pathology&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524051708/http://www.ajsp.com/pt/re/ajsp/abstract.00000478-200504000-00013.htm%3Bjsessionid%3DG3QMCQKJ6hM5VsXLk60GQByjJfkSq7rzMMVZwKbyvpwxmmZXrQpK%21-1734750035%21-949856144%218091%21-1 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA_2004c&gt;{{cite web | title = Study of Rupture of Silicone Gel-filled Breast Implants (MRI Component) | work = FDA Breast Implant Consumer Handbook - 2004 | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/handbook2004/diseases.html | date = 2000-05-22 | accessdate = 2007-05-04 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070609134559/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/handbook2004/diseases.html | archivedate = 2007-06-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspected mechanisms of breast implant rupture are:
* damage during implantation
* damage during (other) surgical procedures
* chemical degradation of the breast implant shell
* trauma ([[blunt trauma]], [[penetrating trauma]], [[blast injury|blast trauma]])

The study ''Safety and Effectiveness of Mentor’s MemoryGel Implants at 6 Years'' (2009), which was a branch study of the U.S. FDA's core [[clinical trial]]s for primary [[breast augmentation]] surgery patients, reported low device-rupture rates of 1.1 per cent at 6-years post-implantation.&lt;ref name="cunningham2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cunningham B, McCue J | title = Safety and effectiveness of Mentor's MemoryGel implants at 6 years | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 440–444 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19437068 | doi = 10.1007/s00266-009-9364-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series of [[MRI]] evaluations of the silicone breast implants with thick filler-gel reported a device-rupture rate of 1 percent, or less, at the median 6-year device-age.&lt;ref name="Heden"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hedén P, Boné B, Murphy DK, Slicton A, Walker PS | title = Style 410 Cohesive Silicone Breast Implants: Safety and Effectiveness at 5 to 9 years after Implantation | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 6 | pages = 1281–1287 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17051096 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000239457.17721.5d }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, the manual examination (palpation) of the woman is inadequate for accurately evaluating if a breast implant has ruptured.

===Capsular contracture===
{{main|Capsular contracture}}
The human body's [[immune response]] to a surgically installed foreign object—breast implant, cardiac [[pacemaker]], [[orthopedic]] [[prosthesis]]—is to encapsulate it with [[Scar|scar tissue]] capsules of tightly woven [[collagen]] fibers, in order to maintain the integrity of the body by isolating the foreign object, and so tolerate its presence. [[Capsular contracture]]—which should be distinguished from normal capsular tissue—occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule thickens and compresses the breast implant; it is a painful [[Complication (medical)|complication]] that might distort either the breast implant, or the breast, or both.

[[Image:Capsular fibrosis.jpg|thumb|A breast implant failure: capsular contracture is a medical complication, in this case, a Baker scale Grade IV contraction, of a subglandular silicone implant in the right breast.]]

The cause of capsular contracture is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and [[hematoma]]. The surgical implantation procedures that have reduced the incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a textured surface (polyurethane-coated);&lt;ref name="Barnsley2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barnsley GP, Sigurdson LJ, Barnsley SE | title = Textured surface Breast Implants in the Prevention of Capsular Contracture among Breast Augmentation Patients: a Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 7 | pages = 2182–2190 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16772915 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000218184.47372.d5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong CH, Samuel M, Tan BK, Song C | title = Capsular Contracture in Subglandular Breast Augmentation with Textured versus Smooth Breast Implants: a Systematic Review | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1224–1236 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17016195 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000237013.50283.d2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HandelGut2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handel N, Gutierrez J | title = Long-term safety and efficacy of polyurethane foam-covered breast implants | journal = Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 265–274 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 19338905 | doi = 10.1016/j.asj.2006.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; limited pre-operative handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions.&lt;ref name="Mladick1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mladick RA | title = "No-touch" submuscular saline breast augmentation technique | journal = Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–192 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8213311 | doi = 10.1007/BF00636260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams WP, Rios JL, Smith SJ | title = Enhancing Patient Outcomes in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery using Triple Antibiotic Breast Irrigation: Six-year Prospective Clinical Study | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16404244 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000185671.51993.7e }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correction of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external [[medical ultrasound|ultrasonic]] therapy, [[leukotriene antagonist|leukotriene pathway inhibitors]] such as [[zafirlukast]] (Accolate) or [[montelukast]] (Singulair), and [[Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy|pulsed electromagnetic field therapy]] (PEMFT).&lt;ref name="Planas2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Planas J, Cervelli V, Planas G | title = Five-year experience on ultrasonic treatment of breast contractures | journal = Aesthetic Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–93 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11349308 | doi = 10.1007/s002660010102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlesinger SL, Ellenbogen R, Desvigne MN, Svehlak S, Heck R | title = Zafirlukast (Accolate): A new treatment for capsular contracture | journal = Aesthetic Plast Surg. | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–36 | year = 2002 | pmid = 19331987 | doi = 10.1067/maj.2002.126753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scuderi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scuderi N, Mazzocchi M, Fioramonti P, Bistoni G | title = The effects of zafirlukast on capsular contracture: preliminary report | journal = Aesthetic Plast Surg. | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–520 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16977359 | doi = 10.1007/s00266-006-0038-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silver1982"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Silver H | title = Reduction of capsular contracture with two-stage augmentation mammaplasty and pulsed electromagnetic energy (Diapulse therapy) | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 802–805 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7071225 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-198205000-00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repair and revision surgeries===
When the patient is unsatisfied with the outcome of the augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life, it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. Common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, [[capsular contracture]], shell rupture, and device deflation.&lt;ref name = FDA_2004b /&gt; Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the [[human anatomy|anatomical]] borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name = FDA_2004b /&gt; Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, [[breast cancer]] patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient's pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3 percent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref name="Tebbets2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tebbetts JB | title = Out Points Criteria for Breast Implant Removal without Replacement and Criteria to Minimize Reoperations following Breast Augmentation | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 114 | issue = 5 | pages = 1258&amp;ndash;1262 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 15457046 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000136802.91357.cf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tebbets2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tebbetts JB | title = Achieving a Zero Percent Reoperation Rate at 3 years in a 50-consecutive-case Augmentation Mammaplasty Premarket Approval Study | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 6 | pages = 1453&amp;ndash;7 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17051118 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000239602.99867.07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systemic Illness and ALCL Cancer ==
[[Image:BreastImplant09.JPG|thumb|Chest X-ray showing breast implants]]

===Claims of Systemic disease and sickness===
Since the early 1990s, a number of independent systemic comprehensive reviews have examined studies concerning links between silicone gel breast implants and claims of systemic diseases. The consensus of these reviews (outlined below under Safety of Breast Implants heading) is that there has been no evidence of a causal link between the implantation of saline or silicone breast implants and systemic disease After investigating this issue, the U.S. FDA has concurred and since reaffirmed that “the weight of the epidemiological evidence published in the literature does not support an association between fibromyalgia and breast implants.”. A comprehensive systemic review by Lipworth (2011) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21369953]&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that "any claims that remain regarding an association between cosmetic breast implants and CTDs are not supported by the scientific literature".

===Platinum toxicity===
[[Platinum]] is a catalyst used in the making of silicone implant polymer shells and other silicone devices used in medicine. The literature indicates that small amounts of platinum leaches (leaks) from these implants and is present in the surrounding tissue. The FDA reviewed the available studies from the medical literature on platinum and breast implants in 2002 and concluded there was little evidence suggesting toxicity from platinum in implant patients.&lt;ref&gt;
Arepelli S; et al. (2002). "Allergic reactions to platinum in silicone breast implants". J Long-Term Effects Medical Implants. 12 (4): 299–306. {{PMID|12627791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA revisited this study and additional literature several years later, reaffirming prior conclusions that platinum catalysts used in implants is likely not ionized and therefore would not represent a risk to women. &lt;ref name="FDA Backgrounder on Platinum in breast implants"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/platinum.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaplastic large cell lymphoma===
The FDA has identified that breast implants may be associated with a rare form of cancer called [[anaplastic large-cell lymphoma]],  believed to be associated with chronic bacterial inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm547622.htm|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Breast Implants: Update - Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|date=|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428170514/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm547622.htm|archivedate=28 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ALCL phenomena have been seen with other types of medical implants including vascular access ports, orthopedic hip implants, and jaw (TMJ) implants. As of February 1, 2017, the FDA has received a total of 359 medical device reports of breast-implant-associated ALCL (BIALCL), including 9 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm481899.htm?source=govdelivery|title=Breast Implants - Medical Device Reports of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|last=Health|date=|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428170514/https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm481899.htm?source=govdelivery|archivedate=28 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases of breast implant-associated ALCL had implants in for many years prior to the condition, and are usually treated successfully by simple removal of the implant and the capsule surrounding the implant without the need for chemotherapy if no evidence of systemic disease exists. If women with implants present with delayed swelling or fluid collection, cytologic studies and test for a marker "CD30" are suggested. The American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) states, "CD30 is the main diagnostic test that must be performed on the seroma fluid as routine pathology or H&amp;E staining can frequently miss the diagnosis." &lt;ref name="plasticsurgery.org"&gt;Clemens, Mark. "[https://www.plasticsurgery.org/for-medical-professionals/quality-and-registries/bia-alcl-by-the-numbers Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326231741/https://www.plasticsurgery.org/for-medical-professionals/quality-and-registries/bia-alcl-by-the-numbers |date=2017-03-26 }}" (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagnosis and treatment of breast implant associated ALCL now follows standardized guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens|first=Mark W.|last2=Horwitz|first2=Steven M.|date=2017-03-01|title=NCCN Consensus Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pages=285–289|doi=10.1093/asj/sjw259|issn=1527-330X|pmid=28184418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current lifetime risk of BIA-ALCL in the U.S. is unknown, but estimates have ranged between estimated to be between 1 in 70,000 to 1 in 500,000 women with breast implants according to MD Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma-facts.html|title=Implant-associated ALCL Facts {{!}} The MD Anderson Foundation|website=www.mdanderson.org|accessdate=2017-12-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209152413/https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma-facts.html|archivedate=2017-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain geographic locations have demonstrated variable risks. For instance, a December 2016 update from the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia and New Zealand reported a risk of '''1:1,000 to 1:10,000 for textured implants."'''.&lt;ref name="plasticsurgery.org"/&gt; To date (2017), there has not been a case of BIAL reported where the patient had only implantation of smooth shell breast implants or a textured tissue expander that was exchanged for a smooth implant. The paucity of cases reported in Asian populations has raised the possibility that there may be a range of genetic susceptibility to the phenomena, or alternatively merely reflect differences in how cases are identified and reported.

The ASPS and the Plastic Surgery Foundation (PSF) have partnered with the FDA to study this condition and in doing so created the Patient Registry and Outcomes For breast Implants and anaplastic large cell Lymphoma Etiology and epidemiology (PROFILE).  The United States FDA strongly encourages all physicians to report cases to PROFILE in an effort to better understand the role of breast implants in ALCL and the management of this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepsf.org/research/clinical-impact/profile.htm|title=Breast Implant Associated ALCL: PROFILE Project {{!}} The Plastic Surgery Foundation|website=www.thepsf.org|access-date=2017-04-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507235532/http://www.thepsf.org/research/clinical-impact/profile.htm|archivedate=2017-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implants and breast-feeding==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|Cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]. {{ordered list |1=[[Chest wall]] |2=[[Pectoralis muscle]]s |3=[[Lobules]] |4=[[Nipple]] |5=[[Areola]] |6=[[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] |7=[[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] |8=[[Human skin|Skin envelope]]}}]]

The presence of breast implants currently presents no contraindication to breast feeding, and no evidence to support that the practice may present health issues to a breast feeding infant is recognized by the USFDA.

Women with breast implants may have functional breast-feeding difficulties; mammoplasty procedures that feature periareolar incisions are especially likely to cause breast-feeding difficulties. Surgery may also damage the lactiferous ducts and the nerves in the nipple-areola area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llli.org/NB/NBsurgery.html Breastfeeding after Breast Surgery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230173437/http://www.llli.org/NB/NBsurgery.html |date=2010-12-30 }}, La Leche League, contains references.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llli.org/cbi/bibimplant.html Breastfeeding and Breast Implants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231121338/http://www.llli.org/cbi/bibimplant.html |date=2010-12-31 }}, Selected Bibliography April 2003, LLLI Center for Breastfeeding Information&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2238096/ Inorganic Milk: Can Kendra Wilkinson breast-feed her baby even though she has implants?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125010657/http://www.slate.com/id/2238096 |date=2010-01-25 }}, Christopher Beam, [[Slate.com]], 11 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional breast-feeding difficulties arise if the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, or if the milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common if the incisions cut tissue near the nipple. The milk glands are most likely to be affected by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, it is impossible to predict whether a woman who undergoes breast augmentation will be able to successfully breast feed since some women are able to breast-feed after periareolar incisions and subglandular placement and some are not able to after augmentation using submuscular and other types of surgical incisions.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

==Implants and mammography==
The presence of [[radiology|radiologically]] opaque breast implants (either saline or silicone) might interfere with the radiographic sensitivity of the [[mammograph]], that is, the image might not show any tumor(s) present.  In this case, an Eklund view mammogram is required to ascertain either the presence or the absence of a cancerous tumor, wherein the breast implant is manually displaced against the chest wall and the breast is pulled forward, so that the mammograph can visualize a greater volume of the internal tissues; nonetheless, approximately one-third of the breast tissue remains inadequately visualized, resulting in an increased incidence of mammograms with false-negative results.&lt;ref name="Handel1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handel N, Silverstein MJ, Gamagami P, Jensen JA, Collins A | title = Factors Affecting Mammographic Visualization of the Breast after Augmentation Mammaplasty | journal = JAMA | volume = 268 | issue = 14 | pages = 1913–1917 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1404718 | doi = 10.1001/jama.268.14.1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breast implant has no clinical bearing upon [[lumpectomy]] breast-conservation surgery for women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular [[contracture]].&lt;ref name="Scwartz2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz GF, Veronesi U, Clough KB, Dixon JM, Fentiman IS, Heywang-Köbrunner SH, Holland R, Hughes KS, Mansel RE, Margolese R, Mendelson EB, Olivotto IA, Palazzo JP, Solin LJ | title = Consensus Conference on Breast Conservation | journal = JACAS | volume = 203 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–207 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16864033 | doi = 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2006.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies'', reported an average later stage in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation, although this did not ultimately affect the patients prognosis.

==U.S. FDA approval==
In 1988, twenty-six years after the 1962 introduction of breast implants filled with silicone gel, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) investigated breast implant failures and the subsequent [[Complications (medical)|complications]], and re-classified breast implant devices as Class III medical devices, and required from manufacturers the documentary data substantiating the safety and efficacy of their breast implant devices.&lt;ref name="FDABICH"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/indexbip.html FDA Breast Implant Consumer Handbook - 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917223436/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/indexbip.html |date=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the FDA placed silicone-gel breast implants in moratorium in the U.S., because there was “inadequate information to demonstrate that breast implants were safe and effective”. Nonetheless, medical access to silicone-gel breast implant devices continued for clinical studies of post-mastectomy [[breast reconstruction]], the correction of congenital deformities, and the replacement of ruptured silicone-gel implants. The FDA required from the manufacturers the clinical trial data, and permitted their providing breast implants to the [[breast augmentation]] patients for the statistical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt; In mid–1992, the FDA approved an adjunct study protocol for silicone-gel filled implants for breast reconstruction patients, and for revision-surgery patients. Also in 1992, the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], a silicone products and breast implant manufacturer, announced the discontinuation of five implant-grade [[silicone]]s, but would continue producing 45 other, medical-grade, silicone materials—three years later, in 1995, the Dow Corning Corporation went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] when it faced large class action lawsuits claiming a variety of illnesses.&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt;

* In 1997, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) appointed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to investigate the potential risks of operative and post-operative [[Complication (medical)|complications]] from the emplacement of silicone breast implants. The IOM's review of the safety and efficacy of silicone gel-filled breast implants, reported that the "evidence suggests diseases or conditions, such as [[Cartilage|connective tissue]] diseases, [[cancer]], neurological diseases, or other systemic complaints or conditions are no more common in women with breast implants, than in women without implants" subsequent studies and systemic review found no causal link between silicone breast implants and disease.&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt;
[[File:Seal of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.svg|thumb|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services verifies the scientific, medical, and clinical data of medical devices.]]
* In 1998, the U.S. FDA approved adjunct study protocols for silicone-gel filled implants only for breast reconstruction patients and for revision-surgery patients; and also approved the Dow Corning Corporation's Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study for silicone-gel breast implants for a limited number of breast augmentation-, reconstruction-, and revision-surgery patients.&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt;
* In 1999, the Institute of Medicine published the ''Safety of Silicone Breast Implants'' (1999) study that reported no evidence that saline-filled and silicone-gel filled breast implant devices caused systemic health problems; that their use posed no new health or safety risks; and that local complications are “the primary safety issue with silicone breast implants”, in distinguishing among routine and local medical complications and systemic health concerns.”&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9602.html|title=Safety of Silicone Breast Implants - The National Academies Press|work=nap.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119070548/http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9602.html|archivedate=2008-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9618.html|title=Information for Women about the Safety of Silicone Breast Implants - The National Academies Press|authors=Martha Grigg, Stuart Bondurant, Virginia L.

* In 2006, for the Inamed Corporation and for the Mentor Corporation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted its restrictions against using silicone-gel breast implants for breast reconstruction and for augmentation mammoplasty. Yet, the approval was conditional upon accepting FDA monitoring, the completion of 10-year-mark studies of the women who already had the breast implants, and the completion of a second, 10-year-mark study of the safety of the breast implants in 40,000 other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01512.html |title=FDA Approves Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants |accessdate=2008-07-01 |publisher=FDA |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726061002/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01512.html |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA warned the public that breast implants do carry medical risks, and recommended that women who undergo [[breast augmentation]] should periodically undergo [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] examinations to screen for signs of either shell rupture or of filler leakage, or both conditions; and ordered that breast surgery patients be provided with detailed, informational brochures explaining the medical risks of using silicone-gel breast implants.&lt;ref name="FDABICH" /&gt;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration established the age ranges for women seeking breast implants; for breast reconstruction, silicone-gel filled implants and saline-filled implants were approved for women of all ages; for breast augmentation, saline implants were approved for women 18 years of age and older; silicone implants were approved for women 22 years of age and older.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm#4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112214319/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm |date=2010-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each breast implant device entails different medical risks, the minimum age of the patient for saline breast implants is different from the minimum age of the patient for silicone breast implants—because of the filler leakage and silent shell-rupture risks; thus, periodic [[MRI]] screening examinations are the recommended post-operative, follow-up therapy for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm#5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112214319/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm |date=2010-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, in Europe and Oceania, the national health ministries' breast implant policies do not endorse periodic MRI screening of asymptomatic patients, but suggest palpation proper—with or without an [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] screening—to be sufficient post-operative therapy for most patients.

==Safety of Breast Implants==
In the early 1990s, the national health ministries of the listed countries reviewed the pertinent studies for causal links among silicone-gel breast implants and systemic and auto-immune diseases. The collective conclusion is that there is no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease.  The Danish study ''Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants'' (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were no more likely to report an excessive number of [[rheumatic disease]] symptoms than would the women of the control group.&lt;ref name="Breiting2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Breiting VB, Hölmich LR, Brandt B, Fryzek JP, Wolthers MS, Kjøller K, McLaughlin JK, Wiik A, Friis S | title = Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 217–226 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15220596 | doi = 10.1097/01.PRS.0000128823.77637.8A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up study ''Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update'' (2006) reported a decreased [[standardized mortality ratio]] and an increased risk of [[lung cancer]] death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to [[tobacco smoking]].&lt;ref name="Brinton2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brinton LA, Lubin JH, Murray MC, Colton T, Hoover RN | title = Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 162&amp;ndash;9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16477256 | doi = 10.1097/01.ede.0000197056.84629.19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.&lt;ref name="Villenueve2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villeneuve PJ, Holowaty EJ, Brisson J, Xie L, Ugnat AM, Latulippe L, Mao Y | title = Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 164 | issue = 4 | pages = 334–341 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16777929 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwj214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copy Generation Management System – Analog''' ('''CGMS-A''') is a [[copy protection]] mechanism for [[analog signal|analog]] [[television]] signals. It consists of a waveform inserted into the non-picture [[Vertical Blanking Interval]] (VBI) of an analogue video signal. If a compatible recording device (for example, a [[DVD recorder]]) detects this waveform, it may block or restrict recording of the video content.

It is not the same as the [[broadcast flag]], which is designed for use in [[digital television]] signals, although the concept is the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techdirt.com/articles/20080529/0258571254.shtml Techdirt: Microsoft: It's Not The Broadcast Flag, It's A Different Flag]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a digital form of CGMS specified as CGMS-D which is required by the [[Digital Transmission Content Protection|DTCP]] ("5C") protection standard.

== History ==
CGMS-A has been in existence since 1995, and has been standardized by various organizations including the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and EIA/[[Consumer Electronics Association|CEA]]. It is used in devices such as PVRs/DVRs, [[DVD]] players and recorders, [[D-VHS]], and [[Blu-ray]] recorders, as well certain television broadcasts. More recent [[TiVo]] firmware releases comply with CGMS-A signals.

== Applications ==
Implementation of CGMS-A is required for certain applications by [[DVD CCA]] license. [[D-VHS]] and some [[DVD recorder]]s comply with CGMS-A signal on analog inputs. The technology requires minimal signal processing.

Where the source signal is analogue (e.g. VHS, analogue broadcast), the CGMS-A signalling may be present in that source.

Where the source signal is digital (e.g. DVD, digital broadcast), then the Copy Control Information (CCI) is carried in metadata in the digital transport or program stream, and a compliant hardware device (e.g. a DVD player) will read that data, and encode it into the analogue video signal generated within the device itself.

There is no blanket legal requirement for devices which record video to detect or act upon the CGMS-A information. For example, the DMCA "does not require manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications or computing equipment to design their products affirmatively to respond to any particular technological measure.".&lt;ref&gt;THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1998

== Standardization ==
CGMS-A is standardized through the IEC, CEA, EIA-J and ETSI as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Video Format !! Standard !! Line number(s) !! Bit number(s) !! Type
|-
| 480i60 (525i / "NTSC") || IEC-61880 || 20, 283 || 7, 8 || ''A''
|-
| 480i60 (525i / "NTSC") || CEA-608 || 284 || 4, 3 || –
|-
| 480p60 (525p) || EIA-J CPR1204-1 || 41 || – || ''A''
|-
| 480p60 (525p) || IEC-61880-2 || 41 || 7, 8 || ''A''
|-
| 480p60 (525p) || CEA-805 || 41 || 7, 8 || A
|-
| 480p60 (525p) || CEA-805 || 40 || 38 (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), 39 (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) || B
|-
| 720p60 || CEA-805 || 24 || 7, 8 || A
|-
| 720p60 || CEA-805 || 23 || 38 (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), 39 (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) || B
|-
| 1080i60 || CEA-805 || 19, 582 || 7, 8 || A
|-
| 1080i60 || CEA-805 || 18, 581 || 38 (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), 39 (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) || B
|-
| 576i50 (625i / "PAL") || EN-300-294 || 23 || 12, 13 || –
|-
| 576p50 (625p) || IEC-62375 || 43 || 12, 13 || –
|}

In all these standards, the CGMS-A information is only two out of many bits of information that are defined.

'''On 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems''' (commonly known as "NTSC"), the system is highly extensible, though beyond the CGMS-A bits, only the aspect ratio of the video signal and the analogue protection system (APS) bits are commonly used. The signalling is typically present on every video frame, but CEA-805-D states that "the transmission rate for any given packet type defined in CEA-805-D shall be at least once every three frames", meaning that in theory for two out of three frames, different header values can be used to send data not defined in the standard. Type A signalling (20 bits in total; the only type defined for 480i) offers some extensibility by re-using the 14 data bits via one of the 14 undefined values for the four header bits. Type B signalling (134 bits in total) already defines bits to carry an [[Active Format Descriptor]], [[Colorimetry]], [[Redistribution Control]], and a pixel-accurate definition of the location of any [[letterbox]] or [[pillarbox]] bars in the image, plus two bytes reserved for future use. Different header bit values may also be used for further extensibility.

'''On 50&amp;nbsp;Hz systems''' (commonly, though incorrectly known as "PAL"), the bits that are widely used and interpreted as CGMS-A are not named as such, and are added at the end of an existing signalling standard originally created for the [[PALplus]] video format (but still in common use in Europe in standard PAL video) called [[Widescreen signaling]].

===Contradicting Type A standards===

Some references quote EIA-J CPR1204-1 as the authoritative reference for CGMS-A on 480p60 (525p) systems, since this was the first published standard to mention CGMS-A on 480p. This EIA-J document does not define the meaning of the bits, only their timing on the analogue video signal. The 480p signalling is based on the existing 480i standard but with a double speed clock, and IEC-61880-2 formalises this by defining bit meanings which are the same as for 480i. However, CEA-805 re-defines the aspect ratio signalling bits. Hence 480p Type A line 40 CGMMS-A data generated in accordance with CEA-805 cannot signal the aspect ratio of the video image, and in this way is incompatible with the same data generated in accordance with IEC-61880-2, and is no longer a straight "double speed clock" version of the 480i standard.

===CEA-805 CGMS-A Type B confusion===

CEA-805 is now on its fourth major version (CEA-805-D), and there have been errata issued to at least one version. CEA-805-D recognises that, in respect of Type B signalling, earlier versions of the standard were unclear regarding the ''order'' of bits as represented in the analogue video signal vs as used for the CRC calculation, and also ''which'' bits were to be used for the CRC calculation. Issue D requires sink devices to perform multiple CRC calculations for Type B signalling, taking account of various possible implementations in source devices. There is no such confusion surrounding Type A signalling.

== Signalling ==
CEA-608-B specifies meaning of the 7-bit field placed on the data lines. The bits 4 and 3 contain the CGMS-A values, the bits 2 and 1 contain the [[Analog Protection System]] (APS) value, the bit 0 is the [[Analog Source Bit]] (ASB) specifying if the signal originates from a pre-recorded material, bits 5 and 6 are reserved.

CGMS-A is signalled by 2 bits in the [[vertical blanking interval]] (VBI) signal of analog television broadcasts according to the following matrix:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"
|-
| 0
| 0
| CopyFreely
| Unlimited copies may be made of the content.
|-
| 0
| 1
| CopyNoMore*
| One generation of copies has already been made; no further copying is allowed.
|-
| 1
| 0
| CopyOnce
| One generation of copies may be made
|-
| 1
| 1
| CopyNever
| No copies may be made of the content.
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;CopyNoMore was not a part of the original standard. The 0,1 value originally was "Reserved".

== Removal ==
The signal itself can be easily stripped by normalizing the VBI, e.g. using a video stabilizer to counter the side effects from [[Macrovision]]'s manipulation of the VBI. CGMS-A VBI data is commingled or generally near captioning signals, so removal of CGMS-A will likely remove captioning as well.

The scheme can be made more robust by adding the [[Rights Assertion Mark]] (RAM); when the RAM is present but CGMS-A is not, copying is denied, turning the scheme into a permission-based one. The RAM can be encoded by using the [[Video Encoded Invisible Light|VEIL]] technology.

'''Carbon filtering''' is a method of filtering that uses a bed of [[ activated carbon ]] to remove contaminants and impurities, using chemical adsorption.

Each particle, or granule, of carbon provides a large surface area, or pore structure, allowing contaminants the maximum possible exposure to the active sites within the filter media. One gram of activated carbon has a surface area in excess of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft).

Activated carbon works via a process called [[adsorption]], whereby pollutant molecules in the fluid to be treated are trapped inside the pore structure of the carbon substrate.  Carbon filtering is commonly used for [[water purification]], [[air filter|air filtering]] and industrial gas processing, for example the removal of [[siloxane]]s and [[hydrogen sulfide]] from [[biogas]].  It is also used in a number of other applications, including respirator masks, the purification of [[sugarcane]] and in the recovery of precious metals, especially gold. It is also used in [[cigarette filter]]s.

Active charcoal carbon filters are most effective at removing chlorine, particles such as sediment, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), taste and odor from water.  They are not effective at removing minerals, salts, and dissolved inorganic substances.

Typical particle sizes that can be removed by carbon filters range from 0.5 to 50 micrometres. The particle size will be used as part of the filter description. The efficacy of a carbon filter is also based upon the flow rate regulation.  When the water is allowed to flow through the filter at a slower rate, the contaminants are exposed to the filter media for a longer amount of time.

== Hydrogen production ==
For small-scale [[Hydrogen production|production of hydrogen]], water purifiers are installed to prevent formation of minerals on the surface of the electrodes and to remove organics and chlorine from utility water. First the water passes through a 20 micrometer interference (mesh or screen filter) filter to remove sand and dust particles, second, a charcoal filter ([[activated carbon]]) to remove organics and [[chlorine]], third stage, a [[Deionized water|de-ionizing filter]] to remove metallic ions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A test can be done before and after the filter for proper functioning on [[barium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], and [[silicon]].

It was intended to be adopted by telecommunications companies for voice transmission. It can encipher and decipher messages. It was part of a Clinton Administration program to “allow Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials the ability to decode intercepted voice and data transmissions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; “Each clipper chip ha[d] a unique serial number and a secret ‘unit key,’ programmed into the chip when manufactured."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This way, each device was meant to be different from the next. [[File:MYK-78 Clipper chip markings.jpg|thumb|MYK-78 "Clipper chip"]]
It was announced in 1993 and by 1996 was entirely defunct.

== Key escrow ==
The Clipper chip used a data encryption [[algorithm]] called [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]]&lt;ref name="Skyjack"/&gt; to transmit information and the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]-algorithm to distribute the cryptokeys between the peers. Skipjack was invented by the [[National Security Agency]] of the U.S. Government; this algorithm was initially [[Classified information in the United States|classified]] SECRET, which prevented it from being subjected to [[peer review]] from the encryption research community. The government did state that it used an [[key size|80-bit key]], that the algorithm was [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]], and that it was similar to the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] algorithm. The Skipjack algorithm was declassified and published by the NSA on June 24, 1998. The initial cost of the chips was said to be $16 (unprogrammed) or $26 (programmed), with its logic designed by [[Mykotronx]], and fabricated by [[VLSI Technology, Inc]] (see the VLSI logo on the image on this page).

At the heart of the concept was [[key escrow]]. In the factory, any new telephone or other device with a Clipper chip would be given a [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]], that would then be provided to the government in [[escrow]]. If government agencies "established their authority" to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone. The newly formed [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] preferred the term "key surrender" to emphasize what they alleged was really occurring.&lt;ref name="cryptomuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/clipper.htm|title=Clipper Chip|publisher=cryptomuseum.com|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinton Administration ==
The Clinton Administration argued that the Clipper chip was essential for law enforcement to keep up with the constantly progressing technology in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While many believed that the device would act as an additional way for terrorists to receive information, the Clinton Administration said it would actually increase national security.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html?pagewanted=all|title=Battle of the Clipper Chip|last=Levy|first=Steven|date=June 12, 1994|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that because “terrorists would have to use it to communicate with outsiders — banks, suppliers, and contacts — the Government could listen in on those calls.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Organizations such as the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] challenged the Clipper chip proposal, saying that it would have the effect not only of subjecting citizens to increased and possibly illegal government [[surveillance]], but that the strength of the Clipper chip's encryption could not be evaluated by the public as its design was classified secret, and that therefore individuals and businesses might be hobbled with an insecure communications system. Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout the world and into the United States, negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially damaging U.S. manufacturers en route. Then-Senators [[John Ashcroft]] and [[John Kerry]] were opponents of the Clipper chip proposal, arguing in favor of the individual's right to encrypt messages and export encryption software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techlawjournal.com/cong106/encrypt/Default.htm Summary of Encryption Bills in the 106th Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

The release and development of several strong cryptographic software packages such as [[Nautilus (secure telephone)|Nautilus]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html Philip Zimmermann - Why I Wrote PGP (Part of the Original 1991 PGP User's Guide (updated in 1999))]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PGPfone]] was in response to the government push for the Clipper chip. The thinking was that if strong cryptography was freely available on the internet as an alternative, the government would be unable to stop its use.

[[File:MYK-78 Clipper Chip.jpg|thumb|MYK-78]]
In 1994, [[Matt Blaze]] published the paper ''Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard''.&lt;ref name=Blaze&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mattblaze.org/papers/eesproto.pdf |title=Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard |first=Matt |last=Blaze |date=August 20, 1994 |work=Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security |pages=59-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It pointed out that the Clipper's escrow system has a serious vulnerability: the chip transmitted a 128-bit "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF) that contained the information necessary to recover the encryption key. To prevent the software that transmitted the message from tampering with the LEAF, a 16-bit [[cryptographic hash|hash]] was included. The Clipper chip would not decode messages with an invalid hash; however, the 16-bit hash was too short to provide meaningful security. A [[brute-force attack]] would quickly produce another LEAF value that would give the same hash but not yield the correct keys after the escrow attempt. This would allow the Clipper chip to be used as an encryption device, while disabling the key escrow capability.&lt;ref name=Blaze/&gt;{{rp|63}} In 1995 Yair Frankel and [[Moti Yung]] published another attack which is inherent to the design and which shows that the key escrow device tracking and authenticating capability (namely, the LEAF) of one device, can be attached to messages coming from another device and will nevertheless be received, thus bypassing the escrow in real time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Q-6qCAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA222&amp;ots=TWgiD_DVlp&amp;sig=yjqTOoEdjChOVSo0JS5WKX0mOqs#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Y. Frankel and M. Yung. Escrow Encryption Systems Visited: Attacks, Analysis and Designs. Crypto 95 Proceedings, August 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a group of leading cryptographers published a paper, "The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption", analyzing the architectural vulnerabilities of implementing key escrow systems in general, including but not limited to the Clipper chip Skipjack protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A127127 The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption]&lt;/ref&gt; The technical flaws described in this paper were instrumental in the demise of the Clipper chip as a public policy option.{{citation needed|reason=Article previously states that the chip was defunct by 1996, one year earlier than this article |date=July 2015}}  While many leading voices in the computer science community expressed opposition to the Clipper chip and key recovery in general, some supported the concept, including [[Dorothy E. Denning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://encryption_policies.tripod.com/us/denning_0795_clipper.htm |title=The Case for Clipper (Clipper Chip offers escrowed encryption) |first=Dorothy E. |last=Denning |work=[[MIT Technology Review]] |date=July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of adoption ==
The Clipper chip was not embraced by consumers or manufacturers and the chip itself was no longer relevant by 1996. The U.S. government continued to press for [[key escrow]] by offering incentives to manufacturers, allowing more relaxed export controls if key escrow were part of cryptographic software that was exported. These attempts were largely made moot by the widespread use of strong cryptographic technologies, such as [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], which were not under the control of the U.S. government.

However, strongly encrypted voice channels are still not the predominant mode for current cell phone communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/by-cracking-cellphone-code-nsa-has-capacity-for-decoding-private-conversations/2013/12/13/e119b598-612f-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=By cracking cellphone code, NSA has ability to decode private conversations |date=December 13, 2013 |first1=Craig |last1=Timberg |first2=Ashkan |last2=Soltani |accessdate=August 18, 2015 |quote=More than 80 percent of cellphones worldwide use weak or no encryption for at least some of their calls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secure cell phone devices and [[smartphone]] apps exist, but may require specialized hardware, and typically require that both ends of the connection employ the same encryption mechanism. Such apps usually communicate over secure Internet pathways (e.g. [[ZRTP]]) instead of through phone voice data networks.

== Later related debates ==
Following the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|Snowden disclosures]] from 2013, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] announced that they would lock down all data stored on their smartphones with encryption, in such a way that Apple and Google themselves could not break the encryption even if ordered to do so with a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone.html&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted a strong reaction from the authorities, with one of the more iconic responses being the chief of detectives for Chicago’s police department stating that "Apple['s [[iPhone]]] will become the phone of choice for the [[Think of the children|pedophile]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2014/09/25/68c4e08e-4344-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|title=FBI blasts Apple, Google for locking police out of phones|website=The Washington Post|author=Craig Timberg and Greg Miller|date=25 Sep 2014|accessdate=1 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington Post posted an editorial insisting that "smartphone users must accept that they cannot be above the law if there is a valid search warrant", and after agreeing that backdoors would be undesirable, suggested implementing a "golden key" backdoor which would unlock the data with a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/compromise-needed-on-smartphone-encryption/2014/10/03/96680bf8-4a77-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html|title=Compromise needed on smartphone encryption|website=The Washington Post|author=Editorial Board|date=3 Oct 2014|accessdate=1 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141006/01082128740/washington-posts-braindead-editorial-phone-encryption-no-backdoors-how-about-magical-golden-key.shtml|title=Washington Post's Clueless Editorial On Phone Encryption: No Backdoors, But How About A Magical 'Golden Key'?|publisher=Tech Dirt|author=Mike Masnick|date=6 Oct 2014|accessdate=1 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of "The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption" 1997 paper, as well as other researchers at MIT, wrote a follow-up article in response to the revival of this debate, arguing that mandated government access to private conversations would be an even worse problem now than twenty years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/97690 |title=Keys Under Doormats: Mandating insecurity by requiring government access to all data and communications |first1=Harold |last=Abelson |display-authors=etal |date=July 6, 2015 |publisher=MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cylinder manifold''' is a group of large [[gas cylinders]], commonly used to supply gases via a pipeline to a building such as a hospital. Cylinders are often arranged into two groups; a primary and secondary group. In a hospital, size J cylinders are commonly used, which are capable of holding 6800 litres of oxygen each or 13,600 of nitrous oxide. 

Initially, the gas is used up from the primary group first, with gas being expended equally from all cylinders, as they are connected in parallel through a common outlet. Once the levels in the cylinders are sufficiently low, a pressure transducer switches to the secondary manifold; allowing the primary manifold to be replenished. Manifolds are used to supply [[nitrous oxide]], [[Entonox]], air or oxygen; although a [[vacuum insulated evaporator]] is more commonly used to store oxygen.

Gas manifolds should be stored in an area separate from the main building. It should not be exposed to the environment and should be well ventilated.

'''Czech Technical University in Prague''' ('''CTU''', {{lang-cs|České vysoké učení technické v Praze, ČVUT}}) is one of the largest [[university|universities]] in the Czech Republic, and is one of the oldest institutes of technology in [[Central Europe]]. It is also the oldest non-military technical university in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==History==
[[File:CTU founding decree.jpg|left|thumb|The founding decree of the Czech Technical University, ratified by [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor]]; January 18, 1707]]
It was established as the Institute of Engineering Education in 1707, but not as a tertiary university but only [[secondary education]] (high school), by [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph I]]&lt;ref name="1808 Rescript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvut.cz/en/history/rescript |title=Rescript of the Emperor Joseph I |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005023043/http://www.cvut.cz/en/history/rescript |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a response to Christian Josef Willenberg's petition addressed to preceding emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]]. In 1806 the institute of Engineering Education was transformed into '''Prague Polytechnical Institute''' (or '''Prague Polytechnic'''), when the university studies began. After the disintegration of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the name of the school was changed in 1920 to the Czech Technical University in Prague.

===Origins===
In 1705, {{Interlanguage link multi|Christian Josef Willenberg|de}} asked Emperor Leopold I for permission to teach "the art of engineering". Later, the emperor's only son, who succeeded him on the throne in 1707 as [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], ordered the Czech state of Prague to provide engineering education. Due to various reasons the request was avoided long periods of time but in October 1716 Willenberg repeated the request and finally on 9 November 1717 a decree by the Czech state granted Willenberg the [[professor]]ship (first engineering professorship in [[Central Europe]]) and on 7 January 1718 he began teaching. Initially, Willenberg started teaching only 12 students in his own apartment (six [[baron]]s , four [[knight]]s and two [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burghers]]), but gradually students proliferated (in 1779 there were around 200) and they started studying in more suitable premises. Initially, the training focused mainly on the military. Teaching in the first year lasted one hour per day in the second year almost two.

The successor of prof. Willenberg was [[Jan Ferdinand Schor|Johann Ferdinand Schor]], builder of hydraulic structures in the basin of the [[Vltava]] and author of textbooks used at the school of mathematics. He began under Willenberg's leadership by teaching [[optics]], [[perspectivity]], [[technical drawing]] and [[geography]]. The third was professor [[František Antonín Herget]], who mainly focused on [[civil engineering]], particularly construction.

In September 1776 [[Maria Theresa]] allowed Herget to use the [[Clementinum]] building; in 1786 the school moved to the new and better building.

In 1787 the School of Engineering was established at the decree of Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].

=== Rankings ===
The CTU is the best technical university in the Czech Republic. In 2010, in the world rating of THES-QS universities in the category of technical sciences, the CTU took the 121st place, in the category of natural sciences – 246th place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msmstudy.eu/education/universities/czech-technical-university-ctu/|title=Czech Technical University (CTU)|website=msmstudy.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2018 Czech Technical University was ranked as 220th in Engineering and Technology in the [[QS World University Rankings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/engineering-technology|title=QS Engineering and Technology ranking|website=topuniversities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Admissions ===
Students apply to faculty. Each faculty has different admissions requirements. Acceptance rate ranges from 52.32% ([[Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague|Faculty of Information Technology]]) to 81.51% (Faculty of Transportation Sciences)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vysokeskoly.com/sance-na-prijeti/?filterTyp=&amp;filterZamereni=5&amp;ord=&amp;fakOrd=&amp;typOrd=&amp;sanceOrd=&amp;sance_rok=|title=Acceptance rate of Czech Universities|website=vysokeskoly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The percentage of international students grew '''from 2.5% in 2000 to 16.4% in 2017'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvut.cz/sites/default/files/content/122dcbcf-3b4a-4188-913e-5a0dd25f3d6e/cs/20180629-vyrocni-zprava-o-cinnosti-cvut-2000.pdf|title=Annual report 2000|website=cvut.cz|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvut.cz/sites/default/files/content/122dcbcf-3b4a-4188-913e-5a0dd25f3d6e/cs/20180911-vyrocni-zprava-o-cinnosti-cvut-2017.pdf|title=Annual report 2017|website=cvut.cz|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Graduation rate ===
Due to the pace and difficulty of CTU coursework, high percentage of students fail to complete first year of their studies. First year failure rates range from 23% (Faculty of Civil Engineering) to 47% ([[Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague|Faculty of Information Technology]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvut.cz/sites/default/files/content/122dcbcf-3b4a-4188-913e-5a0dd25f3d6e/cs/20180911-vyrocni-zprava-o-cinnosti-cvut-2017.pdf|title=Annual report 2017|website=cvut.cz|language=Czech|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Discovery shopping''' (also known as '''discovery shopping search''') is a type of [[online shopping]] that emphasizes the browsing aspects of the [[shopping]] experience.  Discovery shopping search offers shoppers guided queries for more personalized results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Megna | first =  Michelle | title = eBiz News: Capitalize on Next-Generation Search. | publisher = ECommerce-Guide.com | date = 2007-03-29 | url = http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/article.php/3668646}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to recreate the experience of live shopping as a leisure activity, where the items are selected by sampling or viewing a variety of similar or related goods. This is sometimes referred to as [[window shopping]].

Unlike a [[Comparison Shopping Engine]] which evaluates prices and feature sets for identical or very closely related products, discovery shopping enables users to tailor product results to suit their preferences. To achieve this experience online, discovery shopping sites offer features such as specifying styles, colors and brands, showing similar items, and displaying results in a visually engaging format.  Such tools allow shoppers to narrow down from a large to number of choices to a set of products that they find appealing. Comprehensiveness and relevancy are also critical factors, since choice and accuracy increase a shopper's chances of finding a product they wish to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strategies For Multi-Channel Retailing | publisher = InternetRetailer.com | date = 2007-03-22 | url = http://www.internetretailer.com/dailyNews.asp?id=21820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovery search was pegged as a hot trend for 2007, according to a recent report from [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = eBiz News: Capitalize on Next-Generation Search. | publisher = ECommerce-Guide.com | date = 2007-03-29 | url = http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/article.php/3668646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency rations''' are items of [[food]] and [[drink]] that a person stores and relies on in case of an emergency. Emergency food supplies can be purchased for camping trips or wilderness adventures. These supplies are meant to last for several days. Many people also purchase long shelf life emergency food in case of natural disasters or other emergency situations. The food can come in the form of a powder, freeze dried, smoked or salted. The rations are to help people survive until help arrives and are often carried while hill walking or mountaineering, because of the risk of being stranded by an accident. In some organised events, such as [[Ten Tors]], it is obligatory to carry emergency rations.

Emergency rations are often carried by [[camping]] enthusiasts, especially [[Backpack#Backpacks_for_backpacking|back-pack]] campers, who are more likely to be far from food supplies.  Emergency foodstuffs are usually high in caloric content, and sometimes also in nutritional content. Typical emergency foodstuffs are  high-calorie foods such as candy bars, nutritional bars, energy or sports bars, hard bread or biscuit, dried meat (such as [[jerky (food)|jerky]]), and dried fruit. If water is available, rations with little water content are lighter to carry.

Emergency rations are generally carried on the person by people on foot in case of becoming lost or separated from normal food supplies.  Water or other drinks are carried if water is not readily available from the environment.

[[File:eyelashperm.jpg|thumb|right|Eyelashes before (left) and after (right) a perm.]]

'''Eyelash permanent wave''', or more commonly called an '''eyelash perm''', and may also refer to [[permanent relaxer]] that [[straightens the hair]] is a cosmetics procedure performed only by licensed Cosmetologists to flip up eyelashes using hair perming technology.

Lashes are treated with a perm solution which is then followed by the neutralizer and sometimes depending on which system you use will have a nourishing oil as the last step to recondition and strengthen the lashes.  Each being left on for about ten to fifteen minutes. Traditionally when lash perming was introduced a soft like sponge in the shape of a rod would be placed at the base of the lashes where the lashes would take on its new shape.  Although, in recent years people have now started using a silicone pad that is placed on your eyelid.  There is small, medium, or large silicone pads depending on the natural length of your lashes or how curly you would like them to be.  This new form or perming lashes compared to the original sponge rod creates more of a natural shape and curve to the lashes.  The original way of perming lashes which is still done oftentimes gives less of a natural curve or shape to the lash.

Another way to perm lashes is done by using a plastic instrument that looks a lot like a lash curler.  This plastic instrument is then placed at the base of your lashes and then the instrument pinches them up wards the way a lash curler works.  It rests on your eye for support and the rest of the procedure is performed the same way you would with rods or silicone pads.

Once your lashes have been applied (by a special glue that does not harm the lashes) to the perm rod or silicone pad the perming solution is applied to the upturned lash, and then it is left to set for ten to fifteen minutes, followed by the neutralizer which is also left on for ten to fifteen minutes.  In certain systems there will be a nourishing oil as the last step, this nourishing oil also helps to break up the glue that was used to place the lashes on the silicone pad making it easier for the removal of the silicone pad.  Once the silicone pad has been removed the eyelids and lashes are cleansed of any residue left over.  The over all procedure takes about 30–45 minutes to perform.

The results may lasts for two to three months. The chemical reaction breaks and reforms the bonds of the hair. This reaction, softening the lash's inner structure between the protein chains of the hair. The hair swells, stretches and softens, then is molded around the shape of the perm rod or silicone pad to form a curl.

The procedure is performed in a salon or spa by a trained, licensed and certified individual. Every state requires individuals performing the procedure to have a valid [[Cosmetology license]].

==History==
Historically, to achieve an upturned look, lash curlers and mascara were used. The first eyelash curler was invented by the Kurlash company. An early alternative method for curling hair that was suitable for use on people was invented in 1905 by German hairdresser [[Charles Nessler]]. Eyelash perming developed as a widely available solution sometime after 2000.

==Considerations==

Due to the chemicals involved, like any procedure, there is some risk. Side effects of the procedure have been known to include stinging around the eyes. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), while approving of hair treatment, has not yet approved the procedure for use around the eyes.

'''''F.B.T. Productions, LLC, et al. v. Aftermath Records, et al.''''' 621 F.3d 958 was a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] dealt with how Federal Copyright Law applied to the sales and licensing contracts of [[music downloads]] and other downloadable copyrighted material. Specifically, the circuit court ruled that a licensing provision in the contract between [[Bass Brothers|F.B.T. Productions]] and [[Aftermath Records]] unambiguously applied to permanent downloads and mastertones offered through third party distributors. After reviewing the [[First Sale Doctrine]] and the nature of Aftermath's contracts with its distributors, the circuit court concluded that such downloads constituted a licensing of copyrights rather than a sale, causing Aftermath to pay higher royalties to F.B.T. under their agreement.&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal&gt;[http://www.howardrice.com/webfiles/09-55817.pdf F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records opinion], Argued and Submitted July 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 1995 Plaintiff F.B.T. Productions, LLC ("FBT") signed fellow Plaintiff, [[rap]] artist [[Eminem|Marshall Bruce Mathers III]] (stage name [[Eminem]]), to a [[recording contract]].  Subsequent contract agreements in 1998 and 2000 between Plaintiffs and Defendant [[Aftermath Records]] ("Aftermath"), a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]], [[UMG]] Recordings, Inc., and Ary, Inc., allowed Aftermath the right to distribute recordings of Eminem, and then ultimately transferred all exclusive rights of Eminem's recordings to Aftermath.  In exchange for these rights, the agreements provided that Aftermath pay FBT royalties between 12% - 20% of the retail price of copies of Eminem's records sold ("Records Sold" provision).  Furthermore, the agreements provided that FBT receive 50% of the net revenue Aftermath obtained by licensing out the use of Eminem's master recordings ("Masters Licensed" provision).&lt;ref name=fbt_district_court_decision&gt;[http://reporter.blogs.com/files/fbt-summary-judgment-decision.doc U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles)], January 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2001, Defendants licensed various third parties the right to distribute over the [[Internet]], recordings of Eminem in the form of music downloads and [[ringtones]].  These parties included, but were not limited to, the [[iTunes]] music store, [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], [[Nextel]], [[Cingular]], and [[T-Mobile]].&lt;ref name=fbt_district_court_decision/&gt;

In 2005 auditors hired by Plaintiffs allegedly found that Defendants were remitting to Plaintiffs royalties for music downloads and ringtones under the lower percentage "Records Sold" provision of their agreement.  Based on these findings, Plaintiffs filed complaints in 2007 and 2008, alleging [[breach of contract]] and motioned for [[summary judgment]].  Plaintiffs claimed that language in the record contracts stipulated that music downloads and ringtones be classified not as "Records Sold", but instead as the higher percentage "Masters Licensed", and that these higher royalties be remitted to FBT as such.&lt;ref name=fbt_district_court_decision/&gt;

==District Court Ruling and Jury Trial==

United States District Judge [[Philip S. Gutierrez]] denied Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the contract agreements were too ambiguous as to how to calculate royalties for downloads and ringtones.  Based on the third party agreements, the court could not definitively conclude if downloads were licenses.  Also, neither party was able to establish any prevailing industry custom as to how downloads and ringtones were traditionally calculated.  In lieu of conclusive information, the court took into consideration that the agreements gave the Defendants the right to sell recordings, "...in any [or] all forms of media now known and hereinafter developed..."  and that Plaintiffs never objected to the lower royalty rate until after the audit, therefore providing insight as to Plaintiffs' original intent.  As such, the court ruled that both parties' reasonable expectations for download and ringtone royalties at the time of the agreement was that of a sale.&lt;ref name=fbt_district_court_decision/&gt;

Accordingly, the issue went to trial where a jury, "...returned a verdict in favor of Aftermath, and the district court awarded Aftermath its attorneys’ fees of over $2.4 million."&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt;

==US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit==

Upon appeal by Plaintiffs to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Decision, "[t]he judgment in favor of defendants was reversed, the district court's order granting attorneys' fees to defendants was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings."&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt;

In its reversal, the circuit court emphasized its right to review the district court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, as the district court's "determination of whether an ambiguity exists remains 'a question of law, subject to independent review on appeal.'"&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt; Thus it started by reiterating the district court's conclusion that since either the "Records Sold" or the "Masters Licensed" provision could apply to the downloads, that neither the Plaintiffs' nor the Defendant's motions for summary judgment could be granted due to an inherent ambiguity. However, the circuit court pointed out the specific use of the word "notwithstanding," explaining that the provision states "notwithstanding" the "Records Sold" provision, the "Masters Licensed" provision would apply. The circuit court interpreted this to mean that the "Masters Licensed" provision had overarching scope, concluding that no ambiguity existed.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A contractual term is not ambiguous just because it is broad. Here, the Masters Licensed provision explicitly applies to (1) masters (2) that are licensed to third parties for the manufacture of records “or for any other uses,” (3) “notwithstanding” the Record Sold provision. This provision is admittedly broad, but it is not unclear or ambiguous.&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court then discussed whether or not Aftermath licensed the music to third party distributors, making extensive use of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], including references to sections {{UnitedStatesCode|17|114}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|17|115}}, and the [[First-sale doctrine]] as expressed in {{UnitedStatesCode|17|109}}. The court reaffirmed the fundamental differences between a sale and a license, particularly pointing out that "a 'sale' of a work may either be a transfer in title of an individual copy of a work, or a sale of all exclusive intellectual property rights in a work."&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt; Relying heavily on the Supreme Court's interpretation of these statutes, the court of appeals thus ruled that Defendants' dealings with third parties were license agreements and not sales.  This was mainly based on the fact that Defendants' transfer of copyrighted material to third parties did not include ownership title of copyrighted material, and that Defendants reserved the right to reclaim copyrighted material at any time, therefore no sale was made.&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt;

Furthermore, the court established that the copyrighted material transferred to the third parties qualified as a [[master recording]] due to the quality and fidelity of the recordings. Aftermath had also argued that F.B.T. failed to complain about the lower royalty rates until the audit in 2006, claiming this demonstrated acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff. The court ruled against this as well, determining that such actions by the Plaintiff were reasonable and contributed nothing to their intentions, stating, "F.B.T. had no obligation to audit the statements any earlier than it did, and it immediately raised the issue with Aftermath after the audit." The court therefore concluded that the Defendants owed Plaintiffs a royalty rate of 50% for downloads and ringtones under the "Masters Licensed" provision.&lt;ref name=fbt_aftermath_appeal/&gt;

==Supreme Court of the United States==
The Defendants petitioned the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], seeking a review of the Ninth Circuit's judgment.  In March 2011 the US Supreme Court denied the Defendants' petition for [[writ of certiorari]].&lt;ref name=scotus_appeal&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12478269983023958737&amp;q=F.B.T.+Productions,+LLC+v.+Aftermath+Records&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5, Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied.], March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FLOX'''  is a [[combustion]] process developed by ''WS Wärmeprozesstechnik GmbH''.

== History ==
In April 1990 Joachim Alfred Wünning made experiments with industrial gasoline engines thereby observing that beyond a temperature of 850&amp;nbsp;°C the flames were blown away. The German word "flammenlose Oxidation" (flameless oxidation) is the origin of the name for the FLOX-Technology that was derived from the effect. Its specific advantages led to additional funding including a project "FLoxCoal" at the Stuttgart University to engineer a prototype of an atomizing burner for coal without flame reactions.

== Technology ==
The [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] formation is specifically located in the flame front so that by suppressing peak flame the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emission can be reduced theoretically to zero. In the practical implementations in current burner technology a reduction of 20% was observed for [[Rhineland|Rhenisch]] [[brown coal]] and 65% for Polish black coal. 

The role of combustion temperature in NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; formation has been understood for some time.  Reduction of the combustion temperature in gasoline engines, by reducing the compression ratio, was among the first steps taken to comply with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. clean air act]] in the 1970s. This lowers the [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions by lowering the temperature at the flame front.

'''Fermented bean paste''' is a category of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented foods]] typically made from ground [[soybean]]s, which are indigenous to the cuisines of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. In some cases, such as the production of ''[[miso]]'', other varieties of beans such as [[Vicia faba|broad bean]]s, may also be used.&lt;ref&gt; The Book of Miso, 2nd ed., by Shurtleff and Aoyagi. Berkeley, California: Ten Speed Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastes are usually salty and [[Umami|savory]], but may also be spicy, and are used as a [[condiment]] to flavor foods such as [[stir-fries]], stews, and soups.  The colours of such pastes range from light tan to reddish brown and dark brown. The differences in colour are due to different production methods, such as the conditions of fermentation, the addition of [[wheat]] flour, pulverized [[mantou]], [[rice]], or [[sugar]] and the presence of different [[microflora]], such as bacteria or molds used in their production, as well as whether the soybeans are roasted (as in ''chunjang'') or aged (as in ''tauchu''&lt;!--Please check; I may have gotten this wrong--&gt;) before being ground.

Fermented bean pastes are sometimes the starting material used in producing soy sauces, such as [[Soy sauce#Japanese|tamari]], or an additional product created from the same fermented mass.

Due to the protein content of the beans, the fermentation process releases a large amount of free [[amino acid]]s, which when combined with the large amounts of [[Edible salt|salt]] used in its production, produces a highly [[umami]] product. This is particularly true with miso, which can be used as the primary ingredient in certain dishes, such as [[miso soup]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12072">A '''fusion rocket''' is a theoretical design for a [[rocket]] driven by [[nuclear fusion|fusion propulsion]] which could provide efficient and long-term [[Spacecraft propulsion|acceleration in space]] without the need to carry a large fuel supply. The design relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities, and the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current [[spacecraft]]. A smaller and lighter fusion reactor might be possible in the future when more sophisticated methods have been devised to control magnetic confinement and prevent [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] instabilities. [[Inertial confinement fusion|Inertial fusion]] could provide a lighter and more compact alternative, as might a fusion engine&lt;ref&gt;"Direct Fusion Drive for a Human Mars Orbital Mission", Michael Paluszek et al, The 65th International Astronautical Congress (AIC), 29 September - 3 October, 2014, Toronto, Canada, http://bp.pppl.gov/pub_report/2014/PPPL-5064.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; based on an [[Field-reversed_configuration|FRC]].

For space flight, the main advantage of fusion would be the very high [[specific impulse]], and the main disadvantage the (likely) large mass of the reactor. However, a fusion rocket may produce less radiation than a [[nuclear fission|fission]] rocket, reducing the mass needed for shielding. The surest way of building a fusion rocket with current technology is to use [[hydrogen bomb]]s as proposed in [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], but such a spacecraft would also be massive and the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] prohibits the use of nuclear bombs. Therefore, the use of nuclear bombs to propel rockets on Earth is problematic, but possible in space in theory. An alternate approach would be electrical (e.g. [[ion thruster|ion]]) propulsion with electric power generation via fusion power instead of direct thrust.

== Electricity generation vs. direct thrust ==

Many spacecraft propulsion methods such as [[ion thruster]]s require an input of electric power to run but are highly efficient. In some cases their maximum thrust is limited by the amount of power that can be generated (for example, a [[mass driver]]). An electric generator that ran on fusion power could be installed purely to drive such a ship. One disadvantage is that conventional electricity production requires a low-temperature energy sink, which is difficult (i.e. heavy) in a spacecraft. '''Direct conversion''' of the kinetic energy of the fusion products into electricity is in principle possible and would mitigate this problem.

An attractive possibility is to simply direct the exhaust of fusion product out the back of the rocket to provide thrust without the intermediate production of electricity. This would be easier with some confinement schemes (e.g. [[magnetic mirror]]s) than with others (e.g. [[tokamak]]s). It is also more attractive for "advanced fuels" (see [[aneutronic fusion]]). '''Helium-3 propulsion''' is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion that uses the fusion of [[helium-3]] atoms as a power source. Helium-3, an [[isotope]] of helium with two [[proton]]s and one [[neutron]], could be fused with [[deuterium]] in a reactor. The resulting energy release could be used to expel propellant out the back of the spacecraft. Helium-3 is proposed as a power source for spacecraft mainly because of its abundance on the moon. Currently, scientists estimate that there are 1 million tons of helium-3 present on the moon, mainly due to solar wind colliding with the moon's surface and depositing it, among other elements, into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/gallery/pdf/space_com063000.pdf Moon's Helium-3 Could Power Earth]&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the power produced by the D-T reaction could be used this way; the other 80% is released in the form of neutrons which, because they cannot be directed by magnetic fields or solid walls, would be very difficult to use for thrust. Helium-3 is also produced via [[beta decay]] of [[tritium]], which in turn can be produced from deuterium, lithium, or boron.

Even if a self-sustaining fusion reaction cannot be produced, it might be possible to use fusion to boost the efficiency of another propulsion system, such as a [[Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket|VASIMR]] engine.

== Confinement concept ==

To sustain a fusion reaction, the plasma must be confined. The most widely studied configuration for terrestrial fusion is the [[tokamak]], a form of [[magnetic confinement fusion]]. Currently tokamaks weigh a great deal, so the thrust to weight ratio would seem unacceptable. [[NASA]]'s [[Glenn Research Center]] has proposed a small aspect ratio spherical torus reactor for its "Discovery II" conceptual vehicle design. "Discovery II" could deliver a manned 172 000-kilogram payload to [[Jupiter]] in 118 days (or 212 days to [[Saturn]]) using 861 metric tons of [[hydrogen]] propellant, plus 11 metric tons of [[Helium-3]]-[[Deuterium]] (D-He3) fusion fuel.&lt;ref&gt;"Realizing "2001: A Space Odyssey": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion" by Craig H. Williams, Leonard A. Dudzinski, Stanley K. Borowski, and Albert J. Juhasz, NASA TM-2005-213559, 2005, https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960_2005161052.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrogen is heated by the fusion plasma debris to increase thrust, at a cost of reduced [[exhaust velocity]] (348–463&amp;nbsp;km/s)  and hence increased propellant mass.

The main alternative to magnetic confinement is [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF), such as that proposed by [[Project Daedalus]]. A small pellet of fusion fuel (with a diameter of a couple of millimeters) would be ignited by an [[electron beam]] or a [[laser]]. To produce direct thrust, a [[magnetic field]] would form the pusher plate. In principle, the Helium-3-Deuterium reaction or an [[aneutronic fusion]] reaction could be used to maximize the energy in charged particles and to minimize radiation, but it is highly questionable whether it is technically feasible to use these reactions. Both the detailed design studies in the 1970s, the [[Orion drive]] and Project Daedalus, used inertial confinement. In the 1980s, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and NASA studied an ICF-powered "Vehicle for Interplanetary Transport Applications" (VISTA). The conical VISTA spacecraft could deliver a 100-tonne payload to [[Mars]] orbit and return to Earth in 130 days, or to Jupiter orbit and back in 403 days. 41 tonnes of deuterium/[[tritium]] (D-T) fusion fuel would be required, plus 4,124 tonnes of hydrogen expellant.&lt;ref&gt;"Interplanetary Space Transport Using Inertial Fusion Propulsion" by C.D.Orth, UCRL-JC-129239, 9th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Systems, Tel-Aviv, Israel, June 28-July 2, 1998, {{cite web |url=http://www.boomslanger.com/images/istuifp.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215124046/http://www.boomslanger.com/images/istuifp.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust velocity would be 157&amp;nbsp;km/s.

[[Magnetized target fusion]] (MTF) is a relatively new approach that combines the best features of the more widely studied magnetic confinement fusion (i.e. good energy confinement) and inertial confinement fusion (i.e. efficient compression heating and wall free containment of the fusing plasma) approaches. Like the magnetic approach, the fusion fuel is confined at low density by magnetic fields while it is heated into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], but like the inertial confinement approach, fusion is initiated by rapidly squeezing the target to dramatically increase fuel density, and thus temperature. MTF uses "plasma guns" (i.e. electromagnetic acceleration techniques) instead of powerful lasers, leading to low cost and low weight compact reactors.&lt;ref&gt;"Magnetized Target Fusion in Advanced Propulsion Research" by Rashad Cylar, MSFC/University of Alabama NASA Faculty Fellowship Program 2002, https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030093609_2003101283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The NASA/[[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) group has investigated a manned MTF propulsion spacecraft capable of delivering a 163933-kilogram payload to Jupiter's moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] using 106-165 metric tons of propellant (hydrogen plus either D-T or D-He3 fusion fuel) in 249–330 days.&lt;ref&gt;"Conceptual Design of In-Space Vehicles for Human Exploration of the Outer Planets", NASA/TP—2003–212691, November 2003, https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040010797_2004001506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This design would thus be considerably smaller and more fuel efficient due to its higher exhaust velocity (700&amp;nbsp;km/s) than the previously mentioned "Discovery II", "VISTA" concepts.

Another popular confinement concept for fusion rockets is [[inertial electrostatic confinement]] (IEC), such as in the [[Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor]] or the [[Polywell]] variation being researched by the Energy-Matter Conversion Corporation. The University of Illinois has defined a 500-tonne "Fusion Ship II" concept capable of delivering a 100,000&amp;nbsp;kg manned payload to Jupiter's moon Europa in 210 days. Fusion Ship II utilizes [[ion rocket]] thrusters (343&amp;nbsp;km/s exhaust velocity) powered by ten D-He3 IEC fusion reactors. The concept would need 300 tonnes of [[argon]] propellant for a 1-year round trip to the Jupiter system.&lt;ref&gt;"Fusion Ship II -- A Fast Manned Interplanetary Space Vehicle Using Inertial Electrostatic Fusion", J.Webber et al., University of Illinois, U-C, Department of Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological Engineering, 2003, http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/iecworkshop/PDF/TECHNICAL_TALKS/webber.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bussard]] published a series of technical articles discussing its application to spaceflight throughout the 1990s. His work was popularised by an article in the [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]] publication, where Tom Ligon (who has also written several [[Bahá'í Faith in fiction#Tom Ligon's trilogy|science fiction stories]]) described how the fusor would make for a highly effective fusion rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torsatron.tripod.com/fusor/fusor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615044323/http://torsatron.tripod.com/fusor/fusor.html |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in this role in the science fiction novel ''The Wreck of the River of Stars'', by [[Michael Flynn (author)|Michael Flynn]].

A still more speculative concept is [[antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion]], which would use tiny quantities of antimatter to catalyze a fission and fusion reaction, allowing much smaller fusion explosions to be created.

'''Hand Held Products'''  was the world's largest manufacturer of linear and 2D handheld barcode scanners based on imaging technology. Its product range included rugged mobile computers, image kiosks, and barcode verification devices. Its range of data collection and communication products were designed for mobile, on-site, and transaction processing applications.

==History==
[[Image:Old Handheld Products Logo.png|right|160px|Old Hand Held Products Logo]]
The company was created in a merger between the former Welch Allyn Data Collection, Inc. and Hand Held Products, Inc. in late 1999.
Since the merger in 1999, the company has maintained its company headquarters in NY.

[[Image:Original Hand Held Products Logo.png|right|160px|Original Hand Held Products Logo]]
Welch Allyn Data Collection was formed in 1972 as a subsidiary of [[Welch Allyn]], headquartered in Skaneateles Falls, New York, and by the 1990s was manufacturing a complete line of handheld [[bar code]] readers.

The original Hand Held Products company, established in 1981 in [[Charlotte]], North Carolina, began life as a manufacturer of memory modules for [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Texas Instruments]] programmable calculators, but quickly came to the industry spotlight in 1983 thanks to an [[RFP]] hand-off by Hewett-Packard, as a package delivery company [[Federal Express]] selected their Micro-Wand portable data collection device to begin its first major [[proof of delivery]] system for package tracking.

In 1996, Hand Held Products launched the first mobile computer with 2D imaging technology, the Dolphin 7200. In 1997, the Hand Held Product's Dolphin portable computer was selected by the [[United States Postal Service]] to be part of their own proof of delivery system, although a third party provided the manufacturing for this deal, which was the largest single order in the history of the industry – 300,000 units.
In 2006–2007 [[United States Postal Service]] started replacing these portable computers with newly designed Motorola portable computers (370,000 units). The bar code reading hardware (2D imager) and decoding and image processing software in these new portable computers are designed and supplied by Hand Held Products.

Hand Held Products has a significant presence in Europe, with its EMEA headquarters in [[Eindhoven]], The Netherlands, where its European repair center is also based. It also has offices in the UK, Germany and France and sales representation and resellers in most countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Hand Held Products also has offices in Latin America and Asia.

As of January 1, 2005, the company dropped HHP as its brand name and returned to its full name Hand Held Products. (The legal company name has always been Hand Held Products, Inc.)
[[Image:Hand Held Products (logo).png|right|160px|HHP, Inc. Logo]]
[[Image:Handheld logo.png|right|160px|Hand Held Products Logo]]

On October 15, 2007, Hand Held Products announced they had entered an agreement with [[Honeywell]] to be purchased for a reported $390 M usd.  On December 20, 2007 Honeywell’s acquisition of Hand Held was approved, and Hand Held officially became a part of Honeywell.
Hand Held formed a new line of business within the Honeywell Security Group, initially called Honeywell Imaging and mobility. With Honeywell's acquisition of [[Metrologic]] in 2008 they decided to call the business unit [[Honeywell Scanning and Mobility]].

Hydrogen pipeline transport is used to transport hydrogen from the point of production or delivery to the point of demand. Although hydrogen pipeline transport is technologically mature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/hpwgw_airprod_remp.pdf 2005 DOE Hydrogen Pipeline Working Group Workshop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191048/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/hpwgw_airprod_remp.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cder.dz/A2H2/Medias/Download/Proc%20PDF/POSTERS/%5BGIV%5D%20Liquid%20&amp;%20gaseous%20storage,%20delidevy,%20safety,%20RCS/222.pdf Natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transportation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the transport costs are similar to those of [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leightyfoundation.org/files/WHEC16-Lyon/WHEC16-Ref022.pdf 2006 - Compressorless Hydrogen Transmission Pipelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210131141/http://www.leightyfoundation.org/files/WHEC16-Lyon/WHEC16-Ref022.pdf |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most hydrogen is produced in the place of demand, with an industrial production facility every {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogenforecast.com/ArticleDetails.php?articleID=250 Every 50 to 100 miles ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820202251/http://www.hydrogenforecast.com/ArticleDetails.php?articleID=250 |date=2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piping==
Hydrogen has problems with both [[hydrogen embrittlement]] and corrosion. Hydrogen has an active electron, and therefore behaves somewhat like a [[halogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siei.org/piping.html Stuart Island Energy Initiative Website] Accessed 2010-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, hydrogen pipes have to resist corrosion. The problem is compounded because hydrogen can easily migrate into the crystal structure of most metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siei.org/piping.html Stuart Island Energy Initiative Website] Accessed 2010-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; For process metal piping at pressures up to {{convert|7000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, high-purity [[stainless steel]] piping with a maximum hardness of 80 [[Rockwell scale|HRB]] is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avt.inel.gov/pdf/hydrogen/h2station_appendixc.pdf Idaho national Engineering Laboratory Recommendations for Piping for Gaseous Hydrogen] Accessed 2010-10-13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6143">[[Image:Langley hypersonic wind tunnels.jpg|thumb|[[Langley Research Center|NASA Langley]]'s Hypersonic Facilities Complex, 1969]]

A '''hypersonic wind tunnel''' is designed to generate a [[hypersonic]] flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, closed circuit wind tunnel remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II&lt;ref&gt;Eckardt, Dietrich: "The 1x1 m hypersonic wind tunnel Kochel/Tullahoma 1940-1960", CEAS Space Journal, March 2015, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt; and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at [[AEDC]] Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]]. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).

==Technological problems==
There are several technological problems in designing and constructing a hyper-velocity wind tunnel:
*supply of high temperatures and pressures for times long enough to perform a measurement
*reproduction of equilibrium conditions
*structural damage produced by overheating
*fast instrumentation
*power requirements to run the tunnel
Simulations of a flow at 5.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, 45&amp;nbsp;km altitude would require tunnel temperatures of over 9000 [[Kelvin|K]], and a pressure of 3 [[gigapascal|GPa]] (see [[Talk:Hypersonic wind tunnel#Pressure required 3GPa ?|discussion]]).

==Hot shot wind tunnel==
One form of HWT is known as a Gun Tunnel or hot shot tunnel (up to ''M''=27), which can be used for analysis of flows past ballistic missiles, space vehicles in atmospheric entry, and plasma physics or heat transfer at high temperatures. It runs intermittently, but has a very low running time (less than a second).
The method of operation is based on a high temperature and pressurized gas (air or nitrogen) produced in an arc-chamber, and a near-vacuum in the remaining part of the tunnel. The arc-chamber can reach several [[megapascal|MPa]], while pressures in the vacuum chamber can be as low as 0.1 [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]. This means that the pressure ratios of these tunnels are in the order of 10 million. Also, the temperatures of the hot gas are up to 5000 K. The arc chamber is mounted in the gun barrel. The high pressure gas is separated by the vacuum by a diaphragm that breaks down as its resistance is exceeded.

Prior to a test run commencing, a membrane separates the compressed air from the gun barrel breech. A rifle (or similar) is used to rupture the membrane. Compressed air rushes into the breech of the gun barrel, forcing a small projectile to accelerate rapidly down the barrel. Although the projectile is prevented from leaving the barrel, the air in front of the projectile emerges at hypersonic velocity into the working section. Naturally the duration of the test is extremely brief, so high speed instrumentation is required to get any meaningful data.

== Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Facility in India ==
ISRO commissioned two major facilities — a Hypersonic Wind Tunnel and Shock Tunnel — at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center here as part of its continuous and concerted efforts to minimize cost of access to space. ISRO Chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar said commissioning of such facilities would provide adequate data for design and development of current and future space transportation systems in India.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== MARHY, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Facility in Orléans FRANCE  ==
[[File:MARHy.jpg|thumb|Photo of the wind tunnel MARHy]]
The '''MARHy Hypersonic low density Wind Tunnel''', located at the ICARE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icare.cnrs-orleans.fr/spip.php?rubrique174, ICARE Laboratory, CNRS, Orléans]&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory in Orléans, France, is a research facility used extensively for fundamental and applied research of fluid dynamic phenomena in rarefied compressible flows, applied to space research(contact Viviana Lago: head of the Fast team, viviana.lago@cnrs-orleans.fr). Its name is an acronym for '''M'''ach '''A'''daptable '''R'''arefied '''Hy'''personic and the wind tunnel is recorded under this name under the European portal MERIL.

'''Immudex''' is a Danish Reagents and Diagnostics company established in 2009. The company is operating from offices located in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{Cite press release|title = Immudex, a new spin-out from Dako|date = October 9, 2009|publisher = Immudex ApS|url = http://www.immudex.com/media/5543/pressrelease20091009.pdf|accessdate = January 3, 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140103161516/http://www.immudex.com/media/5543/pressrelease20091009.pdf|archivedate=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immudex specializes in the production of [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]].

Nat Rev Immunol. 2011 Jul 15;11(8):551-8. doi: 10.1038/nri3020.&lt;/ref&gt;

All Immudex products, whether on the marked or in development, are based on its proprietary [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramer]] technology. The use of [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] offers a new method to accurately detect and quantify antigen-specific [[CD8+ T cells]].

While some of the technology is currently only sold for [[Research chemical|Research use only (RUO)]], clinical applications are being actively pursued. Currently, Immudex has several development projects for clinically applicable [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]]. Even so, the first [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] clinical reagent has been developed and approved for clinical in vitro diagnostics in [[Europe]]. Namely the CE-marked kit for enumeration of [[cytomegalovirus]]-specific [[T cells]]. Immudex primarily focuses on the identification of producing large quantities of [[CD8+ T cells]] by the means of [[MHC class I]] molecules. Even so, the research and development into the application of [[MHC class II]] [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|Dextramers]] might expand the technology.

== History ==
Originally, Immudex operated as an individual division within the much larger [[Denmark|Danish]] pharmaceutical company Dako. Immudex was later spun out as a separate business, when the focus of Dako largely shifted to [[cancer]] diagnostics.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Børsen, Oct. 9th, 2009, Tom Frovst. "Milliardpotentiale i Dako-satsning". Copenhagen, DK. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Immudex currently have clients world wide with major markets in the United States and Europe. 
Patents for the [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramer]] technology were filed at Dako in 2001, and the Immudex division was launched in 2005.

In 2011, Immudex received the prestigious “Entrepreneur of the Year 2011” award in the Life Sciences category granted by [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst &amp; Young, Nov. 24th, 2011. "Immudex vinder kategorien Life Sciences Entrepreneur Of The Year 2011". Copenhagen, DK&lt;/ref&gt;
Immudex received this award because of the commitment of the company, articulated in the company's "make it work and make it better" strategy to generate results for both practitioners and patients. The award is given to companies not only focused on financial growth, but also for softer values such as the entrepreneur's social responsibility and the ability to aspire an motivate the organization.

== Dextramer technology ==
A large number of immunotherapies, currently in development, seek to induce, expand, activate or eliminate antigen-specific [[T cells]]. It is therefore important to be able to quantify and characterize the [[T cell]] responses before, during and after treatment in order to understand if the proposed change to the [[T cells]] has been effectuated.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The process of [[Central tolerance|negative selection]] in the [[thymus]] guarantees that virtually all [[T cells]] have very weak affinity for [[Antigen|self-antigens]]. Therefore, the study of these lymphocytes in [[autoimmune diseases]] and [[cancer]] has been difficult, until the fairly recent introduction of [[MHC multimer]]s. [[MHC multimer#Tetramer|Tetramers]], which are among the most popular form of these multimer complexes, have four binding sites. The [[MHC multimer#Tetramer|Tetramers]] were originally developed in [[Academia]]. Many further developments in this technology have taken place at biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, J.D. et al. “Phenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T lymphocytes.” Science, 274 (5284): October 1996, 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Immudex [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]], which represent the latest advancement in this field, provide an exponentially greater probability of successful identification of antigen-specific [[T cells]]. This can be done, because the [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] have nine, or more binding sites per [[dextran]] backbone. Scientists have been optimistic about the potential of such technology, since it will help broaden the understanding of [[T cell]] responses and will in the future be clinically applicable to many different antigen-specific [[T cells]].&lt;ref name="baboon" /&gt;

== Products ==
The [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] are fluorescent [[MHC multimer]] reagents, developed for sensitive, specific and accurate detection of antigen-specific [[T cells]] by using [[Flow cytometry]]. The [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] covers human, mouse, and monkey [[alleles]] that all display disease relevant antigenic peptides. The [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] can thereby be used for monitoring antigen-specific [[T cell]] responses.

'''Virus Dextramer collection 1''' - provides reagents for detection, quantification and isolation of virus specific [[T cell]]s. It furthermore enables detection for [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]]-, [[Epstein-barr virus|EBV]]-, [[influenza]]-, and [[BK virus|BK]] virus specific CD8+ [[T cell]]s.

'''Dextramer CMV kit''' - These [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] provide a method for quantification of [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]]-specific CD8+ [[T cell]]s in whole blood samples as an aid in predicting and monitoring patients at risk of developing [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]]-related disease.

'''Melanoma Dextramer collection 1''' - comprises [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] specific for 6 different [[melanoma]]-associated antigens and can be used for the detection, enumeration and isolation of [[melanoma]]-specific CD8+ [[T cell]]s from blood or tumor tissue.

'''Cancer Testis Antigen CD1d Dextramer''' - These [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramers]] are [[flow cytometry]] reagents for the identification and sorting of [[Natural killer cells|Natural killer cells (NKT)]], as well as an extensive range of single reagents for detection of [[cancer]]- and viral-specific [[T cell]]s. The CD1d/α-GalCer displays human CD1d molecules loaded with α-GalCer.

== Development Projects ==

Though Immudex specializes in [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramer]] technology, the company is also pursuing development projects in diagnostics for [[Lyme disease]]/[[Borreliosis]], based on the detection of [[Borrelia]]-specific [[T cell]]s in diseased patients.

Clinical application of the CE-market [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|Dextramer]] [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]] kit has been approved for the [[Europe]]an market. The [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]] kit will also be attempted approved for the US market through a number of clinical trials and S10K approval. The [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]] kit is intended for identification and enumerication of [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]]-specific CD8+ [[T cell]]s in whole blood samples. Furthermore, the [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramer]] [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]] kit can be used for the assessment of [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]]-specific immune status in [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-matched patients.

Knowledge of the level of viral-specific [[T cell]]s allow evaluation of the patients preparedness for fighting the viral infection and thereby avoid unnecessary antiviral treatment. [[cytomegalovirus|CMV]] infections are often unnoticed by healthy people, but can be life threatening for immune compromised individuals, such as [[HIV]]-infected persons and organ-transplant recipients.

== Collaborations and partnerships ==

In 2013, Immudex entered into a co-distribution and co-promotional partnership with JPT Peptide Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Products &amp; Services|date = December 2013|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/gen.33.21.07|work = Gen. Eng. Biotechnol. News|page = 14|volume = 33|issue = 21}} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this partnership is to synergistically combine JPT's innovative peptide technologies along with existing products with Immudex's sophisticated [[MHC multimer#MHC Dextramer|MHC Dextramer]] products. This product combination will provide a comprehensive portfolio of high quality [[T cell]] relevant products and services for the immunotherapy and vaccine community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = JPT and Immudex announces Partnership Agreement|date = May 2015|url = http://www.immudex.com/media/32295/release_jpt-immudex.pdf|work = Immudex}} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Proficiency Panels ==

Proficiency panel testing comprises an interlaboratory system for the regular testing of accuracy that the participating laboratories can achieve. The [[MHC multimer]] panel tests the proficiency of a given laboratory in performing the [[flow cytometry]] based [[MHC multimer]] assay on blood and in performing an [[ELISPOT|Elispot Assay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ATCC proficiency|url = http://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/standards/standards_programs/atcc_proficiency_standard_program.aspx?geo_country=dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2013 Immudex entered an agreement with the US cancer Immunotherapy consortium (CIC) and the European Association for Cancer Immunotherapy (CIMIT). The agreement dictates that Immudex will provide [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]]-peptide multimers and Elispot proficiency panels to laboratories worldwide, independently of their background and associations.

CIC and CIMT originally established proficiency panel programs to offer an external validation of assay performance and to enhance assay harmonization. Over the years, more than one hundred laboratories have participated. Not only from the cancer field, but also from other immunological fields utilizing immune monitoring. As a result, two frequently used immune monitoring methods, have now reached a high degree of harmonization.

Immudex, specialized in the detection of antigen-specific [[T cell]]s has been an active participant in the proficiency panel process and is globally recognized for its expertise in immune monitoring. Thus Immudex was the logical choice as a partner for proficiency panels.

Immudex will continue the external validation program established by CIC and CIMT under the successfully implemented harmonization guidelines and will promote a more widespread use of these technologies in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines against other diseases such as [[HIV]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], [[diabetes]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Immudex takes on proficiency panels|url = http://www.immudex.com/media/29197/produktark_press.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Sweden}}
The '''industrialization of Sweden''' began during the second half of the 19th century. By the end of the century, the first multinational companies based on advanced technology had emerged.

During the early phase of [[World War I]], in which Sweden remained [[neutral country|neutral]], the country benefited from increasing demand. However, with the German submarine war, Sweden was cut off from its markets, which led to a severe economic downturn. Between the world wars, major Swedish exports were [[steel]], ball-bearings, wood pulp, and [[match]]es. Prosperity following World War II provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden.

[[Foreign relations of Sweden|Foreign policy]] concerns in the 1930s centered on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and German expansionism, which stimulated [[Scandinavian defence union|abortive efforts at Nordic defence co-operation]].

==Communications==
[[File:Sweden Main Line Railways.png|left|thumb|150px|Main Line railways built in Sweden between 1860-1930.]]
The main line railways ({{lang-sv|stambanor}}), built and owned by the State, were of major importance for the development of Swedish industry and economy in general.

The two first main line railways, were the [[Southern Main Line]], stretching from [[Stockholm]] to [[Malmö]] in the south, and the [[Western Main Line]], from Stockholm to [[Gothenburg]] on the west coast. They were completed between 1860–1864. The Northern railways ([[East Coast Line (Sweden)|East Coast Line]], [[Northern Main Line]] &amp; [[Main Line Through Upper Norrland]]) runs parallel to the Baltic coast up to [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]] in northern Sweden, and was finished in 1894. The [[Inland Line]] runs through the central parts of northern Sweden, and was built between 1908–1937.

The construction of the early main lines provided a fast and safe connection from the mines in the north to the rest of Sweden. It also facilitated business (and private) travel, that had earlier required horse-driven carriages.

The [[Iron Ore Line]] (not a main line), from [[Luleå]] to [[Narvik]] in [[Norway]], provided a highly efficient transportation linkage from the iron ores near [[Kiruna]] and [[Gällivare]] to harbours on both the Atlantic and the Baltic coasts. The sections of the Iron Ore Line were completed in stages between 1888 and 1903.

The '''LG Internet Digital DIOS''' (also known as '''R-S73CT''') is an [[internet refrigerator]] released by [[LG Electronics]] in June 2000. The technology is the result of a project that started in 1997 and staffed by a team of 55 researchers with a budget cost of Won15 bil (US$49.2 million).

==Features==
The refrigerator has a TFT-LCD (thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display) screen with TV functionality and Local Area Network (LAN) port. It includes a LCD information window that features electronic pen, data memo, video messaging and schedule management functions and provides information, such as inside temperature, the freshness of stored foods, nutrition information and recipes. Other features are a webcam that is used as a scanner and tracks what is inside the refrigerator, a MP3 player and a three-level automatic icemaker. In addition, the electricity consumption is half the level of conventional refrigerators and the noise level is only 23 decibels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/lg-unveils-internetready-refrigerator--221266|title=LG UNVEILS INTERNET-READY REFRIGERATOR|work=LG Electronics|publisher=telecompaper.com|date=June 21, 2000|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99743|title=No need for PCs with intelligent fridges|work=[[ITWeb]]|date=December 13, 2000|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIT OpenCourseWare''' ('''MIT OCW''') is an initiative of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) to publish all of the educational materials from its [[Post-secondary education|undergraduate]]{{snd}}and [[Quaternary education|graduate-level]] courses [[online]], [[Free content|freely]] and [[Open access (publishing)|openly available]] to anyone, anywhere. MIT OpenCourseWare is a large-scale, [[website|web-based]] publication of MIT course materials. The project was announced on April 4, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Auditing classes at M.I.T., on the web for free |publisher=The New York Times |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |date={{date|2001|04|04}} |access-date={{date|2017-04-22}} |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/04/us/auditing-classes-at-mit-on-the-web-and-free.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license. The program was originally funded by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], and MIT.  Currently, MIT OpenCourseWare is supported by MIT, corporate underwriting, major gifts, and donations from site visitors.&lt;ref name="why-donate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/donate/why-donate/ |title=Free Online Course Materials &amp;#124; Why Donate? &amp;#124; MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative has inspired more than 250 other institutions to make their course materials available as [[open educational resources]] through the Open Education Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Attwood| first = Rebecca| title = Get it out in the open| work = Times Higher Education| location = London| accessdate = 2010-12-18| date = 2009-09-24| url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=408300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|May}}, over 2,400 courses were available online. While a few of these were limited to chronological reading lists and discussion topics, a majority provided homework problems and exams (often with solutions) and lecture notes. Some courses also included interactive web demonstrations in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], complete textbooks written by MIT professors, and [[Streaming media|streaming]] video lectures.

{{As of|2018|May}}, 100 courses included complete video lectures. The videos were available in streaming mode, but could also be downloaded for viewing offline.  All video and audio files were also available from [[YouTube]], [[iTunes U]] and the [[Internet Archive]].

==Project==

===History===
The concept of MIT OpenCourseWare grew out of the MIT Council on Education Technology, which was charged by MIT [[Provost (education)|provost]] [[Robert A. Brown|Robert Brown]] in 1999 with determining how MIT should position itself in the [[distance learning]]/e-learning environment.  MIT OpenCourseWare was then initiated to provide a new model for the dissemination of knowledge and collaboration among scholars around the world, and contributes to the “shared intellectual commons” in academia, which fosters collaboration across MIT and among other scholars. The project was spearheaded by professors Dick K.P Yue, Shigeru Miyagawa, [[Hal Abelson]] and other MIT Faculty.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The main challenge in implementing the MIT OCW initiative had not been faculty resistance, but rather, the [[logistical]] challenges presented by determining ownership and obtaining publication permission for the massive amount of [[intellectual property]] items that are embedded in the course materials of MIT's faculty, in addition to the time and technical effort required to  convert the educational materials to an online format. [[Copyright]] in MIT OpenCourseWare material remains with MIT, members of its faculty, or its students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In September 2002, the MIT OpenCourseWare proof-of-concept pilot site opened to the public, offering 32 courses. In September 2003, MIT OpenCourseWare published its 500th course, including some courses with complete streaming video lectures. By September 2004, 900 MIT courses were available online.

In 2005, MIT OpenCourseWare and other leading [[open educational resources]] projects formed the [[OpenCourseWare Consortium]], which seeks to extend the reach and impact of open course materials, foster new open course materials and develop sustainable models for open course material publication.

In 2007, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced a site called Highlights for High School that indexes resources on the MIT OCW applicable to advanced high school study in [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[calculus]] and [[physics]] in an effort to support US [[STEM fields|STEM]] education at the [[secondary school]] level.

In 2011, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced the first of fifteen OCW Scholar courses, which are designed specifically for the needs of independent learners.  While still publications of course materials like the rest of the site content, these courses are more in-depth and the materials are presented in logical sequences that facilitate self-study.  No interaction with other students is supported by the OCW site, but study groups on collaborating project [[OpenStudy]] are available for some OCW Scholar courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ocw-scholar/ |title=OCW Scholar courses |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014|08}}, some MIT OCW courses are delivered by the European MooC platform [[Eliademy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irving Singer |authorlink=Irving Singer |url=https://eliademy.com/catalog/oer/philosophy-of-love-in-the-western-world.html |title=Philosophy of Love in the Western World |publisher=MIT OCW |work=Eliademy.com |date=Fall 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-19 |quote=Based on a work at http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-261-philosophy-of-love-in-the-western-world-fall-2004/.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
MIT OCW was originally served by a custom [[content management system]] based on [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Microsoft Content Management Server|Content Management Server]], which was replaced in mid-2010 with a [[Plone (software)|Plone]]-based content management system. The publishing process is described by MIT as a "large-scale digital publishing infrastructure consists of planning tools, a content management system (CMS), and the MIT OpenCourseWare content distribution infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/help/faq4/index.htm |title=Free Online Course Materials &amp;#124; FAQ: Technology &amp;#124; MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video content for the courses were originally primarily in [[RealMedia]] format.  In 2008, OCW transitioned to using [[YouTube]] as the primary digital video streaming platform for the site, embedding YouTube video back into the OCW site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT |title=MIT |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCW video and audio files are also provided in full for offline downloads on iTunesU and the [[Internet Archive]].  In 2011, OCW introduced an iPhone App called LectureHall in partnership with Irynsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/about/media-coverage/press-releases/iphone-lecturehall |title=Free Online Course Materials &amp;#124; MIT OpenCourseWare Announces iPhone App for Video Lectures &amp;#124; MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327130556/http://ocw.mit.edu/about/media-coverage/press-releases/iphone-lecturehall/ |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
{{as of|2013}}, the annual cost of running MIT OCW is about $3.5 million. "MIT's goal for the next decade is to increase our reach ten-fold" and to secure funding for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[MIT OCW]]|title=A Decade of Open Sharing|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/about/next-decade/|date=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahavihara''' ({{IAST|Mahāvihāra}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term for a great [[vihara]] (Buddhist monastery) and is used to describe a monastic complex of viharas.

==Mahaviharas of India==
A range of monasteries grew up in ancient [[Magadha]] (modern [[Bihar]]) and [[Bengal]]. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out during the [[Pala empire|Pāla]] period: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapurā, and Jaggadala.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-329-X}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The five monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them . . it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 352-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nalanda===
{{Main|Nalanda}}
The famous Nalanda Mahavihara was founded a few centuries earlier; [[Xuanzang]] speaks about its magnificence and grandeur. Reference to this monastery is found in Tibetan and Chinese sources. During the Pāla period, Nālānda was less singularly outstanding, as other Pālā establishments "must have drawn away a number of learned monks from Nālānda when all of the  . . came under the aegis of the Pālās."&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 344&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the fame of this monastery lingered even after the Pala period.

===Odantapura===
{{Main|Odantapura}}
Odantapuri, also called Odantapura or Uddandapura, was a Buddhist vihara in what is now Bihar, India. It was established by King Gopala of the Pala dynasty in the 7th century. It is considered the second oldest of India's universities and was situated in Magadh. Currently it is known as the Bihar Sharif city (Headquarters of Nalanda District). Acharya Sri Ganga of Vikramashila had been a student here. According to the Tibetan records there were about 12,000 students at Odantapuri. Odantpuri was situated at a mountain called Hiranya Prabhat Parvat and the bank of the river Panchanan.

===Vikramashila===
{{Main|Vikramashila}}
Reference to a monastery known as Vikramashila is found in Tibetan records. The Pala ruler Dharmapala was its founder. The exact site of this vihara is at Antichak, a small village in Bhagalpur district (Bihar). The monastery had 107 temples and 50 other institutions providing room for 108 monks. It attracted scholars from neighbouring countries.

==Mahaviharas of Bangladesh==

===Somapura===
{{Main|Somapura}}
Somapura Mahavihara was located at Paharpur, 46.5&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west of [[Mahasthangarh]] in [[Bangladesh]]. The available data suggests that the Pala ruler Dharmapala founded the vihara. It followed the traditional [[cruciform]] plan for the central shrine. There were 177 individual cells around the central courtyard. There were central blocks in the middle of the eastern, southern and western sides. These might have been subsidiary chapels. It was the premier vihara of its kind and its fame lingered till the 11th century CE.

===Jagaddala===
{{Main|Jagaddala}}
Jagaddala Mahavihara was a [[Buddhist]] monastery and seat of learning in [[Varendra]], a geographical unit in present north Bengal.&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 377"&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 377&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by the later kings of the [[Pāla dynasty]], probably [[Ramapala]] ({{circa|1077|1120}}), most likely at a site near the present village of Jagdal in [[Dhamoirhat Upazila]] in the north-west [[Bangladesh]] on the border with India,  near Paharapur.&lt;ref name="UNESCO World Heritage website"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1212/ UNESCO World Heritage website]&lt;/ref&gt;



===Shalban Vihara===
{{Main|Shalban Vihara}}
also known as Bhavadev Bihar is another large monastery which flourished between 7th to 12th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shalvan_Vihara |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Located in Comilla, Bangladesh,it was established by King Bhava Deva in the Lalmai Hills Ridge.

==Mahavihara of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka==
{{Main|Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya}}
The '''Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya''' ([[Pāli|Pali]] for "Great Monastery") was an important monastery for [[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was founded by king [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (247–207 BCE) in his capital [[Anuradhapura]]. The Mahavihara was the place where the Mahavihara orthodoxy was established by monks such as [[Buddhaghosa]]. The traditional Theravadin account provided by the Mahavamsa stands in contrast to the writings of the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] monk [[Faxian]] (Ch. 法顯), who journeyed to [[India]] and Sri Lanka in the early 5th century (between 399 and 414 CE). He recorded that the Mahavihara was not only intact, but housed 3000 monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter XXXIX: The Cremation of an Arhat |work=A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2124 |accessdate=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microelectromechanical systems''' ('''MEMS''', also written as ''micro-electro-mechanical'',  ''MicroElectroMechanical'' or ''microelectronic and microelectromechanical systems'' and the related ''micromechatronics'') is the technology of microscopic devices, particularly those with moving parts. It merges at the nano-scale into [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS) and [[nanotechnology]]. MEMS are also referred to as [[Micromachinery|micromachines]] in Japan, or ''micro systems technology'' (''MST'') in Europe.

MEMS are made up of components between 1 and 100 micrometers in size (i.e., 0.001 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm), and MEMS devices generally range in size from 20 micrometres to a millimetre (i.e., 0.02 to 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm), although components arranged in arrays (e.g., [[digital micromirror device]]s) can be more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Small_Machines_Large_Opportunities.html?id=7lKytgAACAAJ|title=Small Machines, Large Opportunities: A Report on the Emerging Field of Microdynamics : Report of the Workshop on Microelectromechanical Systems Research ; Sponsored by the National Science Foundation|last=Kaigham|first=Gabriel|last2=Jarvis|first2=John|last3=Trimmer|first3=William|publisher=AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They usually consist of a central unit that processes data (the microprocessor) and several components that interact with the surroundings such as microsensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste| author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner | title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |place = London |year = 2008 |page = 205 |isbn = 1-84821-009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the large surface area to volume ratio of MEMS, forces produced by ambient [[electromagnetism]] (e.g., electrostatic charges and [[magnetic moment]]s), and fluid dynamics (e.g., [[surface tension]] and [[viscosity]]) are more important design considerations than with larger scale mechanical devices. MEMS technology is distinguished from [[molecular nanotechnology]] or [[molecular electronics]] in that the latter must also consider [[surface chemistry]].

The potential of very small machines was appreciated before the technology existed that could make them (see, for example, [[Richard Feynman]]'s famous 1959 lecture [[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]). MEMS became practical once they could be fabricated using modified [[semiconductor device fabrication]] technologies, normally used to make [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=James B.

==Materials for MEMS manufacturing==
The fabrication of MEMS evolved from the process technology in [[semiconductor device fabrication]], i.e. the basic techniques are [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] of material layers, patterning by [[photolithography]] and etching to produce the required shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=R. Ghodssi |author2=P.

===Silicon===
[[Silicon]] is the material used to create most [[integrated circuit]]s used in consumer electronics in the modern industry.  The [[economies of scale]], ready availability of inexpensive high-quality materials, and ability to incorporate electronic functionality make silicon attractive for a wide variety of MEMS applications.  Silicon also has significant advantages engendered through its material properties.  In single crystal form, silicon is an almost perfect [[Hooke's law|Hookean]] material, meaning that when it is flexed there is virtually no [[hysteresis]] and hence almost no energy dissipation.  As well as making for highly repeatable motion, this also makes silicon very reliable as it suffers very little [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and can have service lifetimes in the range of [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] to [[1000000000000 (number)|trillions]] of cycles without breaking.

===Polymers===
Even though the electronics industry provides an economy of scale for the silicon industry, crystalline silicon is still a complex and relatively expensive material to produce.  Polymers on the other hand can be produced in huge volumes, with a great variety of material characteristics.  MEMS devices can be made from polymers by processes such as [[injection molding]], [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]] or [[stereolithography]] and are especially well suited to [[microfluidic]] applications such as disposable blood testing cartridges.

===Metals===
Metals can also be used to create MEMS elements.  While metals do not have some of the advantages displayed by silicon in terms of mechanical properties, when used within their limitations, metals can exhibit very high degrees of reliability. Metals can be deposited by electroplating, evaporation, and sputtering processes. Commonly used metals include [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]], [[platinum]], and [[silver]].

===Ceramics===
The [[nitride]]s of silicon, aluminium and titanium as well as [[silicon carbide]] and other [[ceramic]]s are increasingly applied in MEMS fabrication due to advantageous combinations of material properties. [[aluminium nitride|AlN]] crystallizes in the [[wurtzite structure]] and thus shows [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] and [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties enabling sensors, for instance, with sensitivity to normal and shear forces.&lt;ref name= PC2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T.

==MEMS basic processes==

===Deposition processes===
One of the basic building blocks in MEMS processing is the ability to deposit thin films of material with a thickness anywhere between one micrometre, to about 100 micrometres. The NEMS process is the same, although the measurement of film deposition ranges from a few nanometres to one micrometre. There are two types of deposition processes, as follows.

====Physical deposition====
Physical vapor deposition ("PVD") consists of a process in which a material is removed from a target, and deposited on a surface.  Techniques to do this include the process of [[sputtering]], in which an ion beam liberates atoms from a target, allowing them to move through the intervening space and deposit on the desired substrate, and  [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation]], in which a material is evaporated from a target using either heat (thermal evaporation) or an electron beam (e-beam evaporation) in a vacuum system.

====Chemical deposition====
Chemical deposition techniques include chemical vapor deposition ("CVD"), in which a stream of source gas reacts on the substrate to grow the material desired.  This can be further divided into categories depending on the details of the technique, for example, [[LPCVD]] (Low Pressure chemical vapor deposition) and PECVD ([[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]]).

Oxide films can also be grown by the technique of [[thermal oxidation]], in which the (typically silicon) wafer is exposed to oxygen and/or steam, to grow a thin surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]].

===Patterning===
Patterning in MEMS is the transfer of a pattern into a material.

====Lithography====
Lithography in MEMS context is typically the transfer of a pattern into a photosensitive material by selective exposure to a radiation source such as light. A photosensitive material is a material that experiences a change in its physical properties when exposed to a radiation source. If a photosensitive material is selectively exposed to radiation (e.g. by masking some of the radiation) the pattern of the radiation on the material is transferred to the material exposed, as the properties of the exposed and unexposed regions differs.

This exposed region can then be removed or treated providing a mask for the underlying substrate.  [[Photolithography]] is typically used with metal or other thin film deposition, wet and dry etching. Sometimes, photolithography is used to create structure without any kind of post etching. One example is SU8 based lens where SU8 based square blocks are generated. Then the photoresist is melted to form a semi-sphere  which acts as a lens.

====Electron beam lithography====
{{Main|Electron beam lithography}}
Electron beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography) is the practice of scanning a beam of [[electron]]s in a patterned fashion across a surface covered with a film (called the [[resist]]),&lt;ref name="mccord"&gt;{{cite book |last= McCord |first=M. A. |author2=M. J. Rooks |title=SPIE Handbook of Microlithography, Micromachining and Microfabrication|year=2000 |chapter=2|url=http://www.cnf.cornell.edu/cnf_spietoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("exposing" the resist) and of selectively removing either exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist ("developing"). The purpose, as with [[photolithography]], is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching. It was developed for manufacturing [[integrated circuit]]s, and is also used for creating [[nanotechnology]] architectures.

The primary advantage of electron beam lithography is that it is one of the ways to beat the [[diffraction limit]] of light and make features in the [[nanometer]] range.  This form of [[maskless lithography]] has found wide usage in [[photomask]]-making used in [[photolithography]], low-volume production of semiconductor components, and research &amp; development.

The key limitation of electron beam lithography is throughput, i.e., the very long time it takes to expose an entire silicon wafer or glass substrate. A long exposure time leaves the user vulnerable to beam drift or instability which may occur during the exposure. Also, the turn-around time for reworking or re-design is lengthened unnecessarily if the pattern is not being changed the second time.

====Ion beam lithography====
It is known that focused-[[ion beam lithography]] has the capability of writing extremely fine lines (less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm line and space has been achieved) without proximity effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, because the writing field in ion-beam lithography is quite small, large area patterns must be created by stitching together the small fields.

====Ion track technology====
[[Ion track technology]] is a deep cutting tool with a resolution limit around 8&amp;nbsp;nm applicable to radiation resistant minerals, glasses and polymers. It is capable of generating holes in thin films without any development process. Structural depth can be defined either by ion range or by material thickness. Aspect ratios up to several 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; can be reached. The technique can shape and texture materials at a defined inclination angle. Random pattern, single-ion track structures and aimed pattern consisting of individual single tracks can be generated.

====X-ray lithography====
[[X-ray lithography]] is a process used in electronic industry to selectively remove parts of a thin film. It uses X-rays to transfer a geometric pattern from a mask to a light-sensitive chemical photoresist, or simply "resist", on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then engraves the produced pattern into the material underneath the photoresist.

====Diamond patterning====
A simple way to carve or create  patterns on the surface of nanodiamonds without damaging them could lead to a new photonic devices.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Diamond patterning is a method of forming diamond MEMS.  It is achieved by the lithographic application of diamond films to a substrate such as silicon.  The patterns can be formed by selective deposition through a silicon dioxide mask, or by deposition followed by micromachining or focused [[Ion milling machine|ion beam milling]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc J. Madou, ''Fundamentals of Microfabrication and Nanotechnology, Volume III: From MEMS to Bio-MEMS and Bio-NEMS: Manufacturing Techniques and Applications'', p. 252, CRC Press, 2011 {{ISBN|1439895244}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etching processes===
There are two basic categories of etching processes: [[Etching (microfabrication)|wet etching]] and [[dry etching]].  In the former, the material is dissolved when immersed in a chemical solution.  In the latter, the material is sputtered or dissolved using reactive ions or a vapor phase etchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/84.546406|title=Etch rates for micromachining processing|year=1996|last1=Williams|first1=K.R.|last2=Muller|first2=R.S.|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|volume=5|page=256|issue=4|url=http://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~ee245/fa07/lectures/WetEtchRates.WilliamsMuller.00546406.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bulk"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/5.704259|title=Bulk micromachining of silicon|year=1998|last1=Kovacs|first1=G.T.A.|last2=Maluf|first2=N.I.|last3=Petersen|first3=K.E.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=86|page=1536|issue=8|url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/class/enee416.S2004/Bulk-Micromachining.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wet etching====
{{Main|Etching (microfabrication)}}
Wet chemical etching consists in selective removal of material by dipping a substrate into a solution that dissolves it. The chemical nature of this etching process provides a good selectivity, which means the etching rate of the target material is considerably higher than the mask material if selected carefully.

=====Isotropic etching=====
Etching progresses at the same speed in all directions. Long and narrow holes in a mask will produce v-shaped grooves in the silicon.  The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, with dimensions and angles being extremely accurate.

=====Anisotropic etching=====
Some single crystal materials, such as silicon, will have different etching rates depending on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. This is known as anisotropic etching and one of the most common examples is the etching of silicon in KOH (potassium hydroxide), where Si &lt;111&gt; planes etch approximately 100 times slower than other planes ([[crystallography|crystallographic orientations]]). Therefore, etching a rectangular hole in a (100)-Si wafer results in a pyramid shaped etch pit with 54.7° walls, instead of a hole with curved sidewalls as with isotropic etching.

=====HF etching=====
[[Hydrofluoric acid]] is commonly used as an aqueous etchant for silicon dioxide ({{chem|SiO|2}}, also known as BOX for SOI), usually in 49% concentrated form, 5:1, 10:1 or 20:1 BOE ([[buffered oxide etch]]ant) or BHF (Buffered HF). They were first used in medieval times for glass etching. It was used in IC fabrication for patterning the gate oxide until the process step was replaced by RIE.

Hydrofluoric acid is considered one of the more dangerous acids in the [[cleanroom]]. It penetrates the skin upon contact and it diffuses straight to the bone. Therefore, the damage is not felt until it is too late.

=====Electrochemical etching=====
Electrochemical etching (ECE) for dopant-selective removal of silicon is a common method to automate and to selectively control etching.  An active p-n [[diode]] junction is required, and either type of dopant can be the etch-resistant ("etch-stop") material.  Boron is the most common etch-stop dopant.  In combination with wet anisotropic etching as described above, ECE has been used successfully for controlling silicon diaphragm thickness in commercial piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors.  Selectively doped regions can be created either by implantation, diffusion, or epitaxial deposition of silicon.

====Dry etching====
{{Main|Dry etching}}
=====Vapor etching=====

======Xenon difluoride======
[[Xenon difluoride]] ({{chem|XeF|2}}) is a dry vapor phase isotropic etch for silicon originally applied for MEMS in 1995 at University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.220933|title=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|year=1995|last1=Chang|first1=Floy I.|page=117|volume=2641|chapter=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|series=Microelectronic Structures and Microelectromechanical Devices for Optical Processing and Multimedia Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=M.S. |title=Xenon difluoride etching of silicon for MEMS |last=Chang |first=Floy I-Jung |year=1995 |publisher=University of California |location=Los Angeles |oclc=34531873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily used for releasing metal and dielectric structures by undercutting silicon, {{chem|XeF|2}} has the advantage of a [[stiction]]-free release unlike wet etchants.  Its etch selectivity to silicon is very high, allowing it to work with photoresist, {{chem|SiO|2}}, silicon nitride, and various metals for masking.  Its reaction to silicon is "plasmaless", is purely chemical and spontaneous and is often operated in pulsed mode.  Models of the etching action are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290690|year=2004|last1=Brazzle|first1=J.D.|last2=Dokmeci|title=17th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. Maastricht MEMS 2004 Technical Digest|first2=M.R.|last3=Mastrangelo|first3=C.H.|page=737|chapter=Modeling and characterization of sacrificial polysilicon etching using vapor-phase xenon difluoride|isbn=0-7803-8265-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and university laboratories and various commercial tools offer solutions using this approach.

=====Plasma etching=====
Modern VLSI processes avoid wet etching, and use [[plasma etching]] instead. Plasma etchers can operate in several modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic.

Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching.

The source gas for the plasma usually contains small molecules rich in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) etches silicon and aluminium, and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to oxidize ("ash") photoresist and facilitate its removal.

Ion milling, or sputter etching, uses lower pressures, often as low as 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar+, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity. Reactive-ion etching (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10–3 and 10−1 Torr). Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.

======Sputtering======
{{Main|Sputtering}}

======Reactive ion etching (RIE)======
{{Main|Reactive-ion etching}}
In reactive-ion etching (RIE), the substrate is placed inside a reactor, and several gases are introduced. A plasma is struck in the gas mixture using an RF power source, which breaks the gas molecules into ions. The ions accelerate towards, and react with, the surface of the material being etched, forming another gaseous material. This is known as the chemical part of reactive ion etching. There is also a physical part, which is similar to the sputtering deposition process. If the ions have high enough energy, they can knock atoms out of the material to be etched without a chemical reaction. It is a very complex task to develop dry etch processes that balance chemical and physical etching, since there are many parameters to adjust. By changing the balance it is possible to influence the anisotropy of the etching, since the chemical part is isotropic and the physical part highly anisotropic the combination can form sidewalls that have shapes from rounded to vertical.
{{Main|Deep reactive ion etching}}

Deep RIE (DRIE) is a special subclass of RIE that is growing in popularity. In this process, etch depths of hundreds of micrometres are achieved with almost vertical sidewalls. The primary technology is based on the so-called "Bosch process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/SENSOR.2005.1497272|year=2005|last1=Laermer|first1=F.|last2=Urban|title=The 13th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, 2005. Digest of Technical Papers. TRANSDUCERS '05|first2=A.|page=1118|volume=2|chapter=Milestones in deep reactive ion etching|isbn=0-7803-8994-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the German company Robert Bosch, which filed the original patent, where two different gas compositions alternate in the reactor. Currently there are two variations of the DRIE. The first variation consists of three distinct steps (the original Bosch process) while the second variation only consists of two steps.

In the first variation, the etch cycle is as follows:

(i) {{chem|SF|6}} isotropic etch;&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) {{chem|C|4|F|8}} passivation;&lt;br /&gt;
(iii) {{chem|SF|6}} anisoptropic etch for floor cleaning.

In the 2nd variation, steps (i) and (iii) are combined.

Both variations operate similarly.  The {{chem|C|4|F|8}} creates a polymer on the surface of the substrate, and the second gas composition ({{chem|SF|6}} and {{chem|O|2}}) etches the substrate. The polymer is immediately sputtered away by the physical part of the etching, but only on the horizontal surfaces and not the sidewalls. Since the polymer only dissolves very slowly in the chemical part of the etching, it builds up on the sidewalls and protects them from etching. As a result, etching aspect ratios of 50 to 1 can be achieved. The process can easily be used to etch completely through a silicon substrate, and etch rates are 3–6 times higher than wet etching.

===Die preparation===
After preparing a large number of MEMS devices on a [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]], individual [[die (integrated circuit)|dies]] have to be separated, which is called [[die preparation]] in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by [[wafer backgrinding]] in order to reduce the wafer thickness. [[Wafer dicing]] may then be performed either by sawing using a cooling liquid or a dry laser process called [[wafer dicing#Stealth dicing|stealth dicing]].

==MEMS manufacturing technologies==

===Bulk micromachining===
{{Main|Bulk micromachining}}
Bulk micromachining is the oldest paradigm of silicon based MEMS. The whole thickness of a silicon wafer is used for building the micro-mechanical structures.&lt;ref name="bulk"/&gt; Silicon is machined using various [[#Etching processes|etching processes]]. [[Anodic bonding]] of glass plates or additional silicon wafers is used for adding features in the third dimension and for hermetic encapsulation. Bulk micromachining has been essential in enabling high performance [[pressure sensor]]s and [[accelerometer]]s that changed the sensor industry in the 1980s and 90's.

===Surface micromachining===
{{Main|Surface micromachining}}
Surface micromachining uses layers deposited on the surface of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bustillo | first1 = J. M.| last2 = Howe | first2 = R. T.| last3 = Muller | first3 = R. S.| doi = 10.1109/5.704260 | title = Surface Micromachining for Microelectromechanical Systems | journal = [[Proceedings of the IEEE]]| url = http://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/sclu/surface_micromachining.pdf| volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1552–1574| date=August 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.120.4059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface micromachining was created in the late 1980s to render micromachining of silicon more compatible with planar integrated circuit technology, with the goal of combining MEMS and [[integrated circuit]]s on the same silicon wafer. The original surface micromachining concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost [[accelerometer]]s for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. [[Analog Devices]] has pioneered the industrialization of surface micromachining and has realized the co-integration of MEMS and integrated circuits.

===High aspect ratio (HAR) silicon micromachining===
Both bulk and surface silicon micromachining are used in the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, [[deep reactive-ion etching]], has made it possible to combine good performance typical of [[bulk micromachining]] with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of [[surface micromachining]]. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2&amp;nbsp;µm, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon micromachining.

==Industry structure==
The global market for micro-electromechanical systems, which includes products such as automobile airbag systems, display systems and inkjet cartridges totaled $40 billion in 2006 according to Global MEMS/Microsystems Markets and Opportunities, a research report from [[SEMI]] and Yole Developpement and is forecasted to reach $72 billion by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=4479 Worldwide MEMS Systems Market Forecasted to Reach $72 Billion by 2011]. Azonano.com (2007-07-17). Retrieved on 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies with strong MEMS programs come in many sizes. Larger firms specialize in manufacturing high volume inexpensive components or packaged solutions for end markets such as automobiles, biomedical, and electronics.  Smaller firms provide value in innovative solutions and absorb the expense of custom fabrication with high sales margins. Both large and small companies typically invest in [[R&amp;D]] to explore new MEMS technology.

The market for materials and equipment used to manufacture MEMS devices topped $1 billion worldwide in 2006. Materials demand is driven by substrates, making up over 70 percent of the market, packaging coatings and increasing use of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). While MEMS manufacturing continues to be dominated by used semiconductor equipment, there is a migration to 200&amp;nbsp;mm lines and select new tools, including etch and bonding for certain MEMS applications.

Nuruk, a Traditional Korean Fermentation Starter, contains the Bioactive Compound 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,6-DMBQ). Online.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to make different types of [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] including ''[[takju]]'', ''[[Cheongju (beverage)|cheongju]]'', and [[soju]].&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt; It is an essential ingredient in Shindari and is mixed with rice (Nowicki 22).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nowicki, Stephen. Holt McDougal Biology. Orlando, FL: Holt McDougal, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, it was used in a variety of provinces of [[Korea]], including [[Jeju Island]].

[[Wheat]], [[rice]] (of both the [[glutinous]] and non-glutinous types), and [[barley]] are used to make ''nuruk,'' either as whole grain or in the form of grits or flour.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yokotsuka"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Yokotsuka|first=T.|editor-last=Wood|editor-first=Brian J.

== Origin ==

Chinese history records the first use of ''nuruk'' in Korea in 1123 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1847809&amp;cid=48180&amp;categoryId=48258|title=전통누룩의 역사|website=terms.naver.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar fermentation starter was first made in [[China]] during the [[Warring States period]] beginning in the 5th century BCE, and ''nuruk'' has been used in Korea since the period of the [[Three Kingdoms]] in the 3rd century CE.

Traditionally, ''nuruk'' was prepared on a small scale by families in summer or autumn, especially in July when the ambient temperature is between {{Convert|20-30|C}} on the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yokotsuka" /&gt; It has been mass-produced in factories since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuruk, a Traditional Korean Fermentation Starter, Contains the Bioactive." Ve Compound 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,6-DMBQ). Web. 16 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fermentation process ==

[[Fermentation]] is a metabolic process in which an organism converts carbohydrate, such as a sugar, into an alcohol or an acid. Fermentation is an anaerobic process (Nowicki 2),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; meaning the living organisms involved in this process do not require oxygen to breathe. A small amount of ATP can be produced without [[oxygen]]. Wine, beer, and yogurt are produced through fermentation. In Korea, popular fermented foods include “[[Kimchi]]” and soybean paste. If the result is harmful or smelly, it is called "spoilage," but if it is useful, then it is called "fermentation."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Helmenstine, Ph.D. Anne Marie. "What Is Fermentation?"Chemistry.about.com., 29 Nov. 2014. Web. 05 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, it contains [[2,6-Dimethoxybenzoquinone]] (2,6-DMBQ), also found in fermented wheat germ extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1077999&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=32099|title=누룩|website=terms.naver.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms present in ''nuruk'' include ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Rhizopus]]'', and yeasts.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yokotsuka" /&gt; Together with yeast, ''nuruk'' is used in rice alcohol production in Korea, as it provides the enzyme [[amylase]].&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt;

Korea has four seasons with distinct temperature and humidity. Summer, with high temperature and humidity, is best for farming.&lt;ref&gt;Nuruk, a Traditional Korean Fermentation Starter, Contains the Bioactive."Ve Compound 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,6-DMBQ), 01 Oct. 2011. Web. 05 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the sweet fruit of the west was unavailable, staple grains including rice and barley made it easy to produce and distribute the mold necessary for ''nuruk''.

== Health benefits ==

Fermented foods provide friendly organisms for the flora across the digestive system that are necessary for normal digestive function and protect the flora of gut from harmful organisms. Fermented foods also have been broken down or “pre-digested" and therefore, unlike ordinary carbohydrates, place a lighter burden on the digestion system. They have many additional benefits (Helmenstine 25-28).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fermented food and drink such as Shindari are said to improve the immune system, prevent cancer, and increase beneficial bacteria in the digestive system, balancing the production of stomach acid and aiding nutrient absorption.&lt;ref&gt;"Mycoflora Dynamics Analysis of Korean Traditional Wheat-based Nuruk." - Springer. Web. 04 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional fermented food helps the body to produce acetylcholine. It is especially beneficial for people with diabetes.

A '''pentamirror''' is an optical device used in the [[viewfinder]] systems of various [[single-lens reflex]] [[camera]]s instead of the [[pentaprism]]. It is used to reverse again the laterally reversed image coming from the reflex mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Stensvold. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Photography Like a Pro'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cXy-yzb_nqgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=pentamirror&amp;lr=&amp;hl=it page 26].&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of the solid block of glass of the prism in pentaprism system, here 3 mirrors are used to perform the same task. This is cheaper and lighter, but generally produces a viewfinder image of lower quality and brightness.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Busch. ''Digital Photography All-in-One Desk Reference for Dummies'', 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-XENqZmgWm0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=pentamirror&amp;lr=&amp;hl=it page 106].&lt;/ref&gt;

This optical device is often (more precisely) referred to as ''roof pentamirror'' because of the roof-like ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Yoder. ''Opto-Mechanical Systems Design'', 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukkZuvSSeUQC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=%22roof+pentamirror%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=it page 435].&lt;/ref&gt;

The program aims to provide practical experience for its students, who work with RAND analysts on real-world problems. The campus is at RAND's Santa Monica research facility. The Pardee RAND School is the world's largest PhD-granting program in policy analysis.&lt;ref name=PardeeRAND&gt;{{cite web|title=Pardee RAND History|url=http://www.prgs.edu/about/at-a-glance.html|website=Pardee RAND Graduate School|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other universities, all Pardee RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships to cover their education costs. This allows them to dedicate their time to engage in research projects and provides them on-the-job training.&lt;ref name=PardeeRAND/&gt; RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff member.&lt;ref name=RANDglance&gt;{{cite web|title=RAND at a Glance|url=https://www.rand.org/about/glance.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAND publishes the ''[[RAND Journal of Economics]]'', a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal of economics.

==Project RAND==
General [[Henry H. Arnold]], commander of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], established '''Project RAND''' with the objective of looking into long-range planning of future weapons.&lt;ref name=RANDhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Stephen B|title=The United States Air Force and the Culture of Innovation 1945-1965|date=2002|publisher=Diane Publishing|isbn=9781428990272|page=32|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100526-019.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1946 [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] was granted a contract for research on intercontinental warfare, using [[operations research]]. In May 1946 the ''[[Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship]]'' was released. In May 1948, Project RAND separated from Douglas and became an independent [[non-profit organization]] as Douglas Aircraft feared it would create conflicts of interest jeopardizing future hardware contracts. Initial capital for the spin-off was provided by the [[Ford Foundation]].

==History==
[[File:Randcorporationsantamonica.JPG|thumb|left|RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California]]
RAND was created after individuals in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], and industry  began to discuss the need for a private organization to connect military planning with research and development decisions.&lt;ref name=RANDglance/&gt; On 1 October 1945, Project RAND was set up under special contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company and began operations in December 1945.&lt;ref name=RANDglance/&gt; By late 1947, Project RAND considered operating as a separate organization from Douglas and in February 1948, the Chief of Staff of the newly created United States Air Force wrote a letter to the president of the Douglas Aircraft Company that approved the evolution of Project RAND into a nonprofit corporation, independent of Douglas.&lt;ref name=RANDglance/&gt; On 14 May 1948, RAND was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of California and on 1 November 1948, the Project RAND contract was formally transferred from the Douglas Aircraft Company to the RAND Corporation.&lt;ref name=RANDglance/&gt;

Since the 1950s, RAND research has helped inform United States policy decisions on a wide variety of issues, including the space race, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms confrontation, the creation of the Great Society social welfare programs, the digital revolution, and national health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jardini|first=David R. |title=Thinking Through the Cold War: RAND, National Security and Domestic Policy, 1945-1975|year=2013|page=10|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/352765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most visible contribution may be the doctrine of [[nuclear deterrence]] by [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), developed under the guidance of then-Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and based upon their work with [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twing|first=Steven W.|title=Myths, models &amp; U.S. foreign policy|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-55587-766-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS4A2jJph_cC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief strategist [[Herman Kahn]] also posited the idea of a "winnable" nuclear exchange in his 1960 book ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]''. This led to Kahn being one of the models for the titular character of the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr.&amp;nbsp;Strangelove]]'', in which RAND is spoofed as the "BLAND Corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-week-in-radio-the-think-tank-for-unthinkable-thoughts-765975.html |title=The Week In Radio: The think tank for unthinkable thoughts |last=Hanks |first=Robert |date=19 December 2007 |work=The Independent |location= London |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/movies/10kapl.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Truth Stranger Than 'Strangelove' |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |authorlink=Fred Kaplan (journalist) |date=10 October 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
RAND was incorporated as a non-profit organization to "further promote scientific, educational, and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare and security of the United States of America". Its self-declared mission is "to help improve policy and decision making through research and analysis", using its "core values of quality and objectivity".&lt;ref name=RANDvision/&gt;

==Achievements==
[[Image:RANDPittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|RAND Corporation, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]]]
The achievements of RAND stem from its development of [[systems analysis]]. Important contributions are claimed in space systems and the United States' [[space program]],&lt;ref name=RANDspacebook&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies|first1=Merton E.|last2=Hams|first2=William R.|title=RAND's Role in the Evolution of Balloon and Satellite Observation Systems and Related U.S. Space Technology|date=September 1988|publisher=RAND Corp|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a216963.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in computing and in [[artificial intelligence]].

Current areas of expertise include: child policy, [[civil justice|civil]] and [[criminal justice]], education, health, international policy, [[labor market]]s, national security, infrastructure, energy, environment, corporate governance, economic development, intelligence policy, long-range planning, crisis management and disaster preparation, [[World population|population]] and [[regional studies]], science and technology, [[social welfare]], terrorism, arts policy, and transportation.&lt;ref name=RANDpolicyexperts&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Experts|url=https://www.rand.org/about/people.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAND designed and conducted one of the largest and most important studies of health insurance between 1974 and 1982. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]], funded by the then–U.S. [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], established an insurance corporation to compare demand for health services with their cost to the patient.&lt;ref name=RANDhie&gt;{{cite web |title=RAND's Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)|url=https://www.rand.org/health/projects/hie.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herdman|first1=Roger C.|last2=Behney|first2=Clyde J.|title=Chapter 3: The Lessons and Limitations of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment |journal=Benefit Design in Health Care Reform: Patient Cost-Sharing|date=September 1993|issue=[[Princeton University]]|pages=23–38|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk1/1993/9310/9310.PDF |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2005 annual report, "about one-half of RAND's research involves national security issues". Many of the events in which RAND plays a part are based on assumptions which are hard to verify because of the lack of detail on RAND's highly classified work for defense and intelligence agencies. The RAND Corporation posts all of its unclassified reports in full on its website.

'''Retrofitting''' refers to the addition of new technology or features to older systems.
* [[power plant]] retrofit, improving power plant efficiency / increasing output / reducing emissions
* [[home energy retrofit]], the improving of existing buildings with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] equipment
* [[seismic retrofit]], the process of strengthening older buildings in order to make them earthquake resistant
* Naval vessels often undergo retrofitting in dry dock to incorporate new technologies, change their operational designation, or compensate for perceived weaknesses in their design or gun plan.

==Benefits of a retrofit==
* Saving on [[capital expenditure]] while benefiting from new technologies
* Optimization of existing plant components
* Adaptation of the plant for new or changed products
* Increase in piece number and cycle time
* Guaranteed spare parts availability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma-automation.com/Retrofitting.1520.0.html?&amp;L=1, article on retrofit, retrieved on 4 June 2010]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.controleng.com/single-article/controls-retrofit-boosts-printing-production-for-packaging-manufacturer/dc88d98fd08caf326e1458d61f97b548.html|title=Controls retrofit boosts printing production for packaging manufacturer {{!}} Control Engineering|website=www.controleng.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
Principally retrofitting describes the measures taken in the manufacturing industry to allow new or updated parts to be fitted to old or outdated assemblies (like blades to wind turbines).

The production of retrofit parts is necessary in manufacture when the design of a large assembly is changed or revised. If, after the changes have been implemented, a customer (with an old version of the product) wishes to purchase a replacement part then retrofit parts and assembling techniques will have to be used so that the revised parts will fit suitably onto the older assembly.

Retrofitting is an important process used for valves and actuators to ensure optimal operation of an industrial plant. One example is retrofitting a 3-way valve into a 2-way valve, which results in closing one of the three openings to continue using the valve for certain industrial systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.baelzna.com/blog/chilled-water-system-valves|title=3-Way Valves Vs. 2-Way Valves in a Chilled Water Systems|last=America|first=Baelz North|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrofitting can improve a machine or system’s overall functionality by using advanced and updated equipment and technology—such as integrating Human Machine Interfaces into older factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/design-engineering-blogs/guest-blog-retrofit-your-way-to-industry-4-0/147234/|title=Retrofit your way to Industry 4.0|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eurekamagazine.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is [[custom car|car customizing]], where older vehicles are fitted with new technologies: [[power window]]s, [[cruise control]], [[remote keyless system]]s, electric [[fuel pump]]s, etc.

==Environmental management==
The term is also used in the field of [[environmental engineering]], particularly to describe [[construction]] or renovation projects on previously built sites, to improve [[water quality]] in nearby [[stream]]s, [[river]]s or [[lake]]s. The concept has also been applied to changing the output mix of [[energy]] from [[power plant]]s to [[cogeneration]] in [[urban area]]s with a potential for [[district heating]].

Sites with extensive [[impervious surface]]s (such as parking lots and rooftops) can generate high levels of [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] during rainstorms, and this can damage nearby water bodies.  These problems can often be addressed by installing new stormwater management features on the site, a process that practitioners refer to as stormwater retrofitting. Stormwater management practices used in retrofit projects include [[rain garden]]s, [[permeable paving]] and [[green roof]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD (2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080626221608/http://www.cwp.org/Store/usrm.htm#3#3 "Urban Stormwater Retrofit Practices."]&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[stream restoration]].)''

==Naval vessels==
Many naval vessels have undergone retrofitting and refitting, sometimes entire classes at once. For instance, the [[New Threat Upgrade]] program of the US Navy saw many vessels retrofitted for improved anti-air capability. Naval vessels are often retrofit for one of three reasons: to incorporate new technology, to compensate for performance gaps or weaknesses in design, or to change the ship's [[Hull classification symbol#The modern hull classification system|classification]].

Militaries of the world are often ardent adopters of the latest technology, and many technological advances have been spurred by warfare, especially in fields such as radar and radio communications. Because of this, and the significant investment that a ship hull represents, it is common for retrofitting to be performed whenever new systems are developed. This may be as small as replacing one type of radio with another, or replacing out-dated cryptography equipment with more secure methods of communication, or as major as replacing entire guns and turrets, adding armor plate, or new propulsion systems.

Other ships are retrofit to compensate for weaknesses perceived in their operational capabilities. This was the secondary purpose of the US Navy's New Threat Upgrade program, for instance. Major changes in doctrine or the art of warfare also necessitate changes, such as the anti-aircraft upgrades performed on many World War Two-era vessels as air power became a dominant part of naval strategy and tactics.

Additionally, because of the investment a hull represents, few navies scrap front-line warships. Many times smaller ships are retrofitted for patrol, coast guard, or specialized roles when they are no longer fit for duty as part of a warfleet. The Japanese [[Momi-class destroyer|Momi class]] from the interwar period, for example, was converted from destroyers to patrol boats in 1939, as they were no longer capable enough to serve in the role of destroyer. Other times classes are retrofit because they are no longer needed in warfare, due to changes in tactics. For instance, the [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS Langley]] was an aircraft carrier converted from a collier (coal carrying ship for supply coal-fired steam ships with fuel) of the Jupiter-class.

Because of the heavy use of retrofitting and refitting fictional navies also include the concept. As an example, in the Star Trek [[MMORPG]] Star Trek Online players can purchase retrofitted ships of famous Star Trek ship classes such as those manned by the protagonists of the Star Trek TV series. This is done to allow players to pilot iconic ships of the series from old series of the show that wouldn't naturally be latest-and-greatest ships due to their obsolescence or size but are retrofit to be suitable for a maximum-level player-character admiral.

[[File:Cordage en chanvre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A coil of rope]]

A '''rope''' is a group of [[yarn]]s, [[Plying|plies]], [[fiber]]s or strands that are twisted or [[braid]]ed together into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have [[tensile strength]] and so can be used for dragging and lifting. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, string, and [[twine]].

Common natural fibres for rope are [[manila hemp]], [[hemp]], [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[coir]], [[jute]], [[straw]], and [[sisal]]. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]], [[polyester]]s (e.g. [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], [[Liquid Crystal Polymer|LCP]], [[Vectran]]), [[polyethylene]] (e.g. [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|Dyneema and Spectra]]), [[Aramid]]s (e.g. [[Twaron]], [[Technora]] and [[Kevlar]]) and [[Acrylate polymer|acrylics]] (e.g. [[Dralon]]). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. [[Wire rope]] is made of steel or other metal alloys.  Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as [[silk]], [[wool]], and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. [[Rayon]] is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.

The twist of the strands in a twisted or braided rope serves not only to keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly distribute tension among the individual strands. Without any twist in the rope, the shortest strand(s) would always be supporting a much higher proportion of the total load.

== Size measurement ==
The long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope. In systems that use the "inch" (British Imperial and United States Customary Measure), large ropes over 1 inch diameter such as are used on ships are measured by their circumference in inches; smaller ropes have a nominal diameter based on the circumference divided by three (rounded-down value for pi). In metric systems of measurement, nominal diameter is given in millimetres.  The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre.  However, even sources otherwise using metric units may still give a "rope number" for large ropes, which is the circumference in inches.&lt;ref&gt;H A McKenna, J. W. S. Hearle, N O'Hear, ''Handbook of Fibre Rope Technology'', Elsevier, 2004,{{ISBN|1855739933}}, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

Rope is of paramount importance in fields as diverse as [[construction]], [[seafaring]], exploration, sports, theatre, and communications, and has been used since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kaC-1iQPwAC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=rope+used+since+prehistoric+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuIOu87vUAhVWVWMKHZNeAIUQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rope%20used%20since%20prehistoric%20times&amp;f=false |title=The Ultimate Book of Top Ten Lists: A Mind-Boggling Collection of Fun, Fascinating and Bizarre Facts on Movies, Music, Sports, Crime, Celebrities, History, Trivia and More |last=ListVerse.com |date=November 2009 |publisher=Ulysses Press |isbn=978-1-56975-715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fasten rope, many types of [[knot]]s have been invented for countless uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ropesdirect.co.uk/blog/a-brief-history-of-rope/ |title=A Brief History of Rope: 8 Times Rope has Shaped the World – Ropes Direct |date=2016-07-29 |work=Ropes Direct |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Pulley]]s redirect the pulling force to another direction, and can create [[mechanical advantage]] so that multiple strands of rope share a load and multiply the force applied to the end. [[Winch]]es and [[capstan (nautical)|capstans]] are machines designed to pull ropes.

=== Rock climbing ropes ===
[[File:Kernmantle climbing rope dynamic Sterling 10.7mm internal yarns and plies.jpg|thumb|[[Dynamic rope|Dynamic]] [[Kernmantle]] rock climbing rope with its braided sheath cut to expose the twisted core yarns and core yarn plies.]]
[[File:Kernmantle climbing rope dynamic Sterling 10.7mm cut end.jpg|thumb|Section through Kernmantle rope]]

The modern sport of [[rock climbing]] uses so-called [[Dynamic rope|"dynamic" rope]], which stretches under load in an elastic manner to absorb the energy required to [[Fall arrest|arrest a person in free fall]] without generating forces high enough to injure them. Such ropes normally use a [[Kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] construction, as described [[#kernmantle|below]]. [[Static rope|"Static" ropes]], used for example in caving, rappelling, and rescue applications, are designed for minimal stretch; they are not designed to arrest free falls.  The [[UIAA]], in concert with the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], sets climbing-rope standards and oversees testing. Any rope bearing a GUIANA or CE certification tag is suitable for climbing. Despite the hundreds of thousands of falls climbers suffer every year, there are few recorded instances of a climbing rope breaking in a fall; the cases that do are often attributable to previous damage to, or contamination of, the rope. Climbing ropes, however, do cut easily when under load. Keeping them away from sharp rock edges is imperative.

Rock climbing ropes come with either a designation for single, double or twin use. A single rope is the most common and it is intended to be used by itself, as a single strand. Single ropes range in thickness from roughly 9&amp;nbsp;mm to 11&amp;nbsp;mm. Smaller ropes are lighter, but wear out faster.  Double ropes are thinner ropes, usually 9&amp;nbsp;mm and under, and are intended for use as a pair. These ropes offer a greater margin or security against cutting, since it is unlikely that both ropes will be cut, but they complicate [[belaying]] and leading. Double ropes are usually reserved for ice and mixed climbing, where there is need for two ropes to [[rappel]] or [[Abseiling|abseil]]. They are also popular among traditional climbers, and particularly in the UK, due to the ability to clip each rope into alternating pieces of protection; allowing the ropes to stay straighter and hence reduce rope drag.
Twin ropes are not to be confused with doubles. When using twin ropes, both ropes are clipped into the same piece of protection, treating the two as a single strand. This would be favourable in a situation where there was a high chance of a rope being cut. However new lighter-weight ropes with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of rope.

The [[butterfly coil]] is a method of carrying a rope used by climbers where the rope remains attached to the climber and ready to be uncoiled at short notice. Another method of carrying a rope is the [[mountaineer's coil|alpine coil]].

=== Aerial rope ===
Rope is also an [[Corde lisse|aerial acrobatics]] circus skill, where a performer makes artistic figures on a vertical suspended rope. Tricks performed on the rope are, for example, drops, rolls and hangs.They must also be strong

== History ==
[[File:Ancient Egypt rope manufacture.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Ancient Egypt]]ians were the first to document tools for ropemaking]]

The use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and climbing dates back to [[prehistoric]] times. It is likely that the earliest "ropes" were naturally occurring lengths of plant fibre, such as vines, followed soon by the first attempts at twisting and braiding these strands together to form the first proper ropes in the modern sense of the word.  Impressions of cordage found on [[Pit fired pottery|fired clay]] provide evidence of string and rope-making technology in Europe dating back 28,000 years.&lt;ref name="stheory"&gt;{{Citation |last=Small |first=Meredith F. |title=String theory: the tradition of spinning raw fibers dates back 28,000 years. (At The Museum). |journal=Natural History |volume=111.3 |date=April 2002 |page=14(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fossil]]ized fragments of "probably two-ply laid rope of about 7&amp;nbsp;mm diameter" were found in one of the caves at [[Lascaux]], dating to approximately 15,000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="histsci14"&gt;J.C. Turner and P. van de Griend (ed.), ''The History and Science of Knots'' (Singapore: World Scientific, 1996), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 B.C. and was generally made of water reed fibres.&lt;ref&gt;(See http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Rope.html, word-for-word not sure which "plagiarized" which)&lt;/ref&gt; Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibres of [[date palm]]s, [[flax]], [[grass]], [[papyrus]], [[leather]], or animal hair. The use of such ropes pulled by thousands of workers allowed the [[Egyptians]] to move the heavy stones required to build their monuments. Starting from approximately 2800 B.C., rope made of [[hemp]] fibres was in use in China. Rope and the craft of rope making spread throughout Asia, India, and Europe over the next several thousand years.

In the Middle Ages (from the 13th to the 18th centuries), from the British Isles to Italy, ropes were constructed in [[ropewalk]]s, very long buildings where strands the full length of the rope were spread out and then ''laid up'' or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed ''[[cable length]]''. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require [[Rope splicing|splicing]] to make them long enough to use for [[sheet (sailing)|sheets]] and [[halyards]]. The strongest form of splicing is the short [[Rope splicing|splice]], which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight.{{Citation needed|reason=need citation for relative strength of short and long splices|date=October 2012}}

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew sketches of a concept for a ropemaking machine, but it was never built. Nevertheless, remarkable feats of construction were accomplished without advanced technology: In 1586, [[Domenico Fontana]] erected the 327 ton [[obelisk]] on Rome's [[Saint Peter's Square]] with a concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses, and countless pulleys and meters of rope. By the late 18th century several working machines had been built and patented.

Some rope is still made from [[natural fibre]]s, such as [[coir]] and [[sisal]], despite the dominance of [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[nylon]] and [[polypropylene]], which have become increasingly popular since the 1950s.

== Styles of rope construction ==

=== Laid or twisted rope ===
[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.png|upright|thumb|left|Illustration of the S and Z naming convention]]

Laid rope, also called twisted rope, is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern [[Western culture|Western]] history. Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist.  The [[ISO 2]] standard uses the [[Letter case|uppercase letters]] '''S''' and '''Z''' to indicate the two possible directions of twist, as suggested by the direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters.  The [[Chirality (physics)|handedness]] of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be [[Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|right-handed]], and S-twist to be left-handed.

Twisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, [[fibre]]s are gathered and [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] into [[yarn]]s. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to lay the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope.  It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.&lt;ref name="ancientartoflayingrope"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The ancient art of laying rope |author=J.

Traditionally, a three strand laid rope is called a ''plain-'' or ''[[hawser]]-laid'', a four strand rope is called ''shroud-laid'', and a larger rope formed by counter-twisting three or more multi-strand ropes together is called ''cable-laid''.&lt;ref name="seamanship"&gt;{{Citation |title=Seamanship |author=G.S. Nares |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VoBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA23#v=onepage&amp;q= |page=23 |year=1865 |publisher=James Griffin |place=London |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable-laid rope is sometimes clamped to maintain a tight counter-twist rendering the resulting [[nautical cable|cable]] virtually waterproof. Without this feature, deep water sailing (before the advent of steel chains and other lines) was largely impossible, as any appreciable length of rope for anchoring or ship to ship transfers, would become too waterlogged -- and therefore too heavy -- to lift, even with the aid of a capstan or windlass.

One property of laid rope is partial untwisting when used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp_2CANYU5wC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=rope+partially+untwists+when+used.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5poGU6_fWAhUpqVQKHQNTDc4Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=rope%20partially%20untwists%20when%20used.&amp;f=false |title=HORSEMANS GT TACK &amp; EQUIPMENT: F |last=McFarland |first=Cynthia |date=2013-08-06 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7627-9598-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or [[Deformation (mechanics)|stretching]], [[wikt:kink|kinking]], or [[wikt:hockle|hockling]] of the rope itself.  An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Twisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right-laid rope should be coiled clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope.  Rope of this type must be [[Whipped rope|bound]] at its ends by some means to prevent untwisting.

=== Braided rope ===
[[File:Braiding machine arbetes museum.jpg|thumb|250px|A rope [[braiding machine]] at the Arbetets Museum (Museum of Work) in Norrköping, Sweden]]
While rope may be made from three or more strands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kyosev |first=Y |title=Braiding technology for textiles |publisher=Elsevier/ Woodhead Pub |location=Cambridge, UK Waltham, MA, USA |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-85709-135-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern braided rope consists of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for [[Abseiling|rappelling]] or to suspend an [[arborist]]. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used as a part of a personal or group safety system.

[[Braid]]ed ropes are generally made from [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]] or high performance fibers such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|high modulus polyethylene]] (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10-15% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to [[ultraviolet]] light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Bexco [http://www.bexco.be/Fibre_properties/11411/bexconet "Fibre properties"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bairstow [http://www.bairstow.com/media/pdf/safety/N7806.pdf "Rope &amp; Fiber Comparison Guide"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Rope &amp; Cable [http://www.us-rope-cable.com/rope.html How to Match the Rope to the Job]&lt;/ref&gt;

Braided ropes (and objects like garden [[hose (tubing)|hoses]], [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] or [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] cables, etc.) that have no ''lay'' (or inherent twist) uncoil better if each alternate loop is twisted in the opposite direction, such as in figure-eight coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out.

'''Single braid''' consists of an even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either [[twill]] or [[plain weave]]. The central void may be large or small; in the former case the term '''hollow braid''' is sometimes preferred.

'''Double braid''', also called '''braid on braid''', consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fibre is chosen for strength while the outer braid fibre is chosen for abrasion resistance.

In '''solid braid''', the strands all travel the same direction, clockwise or anticlockwise, and alternate between forming the outside of the rope and the interior of the rope. This construction is popular for general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line.

{{Anchor|kernmantle}}
'''[[Kernmantle]]''' rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of [[weaving|woven]] fibres. The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In [[dynamic rope|dynamic climbing line]], core fibres are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.

=== Other types ===
'''Plaited rope''' is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called ''square braid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92rWxakaFAoC&amp;pg=PT753&amp;dq=Plaited+rope+is+made+by+braiding+twisted+strands,+and+is+also+called+square+braid.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP0Ymo3v3XAhVT0GMKHbPeAo4Q6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Plaited%20rope%20is%20made%20by%20braiding%20twisted%20strands,%20and%20is%20also%20called%20square%20braid.&amp;f=false |title=Boating |date=June 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. '''Brait rope''' is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by [[arborist]]s. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.

'''Endless winding rope''' is made by winding single strands of high-performance yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to make the difference between a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no construction stretch as is the case with above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.

== Safe and proper rope handling ==
[[File:Cordages-mutin.jpg|thumb|Cordage aboard the French training ship ''[[French ship Mutin|Mutin]]'']]
Rope made from [[hemp]], cotton or nylon is generally stored in a cool dry place for proper storage. To prevent kinking it is usually coiled. To prevent fraying or unravelling, the ends of a rope are bound with twine (whipping), tape, or heat shrink tubing. The ends of plastic fibre ropes are often melted and fused solid; however, the rope and knotting expert [[Geoffrey Budworth]] warns against this practice thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Budworth |first=Geoffrey |publisher=Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. |location=New York |title=The Knot Book |isbn=0-8069-7944-5 |page=37 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous.'' A tugboat operator once sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and obviously ''sharp'') end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a load-bearing rope gets a sharp or sudden jolt or the rope shows signs of deteriorating, it is recommended that the rope be replaced immediately and should be discarded or only used for non-load-bearing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airwinchsafety.com/air-winch-safety-info/#comment-637 |title=Air Winch Safety Info |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=34 |title=Wire Rope Inspections |publisher=U.S. DOL, OSHA |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average rope life-span is 5 years. Serious inspection should be given to line after that point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} However, the use to which a rope is put affects frequency of inspection. Rope used in [[mission-critical]] applications, such as mooring lines or [[running rigging]], should be regularly inspected on a much shorter timescale than this, and rope used in [[life-critical]] applications such as mountain climbing should be inspected on a far more frequent basis, up to and including before each use.

When preparing for a climb, it is important to stack the rope on the ground or a tarp and check for any "dead-spots".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Avoid stepping on rope, as this might force tiny pieces of rock through the sheath, which can eventually deteriorate the core of the rope.
Ropes may be flemished into coils on deck for safety and presentation/tidiness as shown in the picture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Many kinds of filaments in ropes are weakened by acids or other corrosive liquids or solvents, and high temperatures. Such damage is treacherous because it often is hard to tell by eye.&lt;ref&gt;Rope Care [http://www.beyondrigging.com/2014/02/rope-maintenance/ "How to Maintain Ropes"]&lt;/ref&gt; Rope damaged in such ways is dangerous to use.  Ropes therefore should be kept away from all kinds of solvents and from corrosive acids, alkalis, and oxidising agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanical Rope and Cable: Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Mechanical Rope and Cable, National Materials Advisory Board, Commission on Sociotechnical Systems, National Research Council |last=National Research Council (U.S.) |year=1975 |publisher=National Academies |pp=51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ropes should avoid sudden load, as a shock load can destroy a rope easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Use, Care, and Maintenance of Manila Rope and Blocks |last=American Telephone and Telegraph Company |year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any operation of ropes should obey the principle of safe working load, which is usually much less than its ultimate strength. The rope should be replaced immediately if any evidences of shock load have been found.

A rope under tension – particularly if it has a great deal of elasticity – can be very hazardous if it should part, snapping backward and potentially causing grave or lethal injury to people, or damage to objects, in its path. There are occasions when it is proper to cut a taut rope under load, but this should be done ''only'' when necessary and ''only'' with great forethought and preparation for the potential consequences.

== Line ==
"Rope" refers to the manufactured material. Once rope is purposely sized, cut, spliced, or simply assigned a function, the result is referred to as a "line", especially in nautical usage. Sail control lines are mainly referred to as sheets (e.g. [[jibsheet]]). A [[halyard]], for example, is a line used to raise and lower a [[sail]], and is typically made of a length of rope with a shackle attached at one end. Other examples include [[clothesline]], [[chalk line]], [[anchor]] line ("rode"), stern line, [[fishing line]], marline and so on.

The '''SCORPION''' '''(Self CORrecting Projectile for Infantry OperatioN) program''' was a research initiative led by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL), the [[DARPA|U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), and the Georgia Institute of Technology to integrate Micro Adaptive Flow Control (MAFC) technology into small caliber munitions to develop spinning, guided projectiles.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The program led to the creation of a spin-stabilized 40mm grenade, also called SCORPION, that could propel itself to its target by using calculated micro-jet bursts of air to correct its path once launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== History ==

The SCORPION program began in 2001 as a joint venture between DARPA, Georgia Tech Research Institute, and ARL’s Weapons and Materials Research Directorate in order to improve the precision of small to medium-sized munitions in complex, dynamic environments.&lt;ref name = "DARPA_Scorpion"&gt;{{Cite web | first1 =  Andre | last1 = Lovas | first2 = Kevin | last2 = Massey | first3 = Mike | last3 = Heiges | first4 = T.

Micro adaptive flow control is largely defined by the active manipulation of aerodynamic flows using small time-dependent actuators in carefully chosen locations. By taking advantage of flow instabilities, the system can generate large amounts of energy from using only a small fraction of the overall flow if the actuators and their activity are properly assigned. As a result, MAFC can enable low power yet highly distributed redundant actuation systems in contrast to flow systems that utilize steady blowing where high velocity flows must be provided through complex and high-loss ducting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The project was spearheaded by the proposition that MAFC and advanced microtechnology could be combined to establish closed loop guidance of a projectile, demonstrating more effective flight control and steering capabilities.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The program was divided into two phases, Phase I and Phase II. The former focused on constructing the flight control system and determining whether MAFC could be integrated into a 40&amp;nbsp;mm round to provide adequate guidance to its target, while the latter prioritized determining whether MAFC technology could be used to steer projectiles that were smaller and even faster than those used in Phase I. By 2005, Phase I had been completed, and the SCORPION program was chosen as a DARPA demonstration program in order to further investigate the use of MAFC in high-velocity, small-diameter projectiles.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
A Success Story
The SCORPION program concluded in 2007 after successfully demonstrating the use of MCFA to maneuver a 40&amp;nbsp;mm rifle-launched grenade.&lt;ref name = "DARPA_Scorpion" /&gt; In 2009, ARL researchers at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico tested the renamed XM1100 Scorpion networked sensor and munitions platform and achieved what they called a “mobility kill” for the first time, highlighting the system’s ability to identify and track its targets. According to the researchers, the XM1100 Scorpion successfully demonstrated all of its major functions, including command and control, ground sensor tracking, target engagement, anti-vehicle munitions launch, warhead lethality, and self-destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = XM1100 Scorpion Completes Successful End-to-End Live Fire Testing. | url = http://www.pica.army.mil/pmccs/docs/Scorpion.pdf | publisher = U.S. Army }}&lt;/ref&gt; If successful in the government development testing phase, the Pentagon has displayed interest in utilizing the munition system for long-range combat in urban environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Projectile Design ==

Designed to be fired from the M203 grenade launcher, the SCORPION projectile is a 40&amp;nbsp;mm grenade that was based on the M781BT practice grenade.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Due to how 40&amp;nbsp;mm grenades are spin stabilized and have highly nonlinear aerodynamics, researchers undergone several tests to understand the aerodynamic nonlinearities and flight dynamics of the projectile’s trajectory.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Experiments with the base model has shown that these projectiles exhibit fast and slow mode angular precession, meaning that the aerodynamic control system must not only deal with a spin rate of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, but also account for the nonlinear response of the round. Both the rotational motion and the precession of the projectile served to greatly complicate how the projectile respond to control forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The SCORPION projectile features a telemetry system based on the Army Research Laboratory’s diagnostic fuze (DFuze), a high-g, projectile-based sensor system that measures inflight ballistic data.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Used primarily to determine the projectile flight dynamics along the trajectory, the telemetry system consists of four radial accelerometers, a three-axis magnetometer, an axial accelerometer, a two-axis accelerometer for transverse acceleration, and a suite of four Yawsondes. While the magnetometers serve to measure the SCORPION’s projectile orientation and roll angle to the earth’s magnetic field, the Yawsondes measure its projectile angular orientation to the sun. Through the use of the magnetometers and the Yawsondes, the angular state of the projectile can be identified. The accelerometers help measure the accelerations of the SCORPION in the x, y, and z directions, and an encoder board is present inside the projectile to collect the sensor data and send it to the ground station.

As a result of its telemetry system, the researchers can monitor the forces on the SCORPION as it flies to its target. However, in order to control its flight path, the projectile employ MAFC through the use of tiny synthetic jets embedded on the surface of the projectile.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite report | url = https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/public/prod/2017-07/GTRI-Annual-Report-2005.pdf | chapter = Steering Munitions with Synthetic Jet Actuators | title = 2005 Annual Report | publisher =  Georgia Tech Research Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, these synthetic jet actuators are designed to fire bursts of air to alter the flow field and pressure distributions of the surrounding air. When turned on momentarily, these synthetic jets use those tiny, short bursts to correct the trajectory of the projectile as it travels towards its target.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

As active control devices with zero net mass flux, the synthetic jets produce the desired amount of control of the flow field through momentum effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} They act as steering devices for the projectile, using a minute-vibrating diaphragm-like system powered by piezoceramic elements. Due to the tiny air vortices created by the synthetic jets, an asymmetry in the airflow can be created around the projectile. In addition, the resulting Coanda effect can multiply this effects of this phenomenon, producing air flow changes that are strong enough to change the projectile’s trajectory. The SCORPION’s electronics have also undergone g-hardening to withstand the heavy forces generated during each launch.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, issues still remain with this design. The SCORPION projectile lacks sufficient payload room for a full guidance system as well as a greater explosive power. As a result, researchers have investigated using gas-generator actuators, which employ miniature explosive charges to create stronger steering forces and allow the projectile to travel faster in the air.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In addition to the 40&amp;nbsp;mm SCORPION, a 25&amp;nbsp;mm SCORPION has also been developed. Designed similarly to the 40&amp;nbsp;mm model, it features two axes of rate sensors, three aces of accelerometers, three axes of magnetometers, and two additional radially oriented accelerometers. The 25&amp;nbsp;mm SCORPION consists of two sections, the electronics control module and the actuator module. This divide serves to prevent potentially hazardous material like the propellant from interacting with the control electronics until just prior to firing. According to flight experiments conducted at the Army Research Laboratory, the 25&amp;nbsp;mm SCORPION successfully established the charge weight needed to meet the velocity requirements when launched at 0.8 Mach.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[image:Polttopullo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Weapons used in the [[Winter War]]. The original Finnish satchel charge is on the left.]]
A '''satchel charge''' is a [[demolition]] device, primarily intended for [[combat]], whose primary components are a charge of [[dynamite]] or a more potent explosive such as [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] plastic explosive, a carrying device functionally similar to a [[satchel (bag)|satchel]] or [[messenger bag]], and a triggering mechanism; the term covers both [[improvised explosive device|improvised]] and formally designed devices.

In [[World War II]], [[Combat engineering|combat engineers]] used satchel charges to demolish heavy stationary targets such as rails, obstacles, [[blockhouse]]s, [[bunker]]s, caves, and bridges. The   World War II-era [[United States Army]] M37 Demolition Kit contained eight blocks of high explosive, with 2 priming assemblies, in a canvas bag with a shoulder strap. Part or all of this charge could be placed against a structure or slung into an opening. It was usually detonated with a pull igniter. When used as an [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank weapon]], charges were sufficient to severely damage the tracks. {{convert|4|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} charges were enough to destroy medium tanks.

Later in the [[Vietnam War]], [[Viet Cong and PAVN battle tactics#Sapper attacks|Vietcong and North Vietnamese soldiers assigned elite sappers]] to stealthily penetrate defenses of sites controlled by enemy forces. Often, this meant using satchel charges as well as [[Bangalore torpedo]]es to blast through [[barbed wire]] entanglements, [[land mine|minefields]], structures, and other fortifications. The later U.S. M183 Demolition Charge Assembly contained {{convert|20|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of C-4 in each satchel, and could be used with a timed fuse. In the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], U.S. M2 20&amp;nbsp;lb assault demolitions were used to collapse houses being used as fighting positions by insurgents.

Some [[special forces]] may use customized satchel charges designed to destroy their specific mission's target.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">A '''semantic layer''' is a business representation of corporate [[data]] that helps [[end user]]s access data autonomously using common business terms. A semantic layer maps complex data into familiar business terms such as product, customer, or revenue to offer a unified, consolidated view of data across the organization.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = On May 29, 1992, [[Business Objects]] obtained U.S. Patent 5,555,403, which "provides a new data representation and a query technique which allows information system end users to access (query) relational databases without knowing the relational structure or the structure query language (SQL)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US5555403&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, some competitors like [[Cognos]] paid licensing fees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getfilings.com/o0001194396-03-000047.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2003, [[Microstrategy]] successfully defended a brought suit by Business Objects alleging patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theengineer.co.uk/court-dismisses-patent-infringement-suit/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
By using common business terms, rather than data language, to access, manipulate, and organize information, a semantic layer simplifies the complexity of business data. Business terms are stored as objects in a semantic layer, which are accessed through business views.

The semantic layer enables business users to have a common "[[look and feel]]" when accessing and analyzing data stored in relational databases and [[OLAP cube]]s. This is claimed to be core [[business intelligence technology|business intelligence]] (BI) technology that frees users from IT while ensuring correct results.

Business Views is a multi-tier system that is designed to enable companies to build comprehensive and specific [[business object]]s that help report designers and end users access the information they require. Business Views is intended to enable people to add the necessary business context to their [[data island]]s and link them into a single organized Business View for their organization.

Semantic layer maps tables to classes and rows to objects.

'''Squid''' was a British [[World War II]] [[ship]]-mounted [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[weapon]]. It consisted of a three-barrelled [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] which launched [[depth charge]]s. It replaced the [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] system, and was in turn replaced by the [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] system.

[[File:Sailors loading Squid anti-submarine mortar in 1952.jpg|thumb|left|Sailors loading Squid anti-submarine mortar in 1952]]
[[File:Squid bomb markings diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Squid bomb markings diagram]]

Literally ordered directly from the drawing board in 1942, under the auspices of the [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]], this weapon was rushed into service in May 1943 on board [[HMS Ambuscade (D38)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']]. The first production unit was installed on [[HMS Hadleigh Castle (K355)|HMS ''Hadleigh Castle'']]; it went on to be installed on 70 frigates and corvettes during the [[Second World War]]. The first successful use was by [[HMS Loch Killin|HMS ''Loch Killin'']] on 31 July 1944, when she sank ''[[Unterseeboot 333|U333]]''; the system was credited with sinking 17 submarines in 50 attacks. By 1959, 195 Squid installations had been produced.

This weapon was a three-barrel {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} mortar with the mortars mounted in series but off-bore from each other in order to scatter the projectiles.  The barrels were mounted in a frame that could be rotated through 90&amp;nbsp;degrees for loading.  The projectiles weighed {{convert|390|lb|kg|0}} with a {{convert|207|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} [[Minol (explosive)|minol]] charge.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Due to shortages of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and [[RDX]] (cyclonite) in World War II, the British used a 50/50 mixture of [[ammonium nitrate]] and TNT ([[amatol]]) in [[naval mine]]s and depth charges. This low grade explosive was later improved by the addition of about 20% [[aluminium]] powder, producing ''[[Minol (explosive)|minol]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On some vessels, the Squid installations were at the stern – the bombs were fired over the length of the ship and dropping into the sea slightly ahead of it.&lt;ref name="hmcshaida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmcshaida.ca/squid.html|title=Squid Mortar|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Friends of HMCS ''Haida''|accessdate=21 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217023650/http://www.hmcshaida.ca/squid.html|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sink rate was 43.5&amp;nbsp;ft/s (13.3&amp;nbsp;m/s) and a clockwork time [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] was used to determine the detonation depth; all three projectiles had to be set to the same depth; this could be continuously updated right up to the moment of launch to take into account the movements of the target.&lt;ref name="hmcshaida" /&gt; The maximum depth was {{convert|900|ft|m|-1}}.

The weapons were automatically fired from the [[sonar]] range recorder at the proper moment. The pattern formed a triangle about 40&amp;nbsp;yards (37&amp;nbsp;m) on a side at a distance of 275&amp;nbsp;yards (250&amp;nbsp;m) ahead of the ship. Most Squid installations utilised two sets of mortars. All six bombs were fired in salvo so they formed opposing triangular spreads. The salvos were set to explode {{convert|25|ft|m|-1}} above and below the target, the resulting pressure wave crushing the hull of the submarine. Postwar trials found Squid was nine times more effective than conventional depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, David. ''Great Naval Battle of Ottawa'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its proven effectiveness, some officers, notably [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Kenneth Adams]], [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]], opposed fitting Squid to escorts because it meant sacrificing guns, which would make ships unsuitable for fleet actions.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1977, the [[Type 61 frigate]] ''[[HMS Salisbury (F32)|Salisbury]]'' became the last ship to fire Squid in Royal Navy service. Examples of the mortars are on display at the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]] in Gosport, Hampshire and another at Devonport Naval Base. In addition, the system is fitted to {{HMS|Cavalier|D73}}, which is part of the historic ships collection in the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent.

In Swedish service the system soldiered on until 1982 when the [[Östergötland-class destroyer|''Östergötland''-class destroyers]] were decommissioned.

==Cast and characters==
{{main|List of Superstore characters}}

===Main===
*[[America Ferrera]] as Amelia "Amy" Dubanowski (née Sosa), a [[Honduras|Honduran]]-American Cloud 9 employee of eleven years who worked as an associate, then floor supervisor, then assistant manager, and very briefly store manager. Amy always wears a different name tag because she doesn't like strangers using her real name.
*[[Ben Feldman]] as Jonah Simms, a Cloud 9 sales associate. He and Mateo were both hired in the series' pilot episode.
*[[Lauren Ash]] as Dina Fox, Cloud 9's intense and no-nonsense assistant store manager.
*[[Colton Dunn]] as Garrett McNeil, a sarcastic and indifferent Cloud 9 associate who is paralyzed from the waist down.
*[[Nico Santos (actor)|Nico Santos]] as Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag, a gay Filipino Cloud 9 associate who was hired at the same time as Jonah. He later goes on to secretly date Jeff, Cloud 9 district manager. 
*[[Nichole Bloom]] as Cheyenne Thompson (née Lee), a Cloud 9 associate. She is a pregnant 17-year-old high school student at the start of the series. She gave birth to her daughter, Harmonica, in the store in the first-season finale, and married her boyfriend Bo Derek Thompson (the baby's father) during the second season.
*[[Mark McKinney]] as Glenn Sturgis, Cloud 9's constantly positive store manager. Glenn is a devout Christian and a foster-father to many children.

===Recurring===
* [[Johnny Pemberton]] as Bilbo "Bo" Derek Thompson, Cheyenne's immature, wannabe-rapper husband and father of Harmonica. Worked briefly at Cloud 9.
* Kaliko Kauahi as Sandra Kaluiokalani, a Cloud 9 employee who has trouble bringing up legitimate concerns and being heard. She will often attempt to make her voice heard only to shoot herself down shortly after, or during. She also has superior autobiographical memory in which she can remember every single day of her life. Dated Jerry after pretending to date Jeff.
* [[Josh Lawson]] as Tate Stasklewicz, a Cloud 9 pharmacist who is often rude, panicky, sarcastic and full of himself.
* [[Linda Porter (actress)|Linda Porter]] as [[octogenarian]] Myrtle Vartanian, Cloud 9's longest serving employee (30 years). Her tenure has made her the highest paid sales associate, despite her constant confusion and forgetfulness.
* Jon Barinholtz as Marcus White, a dim-witted, oft fired/rehired Cloud 9 employee. Following a mishap with a meat slicer in the Cloud 9 deli, he was promoted (without a pay increase) to warehouse supervisor on the condition that he would not sue the store.
* Isabella Day as Emma Dubanowski, Amy's daughter with her ex-husband Adam.
* [[Ryan Gaul]] as Adam Dubanowski, Amy's estranged husband and Emma's father.

In the episode "Color Wars" it is revealed that he's a YouTube personality who makes real-time grilling videos.
* Jon Miyahara as Brett Kobashigawa, Cloud 9's most productive employee. Said to be a sales machine, though always shown moving slowly if at all. To date, he has spoken only one word of dialogue, which fittingly was censored.
* [[Michael Bunin]] as Jeff Sutin (season 2–), Originally the district manager who oversaw the St. Louis Cloud 9, among others. He is revealed to be gay, and had a romantic relationship with Mateo. After the secret relationship became public, Jeff resigned to continue dating Mateo. Late in season 3, however, Jeff is rehired to manage the Chicago district.
* Kelly Schumann as Justine Sikowicz, a Cloud 9 employee. At times she pretends to be an alcoholic or promiscuous in order to seem more interesting. According to Glenn she is 40 years old and lives alone in a studio apartment.
* Irene White as Carol, a man-hungry Cloud 9 employee who has a rivalry with Sandra, whom she accuses of stealing her boyfriend, Jerry.
* Chris Grace as Jerry, Sandra's boyfriend who briefly dated Carol.
* [[Kelly Stables]] as Kelly Watson, a divorcee who begins working at Cloud 9 in season 3, where she eventually starts a relationship with Jonah.
* [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]] as Jerusha Sturgis (season 3–), Glenn's wife. She is mentioned in the first two seasons, but does not appear until season 3.
* Dave Ferguson as Eugene, an obedient, overly cheerful sales associate. Hired as temporary seasonal help, he is quickly promoted, replacing Jonah as Glenn's assistant.
* [[Jennifer Irwin]] as Laurie, the new district manager who takes over after Jeff resigns in season 3.
* Sean Whalen as Sal Kazlauskas, who is a Cloud 9 employee known for being creepily obsessed with both women and children. His deceased body is found early in season 3.

===Notable guest stars===

* [[Tony Plana]] as Ron Sosa, Amy's father. (In Ferrera's previous series, ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', Plana also played her character's father.) 
* [[Marlene Forte]] as Connie Sosa, Amy's mother.

===Critical reception===
Early reviews for the series were mixed. According to [[Metacritic]], the first season of ''Superstore'' holds a score of 58 out of 100, indicating "mixed to average reviews" based on 21 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/superstore|title=Superstore - Season Reviews - Metacritic|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season holds a 54% with a "Rotten" rating, based on 24 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The general consensus is: "''Superstore''{{'}}s talented cast and obvious potential are slightly overshadowed by a tonally jumbled presentation and thin, formulaic writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/superstore/s01/|title=Superstore - Season Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first season went along, however, reviews started to become more positive. Following the finale "Labor", the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it one of TV's best new comedies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Libby|title='Superstore' Heads into It's Final as One of TV's Best New Comedies|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-superstore-season-one-finale-best-new-comedies-20160222-story.html|accessdate=February 23, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot Viruet of ''[[The A.V.

A '''tablet computer''', commonly shortened to '''tablet''', is a [[mobile device]], typically with a [[mobile operating system]] and [[LCD]] [[touchscreen]] display processing [[circuitry]], and a [[rechargeable battery]] in a single thin, flat package. Tablets, being computers, do what other [[personal computer]]s do, but lack some [[Input/output|I/O]] capabilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern [[smartphones]], the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens {{convert|7|inch|cm}} or larger, measured diagonally,&lt;ref name="Editors PC Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Definition of: tablet computer|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=tablet+computer&amp;i=52520,00.asp|author=Editors PC Magazine|accessdate=April 17, 2010|work=[[PC Magazine]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716184551/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3Dtablet+computer%26i%3D52520%2C00.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Editors Dictionary.com"&gt;{{Citation |title= tablet computer – 1 dictionary result |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tablet+computer |author= Editors Dictionary.com |accessdate= April 17, 2010 |work= [[Dictionary.com]] |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111108081844/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tablet+computer

The touchscreen display is operated by [[gesture recognition|gestures]] executed by finger or [[digital pen|stylus]] instead of the [[computer mouse|mouse]], [[trackpad]], and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] of larger computers. Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]]. Two species of tablet, the "slate" and "booklet", do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a [[virtual keyboard]] shown on their touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by wireless [[Bluetooth]] or [[USB]]; [[#2-in-1|2-in-1 PCs]] have keyboards, distinct from tablets.

The form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the 20th century ([[Stanley Kubrick]] depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 [[science fiction]] film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century.

The tablet computer and its associated operating system began with the development of [[pen computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|4xnqKdWMa_8|Notes on the History of Pen-based Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical devices with [[input/output|data input and output]] on a flat [[information display]] existed as early as 1888 with the [[telautograph]],&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Citation| last =Gray| first =Elisha| coauthors =| title =Telautograph| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =United States Patent 386,815 (full image)| date =July 31, 1888| url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/386815.pdf| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which used a sheet of paper as display and a pen attached to [[electromechanical]] [[actuator]]s. Throughout the 20th century devices with these characteristics have been imagined and created whether as [[blueprint]]s, [[prototype]]s, or [[commercial product]]s. In addition to many academic and research systems, several companies released commercial products in the 1980s, with various input/output types tried out:

=== Fictional and prototype tablets ===
Tablet computers appeared in a number of works of [[science fiction]] in the second half of the [[20th century]]; all helped to promote and disseminate the concept to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JQ8pQVDyaLo|NewsPad depiction - 2001 A Space Odyssey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:
* [[Isaac Asimov]] described a Calculator Pad in his novel ''[[Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' (1951)
*[[Stanislaw Lem]] described the Opton in his novel ''[[Return from the Stars]]'' (1961) 
*Numerous similar devices were depicted in [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s 1966 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s NewsPad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://margaretpuls.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/worlds-first-ipad/|title=Did Arthur C Clarke invent the iPad?|work=Margaret Puls|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807025129/http://margaretpuls.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/worlds-first-ipad/|archivedate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was depicted in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968)
*Douglas Adams described a tablet computer in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and the associated [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|comedy of the same name]] (1978)
*The sci-fi TV series ''[[Star Trek The Next Generation]]'' featured tablet computers which were designated as [[PADD]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/padd |title=Star Trek PADD |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009073446/http://www.startrek.com/database_article/padd |archivedate=October 9, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A device more powerful than today's tablets appeared briefly in ''[[The Mote in God's Eye]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;"I keep wishing for a real tablet--one that would function as the pocket computer we described in ''The Mote in God's Eye''".—{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/mobile-devices/jerry-pournelle-is-back-in-the-house-/d/d-id/1098811? |title=Jerry Pournelle Is Back in the House |first=Jerry |last=Pournelle |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614001412/http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/mobile-devices/jerry-pournelle-is-back-in-the-house-/d/d-id/1098811 |archivedate=June 14, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Star Wars]] franchise features "datapads", first described in print in 1991's [[Heir to the Empire]] and depicted on screen in 1999's [[The Phantom Menace]].

Additionally, real-life projects either proposed or created tablet computers, such as:
* In 1968, computer scientist [[Alan Kay]] envisioned a KiddiComp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why the iPhone makes 2008 seem like 1968 all over again |url=http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/2008/01/23/why_the_iphone_makes_2008_seem_like_1968 |first=Mike |last=Richards |publisher=Open2 |date=January 23, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112071358/http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/2008/01/23/why_the_iphone_makes_2008_seem_like_1968 |archivedate=November 12, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/04/03/alan_kay.html |title=Daddy, Are We There Yet?

Adults could also use a Dynabook, but the [[target audience]] was children.
* In 1979, the idea of a [[touchscreen]] tablet that could detect an external force applied to one point on the screen was patented in Japan by a team at [[Hitachi]] consisting of Masao Hotta, Yoshikazu Miyamoto, Norio Yokozawa and Yoshimitsu Oshima, who later received a US patent for their idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US4389711A/en US4389711A patent: Touch sensitive tablet using force detection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905152952/https://patents.google.com/patent/US4389711A/en |date=September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, [[Atari]] showed developers the Stylus, later renamed ST-Pad. The ST-Pad was based on the TOS/GEM [[Atari ST]] Platform and prototyped early [[handwriting recognition]]. [[Shiraz Shivji]]'s company ''Momentus'' demonstrated in the same time a failed x86 [[MS-DOS]] based Pen Computer with its own [[GUI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologizer.com/2010/01/27/the-long-fail-a-brief-history-of-unsuccessful-tablet-computers/ |title=The Long Fail: A Brief History of Unsuccessful Tablet Computers |first=Harry |last=McCracken |date=January 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090502/http://www.technologizer.com/2010/01/27/the-long-fail-a-brief-history-of-unsuccessful-tablet-computers/ |archivedate=August 19, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, IBM announced (in April) and shipped to developers (in October) the 2521 ThinkPad, which ran the [[GO Corporation]]'s [[PenPoint OS]]. Also based on PenPoint was AT&amp;T's [[EO Personal Communicator]] from 1993, which ran on AT&amp;T's own hardware, including their own [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]] CPU. Apple Computer launched the [[Apple Newton]] personal digital assistant in 1993. It used Apple's own new [[Newton OS]], initially running on hardware manufactured by Motorola and incorporating an [[ARM architecture|ARM]] CPU, that Apple had specifically co-developed with [[Acorn Computers]]. The operating system and platform design were later licensed to [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Digital Ocean]], who went on to manufacture their own variants.

In 1996, [[Palm, Inc.]] released the first of the [[Palm OS]] based [[PalmPilot]] touch and stylus based PDA, the touch based devices initially incorporating a [[Motorola Dragonball]] (68000) CPU. Also in 1996 Fujitsu released the Stylistic 1000 tablet format PC, running Microsoft Windows 95, on a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz AMD486 DX4 CPU, with 8 MB RAM offering stylus input, with the option of connecting a conventional Keyboard and mouse.

The Modbook uses Apple's [[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]] for handwriting and gesture recognition, and uses digitization hardware from [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]].

Following the launch of the [[Ultra-mobile PC]], Intel started the [[Mobile Internet Device]] initiative, which took the same hardware and combined it with a tabletized Linux configuration. Intel co-developed the lightweight [[Moblin]] (mobile Linux) operating system following the successful launch of the Atom CPU series on netbooks. In 2010, Nokia and [[Intel]] combined the Maemo and Moblin projects to form MeeGo, a Linux-based operating system supports netbooks and tablets. The first tablet using MeeGo was the [[Neofonie]] [[WeTab]] launched September 2010 in Germany. The WeTab used an extended version of the MeeGo operating system called WeTab OS. WeTab OS adds runtimes for Android and [[Adobe AIR]] and provides a proprietary user interface optimized for the WeTab device. On September 27, 2011 the [[Linux Foundation]] announced that MeeGo would be replaced in 2012 by [[Tizen]].&lt;ref name="next"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sousou|first=Imad|title=What's Next for MeeGo|url=https://meego.com/community/blogs/imad/2011/whats-next-meego|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006173715/https://meego.com/community/blogs/imad/2011/whats-next-meego|archivedate=October 6, 2011|publisher=meego.com|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android was the first of the 2000s-era dominating platforms for tablet computers to reach the market. In 2008, the first plans for Android-based tablets appeared. The first products were released in 2009. Among them was the Archos 5, a pocket-sized model with a 5-inch [[touchscreen]], that was first released with a proprietary operating system and later (in 2009) released with Android 1.4. The Camangi WebStation was released in Q2 2009. The first [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] tablet appeared late 2009 and was made by ICD for [[Verizon]]. This unit was called the Ultra, but a version called Vega was released around the same time. Ultra had a 7-inch display while Vega's was 15 inches. Many more products followed in 2010. Several manufacturers waited for [[Android Honeycomb]], specifically adapted for use with tablets, which debuted in February 2011.

=== Mini tablet ===
Mini tablets are smaller and weigh less than slates, with typical screen sizes between {{convert|7-8|in|cm}}. The first commercially successful mini tablets were introduced by [[Amazon.com]] ([[Amazon Kindle Fire|Kindle Fire]]), [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] ([[Nook Tablet]]), and [[Samsung]] ([[Samsung Galaxy Tab|Galaxy Tab]]) in 2011; and by [[Google]] ([[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus 7]]) in 2012. They operate identically to ordinary tablets but have lower specifications compared to them.

On September 14, 2012, [[Amazon, Inc.]] released an upgraded version of the [[Amazon Kindle Fire|Kindle Fire]], the [[Kindle Fire HD]], with higher screen resolution and more features compared to its predecessor, yet remaining only 7 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Kelly, Heather &amp; Gross, Doug |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/06/tech/mobile/amazon-kindle-event/index.html |title=Amazon announces new wave of Kindles |work=CNN Tech |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201234333/http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/06/tech/mobile/amazon-kindle-event/index.html |archivedate=December 1, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Apple released the [[iPad Mini]] with a 7.9 inch screen size, about 2 inches smaller than the regular [[iPad]], but less powerful than the then current [[iPad 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/apple-events/ |title=Events |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614024935/http://www.apple.com/apple-events/ |archivedate=June 14, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2013, Google released an upgraded version of the [[Nexus 7 (2013 version)|Nexus 7]], with FHD display, dual cameras, stereo speakers, more color accuracy, performance improvement, built-in [[Qi (inductive power standard)|wireless charging]], and a variant with 4G LTE support for AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. In September 2013, Amazon further updated the Fire tablet with the [[Kindle Fire HDX]]. In November 2013, Apple released the [[iPad Mini 2]], which remained at 7.9 inches and nearly matched the hardware of the [[iPad Air]].

=== Phablet ===
{{Main article|Phablet}}
[[Smartphone]]s and tablets are similar devices, differentiated by the former typically having smaller screens and most tablets lacking [[cellular network]] capability. Since 2010, crossover touchscreen [[smartphone]]s with screens larger than 5 inches have been released. That size is generally considered larger than a traditional [[smartphone]], creating the hybrid category of the ''[[phablet]]'' by [[Forbes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |title=5" Is the market ready for a 'phablet'? |work=Forbes |first=Roger |last=Kay |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729211214/https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |archivedate=July 29, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications. "Phablet" is a [[portmanteau]] of "phone" and "tablet".

At the time of the introduction of the first phablets, they had screens of 5.3 to 5.5 inches, but as of 2017 screen sizes up to 5.5 inches are considered typical. Examples of phablets from 2017 and onward are the [[Samsung Galaxy Note series]] (newer models of 5.7 inches), the [[LG V10]]/[[LG V20|V20]] (5.7 inches), the [[Sony Xperia XA Ultra]] [6 inches], the [[Huawei Mate 9]] (5.9 inches), and  the Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 (7 inches).

=== 2-in-1 ===
{{anchor|Convertible}}
{{anchor|Hybrid}}
{{Main article|2-in-1 PC}}

Distinct from tablets, '''[[2-in-1 PC]]s''' all have physical [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], but they are either concealable by folding them back and under the touchscreen ("2-in-1 convertible") or detachable ("2-in-1 detachable"), but 2-in-1s typically also can display a virtual keyboard on their touchscreens when their physical keyboards are concealed or detached. Some 2-in-1s have processors and operating systems like those of [[laptop]]s, while having the flexibility of operation as a tablet. A 2-in-1 PC is a hybrid or combination of a tablet and [[laptop]] computer that has features of both. An essential feature of a 2-in-1 is a desktop [[operating system]], such as [[Windows 10]], as opposed to a mobile operating system. Additionally, 2-in-1s may have typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[DisplayPort]], and may connect to traditional [[Personal computer|PC]] [[peripheral devices]] and external displays. Therefore they are distinct from tablets, although they can operate just like them. Simple tablets are primarily used as [[media consumption]] devices, while 2-in-1s have capacity for both [[media consumption]] and [[content creation]], and therefore 2-in-1s are often called "laptop" or "[[desktop replacement computer]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here Come the Hybrid ‘Laplets.’ Should You Care?|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/windows8-laplet-hybrid/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=August 13, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813232312/http://www.wired.com/2012/10/windows8-laplet-hybrid/|archivedate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two species of 2-in-1s:
* '''Convertibles''' have a [[Chassis#Electronics|chassis]] design by which their physical keyboard may be concealed by flipping/folding the keyboard behind the chassis. Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Lenovo Yoga]] series.
* '''Detachables''' or '''Hybrids''' have physical keyboards that may be detached from their [[Chassis#Electronics|chassis]], even while the 2-in-1 is operating. Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Asus Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]] series, the [[iPad Pro]], and the Microsoft [[Surface Book]] and [[Microsoft Surface|Surface Pro]].

=== Gaming tablet ===
{{anchor|Gaming}}
Some tablets are modified by adding physical [[gamepad]] buttons such as [[D-pad]] and thumb sticks for better gaming experience combined with the [[touchscreen]] and all other features of a typical tablet computer. Most of these tablets are targeted to run native OS games and [[emulator]] games. [[Nvidia]]'s [[Shield Tablet]], with an {{conv|8|in|mm|adj=on}} display, and running [[Android (operating system)|Android]], is an example. It runs Android games purchased from [[Google Play]] store. [[PC game]]s can also be [[streaming media|streamed]] to the tablet from computers with some higher end models of Nvidia-powered [[video cards]]. The [[Nintendo Switch]] hybrid console is also a gaming tablet that runs on [[Nintendo Switch system software]], features detachable [[Joy-Con]] controllers with motion controls and three gaming modes: table-top mode using its kickstand, traditional docked/TV mode and handheld mode.

=== Booklet ===
Booklets are [[dual-touchscreen]] tablet computers with a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design that can fold like a laptop. Examples include the [[Microsoft Courier]], which was discontinued in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2208325/smb/microsoft-kills-courier-tablet-project.html |first=Denise |last=Dubie |title=Microsoft kills courier tablet project: Apple’s iPad influence likely crushes Microsoft tablet |publisher=NetworkWorld |date=April 29, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009095257/http://www.networkworld.com/article/2208325/smb/microsoft-kills-courier-tablet-project.html |archivedate=October 9, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2208330/computers/microsoft-courier-tablet-canceled-.html |first=Mike |last=Keller |title=Microsoft Courier Tablet Canceled!: Gizmodo reports today that Microsoft’s much-hyped Courier tablet has been canceled. |publisher=PC World |date=April 29, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105743/http://www.networkworld.com/article/2208330/computers/microsoft-courier-tablet-canceled-.html |archivedate=October 6, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sony Tablet P]] (which was considered a flop),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 8 biggest product flops of 2012 (#4)|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-8-biggest-product-flops-of-the-year-2012-12-28|publisher=Marketwatch|accessdate=June 30, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730072420/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-8-biggest-product-flops-of-the-year-2012-12-28|archivedate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toshiba Libretto]] W100.

=== Customized business tablet ===
Customized business tablets are built specifically for a business customer's particular needs from a hardware and software perspective, and delivered in a [[business-to-business]] transaction. For example, in hardware, a transportation company may find that the consumer-grade [[GPS]] module in an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] tablet provides insufficient accuracy, so a tablet can be customized and embedded with a professional-grade antenna to provide a better GPS signal. Such tablets may also be [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] for field use. For a software example, the same transportation company might remove certain software functions in the Android system, such as the internet browser, to reduce costs from unnecessary cellular network data consumption of an employee, and add custom package management software. Other applications may call for a [[resistive touchscreen]] and other special hardware and software.

==Hardware==

&lt;!-- This paragraph should be updated, and concentrate on core mainstream tablet functions, general capabilities, and physical descriptions, not lists of optional user-installed apps, nor history, nor the endless list of bells and whistles. What do they do, what is their main current modern utility as a class of appliance? --&gt;

=== System architecture ===
{{See also|Comparison of tablet computers}}
Two major architectures dominate the tablet market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.cnet.com/Intel-has-ARM-in-its-crosshairs---page-2/2100-1006_3-6210033-2.html?tag=mncol|title=Intel has ARM in its crosshairs|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ARM Holdings]]' [[ARM architecture]] and Intel's and AMD's [[x86]]. Intel's x86, including [[x86-64]] has powered the "IBM compatible" PC since 1981 and Apple's Macintosh computers since 2006. The CPUs have been incorporated into tablet PCs over the years and generally offer greater performance along with the ability to run full versions of Microsoft [[Windows]], along with Windows desktop and enterprise applications. Non-Windows based x86 tablets include the [[JooJoo]]. Intel announced plans to enter the tablet market with its [[Intel Atom|Atom]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/17/intel_tablets/ |title=Intel shows pricing pressures for Atom due to competition from ARM |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019030853/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/17/intel_tablets/ |archivedate=October 19, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/11/22/intel-launches-fpga-equipped-atom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127201023/https://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/11/22/intel-launches-fpga-equipped-atom/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |title=Intel launches FPGA-equipped Atom |author=Gareth Halfacree |date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=November 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Intel's foundry operation announced plans to build FPGA-based quad cores for ARM and x86 processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/intel-on-track-to-build-two-chips-with-arm-inside/|title=Intel on track to build two chips with ARM inside|author=Brooke Crothers|date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARM has been the CPU architecture of choice for manufacturers of smartphones (95% ARM), PDAs, digital cameras (80% ARM), [[set-top box]]es, DSL routers, smart televisions (70% ARM), storage devices and tablet computers (95% ARM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Chu|date=December 18, 2012|url=https://blogs.arm.com/smart-connected-devices/870-ever-wonder-where%e2%80%99s-arm-at-ces/|title=Where's ARM at CES?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307152217/https://blogs.arm.com/smart-connected-devices/870-ever-wonder-where%E2%80%99s-arm-at-ces/|archive-date=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=May 2013}} This dominance began with the release of the mobile-focused and comparatively power-efficient 32-bit ARM610 processor&lt;!--not SoC--&gt; originally designed for the [[Apple Newton]] in 1993 and ARM3-using Acorn A4 laptop in 1992. The chip was adopted by Psion, Palm and Nokia for PDAs and later smartphones, camera phones, cameras, etc. ARM's licensing model supported this success by allowing device manufacturers to license, alter and fabricate custom SoC derivatives tailored to their own products. This has helped manufacturers extend battery life and shrink component count along with the size of devices.

The multiple licensees ensured that multiple fabricators could supply near-identical products, while encouraging price competition. This forced unit prices down to a fraction of their x86 equivalents. The architecture has historically had limited support from Microsoft, with only [[Windows CE]] available, but with the 2012 release of Windows 8, Microsoft announced additional support for the architecture, shipping their own ARM-based tablet computer, branded the [[Microsoft Surface]], as well as an x86-64 Intel Core i5 variant branded as Microsoft Surface Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPad Price, Features Say "ARM" All Over |url=https://www.bnet.com/blog/mobile-internet/apple-ipad-price-features-say-8220arm-8221-all-over/133 |publisher=bnet |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823032856/https://www.bnet.com/blog/mobile-internet/apple-ipad-price-features-say-8220arm-8221-all-over/133 |archivedate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |title=ARM vs. Intel: How the Processor Wars Will Benefit Consumers |author=Tim Barjarin |date=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912022324/https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |archivedate=September 12, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |title=The Economist - Space invaders, America’s Intel and Britain's ARM have long dominated different bits of the global chip market.

[[File:IFA 2010 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin 18.JPG|[[Samsung Galaxy Tab]] demonstrating [[multi-touch]]|thumb]]
A key component among tablet computers is touch input on a [[touchscreen]] [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD). This allows the user to navigate easily and type with a [[virtual keyboard]] on the screen or press other icons on the screen to open apps or files. The first tablet to do this was the [[GRiDPad]] by [[GRiD Systems Corporation]]; the tablet featured both a [[stylus]], a pen-like tool to aid with precision in a touchscreen device as well as an on-screen keyboard.&lt;ref name="PCM"&gt;[[Jeff Hawkins]]: {{cite web|last=Barnett|first=Shawn|title=Jeff Hawkins |url= http://www.pencomputing.com/palm/Pen33/hawkins2.html|publisher=Pen Computing Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105074923/http://www.pencomputing.com/palm/Pen33/hawkins2.html|archivedate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system must respond to on-screen touches rather than clicks of a keyboard or mouse. This operation makes precise use of our [[eye–hand coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20016818-37.html|title=Best Buy: iPad cutting into laptop sales|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617064236/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20016818-37.html|archivedate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/17/notebook-sales-growth-goes-negative-can-we-blame-the-ipad-yet/|title=Notebook sales growth goes negative.

Touchscreens usually come in one of two forms:
* [[Resistive touchscreen]]s are passive and respond to pressure on the screen. They allow a high level of [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], useful in emulating a [[pointer (computing WIMP)|pointer]] (as is common in tablet computers) but may require calibration. Because of the high resolution, a stylus or fingernail is often used. Stylus-oriented systems are less suited to [[multi-touch]].
* [[capacitive sensing|Capacitive touchscreens]] tend to be less accurate, but more responsive than resistive devices. Because they require a conductive material, such as a finger tip, for input, they are not common among stylus-oriented devices, but are prominent on consumer devices. Most finger-driven capacitive screens do not currently support pressure input (except for the [[iPhone 6S]] and later models), but some tablets use a pressure-sensitive stylus or [[active pen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pro Pen for Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 {{!}} Handwriting on Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2|url = https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/pro-pen?os=windows-10|website = www.microsoft.com|accessdate = December 31, 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151228212851/http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/pro-pen?os=windows-10|archivedate = December 28, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some tablets can recognize individual palms, while some professional-grade tablets use pressure-sensitive films, such as those on [[graphics tablet]]s. Some capacitive touch-screens can detect the size of the touched area and the pressure used.&lt;ref name="buxtonoverview"&gt;Buxton, Bill. [http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html Multitouch Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002204530/http://billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html |date=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since mid-2010s, most tablets use [[capacitive sensing|capacitive]] [[touchscreen]]s with [[multi-touch]], unlike earlier [[resistive touchscreen]] devices which users needed styluses in order to perform inputs.

=== Handwriting recognition ===
[[File:人-red.png|thumb|upright|Chinese characters like this one meaning "person" can be written by handwriting recognition ([[File:人-order.gif|20px|人 animation]], [[Chinese language|Mandarin]]: ''rén'', [[Korean language|Korean]]: ''in'', Japanese: ''jin'', ''nin''; ''hito'', [[Cantonese]]: jan4). The character has two strokes, the first shown here in brown, and the second in red. The black area represents the starting position of the writing instrument.]]
Some ARM powered tablets, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1|Galaxy Note 10]], support a stylus and support [[handwriting recognition]]. [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] and [[N-trig]] digital pens provide approximately 2500 DPI resolution for handwriting, exceeding the resolution of capacitive touch screens by more than a factor of 10. These pens also support pressure sensitivity, allowing for "variable-width stroke-based" characters, such as Chinese/Japanese/Korean writing, due to their built-in capability of "pressure sensing". Pressure is also used in digital art applications such as [[Autodesk Sketchbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/100826/technology/lifestyle_hongkong_china_japan_culture_technology |title=China using keyboards versus tablet input |access-date=September 13, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruetersward.com/biblio.html|title=Annotated Bibliography in On-line Character Recognition, Pen Computing, Gesture User Interfaces and Tablet and Touch Computers|work=ruetersward.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215212931/http://ruetersward.com/biblio.html|archivedate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apps exist on both iOS and Android platforms for handwriting recognition and in 2015 Google introduced its own handwriting input with support for 82 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google releases new Handwriting Input keyboard with support for 82 languages|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/google-releases-new-handwriting-input-keyboard-support-82-languages|first=Dan|last=Thorp-Lancaster|date=Apr 15, 2015|publisher=Android Central|accessdate=Dec 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218015826/http://www.androidcentral.com/google-releases-new-handwriting-input-keyboard-support-82-languages|archivedate=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other features ===
After 2007, with access to capacitive screens and the success of the iPhone, other features became common, such as multi-touch features (in which the user can touch the screen in multiple places to trigger actions and other [[natural user interface]] features, as well as [[flash memory]] [[solid state storage]] and "instant on" [[Warm boot|warm-booting]]; external [[USB]] and [[Bluetooth]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]] defined tablets.

Most tablets released since mid-2010 use a version of an [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor for longer battery life. The [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore|ARM Cortex family]] is powerful enough for tasks such as [[Mobile browser|internet browsing]], light production work and [[mobile game]]s.&lt;ref name="The Coming War: ARM versus x86"&gt;[http://vanshardware.com/2010/08/mirror-the-coming-war-arm-versus-x86/ The Coming War: ARM versus x86] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018002338/http://vanshardware.com/2010/08/mirror-the-coming-war-arm-versus-x86/ |date=October 18, 2010 }} Mirror for: ''The Bright Side of News'' April 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features are: High-definition, [[anti-glare screen|anti-glare display]], touchscreen, lower weight and longer [[battery (electricity)#battery lifetime|battery life]] than a comparably-sized laptop, wireless local area and internet connectivity (usually with [[Wi-Fi]] standard and optional [[mobile broadband]]), [[Bluetooth]] for connecting peripherals and communicating with local devices, ports for wired connections and charging, for example [[USB port]]s, Early devices had IR support and could work as a TV [[remote controller]], [[docking station]], keyboard and additional connectivity, on-board [[flash memory]], ports for removable storage, various [[cloud storage]] services for backup and [[file synchronization|syncing]] data across devices, Local storage on a [[LAN]]

* [[Speech recognition]] Google introduced voice input in Android 2.1 in 2009 and [[Voice Actions|voice actions]] in 2.2 in 2010, with up to five languages (now around 40).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First look: Google's new Voice Actions for Android|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2468793/mobile-apps/first-look--google-s-new-voice-actions-for-android.html|first=JR|last=Raphael|date=Aug 12, 2010|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=Dec 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421003717/http://www.computerworld.com/article/2468793/mobile-apps/first-look--google-s-new-voice-actions-for-android.html|archivedate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siri]] was introduced as a system-wide personal assistant on the [[iPhone 4S]] in 2011 and now supports nearly 20 languages. In both cases the voice input is sent to central servers to perform general speech recognition and therefore requires a network connection for more than simple commands.
* [[Near field communication]] with other compatible devices including [[ISO/IEC 14443]] RFID tags.

==Software==

=== Operating system ===

Tablets, like conventional PCs, use several different [[operating system]]s, though [[Multi boot|dual-booting]] is rare. Tablet operating systems come in two classes:

* [[Desktop computer]] operating system
* [[Mobile operating system]]

Desktop OS-based tablets are currently thicker and heavier. They require more storage and [[CPU power dissipation|more cooling]] and give less battery life. They can run processor-intensive graphical applications in addition to [[mobile app]]s, and have more [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro review|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/05/microsoft-surface-pro-review/|publisher=engadget|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610065216/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/05/microsoft-surface-pro-review/|archivedate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile-based tablets are the reverse, and run only mobile apps. They can use battery life conservatively because the processor is significantly smaller. This allows the battery to last much longer than the common laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423063,00.asp |title = Laptops vs. Tablets: The Ultimate Showdown

==== iOS ====
{{Main article|iOS|iPad}}
The iPad runs on [[iOS]], which was created for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]]. The first iPad was released in 2011. Although built on the same underlying [[Unix]] implementation as MacOS, its user interface is radically different. iOS is designed for fingers and has none of the features that required a stylus on earlier tablets. Apple introduced [[multi-touch]] gestures, such as moving two fingers apart or together to zoom in or out, also known as "pinch to zoom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Years Ago, Apple Made a Crowd Gasp With Pinch to Zoom and Swiping|url=http://petapixel.com/2013/03/29/six-years-ago-apple-made-a-crowd-gasp-with-pinch-to-zoom-and-swiping/|accessdate=June 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704204324/http://petapixel.com/2013/03/29/six-years-ago-apple-made-a-crowd-gasp-with-pinch-to-zoom-and-swiping/|archivedate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; iOS is built for the [[ARM architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple tablet rumors redux: 10.7-inch display, iPhone OS underneath|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/29/apple-tablet-rumors-redux-10-7-inch-display-iphone-os-undernea/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=August 6, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214065639/http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/29/apple-tablet-rumors-redux-10-7-inch-display-iphone-os-undernea|archivedate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Tablet PC, Microsoft announced the [[Ultra-mobile PC]] initiative in 2006 which brought Windows tablets to a smaller, touch-centric form factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live from Steve Ballmer's CES 2010 keynote|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/06/live-from-steve-ballmers-ces-2010-keynote/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=August 4, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712220344/http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/06/live-from-steve-ballmers-ces-2010-keynote/|archivedate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20019267-56.html?tag=mncol;mlt_related |title=Initial Windows 7 tablets are slated to appear during holiday 2010 season |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Microsoft showed a prototype of a two-screen tablet called [[Microsoft Courier]], but cancelled the project.

In 2012, Microsoft released [[Windows 8]], which features significant changes to various aspects of the operating system's user interface and platform which are designed for touch-based devices such as tablets. The operating system also introduced an [[Windows Store|application store]] and a new style of application optimized primarily for use on tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/netapp/2012/10/11/windows-8-release-date-tablet-microsoft-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Betting BIG on Cloud with Windows 8 and Tablets |last=Einstein |first=Dave |date=October 11, 2012 |work=Forbes |publisher= |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013024647/http://www.forbes.com/sites/netapp/2012/10/11/windows-8-release-date-tablet-microsoft-cloud/ |archivedate=October 13, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw-building"&gt;{{cite news|title=Build: More Details On Building Windows 8 Metro Apps|url=http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287736-build-more-details-on-building-windows-8-metro-apps|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=February 10, 2012|first=Michael|last=Miller|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217202913/http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287736-build-more-details-on-building-windows-8-metro-apps|archivedate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also introduced [[Windows RT]], an edition of Windows 8 for use on ARM-based devices.&lt;ref name="wsj-rtname"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gara|first=Tom|title=What Does the ‘RT’ In Windows RT Stand For?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2012/10/26/what-does-the-rt-in-windows-rt-stand-for-nothing-andor-something/|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=July 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726135721/http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2012/10/26/what-does-the-rt-in-windows-rt-stand-for-nothing-andor-something/|archivedate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of Windows 8 and RT was accompanied by the release of devices with the two operating systems by various manufacturers (including Microsoft themselves, with the release of [[Microsoft Surface|Surface]]), such as slate tablets, hybrids, and convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Windows 8 tablets: all the Windows 8 tablets we've reviewed|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/computing/windows-8-tablets-release-date-specs-and-prices-916134|publisher=Tech Radar|accessdate=June 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606030511/http://www.techradar.com/us/news/computing/windows-8-tablets-release-date-specs-and-prices-916134|archivedate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in July 2015, Windows 10 introduces what Microsoft described as "[[universal app]]s"; expanding on [[Metro-style app]]s, these apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code‍—‌including [[Personal computer|PCs]], tablets, [[smartphone]]s, [[embedded system]]s, [[Xbox One]], [[Surface Hub]] and [[Windows Holographic]]. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [[touchscreen]]-optimized interface based on available input devices‍—‌particularly on [[2-in-1 PC]]s; both interfaces include an updated [[Start menu]].

[[mobile app|App]]s that do not come pre-installed with the system are supplied through [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices|online distribution]].

Mobile device suppliers may adopt a [[walled garden (technology)|"walled garden"]] approach, wherein the supplier controls what software applications ("[[Mobile app|app]]s") are available. [[Software development kit]]s are restricted to approved software developers. This can be used to reduce the impact of [[malware]], provide software with an approved [[content rating]], control application quality and exclude competing vendors.&lt;ref&gt;This "vicious cycle" (slow hardware development masking slow hardware, causing slow response, causing slow software development, causing sluggish performance at an unrealistic price, causing sluggish sales) serves only to impede further software investment. "HP reboots to confront Tablet Effect" ''Barron's'', August 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] all adopted the strategy.

A '''tally counter''' is a mechanical, electronic, or software device used to incrementally count something, typically fleeting. One of the most common things tally counters are used for is counting people, animals, or things that are quickly coming and going from some location.

==Description==
[[Image:Tally Counters.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanical tally counters|207x207px]]
A tally counter is usually cased in metal and is cylindrical in shape.  Part of the circle is flattened out and contains a window of plastic or glass.  Inside the counter are a number of rings  with the numbers from 0 to 9 in descending order going clockwise.  Most counters have four such rings, allowing the user to count up to 9999.  A metal ring may be attached to aid in holding the counter, and usually half the ring is bent to allow it to fold flush with the counter when not in use.

The counter is activated by pressing a button located above the screen.  This causes the first ring to advance one number.  After the count has reached 0009, then the second ring will advance one click and the first ring will come back to zero displaying 0010.  To reset the counter, a knob is located on the side.  This knob turns all the rings which are displaying the same number (usually zero). When the number displayed reaches the number on the remaining rings, then they will turn too, until the display is reset back to 0000. (Analog [[odometer]]s in vehicles operate in a similar fashion.)

Electronic tally counters are available, which use an LCD screen to display the count, and a button to advance the count. Some also have a button to decrement the count, for example if a mistake is made, or if counting a majority. 
[[File:Digital tally counter.jpg|thumb|189x189px|A digital tally counter]]

==Uses==
The main application of tally counters is as [[people counter]]s. At concerts, stadiums, etc., a person will stand by the door with a tally counter recording the number of people that enter. At [[amusement parks]], the rides can only hold a certain number of people, so the operator may use a tally counter to keep track of the number of people who get on the ride. They are also used for traffic analysis, scientific research, counting inventory and on industrial lines as well.

Tally counters have also been used in religion to count prayers, often replacing traditional prayer beads. [[Shri Vidya]] initiates often use them to keep track of the number of repetitions of the Mula Mantra into which they are initiated. [[Sikh]]s may use them to keep track of the number of times they chant the [[Mul Mantar]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] have also been known to use them to count [[Mantra|mantras]]. [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] Hindus may use tally counters to keep track of the number of times that they chant the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna Mahamantra]]. Initiated devotees are required to chant a certain number of 'rounds' each day, each round consisting of 108 repetitions.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

[[File:Joshua Topolsky.jpg|thumb|Joshua Topolsky, founding editor-in-chief at ''The Verge'']]

Throughout the 2010s, [[AOL]] began to acquire websites in pursuit of a new ad-driven content strategy for the company.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; One of their first acquisitions was [[Weblogs, Inc.]] in 2005, a company that ran dozens of websites, including ''[[Engadget]]'', a [[Technology journalism|tech news]] website.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; According to ''[[Business Insider]]'', ''Engadget'' "became the industry-leading gadget site", and AOL's "most popular and important media property."&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; ''[[All Things Digital]]'' called it "one of the largest in tech".&lt;ref name="ATD: Engadget's Top Editors" /&gt;

[[Joshua Topolsky]] became ''Engadget''{{'}}s editor-in-chief in 2007, and was responsible for new efforts like ''The Engadget Show'' and their mobile app, and the site's continued growth.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; Animosities between Topolsky and AOL developed after AOL's September 2010 [[TechCrunch]] acquisition, when TechCrunch founder [[Michael Arrington]] made several public remarks disparaging ''Engadget'' and Topolsky.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: AOL's New Problem" /&gt; When the acrimony between the two editors escalated in January 2011,&lt;ref name="BI: Arrington Explodes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Enough Is Enough" /&gt; AOL didn't intervene.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; The next month, an internal AOL editor training document called "The AOL Way", a new content strategy that prioritized profitability metrics, leaked to the press.&lt;ref name="BI: The AOL Way" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT: Shackled" /&gt; The document leaked before ''Engadget'' writers and editors saw it internally.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; "The AOL Way" dispirited the ''Engadget'' staff and created an ideological schism between the two entities.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Paul Miller" /&gt;

{{quotebox|quoted=1|align=center|width=33%|quote=We [''Engadget''] have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, and I thought we could be more successful elsewhere.|source=Former ''[[Engadget]]'' editor-in-chief [[Joshua Topolsky]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 2011&lt;ref name="NYT: Shackled" /&gt;}}

=== Vox Media / SB Nation ===
Between March and April 2011, Topolsky and up to eight of ''Engadget''{{'}}s most prominent writers, editors, and product developers left AOL to found a new gadget site that would become ''The Verge''.&lt;ref name="ATD: Engadget's Top Editors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT: Shackled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Paul Miller" /&gt; The other departing editors included managing editor [[Nilay Patel]] and staffers Paul Miller, Ross Miller, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, as well as product developers Justin Glow, and Dan Chilton.&lt;ref name="ATD: Engadget's Top Editors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCM: New Rival Tech Site" /&gt; In early April 2011, Topolsky announced that their unnamed new site would be produced in partnership with sports news website [[SB Nation]], debuting some time in the fall.&lt;ref name="ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYM: AOL Loses" /&gt; Topolsky lauded SB Nation's similar interest in the future of publishing, including what he described as their beliefs in independent journalism and in-house development of their own content delivery tools.&lt;ref name="ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCM: New Rival Tech Site" /&gt; [[Jim Bankoff]] of SB Nation saw an overlap in the two sites' demographics and an opportunity to expand SB Nation's model.&lt;ref name="ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL" /&gt; Bankoff previously worked at AOL in 2005, where he led their ''Engadget'' acquisition.&lt;ref name="AW: Staff of AOL" /&gt; Other news outlets viewed the partnership as positive for both SB Nation and Topolsky's staff, and negative for AOL's outlook.&lt;ref name="GO: Deflection" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes: AOL Defector" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Quit AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: The Engadget Team" /&gt;

Bankoff, [[chairman]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of what became [[Vox Media]], the owner of the SB Nation brand, after the launch of The Verge said in a 2011 interview that though the company had started out with a focus on sports, other categories including consumer technology had growth potential for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beet.tv/2011/05/sbnation.html |title=With Deep Pockets, SB Nation is "Building a Great Media Company" – Launches Interim Site for ex-''Engadget'' Crew, Sets up Shop in NYC |date=May 1, 2011 |publisher=beet.tv |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankoff also expressed a wish to attract other journalists and bloggers outside of the sports medium to Vox Media.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Following news of his untitled partnership with SB Nation in April 2011, Topolsky announced that the ''Engadget'' podcast hosted by Patel, Paul Miller, and himself would continue at an interim site called ''This Is My Next''.&lt;ref name="ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; By August 2011, the site had reached 1 million unique visitors and 3.4 million page views.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; By October 2011, the site had 3 million unique views per month and 10 million total page views.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney: Beyond just gadgets" /&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed the site in its Best Blogs of 2011,&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; calling the prototype site "exemplary".&lt;ref name="Time: Best Blogs of 2011" /&gt; The site closed upon ''The Verge''{{'}}s launch on November 1, 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:This is my next 2014.png|thumb|''This Is My Next'' logo (2014–)]]
On June 11, 2014, The Verge launched a new section on TheVerge.com called "This Is My Next",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5798884/welcome-to-this-is-my-next-your-buying-guide-for-the-future |title=Welcome to This Is My Next, your buying guide for the future |publisher=Vox Media |work=The Verge |date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by former editor David Pierce, as a buyer's guide for consumer electronics.

=== Official launch ===
''The Verge'' launched November 1, 2011, along with an announcement of a new parent company: Vox Media.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney: Beyond just gadgets" /&gt; According to the company, the site launched with 4 million unique visitors and 20 million pageviews.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; At the time of Topolsky's departure, ''Engadget'' had 14 million unique visitors.&lt;ref name="ATD: Engadget's Top Editors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Quit AOL" /&gt; Vox Media overall doubled its unique visitors to about 15 million during the last half of 2012.&lt;ref name="BI: The Raid on AOL" /&gt; ''The Verge'' had 12 former Engadget staffers working with Topolsky at the time of launch.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney: Beyond just gadgets" /&gt; By 2016, the website's advertising had shifted significantly from display advertisements matched with content to partnerships and advertisements with user-specific tweaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/31/13479070/refreshing-the-verge-vox-media-hymnal-concert-revenue |title=Refreshing The Verge: how does this thing make money, anyway? |publisher= |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vox revamped ''The Verge''{{'s}} visual design for its fifth anniversary in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/11/as-the-verge-turns-five-heres-how-its-thinking-about-building-a-news-site-for-the-distributed-age/ |title=As The Verge turns five, here’s how it’s thinking about building a news site for the distributed age |publisher= |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, The Verge fired deputy editor Chris Ziegler after it learned that he had been working for Apple since July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carson |first1=Biz |title=A high-level editor at a top tech blog secretly worked for Apple for months |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-zielger-worked-both-apple-verge-2016-9 |accessdate=January 4, 2017 |work=Business Insider |date=September 23, 2016 |quote=Ziegler had actively worked on stories throughout July while also employed by Apple. After he fell silent in August, The Verge tried to get in touch with him since they were 'in the dark and concerned for Chris'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
''The Verge'' logo featured a modified [[Penrose triangle]], an [[impossible object]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/93205712771096576 |title=Also, our logo and branding was done by the amazing Area 17.

==== ''On The Verge'' ====
On August 6, 2011, in an interview with [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]], [[Marty Moe]], publisher and co-founder of ''The Verge'', announced that they would soon be launching ''The Verge Show'', a [[web television]] series.  After the site's launch, the show was named ''On The Verge''. The first episode was taped on Monday, November 14, 2011, with guest [[Matias Duarte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chad Mumm |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/8/2547883/on-the-verge-arrive-on-monday-november-14th-with-matias-duarte |title=On The Verge' arrives on Monday, November 14th with Matias Duarte |date=November 7, 2011 |work=The Verge |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is a [[technology journalism|technology news]] entertainment show, and its format is similar to that of a [[late-night talk show]], but it is broadcast over the [[Internet]], not on [[television]]. The show's first episode was released on November 15, 2011.

''On The Verge'' is similar to The Engadget Show, an online program run by the technology news blog [[Engadget]].

Ten episodes of the show were broadcast, with the most recent episode going out on November 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/on-the-verge |title=On The Verge |date=November 10, 2012 |accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2013, it was announced that the show would return under a new weekly format, alongside a new logo and theme tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/24/4361460/on-the-verge-is-coming-back |title=On The Verge is coming back |date=May 24, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mc cormick.JPG|thumb|Brass [[token coin|trade token]] from [[Fort Laramie]], Dakota Territory, used in a truck system]]

'''Truck wages''' are any arrangement under which wages are paid in the form of: [[barter|payment in kind]] (i.e. commodities, including goods and/or services); [[credit]] with retailers or; a [[money substitute]], such as [[scrip]], [[Voucher|chit]]s, [[voucher]]s or [[token coin|token]]s,  rather than with conventional [[money]]. '''Truck''', in this context, is an [[archaism|archaic]] English language word meaning "exchange" or "barter" (and is derived from the French ''[[Wiktionary:troquer|troquer]]'').

By contrast, the term '''truck system''' usually refers to a specific set of practices under which employees are defrauded and/or exploited. This may take one or both of two forms. Firstly, the payment in kind, credit, or money substitute is demonstrably of a lesser [[market value]] than the amount of money that would normally be paid for the same work. Secondly, truck systems are normally regarded as undesirable or illegal because they limit employees' ability to choose how to spend their earnings. For example, credit or [[company scrip]] might be usable only for the purchase of goods at a monopolistic [[company store|company-owned store]], at which prices are set artificially high and there is no competition to lower prices. Hence, a truck system relies on a closed economic system in which employees are: required to become indebted, subject to a retail monopoly in essential goods and/or considered [[unfree labour]]. Such a system may appear to be a fair, free and legal exchange, whereby an employer offers something of value (typically goods, food or housing) in exchange for labour, with the result being the same as if the laborer had been paid money and then spent the money on those necessities. Truck systems have been specifically outlawed in many countries by [[legislation]] (which is part of the larger field of [[labour law]] and employment standards, such as the British [[Truck Acts]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[G.W. Hilton]] (1958), ''The Truck Act of 1831''. [[The Economic History Review]], 10: 470–479&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

===Britain===
While truck systems had long existed in many parts of the world, it was widespread during the 18th and early-19th centuries in Britain. Despite a long history of legislation intended to curb truck systems ([[Truck Acts]]), they remained common into the 20th century. In a prosecution brought against a [[Manchester]] cotton manufacturer in 1827 one worker gave evidence that he had received wages of only two [[shilling]]s in nine months; the rest "he was obliged to take [in goods] from the manufacturer's daughter, who was also the cashier".&lt;ref name=AspinP108&gt;{{Harvnb|Aspin|1995|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the truck system was sometimes referred to as the Tommy system. The 1901 edition of [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes the Tommy shop as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where wages are paid to workmen who are expected to lay out a part of the money for the good of the shop. Tommy means bread or a penny roll, or the food taken by a workman in his handkerchief; it also means goods in lieu of money. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Midland Tour'' of his [[Rural Rides]], the agriculturist and political reformer [[William Cobbett]] reports the use of "the truck or tommy system" in [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Shrewsbury]]. He describes the logic of the Tommy as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The manner of carrying on the tommy system is this: suppose there to be a master who employs a hundred men. That hundred men, let us suppose, to earn a pound a week each. This is not the case in the iron-works; but no matter, we can illustrate our meaning by one sum as well as by another. These men lay out weekly the whole of the hundred pounds in victuals, drink, clothing, bedding, fuel, and house-rent. Now, the master finding the profits of his trade fall off very much, and being at the same time in want of money to pay the hundred pounds weekly, and perceiving that these hundred pounds are carried away at once, and given to shopkeepers of various descriptions; to butchers, bakers, drapers, hatters, shoemakers, and the rest; and knowing that, on an average, these shopkeepers must all have a profit of thirty ''per cent.'', or more, he determines to ''keep this thirty per cent. to himself''; and this is thirty pounds a week gained as a shop-keeper, which amounts to 1,560[[pound sterling|l.]] a year. He, therefore, sets up a tommy shop: a long place containing every commodity that the workman can want, liquor and house-room excepted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Cobbett sees nothing wrong ''in itself'' in the tommy system, he notes that ''The only question is in this case of the manufacturing tommy work, whether the master charges a higher price than the shop-keepers would charge;'' but given the guaranteed market Cobbett sees no reason why any master should ever abuse the system.
However, in rural regions he notes the virtual monopoly of the shopkeeper:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have often had to observe on the cruel effects of the suppression of markets and fairs, and on the consequent power of extortion possessed by the country shop-keepers. And what a thing it is to reflect on, that these shopkeepers have the whole of the labouring men of England constantly in their debt; have on an average a mortgage on their wages to the amount of five or six weeks, and make them pay any price that they choose to extort.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United States===
One reason for the truck system in the early history of the United States is that there was no national form of paper currency and an insufficient supply of coinage. Banknotes were the majority of the money in circulation. Banknotes were discounted relative to gold and silver (e.g. a $5 banknote might be exchanged for $4.50 of coins) and the discount depended on the financial strength of the issuing bank and distance from the bank. During financial crises many banks failed and their notes became worthless.&lt;ref name="David Ginsburg"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nFkJTM2Rzc0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=how+gold+coins+circulated+in+nineteenth+century+america+ginsberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z9uQ94aZD0&amp;sig=Jk7Kb34_Gc3VifSLhTBVGaTSl7E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lnw2T43rHMjptgfWg93JAg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20gold%20coins%20circulated%20in%20nineteenth%20century%20america%20ginsberg&amp;f=false ''How Gold Coins Circulated in 19th Century America'' David Ginsburg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1951"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular song "[[Sixteen Tons]]" dramatizes this scenario, with the narrator telling [[Saint Peter]] (who would welcome him to Heaven upon his death), "I can't go; I owe my soul to the company store".

A '''tree chipper''' or '''woodchipper''' is a machine used for reducing [[wood]] (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller [[woodchips]].  They are often portable, being mounted on wheels on frames suitable for towing behind a truck or van. Power is generally provided by an [[internal combustion engine]] from {{convert|3|hp|kW}} to {{convert|1000|hp|kW}}. There are also high power chipper models mounted on trucks and powered by a separate engine. These models usually also have a [[hydraulic crane]].

Tree chippers are typically made of a hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional collection bin for the chips. A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from the chipping blades) and started into the chipping mechanism. The chips exit through a chute and can be directed into a truck-mounted container or onto the ground. Typical output is chips on the order of {{convert|1|in|cm}} to {{convert|2|in|cm}} across in size. The resulting wood chips have various uses such as being spread as a ground cover or being fed into a [[digester (disambiguation)|digester]] during [[papermaking]].

Most woodchippers rely on energy stored in a heavy [[flywheel]] to do their work (although some use drums). The chipping blades are mounted on the face of the flywheel, and the flywheel is accelerated by an electric motor or internal combustion engine.

Large woodchippers are frequently equipped with grooved rollers in the throat of their feed funnels. Once a branch has been gripped by the rollers, the rollers transport the branch to the chipping blades at a steady rate. These rollers are a safety feature and are generally reversible for situations where a branch gets caught on [[clothing]].

==History==

The woodchipper was invented by Peter Jensen (Maasbüll, Germany) in 1884, the "Marke Angeln" woodchipper soon became the core business of his company, which already produced and repaired communal- and woodworking-machinery.

==Types==

===High-torque roller===
Shredders that make use of high-torque low-speed grinding rollers are growing in popularity for residential use. These shredders are driven with an electric motor and are very quiet, dust free, and self-feeding.  Some of these machines are equipped with an anti-jamming feature.

===Disc===
[[File:Fulghum-96-10K.jpg|thumb|Fulghum Industries 96”-10K CCW Chipper]]
The original chipper design employs a steel disk with knives mounted upon it as the chipping mechanism. This technology dates back to an invention by German Heinrich Wigger, for which he obtained a patent in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/DE350958C?cl=en&lt;/ref&gt;  In this design, (usually) reversible hydraulically powered wheels draw the material from the hopper towards the disk, which is mounted perpendicularly to the incoming material. As the disk spins, the knives cut the material into chips. These are thrown out the chute by flanges on the drum. This design is not as [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] as the drum-style design, but produces chips of more uniform shape and size. Most chippers currently used by commercial tree care companies are disk-type.

Consumer-grade disk-style chippers usually have a material diameter capacity of {{convert|6|to|18|in|cm}}. Industrial-grade chippers are available with discs as large as {{convert|160|in|m}} in diameter, requiring {{convert|4000|to|5000|hp|kW}}. One application of industrial disk chippers is to produce the wood chips used in the manufacture of [[particle board]].

===Drum===
[[Image:Bandit Model 1290H drum chipper.jpg|thumb|right|A modern drum chipper "Bandit Industries Model 1290H"]]
Newer chippers employ mechanisms consisting of a large steel drum powered by a motor, usually by means of a belt. The drum is mounted parallel to the hopper and spins towards the output chute. The drum also serves as the feed mechanism, drawing the material through as it chips it. It is colloquially known as a "chuck-and-duck" chipper, due to the immediate speed attained by material dropped into the drum.

Chippers of this type have many drawbacks and safety issues. If an operator becomes snagged on material being fed into the machine, injury or death is very likely. Chippers of this type are also very loud.  The chips produced may be very large, and if thin material is inserted, it may be cut into slivers rather than chips, and since the drum is directly driven by the engine, materials that are too large or long may stall the engine while usually remaining firmly stuck in the drum.

===Other===

[[Image:Precision Husky Tubgrinder.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Tubgrinder (Precision Husky)]]
Much larger machines for wood processing exist.  "Whole tree chippers" and "Recyclers", which can typically handle material diameters of {{convert|2|ft|cm}} to {{convert|6|ft|cm}} may employ drums, disks, or a combination of both. The largest machines used in wood processing, often called "Tub Grinders", may handle a material diameter of {{convert|8|ft|cm}} or greater, and use carbide tipped flail hammers to pulverize wood rather than cut it. These machines usually have {{convert|200|hp|kW}} to {{convert|1000|hp|kW}}. Some are so heavy that they require a [[semi-trailer truck]] to be transported. Smaller models can be towed by a medium duty truck.

[[Image:Garden Mulcher Knives.jpg|right|thumb|The cutting blades of a small electric chipper. The blades can be removed, by loosening the bolt in the center, to facilitate sharpening or for replacement.]]

==Blades==
Although chippers vary greatly in size, type, and capacity, the blades processing the wood are similar in construction. They are rectangular in shape and are usually {{convert|4|in|cm}} to {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} across by {{convert|6|in|cm}} to {{convert|12|in|cm}} long. They vary in thickness from about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} to {{convert|2|in|cm}}. Chipper blades are made from high grade [[steel]] and usually contain a minimum of 8% [[chromium]] for hardness.

==Safety==
Thirty-one people were killed in woodchipper accidents between 1992 and 2002 in the US, according to a 2005 report by the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.&lt;ref name="R001786"&gt;{{cite news
