==Biography==
Adolf Friedrich Leschnitzer was born in [[Poznań|Posen (as Poznań was known]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|before 1945)]].   He was born into a Jewish merchant family of Polish provenance.  Oscar Leschnitzer (1864–1934), his father, was a pharmacist who moved with his family to [[Berlin]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   Adolf attended the [[:de:Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium (Posen)|Frederick William Gymnasium (secondary school)]] in Posen and, then, after the family moved, the [[:de:Kaiserin-Augusta-Gymnasium|Empress Augusta Gymnasium (secondary school)]] in [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]].   He graduated from the school "cum laude" in 1917.   However, the [[First World War|war]] was raging, and he was now conscripted into the army, serving till 1918.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;

Between 1918 and 1923 he studied [[German studies|Germanistics]], [[History]], [[Philosophy]] and [[Pedagogy]] at Berlin and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]].   It was from Heidelberg University that in 1923 he received his doctorate, with a dissertation on [[Minnesang|Medieval love songs]] (''"Untersuchungen über das Hohelied in Minneliedern"'').&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Röder|author2=Herbert A. Strauss|title=Leschnitzer, Adolf Friedrich  | work=Politik, Wirtschaft, Öffentliches Leben.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mt6c3oFVBz0C&amp;pg=PA434|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter| isbn=978-3-11-097028-9| page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In or before 1926 he passed Levels I and II of the [[ Staatsexamen|National professional exams]] for work in teaching.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;   He had by then embarked on a career as a secondary school teacher of German and History in Berlin.&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;   He qualified as a "student assessor" (examiner) in 1927.&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;    Leschnitzer gained further promotions as he taught at a succession of Berlin secondary schools till 1933.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;   During this period he was also involved in teacher training acted as a consultant in respect of the teaching of German literary history.&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;

After several years during which politics had become ever more polarised and [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]] gridlocked, the [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] [[Machtergreifung|took power]] in January 1933 and lost little time in [[Gleichschaltung|transforming Germany]] into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933|dictatorship]].   Public [[antisemitism]], till now chiefly apparent through a succession of populist political slogans, now became [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|a key underpinning of government policy]].   The so-called [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service |Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (''"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums"'')]] passed in April 1933 provided expressly for the immediate dismissal of "non-Aryans" from a wide range of public-sector jobs.  Adolf Leschnitzer was dismissed from his Berlin teaching post during 1933.&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;
 
That same year he accepted an invitation from [[Leo Baeck]], president of the [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden |"Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden" (''loosely, "National representation of German Jews"'')]], to work as an organisor of Jewish education.&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   He was given charge of the schools department.&lt;ref name=WalkSpiegel&gt;Joseph Walk: Jüdische Schule und Erziehung im Dritten Reich, 1991, pp. 117, 137&lt;/ref&gt;   This meant he was responsible for the education of approximately 38,000 school children in 130 schools.&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   Critical decisions in respect of languages and education had to be addressed in the teaching schedules.   He also found himself at the centre of heated debates on religious instruction, arbitrating between [[Reform Judaism |Liberal]] and [[Orthodox Judaism |Orthodox]] priorities.&lt;ref name=WalkSpiegel/&gt;   Between 1934 and November 1938 Leschnitzer published 29 text booklets for the Jewish schools.   He himself authored booklet 10: "Das Judentum im Weltbild des Mittelalters" (''"Judaism in the late medieval context"''), published in 1935.&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;

In 1939 Leschnitzer emigrated with his wife, the literature scholar Maria Bratz, and their baby son.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;   They travelled via the [[Netherlands]] to their initial destination, which was [[England]], where according to one source Leschnitzer supported himself undertaking library work in Cambridge.&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;   They moved on in 1940 to the [[United States]] where Leschnitzer immediately set about creating and organising the "American Institute of Modern Languages" in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   From 1940 till 1952, with backing vfrom the "New World Club", he directed what was in effect a private language school for newly arrived immigrants, most of whom were refugees, often from political and/or race-based persecution in Germany and central Europe more generally.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;&lt;ref name="RöderStrauss2011"/&gt;  Alongside this work, in 1943 he took a teaching position just outside New York City on its southside at [[Rutgers University–New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;    The United States had entered [[Second World War |the war]] in support of [[Great Britain]] and the [[Soviet Union]] at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor |the end of 1941]].  Leschnitzer taught foreign languages, which involved work for the German Section of the Foreign Area and Language Curriculum of the Army Specialized Training Program.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;   He combined the teaching with work as a consultant to the US [[United States Department of War]] and to the [[United States Office of War Information]].&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;    

[[Second World War |The war in Europe]] [[End of World War II in Europe |ended]] in May 1945.  The western two thirds of Germany were now divided into [[Allied-occupied Germany |four military occupation zones]], with the United States taking on control of most of the southern part of the country.   1945 was also the year in which Leschnitzer authored a memorandum entitled "An Immediate Program for the Reconstruction of the German School System".   He was keen that the next generation of Germans should have a closer understanding of the interplay of German history with Jewish history amd culture, as a way to bring "the two peoples together".&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;

In 1946 he took a job as a languages teacher at the [[City College of New York]] where he continued to work till his retirement in 1966.   Initially he was employed as Professor of  [[German studies|Germanistics]].   In 1958 he took over as head of the department for German and Slavonic Languages.   He was a member of various professional associations, serving as president of the "New York Society of Teachers of German" between 1957 and 1964.&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   In 1955 he joined the executive board (''"Vorstand"'') at the [[Leo Baeck Institute]] in New York, of which he had been a founding member.&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;
Starting in 1952 he also taught a succession of summer courses as a guest professor at the US-sponsored [[Free University of Berlin |Free University of (West) Berlin (FU)]].&lt;ref name=ALlautNDB/&gt;   Between 1955 and 1972 he combined his responsibilities in New York with an active role as Honorary Professor for the History and Culture of Judaism at the FU's "Institute for Jewish Studies" (''"Institut für Judaistik"'').&lt;ref name=ALlautYS/&gt;   The [[Shoah]] was still a recent trauma for millions of survivors, and during the 1950s only very few Jews, of whom Adolf Leschnitzer was one, felt able and willing to work regularly - albeit not permanently - in Berlin.&lt;ref name=ALlautFUB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fu-berlin.de/universitaet/villenkultur/10judaistik/institut/index.html| title=Institut |work=Institut für Judaistik|publisher=Freie Universität Berlin|isbn= 978-3-944675-34-3| author=Simone Ladwig-Winters| accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alekseevsky orphanage of the Mariinsky department''' is a building of the historical significance in [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg]]. It was built in 1905. Nowadays it is an object of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Здание Алексеевского приюта (с оградой)|url=http://kgiop.gov.spb.ru/uchet/list_objects/7026/|work=КГИОП Санкт-Петербурга|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Приказ председателя КГИОП № 15 от 20.02.2001&lt;/ref&gt; The building is located on 20/49 Oktyabrsky Boulevard.

== History ==
The shelter building was erected for money, bequeathed by the secret adviser NS Adamovich. The land was allocated for free by the Tsarskoye Selo Palace. The construction was conducted by the technician A. V. Drucker, it began in 1904, and the shelter was opened on October 5, 1905 (consecrated on November 15, 1905). On the first two floors of the building there was a shelter, named in memory of Adamoviches, for 90 children coming. The third floor houses the former Tsarskoe Selo shelter (which existed since 1842), called the orphanage, for 40 boys.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Октябрьский бульвар 20.

After the October Revolution, the building housed an orphanage, its first inhabitants were children who suffered from hunger in the Volga region. In time, the orphanage received the name of Stalin. During the Great Patriotic War, the children were evacuated. After the occupation of Pushkin by the Soviet army, the headquarters of the 42nd Army was located in the house. After the war, the building was empty, then it was transferred to accommodate the Leningrad Head Area Computing Center of the Ministry of Communications.&lt;ref name="enc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="citywalls" /&gt;

== Architecture ==
The building is brick, three-storeyed on a high basement. In its decoration, red facing brick and light plastering parts, in particular profiled cornices, rods, platbands, rust at the corners of the building and rezalitov are used. The yard facade of the building was rebuilt during the post-war reconstruction.&lt;ref name="enc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="citywalls" /&gt;

'''Alexander Vasilievich Soloviev''' ({{lang-sr|Александар Соловјев}}, {{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Васи́льевич Соловьёв}}) (1890–1971) was a historian of Serbia and Serbian law. He published research on the [[Bogumils]], Serbian heraldry, philately and archeology, and translations from [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[French language|French]].   He was a professor at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] (1920-1936),  first Dean of the [[Sarajevo Law School]] (1947-1949) and professor of Slavic studies at the [[University of Geneva]] (1951-1961).

==Biography==
Alexandr Vasilievich Soloviev was born in Poland in 1890 at [[Kalisz]] (then part of the Russian empire). His father, Vasili Feodorovich Soloviev, was a judge at the [[Appellate Court]] in [[Warsaw]], and it was in Warsaw University that Alexandr studied and graduated, in law (1912) and literature (1914).

In 1917 he became a lecturer in Slavic law in the university of Rostov on Don.

Soloviev moved to Serbia from [[Russia]] in the 1920s, with tens of thousands of other [[White Movement|White Russian]] immigrants. From 1920 to 1936 he was a professor at Belgrade university, where he received his doctorate in 1928 for his thesis on the 14th-century king and legislator [[Stefan Uros IV Dusan of Serbia]].

After the second World War he was dean of the law faculty at Sarajevo university from 1948 to 1949; but after the communist takeover in  [[Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] he and his wife were arrested and exiled from the country in 1949.

Soloviev then became professor of [[Slavic studies]] at the [[University of Geneva]] (1951–1961). Subsequently, he continued his career in [[Washington, D.C.]]

He died on 15 January 1971 in Geneva.

For a short time, he also lectured at the [[Lviv University|University of Lvov]], where he published his research on [[Dušan's Code]] in [[Polish language|Polish]].

His son Alexander worked at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington D.C.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19784">{{Indo-European}}
The '''Anatolian hypothesis''', also known as the '''Anatolian theory''' or the '''sedentary farmer theory''', first developed by [[British people|British]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Colin Renfrew]] in 1987, proposes that the dispersal of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] originated in [[Neolithic]] [[Anatolia]].  It is the main competitor to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], or steppe theory, the more favoured view academically.

==Description==
The Anatolian hypothesis suggests that the speakers of [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) lived in [[Anatolia]] during the [[Neolithic]] era, and it associates the distribution of historical [[Indo-European languages]] with the expansion during the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the 7th and the 6th millennia BC.

This hypothesis states that Indo-European languages began to spread peacefully, by [[demic diffusion]], into Europe from [[Asia Minor]] from around 7000 BC with the [[Neolithic revolution|Neolithic advance of farming]] (''wave of advance''). Accordingly, most inhabitants of [[Neolithic Europe]] would have spoken Indo-European languages, and later migrations would have replaced the Indo-European varieties with other Indo-European varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of agriculture from the Middle East would have diffused three language families: Indo-European toward Europe, Dravidian toward Pakistan and India, and Afro Asiatic toward Arabia and North Africa. Reacting to criticism, Renfrew revised his proposal to the effect of taking a pronounced Indo-Hittite position. Renfrew's revised views place only [[Pre-Proto-Indo-European]] in the 7th millennium BC in Anatolia, proposing as the homeland of Proto-Indo-European proper the [[Balkans]] around 5000 BC, which he explicitly identified as the "[[Old European culture]]", proposed by [[Marija Gimbutas]]. He thus still locates the original source of the Indo-European languages in Anatolia around 7000 BC.

Reconstructions of a Bronze Age PIE society, based on vocabulary items like "wheel", do not necessarily hold for the Anatolian branch, which appears to have separated at an early stage, prior to the invention of wheeled vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|2003|pp=17–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neolithic expansion.svg|thumb|250px|Map showing the Neolithic expansion from the seventh to fifth millennium BC.]]
According to Renfrew (2004), the spread of Indo-European proceeded in the following steps:
*Around 6500 BC: Pre-Proto-Indo-European, in Anatolia, splits into Anatolian and Archaic Proto-Indo-European, the language of the Pre-Proto-Indo-European farmers who migrate to Europe in the initial farming dispersal. Archaic Proto-Indo-European languages occur in the Balkans ([[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]]–[[Körös culture|Körös]] culture), in the Danube valley ([[Linear Pottery culture]]), and possibly in the Bug-Dniestr area (Eastern Linear pottery culture).
*Around 5000 BC: Archaic Proto-Indo-European splits into Northwestern Indo-European (the ancestor of [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]), in the Danube valley, Balkan Proto-Indo-European (corresponding to Gimbutas' [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European]] culture) and Early Steppe Proto-Indo-European (the ancestor of Tocharian).

The main strength of the farming hypothesis lies in its linking of the spread of Indo-European languages with an archaeologically-known event, the spread of farming, which scholars often assume involved significant population shifts.

==Bayesian analysis==
Research published in 2003 of "87 languages with 2,449 lexical items" by [[Russell Gray]] &amp; [[Quentin Atkinson]] found an age range for the "initial Indo-European divergence" of 7800 to 9800 years, which was found to be consistent with the Anatolian hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Gray-Atkinson2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=435–439}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[stochastic process|stochastic models]] to evaluate the presence or absence of different words across Indo-European, {{Harvcoltxt|Gray|Atkinson|2003}} concluded that the origin of Indo-European goes back about 8500 years, the first split being that of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] from the rest ([[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis).

In 2006, the authors of the paper responded to their critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkinson|Gray|2006|pp=91–109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the authors and S. Greenhill found that two different datasets were also consistent with their theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|Greenhill|2011|pp=1090–1100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by Ryder and Nicholls (2011) found support for the Anatolian hypothesis: 
{{quote|Our main result is a unimodal posterior distribution for the age of Proto-Indo-European centred at 8400 years before Present with 95% highest posterior density interval equal to 7100–9800 years before Present."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryder|Nicholls|2011|pp=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A computerized [[phylogeography|phylogeographic]] study was published in August 2012 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', using methods drawn from the [[epidemic model|modeling of the spatial diffusion of infectious diseases]]; it also showed strong support for the Anatolian hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bouckaert|2012|pp=957–960}}.&lt;/ref&gt; despite having undergone corrections and revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Letters: Corrections and Clarifications|magazine=Science|volume=342|date=20 December 2013|p=1446|url=http://www.sciencemagazinedigital.org/sciencemagazine/20_december_2013?folio=1431#pg42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist Paul Heggarty from the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]] wrote in 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heggarty|2014|pp=566–577}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|"Bayesian analysis has come to be widely used in archaeological chronologies.... Its application to linguistic prehistory, however, has proved controversial, in particular on the issue of Indo-European origins. Dating and mapping language distributions back into prehistory has an inevitable fascination, but has remained fraught with difficulty. This review of recent studies highlights the potential of increasingly sophisticated Bayesian phylogenetic models, while also identifying areas of concern, and ways in which the models might be refined to address them. Notwithstanding these remaining limitations, in the Indo-European case the results from Bayesian phylogenetics continue to reinforce the argument for an Anatolian rather than a Steppe origin."}}

==Criticism==
===Bayesian analysis===
[[Bayesian analysis]] has been criticized on account of its inferring the lifespan of a language from that of some of its words; the idiosyncratic outcome of, for example, the [[Albanian language]] raises doubts about the method and the data.&lt;ref name=Holm&gt;{{harvnb|Holm|2007|pp=167–214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictory results in statistical, automated and analytical studies===
Furthermore, other lexicostatistical (and some glottochronological) studies have produced results different from the results produced by Gray and Atkinson.&lt;ref name=Holm/&gt;, as has a 2015 phylogenetic analysis which instead supports the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/576998/summary|author=Will Chang, Chundra Cathcart, David Hall, Andrew Garrett | journal=Language|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|date=2015|volume=91|number=1|pages=193-244}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Dating===
However, the main objection to the Anatolian hypothesis is that it requires an unrealistically early date. Most estimates date Proto-Indo-European between 4500 and 2500 BC, with the most probable date around 3700 BC. It is unlikely that late PIE, even after the separation of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian branch]], postdates 2500 BC, as [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] is usually dated to just before 2000 BC. On the other hand, it is not very likely that early PIE predates 4500 BC, as the reconstructed vocabulary strongly suggests a culture of the terminal phase of the Neolithic bordering on the early [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=199–219}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to linguistic analysis, the Proto-Indo-European lexicon seems to include words for a range of inventions and practices related to the [[Secondary Products Revolution]], which postdates the early spread of farming. On lexico-cultural dating, Proto-Indo-European cannot be earlier than 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

PIE contains words for technologies that make their first appearance in the archaeological record in the Late Neolithic, in some cases bordering on the early Bronze Age, some belonging to the oldest layers of PIE. The lexicon includes words relating to agriculture (dated to 7500 BC), stockbreeding (6500 BC), metallurgy (5500 BC), the plow (4500 BC), gold (4500 BC), domesticated horses (4000–3500 BC) and wheeled vehicles (4000–3400 BC). Horse breeding is thought to have originated with the [[Sredny Stog culture]], semi-nomadic pastoralists living in the [[forest steppe]] zone, now in Ukraine. Wheeled vehicles are thought to have originated with [[Funnelbeaker culture]] in what is now [[Poland]], [[Belarus]] and parts of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Piggott|1983|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Many Indo-European languages have [[cognate]] words meaning ''axle'': Latin ''axis'', Lithuanian ''ašis'', Russian ''os' '', and Sanskrit ''ákṣa''. (In some, a similar [[root (linguistics)|root]] is used for the word ''armpit'': ''eaxl'' in Old English, ''axilla'' in Latin, and ''kaksa'' in Sanskrit.) All of them are linked to the PIE root ''ak's-''. The reconstructed PIE root ''i̯eu-g-'' gives rise to German ''joch'', Hittite ''iukan'', Latin ''iugum'' and Sanskrit ''yugá(m)'', all meaning [[yoke]]. Words for ''wheel'' and ''cart/wagon/chariot'' take one of two common forms, thought to be linked with two PIE roots: the root ''kʷel-'' "move around" is the basis of the unique derivative ''kʷekʷlo-'' "wheel" which becomes ''hvél'' (wheel) in Old Icelandic, ''kolo'' (wheel, circle) in Old Church Slavonic, ''kãkla-'' (neck) in Lithuanian, ''kyklo-'' (wheel, circle) in Greek, ''cakka-/cakra-'' (wheel) in [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]], and ''kukäl'' (wagon, chariot) in [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] A. The root ''ret(h)-'' becomes ''rad'' (wheel) in Old High German, ''rota'' (wheel) in Latin, ''rãtas'' (wheel) in Lithuanian, and ''ratha'' (wagon, chariot) in Sanskrit.

===Farming===
The idea that farming was spread from Anatolia in a single wave has been revised. Instead, it appears to have spread in several waves by several routes, primarily from the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinhasi|Fort|Ammerman|2005|pp=2220–2228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trail of plant domesticates indicates an initial foray from the Levant by sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|2008|pp=42–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The overland route via Anatolia seems to have been most significant in spreading farming to Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Özdogan|2011|pp=S415–S430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===

Recent genetic evidence from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona favors Gimbutas’ Kurgan hypothesis over Renfrew’s Anatolian hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Science News.  2015.  “Genetic Study Revives Debate on Origin and Expansion of Indo-European Languages in Europe.”  March 4, 2015. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304075334.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazaridis et al. (2016) noted on the origins of Ancestral North Indians:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lazaridis|2016|loc=[http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2016/06/16/059311.DC1/059311-1.pdf Supplementary Information], p. 123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Nonetheless, the fact that we can reject West Eurasian population sources from Anatolia, mainland Europe, and the Levant diminishes the likelihood that these areas were sources of Indo-European (or other) languages in South Asia."}}

However, Lazaridis et al. previously admitted being unsure "if the steppe is the ultimate source" of the Indo-European languages and believing that more data is needed.&lt;ref name=Curry&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry|first=Andrew|title=Europe's Languages Were Carried From the East, DNA Shows|work=National Geographic|date=3 March 2015|publisher=National Geographic Society|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150303-human-dna-europe-language-archaeology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other geneticists, such as Carles Laluenza-Fox of the [[University of Barcelona]], are uncertain as to the location of the branches of Indo-European which split earliest from the rest.&lt;ref name=Curry/&gt;

The '''Costa Rican Civil War''' was the bloodiest event in 20th-century [[Costa Rica]]n history. It lasted for 44 days (from 12 March to 24 April 1948), during which approximately 2,000 people are believed to have died. The conflict was precipitated by the vote of the Costa Rican Legislature, dominated by pro-government representatives, to annul the results of the [[Costa Rican general election, 1948|presidential elections]] held in February, alleging that the triumph of opposition candidate [[Otilio Ulate Blanco|Otilio Ulate]] had been achieved by fraud.

This caused a rebel army under commander [[José Figueres Ferrer|José Figueres]] to rise up against the government of President [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Teodoro Picado]]; the government was quickly defeated. After the war, Figueres ruled for a year and a half as head of a provisional government [[Military dictatorship|junta]] which abolished the military and oversaw the [[Costa Rican Constitutional Assembly election, 1948|election of a Constitutional Assembly]] in December, which subsequently produced the new [[Constitution of Costa Rica|1949 constitution]]. The junta then stepped down and handed power to Ulate. Costa Rica has not experienced any significant political violence since.

==Background==
In the 1940s, the Costa Rican political scene came to be dominated by [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia|Rafael Ángel Calderón]], a medical doctor who served as [[President of Costa Rica]] from 1940 to 1944.&lt;ref name=ref10&gt;{{cite thesis | last=Holzhauer | first=Ian | title=The Presidency of Calderón Guardia || date=2004 | url=https://sites.google.com/site/reachian/seniorthesis2 | publisher=University of Florida | type=B.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution forbade consecutive reelection, so Calderón's National Republican Party had fielded as its candidate for the [[Costa Rican general election, 1944|1944 elections]] law professor [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Teodoro Picado]], who was perceived as a weak figure controlled by Calderón.

The [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Picado]] administration resorted several times to the use of military force in order to keep the peace, and pro-Calderón elements within the military institution would often become involved in street violence, which helped to sully the image of the military in the minds of the people.  The Costa Rican [[Communism|communist]] movement, organized in the [[People's Vanguard Party (Costa Rica)|Popular Vanguard Party]] led by congressman [[Manuel Mora]], was allied to Picado's government and contributed to the unrest by deploying its militia against the opposition.  As the violence grew, supporters of the opposition began to carry guns, and the police began to threaten the use of firearms rather than just beating demonstrators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Disgust with the government's violent reprisals against the opposition led to the ''Huelga de Brazos Caídos,'' a [[Strike action|strike]] that stalled commerce in Costa Rica for seven days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Pro-Calderón and communist demonstrators began to sack those businesses that participated in the strike, and [[Teodoro Picado Michalski|Picado]] was forced to respond to the strike with force by intimidating merchants and professionals and threatening workers with dismissal and military service.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} By the end of the strike, police and military forces patrolled the streets, and San José appeared as if under a state of siege.&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;[http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/45020.html "How Costa Rica Lost Its Military"] citing:
*{{harvnb | Bell | 1971 }}
*{{harvnb | Bird | 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calderón himself was the ruling party's candidate for the election of 1948 and there were widespread fears that the government would intervene to ensure his triumph against his main opponent, journalist [[Otilio Ulate Blanco|Otilio Ulate]].&lt;ref name=ref10 /&gt;  To assuage these fears, Picado's government for the first time in Costa Rican history placed the election under the control of an independent electoral tribunal.

==Figueres and the Caribbean Legion==
{{Further information|Caribbean Legion}}
[[José Figueres Ferrer|José Figueres]], a Costa Rican businessman, had been forced into exile in [[Mexico]] on April 12, 1942 as a consequence of a radio broadcast in which he strongly criticized the Calderón regime.  Figueres returned to Costa Rica after the election of Picado.  Before the elections of 1948, Figueres had already been planning for a war. Unlike Ulate, former president [[León Cortés Castro|León Cortés]], and the other members of the Costa Rican opposition, Figueres felt that Calderón would never allow a fair election to take place.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite news | title=Costa Rica's Fierce Pacifist | work=The New York Times | date=June 1990 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/opinion/costa-rica-s-fierce-pacifist.html | issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite news | last=Oliver | first=Myrna | title=Jose Figueres, 82; Former Costa Rican President | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 1990 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-09/news/mn-591_1_costa-rican-government | issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;[http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/45020.html "How Costa Rica Lost Its Military"] citing:

Figueres began training the [[Caribbean Legion]], an irregular force of 700.  Hoping to use Costa Rica as a base, the Legion planned to move against other authoritarian governments in [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]]. [[Washington, D.C.]] officials followed the Legion's activities with concern, especially after Figueres carried out a series of terrorist attacks inside Costa Rica during 1945 and 1946 that was supposed to climax in a general strike. The people did not respond.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

==1948 Elections and violent aftermath==
After a highly contentious electoral process plagued by violence and irregularities concluded on February 8, 1948, the independent electoral tribunal, by a split vote of 2 to 1, declared that opposition candidate Otilio Ulate of the National Union Party, had been elected president.  The National Republican Party candidate, former president Calderón, claimed that this result had been obtained by fraud and petitioned Congress, where the coalition of his own party and the Popular Vanguard Party held a majority, to void the results and call for a new election.  When Congress granted this request the country erupted in chaos, as both sides accused the other of vote tampering and [[electoral fraud]].&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{harvnb|La Feber|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

On the day that the government annulled the elections, police surrounded the home of Dr. Carlos Luis Valverde, where [[Otilio Ulate Blanco|Ulate]] was and Figueres had been only moments before. Shots rang out, and Valverde fell dead on his doorstep. Ulate escaped but was later captured and imprisoned, all of which helped to paint an especially distasteful image of the military.&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt;

==Beginning of Civil War==
The annulment of the election results in 1948 and the attack on Dr. Valverde's home on the same day appeared to provide Figueres the proof that he needed to show that the government had no intention of ceding to the will of the people. His hatred for Calderón, combined with his idealism, fueled his desire for war. On March 11, Figueres made the call that brought in the arms and military leaders Figueres needed for a successful campaign. On March 12, his National Liberation Army exchanged fire with government forces, and the war began.&lt;ref name=ref7&gt; [http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/45020.html "How Costa Rica Lost Its Military"] citing:
*{{harvnb|Bell|1971}}
*{{harvnb|Jiménez|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological context==
Costa Rican politics have traditionally been guided by personal allegiances far more than by ideological consistency, and the Civil War of 1948 provides a striking example of this.  Calderón had been elected president in 1940 as the candidate of the right, closely allied with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and with the business elite, but his enthusiastic support for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]] and especially his punitive measures against the rich and influential [[Germans|German]] community in Costa Rica, caused that elite to withdraw its support for him.

Calderón then created a different political base by allying himself with the Costa Rican communists (the Popular Vanguard Party), led by [[Manuel Mora]], and with the socially-progressive Catholic [[Archbishop]] of San José, Monsignor Víctor Manuel Sanabria, in order to pass legislation guaranteeing labor rights and creating a [[welfare state]].  Mora's communist militias provided important armed support for the government, both during the tense years of Picado's administration (1944–48) and during the Civil War itself.

The rebel forces led by Figueres were a disparate mix of anti-communist right-wingers, economically conservative elements weary of the welfare state (represented by the winner of the 1948 election himself, Otilio Ulate), and a [[social democracy|social democratic]] intelligentsia which sought to strengthen the welfare state while ensuring democratic transparency.  After their victory this alliance quickly fell apart.  The right-wing faction, led by the junta's Minister of Public Safety, Édgar Cardona, attempted to overthrow Figueres and was excluded from the government thereafter.  Figueres himself became closely identified with the social democratic faction, which later dominated his own [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] (PLN).  The economically conservative groups under Ulate ended up allying themselves in the 1950s with Calderón's supporters to form a broad anti-PLN coalition.

This lack of ideological consistency is further underscored by the fact that during the Civil War the government forces, despite being allied to the Costa Rican communists, enjoyed the support of right-wing [[Nicaragua]]n dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García|Anastasio Somoza]], while Figueres's rebels, who as anti-communists were tacitly supported by the [[United States]], received significant aid from leftist [[Guatemala]]n president [[Juan José Arévalo]].

==Fall of Cartago==
The National Liberation Army, as the rebel army called itself, slowly worked their way up the [[Pan American Highway]], capturing small but important cities and ports with relative ease.  The official army, which was then led by Picado's brother, was unable to organize an effective resistance to Figueres' National Liberation Army.  Figueres also contended against the communist militias commanded by congressman [[Carlos Luis Fallas]] and against Nicaraguan soldiers who had been sent by Somoza to help the government retain power.

In [[Cartago, Costa Rica]]'s second-largest city, located only twelve miles from the capital, Figueres' forces met considerable military opposition; however, the limited forces and supplies of the governmental forces quickly ran out, and Cartago fell into the hands of Figueres on April 12. Costa Rican President Picado, realizing that defeat was inevitable, sent notice to Figueres that he was willing to come to a compromise.

Picado's long-time political ally, Manuel Mora of the communist Popular Vanguard Party, had no intention of negotiating with Figueres. Mora's forces had sealed themselves up inside the capital of San José, and were determined not to capitulate as quickly as Picado. As the target of many of Figueres' criticisms about Costa Rica, Mora and his party were worried that a Figueres-led takeover might well lead to their expulsion from politics.

==Figueres and United States policy==
Arévalo's help proved to be indispensable. The determining force was United States policy. The creators of that policy held little love for Figueres, but they were determined to destroy the ‘’Vanguardia Popular’’. Perhaps the Communist party had only seven thousand members, Ambassador [[Nathaniel Penistone Davis|Davis]] reported home, but it should hold the balance of political power in Congress and also constituted "some 70 percent of the police and army." Writing within hours after the Communist overthrow of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government (an event that severely shook Washington and other Western capitals), Davis warned that Costa Rica's condition was "in many respects similar to that prevailing in [[Eastern Europe]]."&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

When the [[George Marshall|State Department]] learned on 17 April 1948 that small Communist groups threatened to take over the capital of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], US troops were placed on alert in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]]. Their mission was to move quickly into Costa Rica and stop the revolution before the Vanguardia Popular consolidated its power. It was a false alarm, but it indicated that regardless of any [[Good Neighbor policy]] sentiments, the possibility of unilateral U.S. intervention was no mere abstraction.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{harvnb|La Feber|1993}}, citing:
*{{harvnb|Bell|1971|p=25}}
*{{cite | title=Memorandum by Mr. William Tapley Bennett, Jr., of the Division of Central America and Panama Affairs | date=March 1948 | url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1948v09/d355 | pages=503–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the conflict, Figueres received a steady supply of arms from Arévalo, while Picado's forces were unable to exploit Somoza's desire to help. The United States had ensured Somoza's political impotence. Desperately wanting Nicaraguan help, Picado pleaded with Ambassador Davis to allow what was, after all, the recognized Costa Rican government to obtain help from Nicaragua so it could remain in power. Davis blandly "explained our well known policy of non-intervention" and then referred to the obligations of American nations [to] non-intervene."&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

Picado bitterly observed that non-intervention was a fiction, Figueres had received "tons" of supplies from Arévalo, and rumors circulated of aid even from the [[Panama]]nian government. Davis ignored the charges. Picado then threatened to take the matter to the [[United Nations]]. "The United Nations machinery was cumbersome," the State Department suavely but directly reminded the Costa Rican leader, and "immediate action on the part of the Council (where the United States had a [[veto]] and controlled the majority of the votes) could probably not be expected."&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Surrender of Picado==
The day after the fall of Cartago, Picado—low on supplies and without any other source of support—sent a letter to Mora and National Republican leader, and former President Calderón stating that "the attempt to hold San José would be futile and catastrophic." Mora, facing the reality that now the United States was ready to act against him as well, gave in to Picado's plea. On April 19, Picado and Father Benjamín Núñez, an eminent labor leader within Costa Rica, signed The Pact of the Mexican Embassy, ending the armed uprising. On 24 April, Figueres' forces entered San José, almost six weeks after beginning their revolt in southern Costa Rica.

By its mobilization in the Canal Zone, constant pressure on Picado, and cutting off Somoza's help, the United States determined the outcome of the revolution in April 1948.

With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day civil war resulting from this uprising was the bloodiest event in 20th-century Costa Rican history.

The term ‘'''critical spatial practice'''’ refers to forms of design practice between art and architecture. [[Jane Rendell]] introduced therm in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘A Place Between Art, Architecture and Critical Theory’, Proceedings to Place and Location (Tallinn, Estonia, 2003), pp. 221-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Rendell later consolidated and developed the term as one that defined practices located at a three-way intersection: between theory and practice, public and private, and art and architecture. For Rendell, critical spatial practice is informed by Michel de Certeau’s [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1980, translated into English in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;Certeau, Michel De, The Practice of Everyday Life (University of California Press, 2011) &lt;http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271456&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Lefebvre]]’s The Production of Space (1974, translated into English in 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri, The Production of Space (Wiley-Blackwell, 1991) &lt;http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0631181776.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the critical theory of the Frankfurt School,&lt;ref&gt;	Corradetti, Claudio, ‘Frankfurt School and Critical Theory | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy’, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Rome, Italy: Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy) &lt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; but her definition aims to transpose the key qualities of critical theory – self-reflection and social transformation – into practice. In Rendell’s work, critical spatial practices are those that question and transform the social conditions of the sites into which they intervene, as well as test the boundaries and procedures of their own disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, Art and Architecture (London: IB Tauris, 2006), pp. 1–2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 66 and 191. &lt;http://www.janerendell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Critical_Spatial_Practice.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘Critical Spatial Practice as Parrhesia’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.13&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Other theorists and practitioners have since worked with the term, evolving it in different directions. For example, there was the reading group and blog spot initiated by Nicholas Brown in the early 2000s, which came out of discussions around Brown’s own artistic walking practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://www.walkinginplace.org/iprh/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senn, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice: January 2006’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.blogspot.co.uk/2006_01_01_archive.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Nikolaus Hirsch and [[Markus Miessen]] started a book series with Sternberg Press called Critical Spatial Practice, which focused on architectural discourse and practice. In the first publication, they asked, "What is Critical Spatial Practice?"&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, and Nikolaus Hirsch, What Is Critical Spatial Practice?, Critical Spatial Practice 1 (Sternberg Press, 2012) &lt;http://www.sternberg-&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hirsch and Miessen set up a website site called criticalspatialpractice.org to archive their work in this area since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, ‘Architecture and Critical Spatial Practice (ACSP)’, Critical Spatial Practice &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.org/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The MaHKUscript, Journal of Fine Art Research published a special issue on critical spatial practice in 2016, where many of the contributors enact critical spatial practices concerned with political and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Slager, Henk, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.14&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν ''dokein'', "to appear", "to seem", "to think" and "to accept"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw δοκέω] in Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]]. Used by the Greek [[rhetorics|rhetoricians]] as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the ''doxa'' was often manipulated by [[sophist]]s to [[persuasion|persuade]] the [[people]], leading to [[Plato]]'s condemnation of [[Athenian democracy]].

The word ''doxa'' picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew word for "glory" (כבוד, ''kavod'') as ''doxa''. This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the [[early church]] and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of ''doxa'' as "glory" is made evident by the [[ubiquitous]] use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title="Orthodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title="Heterodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word слава (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like православие (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').

==Doxa, a philosopheme==
In Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the "multitude" to their advantage without shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253–272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]".) Thus, error is considered in [[Western world|Occident]] as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. As such, ''doxa'' may ironically be defined as the "philosopher's sin" {{citation needed|reason=interesting idea, but needs evidence|date=January 2016}}. In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with ''[[episteme]]''.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} &lt;/ref&gt; Endoxa is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been "tested" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The use of ''endoxa'' in the Stagirite's ''[[Organon]]'' can be found in Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.

==Use in sociology and anthropology&lt;!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'--&gt;==

[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which "the natural and social world appears as self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); p.164&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable ("the universe of possible discourse"), that which "goes without saying because it comes without saying".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the "sense of one's place", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that "this is not for us" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les éditions de minuit. Page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu explains the term "doxa" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.

It is a socially accepted misconception, that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. "Doxa and common life". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Phillip E. "Intelligence and Cultural Environment". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in democracy==

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': "The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing "truths".
 
To expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, "Use in sociology and anthropology", Bourdieu writes, "When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article "The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view": "Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.
 
Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.

'''Eduardo Lemaitre Román''' (17 September 1914 - 25 November 1994, [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Colombia]]) was a prominent historian, writer, journalist and politician who lived in [[Cartagena, Colombia]]. He held the positions of Representative (1943), Senator (1950) and Governor (1962) of Colombia's [[Bolívar Department|Bolivar department]]. He also served as Ambassador to UNESCO.&lt;ref name="lemaitre_memoriam"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-255834 |title=Murió el historiador Eduardo Lemaitre |trans-title=Historian Eduardo Lemaitre died |date=26 November 1994 |last= |accessdate=20 September 2010 |journal=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo Newspaper]] |publisher=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo Newspaper]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He graduated from [[Our Lady of the Rosary University|El Rosario University]] (''Colegio del Rosario'', [[Bogotá]]), acquired his doctorate degree in political law from [[National University of Colombia]] (''Universidad Nacional de Colombia'', [[Bogotá]]) and further pursued specialization in administrative law on [[Sorbonne]] (''La Sorbonne'', Paris) and in Hispanic studies on ''Universidad Central de Madrid'' (since 1970 called [[Complutense University of Madrid]]).&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/biografias/lemaedua.htm | title=Ficha bibliográfica - Eduardo Lemaitre |trans-title=|date=13 December 2004 |last=Lamús Obregón |first=Marina |accessdate=20 September 2010 |publisher=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was acting president of the History Academy of Cartagena and corresponding member of various Colombian and foreign academies, including the Colombian Academy of History. He had been rector of the [[University of Cartagena]] 1954-57 and professor of human studies at the [[University of the Andes, Colombia|University of the Andes]] in Bogotá. In administrative field, Lemaitre held important positions in private companies and his own family firm (Daniel Lemaitre &amp; asc.) or founded by him as ''Gráficas El Faro y otras''.&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;

During his political career he served several mandates as Cartagena councilor; he was elected to the Colombian House of Representatives in 1943, the Colombian Senate in 1950, and finally he served as governor of [[Bolivar department|Bolívar department]] in 1962. He was also Colombian ambassador to United Nations' [[UNESCO]]. In 1982, the government of President [[Julio César Turbay Ayala|Julio Cesar Turbay]] awarded him one of the highest honors in Colombia, the [[Colombian military decorations#Order of Boyaca .28Orden de Boyac.C3.A1.29|Orden de Boyacá (''Cruz de Boyacá'')]]&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;

As a journalist, Lemaitre was owner and editor of ''“El Fígaro de Cartagena”'' from 1941-1948 period, until it was burned down during rioting on April 9, 1948. In 1949 he worked as director of ''El Siglo'' (today ''El Nuevo Siglo'') (translated “The Century”), where his management was quite controversial, because in his first editorial he wrote that he was at disposition ''“to work for national understanding. It is impossible that politics will continue in this tone of stridency.”'' However, the liberal press felt that ''El Siglo'' editorial column was kept up under belligerent tone and didn't “soften” political issues. Also, for several years he wrote weekly column in ''“[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]”'', one of the largest [[List of newspapers in Colombia|newspapers in Colombia]].&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;

He also founded a ''[[programadora]]'', [[CPT (programadora)|Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre]], which he operated from 1979 until 1988.

==Works==

===Historical works===
Lemaitre said that "literary activity" with which he most closely identify himself was history. He didn't considered himself historian, since this was ''“so dignified, so serious, so graceful word. I am a publicist. I feel able to publicize history in a sociable form, pleasant, serious and funny at the same time.”'' (--''“[[El Espectador]]”'', 10 September 1978).&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The huge reception of his works should be precisely credited to readability of his novels and strong narrative force that grabs the reader from the first to the last page, not diminishing value of historical accuracy, especially in ''Historia general de Cartagena'' (1983)
which has been classified as a “classic” within summarized works on country's history.&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;

Eduardo Lemaitre remains a preeminent historian for Cartagena.

A list of history books he authored include:
* ''Cartagena en el siglo XVII'' (1949)
* ''Rafael Reyes'' (1952)
* ''Antecedentes y consecuencias del once de noviembre de 1811: testimonios relacionados con la gloriosa gesta de la independencia absoluta de Cartagena de Indias'' (1961)
* ''Panamá y su separación de Colombia'' (1971)&lt;ref name="lemaitre_panama"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.temascolombianos.com/panama/Lemaitre.pdf | title=Panamá y su separación de Colombia | year=1971 | last=Eduardo Lemaitre Roman | publisher=Editorial Pluma, Bogotá 1980, Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cartagena colonial'' (1973)
* ''La bolsa o la vida, cuatro agresiones imperialistas contra Colombia'' (1974)
* ''Cartagena de Indias'' (1976)
* ''Epistolario de Rafael Núnez con Miguel Antonio Caro'' (1977)
* ''Núnez y su leyenda negra'' (1977)
* ''Breve historia de Cartagena 1501-1901'' (1979)
* ''Bolívar, de Cartagena a Santa Marta'' (1980)
* ''Historia del Canal del Dique: sus peripecias y vicisitudes'' (1982)
* ''Autógrafos de varias personas de gran distinción y elevado carácter oficial'' (1983)
* ''El general Juan José Nieto y su época'' (1983)
* ''Historia general de Cartagena'' (1983)
* ''Contra viento y marea. La lucha de Rafael Núnez por el poder'' (1990)
*

===Plays===
Eduardo Lemaitre's writing also extended beyond histories. He wrote theatrical plays, which include:

* ''La aventura de don Melón y dona Endrina'' (1961), inspired by texts from the ''“[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro del Buen Amor]]”'' (~1330) (transl.“Book about pleasant passions”) from [[Juan Ruiz]], [[Archpriest]] of [[Hita, Guadalajara|Hita]], and its imitation and one of the greatest works of [[Spanish literature#Renaissance|Spanish literature]], [[tragicomedy]] ''“[[La Celestina]]”'' (1499) from [[Fernando de Rojas]] which has premiered at theater ''Colón por la Cooperativa de Artistas La Carreta'' (aka.''Teatro Colon'') directed by Bernardo Romero Lozano, during the theatrical festival same year.
* ''Iphigenia'' (1966), based on novel from Venezuelan writer [[Teresa de la Parra]] of the same name (''[[Iphigenia (novel)|Iphigenia: Diary of a young lady who wrote because she was bored]]'' (1924)), and performed by group of artists from National Television, first in Cartagena and then at the ''Teatro Colon''.&lt;ref name="lemaitre_bioblaa"/&gt;

His plays were written and performed during the 1960s, which was period of experimental theater, avant garde student movement at all levels, and especially inside theater. Lemaitre therefore considered that country has entered stage for theatrical closure, as the modern avantgarde theater is “very complicated” and only a small minority could understand “its psychological and literary subtlety”.&lt;br&gt;
After its release ''Iphigenia'' was referred as one “elementary” piece, written by a “bourgeois for bourgeois”, which doesn't “raises pathological concerns”.&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, Lemaitre wrote for television ten scripts about Colombian historical topics, produced under the name ''“[http://www.museovintage.com/imagenes/1980_revivamos.htm Revivamos nuestra historia]”'' (transl. “Relive our history”). This program was aired by his ''programadora'' Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre with the production assistance of [[Promec Televisión]].

'''Ernst Christian Andreas Martin Fabricius''' ([[Darmstadt]], 6 September 1857 – [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], 22 March 1942) was a German historian, archaeologist and classical scholar. Between 1882 and 1888 he participated in excavations in Greece and Asia Minor and also pioneered German research on the Roman Empire border defenses known as the [[Limes Germanicus]].

==Biography==
Ernst Fabricius began his university studies in [[Strasbourg]]. In 1881 he received a doctorate in 'Comprehensive Greek Architecture' from the [[University of Bonn]]. His teachers included [[Adolf Michaelis]], [[Rudolf Schöll]], [[Heinrich Nissen]] and [[Hermann Usener]]. As a fellow of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], along with geographer [[Heinrich Kiepert]], he visited [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Asia Minor]]. In 1886, he was appointed professor of classical philology, archeology and ancient history at the [[University of Berlin]]. Subsequently, he participated in excavations in Greece and Asia Minor, specifically at [[Pergamon]], [[Lesbos]], [[Samos]] and [[Crete]].

From 1888 until his retirement (1926) he was professor of ancient history at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität]] in [[Freiburg]], and the [[University of Freiburg]] in [[Breisgau]].

At the University of Freiburg, Fabricius was the dean of the college, [[Rector (academia)|rector]] (1910–11), and Chairman of the Committee for the construction of the new universities. In 1902 he was appointed President of the [[German Limes Commission]] for the Committee on the [[Limes Germanicus|Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]].

During his career, Fabricius was extensively involved in politics. He served in the [[parliament]] of [[Baden]] (Badische Ständeversammlung) from 1913 to 1918.

He was a supporter of both German colonialism and [[Pangermanism]]. For many years he was a member of the People's League for Germans Abroad (Volksbund für das Deutschtum im Ausland) becoming president of the association in 1920.

Fabricius worked with [[Federico Halbherr]] on the Italian archaeological mission to Crete, and was a major contributor in the excavation and study of the [[Gortyn Code]] ("Leggi di Gortina") on civil rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2259">'''Euphantus''' ({{lang-el|Εὔφαντος}}; [[floruit|fl.]] c. 320 BCE{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=52}}) of [[Olynthus]] was a philosopher of the [[Megarian school]] as well as an historian and tragic poet. He was the disciple of [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Miletus]], and the instructor of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] king of [[Macedon]]ia. He wrote many tragedies, which were well received at the games. He also wrote a very highly esteemed work, ''On Kingship'' ({{lang-el|Περὶ Βασιλείας}}), addressed to Antigonus, and a history of his own times. He lived to a great age.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 110}}{{sfn|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 141}}

[[Athenaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, vi. 59, 251d&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Euphantus relating a detail about [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] of [[Egypt]] who reigned much later. The discrepancy has been explained variously, by supposing the existence of an Egyptian Euphantus,&lt;ref&gt;whose translation of an Egyptian prayer is quoted by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''Abst.'' iv. 10&lt;/ref&gt; or by amending "III" to "I".&lt;ref&gt;Reading "proton" instead of "triton" i.e. first instead of third, see Tarn, W.

The [[Shroud of Turin]] is a length of linen cloth bearing the imprint of the image of a man, and is believed by some to be the [[burial shroud]] of [[Jesus]]. Despite conclusive [[scientific evidence]] that it is of medieval origin, multiple alternative theories about the origin of the shroud dating it to the time of Christ have been proposed. 

Although [[Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|three radiocarbon dating tests]] performed in 1988 provided conclusive evidence of a date of 1260 to 1390 for the shroud, some researchers have challenged the dating based on various theories, including the [[provenance]] of the [[Sample (material)|samples]] used for testing, biological or chemical [[contamination]], incorrect assessment of carbon dating data, as well as other theories.  However, the alternative theories challenging the [[radiocarbon dating]] are not accepted by scientists, and are thus considered to be [[fringe theories]].

The [[Holy See]] received custody of the shroud in 1983, and as with other [[relic]]s, makes no claims about its authenticity. After the 1988 round of tests, no further dating tests have been allowed.

== Overview ==

The [[Shroud of Turin]] is a length of [[linen]] cloth bearing the [[Negative (photography)|negative]] image of a man who is alleged to be [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. The cloth itself is believed by some to be the burial shroud he was wrapped in when he was buried after [[crucifixion]]. The origins of the shroud and its images are the subject of multiple [[fringe theory|fringe theories]]. Diverse arguments have been made in various publications claiming to prove that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. 

In 1988, [[Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|three radiocarbon dating]] tests dated a sample of the shroud as being from the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.E. and Bar-Yosef, Ofer. ''Radiocarbon Dating, Second Edition: An Archaeological Perspective''. Left Coast Press, 2014, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; between the years 1260 and 1390. Some shroud researchers have challenged this dating, arguing in favor of fringe theories.&lt;ref name="Barcaccia-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riani-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riani |first1=M. | display-authors = 1 |last2=et al |year=2013 |title=Regression analysis with partially labelled regressors: carbon dating of the shroud of Turin |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11222-012-9329-5 |journal=Statistics and Computing |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=551–561 |doi=10.1007/s11222-012-9329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poulle-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rogers-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf |title=Evidence for the Skewing of the C-14 Dating of the Shroud of Turin Due to Repairs |last=Marino |first=Joe |date=2000 |website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shroud.com/pdfs/textevid.pdf |title=Textile Evidence Supports Skewed Radiocarbon Date of Shroud of Turin |last=Benford |first=Sue |date=2002 |website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all of the scientific hypotheses used to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted,&lt;ref name="blogs.telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chivers |first1=Tom |title=The Turin Shroud is fake.

== Defective sample theories ==

Allegations have been made that the sample of the shroud chosen for testing was defective in some way, usually involving questions about the provenance of the threads: for example that the sample chosen was not from the original shroud but from a repair or restoration carried out in the [[Middle Ages]]. 

===Medieval repair argument===

Although the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/352187d0 |title=Sampling error? |journal=Nature |volume=352 |issue=6332 |pages=187 |year=1991 |last1=Busson |first1=Pierre |bibcode=1991Natur.352..187B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L.

Since the C14 dating at least four articles have been published in scholarly sources contending that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole shroud.&lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tca.2004.09.029 |title=Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin |journal=Thermochimica Acta |volume=425 |pages=189 |year=2005 |last1=Rogers |first1=Raymond N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Benford-2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmanuel Poulle]], ″Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

===Questionable provenance of samples===

The medieval repair argument was included an article by American chemist [[Raymond Rogers]], who conducted [[chemical analysis]] for the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]] (STURP) and who was involved in work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Rogers took 32 documented adhesive-tape [[Sample (material)|samples]] from all areas of the shroud and associated textiles during the STURP process in 1978.&lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"/&gt; He received 14 yarn segments from Prof. Luigi Gonella (Department of Physics, [[Polytechnic University of Turin]]) on 14 October 1979, which Gonella told him were from the Raes sample. On 12 December 2003, Rogers received a tiny fragment of what he was told was a shroud [[Warp and weft|warp]] thread, and a tiny fragment of what he was told was a shroud [[Warp and weft|weft]] thread, which Prof. Luigi Gonella told him had been taken from {{clarify span|text=the radiocarbon sample|explain=What sample is this? The Raes sample?  |date=May 2018}} before it was distributed for dating. The actual [[provenance]] of these threads is uncertain, as Gonella was not authorized to take or retain genuine shroud material,&lt;ref name="Schafersman-2005" /&gt; but Gonella told Rogers that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.&lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"/&gt;

Raymond Rogers stated in a 2005 article that he performed chemical analyses on these undocumented threads, and compared them to the undocumented Raes threads as well as the samples he had kept from his STURP work. He stated that his analysis showed: "The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/[[mordant]] coating and cotton fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials."&lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"/&gt; He speculated that these products may have been used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection. Based on this comparison Rogers concluded that the undocumented threads received from Gonella did not match the main body of the shroud, and that in his opinion: "The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5137163/Turin-Shroud-could-be-genuine-as-carbon-dating-was-flawed.html ''Turin Shroud 'could be genuine as carbon-dating was flawed''] Stephen Adams in the [[Daily Telegraph]] 10 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from {{date|300 BC}} to {{date|400 AD}}, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name="Fanti-news-2013" /&gt; Because of the manner in which Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s official custodian, Archbishop [[Cesare Nosiglia]] of Turin, told [[Vatican Insider]]: "As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [on] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments."&lt;ref name="Parker-2013"&gt;Science Shines New Light on Shroud of Turin’s Age ; BY SHAFER PARKER JR. [[National Catholic Register]]; 05/06/2013 at http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/science-shines-new-light-on-shroud-of-turins-age/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc-2013"&gt;Shroud of Turin returns to spotlight with new pope, new app, new debate ; NBC News, Friday Mar 29, 2013, at http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/29/17517272-shroud-of-turin-returns-to-spotlight-with-new-pope-new-app-new-debate&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: "But it would be more convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit your approach to other scientists."&lt;ref name="Parker-2013"/&gt;

=== Response to restoration claims ===

The official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample "came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas."&lt;ref name="Nature-1989"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/337611a0 |title=Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin |journal=Nature |volume=337 |issue=6208 |pages=611–5 |year=1989 |last1=Damon |first1=P.

E. |last20=Leese |first20=M. N. |last21=Tite |first21=M. S. |bibcode=1989Natur.337..611D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the testing process in 1988, Derbyshire laboratory in the UK assisted the Oxford University radiocarbon acceleration unit by identifying foreign material removed from the samples before they were processed.&lt;ref name='Textile Horizons'&gt;[http://www.sindone.info/TEXTILE.PDF Rogue fibers found in the Shroud] Textile Horizons, December 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edward Hall of the Oxford team noticed two or three "minute" fibers which looked "out of place",&lt;ref name="Textile Horizons" /&gt; and those "minute" fibers were identified as cotton by Peter South (textile expert of the Derbyshire laboratory) who said: "It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven. It may not have taken us long to identify the strange material, but it was unique amongst the many and varied jobs we undertake." &lt;ref name="Textile Horizons" /&gt;

Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is an expert in the restoration of textiles, who headed the restoration and conservation of the Turin Shroud in 2002. She has rejected the theory of the "invisible reweaving", pointing out that it would be technically impossible to perform such a repair without leaving traces, and that she found no such traces in her study of the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;The Shroud, by Ian Wilson; Random House, 2010, pgs 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality; by Mechthild Flury-Lemberg, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Prof H E Gove, former professor emeritus of physics at the University of Rochester and former director of the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester, helped to invent radiocarbon dating and was closely involved in setting up the shroud dating project. He also attended the actual dating process at the University of Arizona. Gove has written (in the respected scientific journal Radiocarbon) that: "Another argument has been made that the part of the shroud from which the sample was cut had possibly become worn and threadbare from countless handlings and had been subjected to medieval textile restoration. If so, the restoration would have had to be done with such incredible virtuosity as to render it microscopically indistinguishable from the real thing. Even modern so-called invisible weaving can readily be detected under a microscope, so this possibility seems unlikely. It seems very convincing that what was measured in the laboratories was genuine cloth from the shroud after it had been subjected to rigorous cleaning procedures. Probably no sample for carbon dating has ever been subjected to such scrupulously careful examination and treatment, nor perhaps ever will again."&lt;ref name=Gove-1990 /&gt;

In 2010, professors of statistics Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: "The effect is not large over the sampled region; … our estimate of the change is about two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Riani M., Atkinson A.C., Fanti G., Crosilla F., (4 May 2010). [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/statistics/research/RAFC04May2010.pdf "Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin: Partially Labelled Regressor and the Design of Experiments"]. [[The London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Retrieved 2010-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 Professor [[A.J. Timothy Jull|Timothy Jull]], a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal ''Radiocarbon'', coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample that was left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and were assisted by the director of the Gloria F Ross Center for Tapestry Studies. They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30×) stereomicroscope, as well as under high magnification (320×) viewed through both transmitted light and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found "only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers" and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033822200056277 |title=Investigating a Dated Piece of the Shroud of Turin |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=1521 |year=2016 |last1=Freer-Waters |first1=Rachel A |last2=Timothy Jull |first2=A J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vanillin loss theory ==

Raymond Rogers &lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"/&gt; argued in the scientific journal ''Thermochimica Acta'' that the presence of [[vanillin]] differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: "The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years".&lt;ref name="Rogers-2004"/&gt;

It has been stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment – heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth.&lt;ref name="Schafersman-2005" /&gt; Rogers' analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as [[Joe Nickell]], who reasons that the conclusions of the author, [[Raymond Rogers]], result from "starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence".&lt;ref name="Nickell-2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/claims_of_invalid_ldquoshroudrdquo_radiocarbon_date_cut_from_whole_cloth/ |title=Claims of Invalid "Shroud" Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth |accessdate=2009-10-06 |author=[[Joe Nickell]] |work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contamination theories ==

Various theories call into question results of carbon-14 dating, based on contamination by bacteria, reactive carbon, or carbon monoxide.

=== By bacteria ===
Pictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842 indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.

Rodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/c14debat.htm |title=Debate of Roger Sparks and William Meacham on alt.turin-shroud |publisher=Shroud.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers.

Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), once hypothesised that a "bioplastic" bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, could have rendered the tests inaccurate. He has however also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Meacham| first = William |  title = From the Proceedings of the Symposium "Turin Shroud - Image of Christ?"| date = 1 March 1986| url = http://www.shroud.com/meacham.htm|accessdate =14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, and that even if some slight contamination remained, about two thirds of the sample would need to consist of modern material to swing the result away from a 1st Century date to a Medieval date. He inspected the Arizona sample material before it was cleaned, and determined that no such gross amount of contamination was present even before the cleaning commenced.&lt;ref name=Gove-1990 /&gt;

=== By reactive carbon ===
Others have suggested that  the silver of the molten reliquary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Moroni, M. &amp; van Haelst, R. – ‘'Natural Factors Affecting the Apparent Radiocarbon Age of Textiles’’. Shroud News, Issue No. 100, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Kouznetsov claims ====

The Russian {{ill|Dmitri Kouznetsov|de|Dmitri Anatoljewitsch Kusnezow}} , an archaeological biologist and chemist, claimed in 1994 to have managed to experimentally reproduce this purported enrichment of the cloth in ancient weaves, and published numerous articles on the subject between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref name=Kouznetsov /&gt; 

Kouznetsov's results could not be replicated, and no actual experiments have been able to validate this theory, so far.&lt;ref&gt;Fesenko, A. V. – Belyakov, A. V. – Til’kunov, Y. N. – Moskvina, T. P. – On the dating of the Shroud of Turin – Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vol. 71, No. 5, 2001, pp. 528-531&lt;/ref&gt;

Jull, Donahue and Damon of the NSF Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer Facility at the University of Arizona attempted to replicate the Kouznetsov experiment, and could find no evidence for the gross changes in age proposed by Kouznetsov et al. They concluded that the proposed carbon-enriching heat treatments were not capable of producing the claimed changes in the measured radiocarbon age of the linen, that the attacks by Kouznetsov et al. on the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the shroud "in general are unsubstantiated and incorrect," and that the "other aspects of the experiment are unverifiable and irreproducible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0013 |title=Factors Affecting the Apparent Radiocarbon Age of Textiles: A Comment on "Effects of Fires and Biofractionation of Carbon Isotopes on Results of Radiocarbon Dating of Old Textiles: The Shroud of Turin", by D.

Professor Gian Marco Rinaldi and others proved that Kouznetsov never performed the experiments described in his papers, citing non-existent fonts and sources, including the museums from which he claimed to have obtained the samples of ancient weaves on which he performed the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==== Fraud and arrest ====

Kouznetsov was arrested in 1997 on American soil under allegations of accepting bribes by magazine editors to produce manufactured evidence and false reports.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, W. (2007). The amazing Dr Kouznetsov. ANTIQUITY-OXFORD- 81, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By carbon monoxide in smoke ===

In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado proposed a new hypothesis – namely the possibility of more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils that make up the cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible.&lt;ref name="Ramsey-2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ramsey |first=Christopher |url=http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html |title=ORAU - Shroud of Turin |publisher=C14.arch.ox.ac.uk |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Christopher Ramsey]], the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. Before conducting the tests, he told the BBC that "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Omaar |first=Rageh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7307646.stm |title=Science/Nature &amp;#124; Shroud mystery 'refuses to go away' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ramsey stressed that he would be surprised if the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially "a thousand years wrong" – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.&lt;ref&gt;Fresh tests on Shroud of Turin; By Jonathan Petre; Religion Correspondent; The Telegraph; 25 Feb 2008 at - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579810/Fresh-tests-on-Shroud-of-Turin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the tests were to form part of a documentary on the Turin Shroud which was to be broadcast on BBC2. The producer of the 2008 documentary, David Rolfe, suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Chickos, J.S., and Uang, J. (2001). Chemical Modification of Cellulose.  The Possible Effects of Chemical Cleaning on Fatty Acids Incorporated in Old Textiles  (St. Louis MO, Department of Chemistry - University of Missouri-St. Louis).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at [[Chambéry]]. Other similar theories include that  candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon-dating unreliable as a dating tool.&lt;ref&gt;Brunati, E. - Note critiche sulla datazione della S.Sindone con il radiocarbonio - Typescript, Gennaio 1994, pp. 1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardamone-Blacksburg, J. - La cellulosa dal lino; caratterizzazione e datazione - Typescript, Symposium Scientifique International de Paris sur le Linceul de Turin, 7-8 Septembre 1989, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 Professor Ramsey reported back on the testing that: "So far the linen samples have been subjected to normal conditions (but with very high concentrations of carbon monoxide). These initial tests show no significant reaction – even though the sensitivity of the measurements is sufficient to detect contamination that would offset the age by less than a single year. This is to be expected and essentially confirms why this sort of contamination has not been considered a serious issue before." He noted that carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure. He also added that there is as yet no direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate.&lt;ref name="Ramsey-2008"/&gt;

In 2011, Ramsey commented that in general "there are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100125247/the-turin-shroud-is-fake-get-over-it/ ''The Turin Shroud is fake. Get over it''] Tom Chivers in the [[Daily Telegraph]] 20 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incorrect dating calculation theory ==

In 1994, J. A. Christen applied a strong statistical test to the radiocarbon data and concluded that the given age for the shroud is, from a statistical point of view, correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2986273 |jstor=2986273 |title=Summarizing a Set of Radiocarbon Determinations: A Robust Approach |journal=Applied Statistics |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=489 |year=1994 |last1=Christen |first1=J. Andres }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in ''Nature'':&lt;ref name="Nature-1989"/&gt; including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% – rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Fanti, G., and Marinelli, E.

== Other theories ==

Other theories have been proposed as well, such as the nuclear emissions theory which claims that the image was formed from nuclear emissions from an earthquake that struck Jerusalem in 33 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilensky-Lanford |first=Brook |title=Latest Shroud of Turin Theory: Nuclear Emissions |date=February 26, 2014 |url=http://religiondispatches.org/latest-shroud-of-turin-theory-nuclear-emissions/ |website=Religion Dispatches |archive-url= |archive-date= |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gasparo Angiolini''' (7 February 1731 – 6 February 1803), real name '''Domenico Maria Gasparo''', son of Francesco Angiolini and Maria Maddalena Torzi, was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[dancer]] and [[choreographer]], and [[composer]]. He was born in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] and died in [[Milan]].

Gasparo Angiolini directed the ballet at the Imperial Theatre in Vienna, taking over the post in 1758, working closely with [[Christoph Willibald von Gluck]] on such works as ''Don Juan ou le Festin de Pierre'' (1761), and the opera ''Orpheus and Eurydice.''  The dancing in both Don Juan and Orpheus were said to have insisted on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706033734/http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/woa/520352.htm "primacy of drama".] In addition to collaborating with Gluck, he also composed music for many of his ballets.

He later succeeded [[Franz Hilverding]] as director of the Imperial Theatre in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]] in 1766.  Both Hilverding and Angiolini are credited with bringing the European [[ballet d'action]] to Russia. Likewise, Angiolini also attempted to introduce elements of Russian culture into his own work through use of songs, folk dances, and Russian themes. 

In 1772—1773 Angiolini worked in [[Teatro San Benedetto]] in Venice. In 1778 he came to Milan to direct the theatre of [[La Scala]].

Angiolini was a choreographer interested in the dramatic possibilities of dance. He was also an early spokesman for a sense of [[Italian nationalism]] and spoke of the sad state where Germany and Russia were supporting better cultural institutions than was Italy.

His wife was a ballerina {{Interlanguage link multi|Marie Thérèse Foliazzi|ru|3=Фольяцци, Тереза|vertical-align=sup}} (1733—1792). [[Giacomo Casanova]] was in love with her and admits in his memoirs that he stole her portrait. 
  
His son (or nephew) Pietro Angiolini was also a dancer and choreographer, his daughter {{Interlanguage link multi|Fortunata Angiolini|ru|3=Анджолини, Фортуната|vertical-align=sup}} (1776—1817) and her partner [[Armand Vestris]] have danced in Lisbon and London with great success. 

And  Gasparo Angiolini was a ballet teacher of [[Vincenzo Galeotti]].

'''Greater Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|ארץ ישראל השלמה}}; ''Eretz Yisrael Hashlema'') is an [[expression (language)|expression]], with several different [[Biblical]] and political meanings over time. It is often used, in an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] fashion, to refer to the historic or desired borders of Israel.

Currently, the most common definition of the land encompassed by the term is the territory of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] together with the [[Palestinian territories]]. An earlier definition, favored by [[Revisionist Zionism]], included the territory of the former [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. Religious uses of "Greater Israel" refer to one of the Biblical definitions of the [[Land of Israel]] found in {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:24|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:7|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–15|HE}} or {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13–20|HE}}.

== History ==
=== Promised Land ===
Greater Israel occasionally refers to the [[Promised Land]] (defined in {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18-21|NIV}}) or to the [[Land of Israel]], also called Complete Land of Israel or Entire Land of Israel ({{lang-he|ארץ ישראל השלמה}}, ''Eretz Yisrael Hashlemah''). This is a more accurate translation than "Greater Israel", which is used in English but has no real counterpart in [[Hebrew]].

The Bible contains three geographical definitions of the [[Land of Israel]]. The first, found in {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|NIV}}, seems to define the land that was given to all of the children of Abraham, including Ishmael, Zimran, Jokshan, Midian, etc. It describes a large territory, "from the brook of Egypt to the [[Euphrates]]", comprising all of modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Territories]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]], as well as [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[U.A.E]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], most of [[Turkey]], and all the land east of the [[Nile]] river.

The other definitions are found in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:24|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|1:7|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|34:1–15|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13–20|NIV}}. They describe smaller territories (see the map included in this article). The definition in Numbers and Ezekiel refers to the land that was divided between the original twelve tribes of Israel after they were delivered from Egypt, and finally, the borders defined in the book of Deuteronomy are those that will be given to the children of Israel slowly throughout the years (see {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:29|NIV}} &amp; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:22|NIV}}).

=== During British Mandate of Palestine ===

In 1937, the [[Peel Commission]] recommended partition of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. In [[1937 Ben-Gurion letter|a letter to his son later that year]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] stated that partition would be acceptable but as a first step. Ben-Gurion wrote that "This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.

=== During early period of the State of Israel ===
Joel Greenberg writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes: "At Israel's founding in 1948, the [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] leadership, which went on to govern Israel in its first three decades of independence, accepted a pragmatic partition of what had been British Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states. The opposition Revisionist Zionists, who evolved into today's [[Likud]] party, sought ''Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema''—Greater Israel, or literally, the Whole Land of Israel (shalem, meaning complete)."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/weekinreview/the-world-pursuing-peace-netanyahu-and-his-party-turn-away-from-greater-israel.html?scp=4&amp;sq=ariel%20sharon&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1 The World: Pursuing Peace; Netanyahu and His Party Turn Away from 'Greater Israel']&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt during the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, led to the growth of the non-parliamentary [[Movement for Greater Israel]] and the construction of [[Israeli settlements]]. The [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], which brought [[Likud]] to power also had considerable impact on acceptance and rejection of the term. Greenberg notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;THE seed was sown in 1977, when [[Menachem Begin]] of Likud brought his party to power for the first time in a stunning election victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. Ever since, Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the [[West Bank]]) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel into a bi-national state instead of a Jewish one.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Yitzhak Shamir]] was a dedicated proponent of Greater Israel and as Israeli Prime Minister gave the [[Israeli settlement|settler movement]] funding and Israeli governmental legitimisation.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Bar-On (2004) ''A Never-Ending Conflict: A Guide to Israeli Military History'' Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-98158-4}} p 219&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
In a May 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, [[Osama bin Laden]] noted what he saw as "Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel ... to achieve full control over the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arab Peninsula]] which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel." While not his main reason, Bin Laden included what he saw as American and Western support for such a scheme as an additional motivation for his call to wage war against America and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508145341/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/interview.html Interview: Osama bin Laden], ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Annexation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] was part of the platform of the Israeli [[Likud]] party, and of some other Israeli political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Likud - Platform| publisher=www.knesset.gov.il| url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm| accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2008 Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] remarked that "Greater Israel is over. There is no such thing. Anyone who talks that way is deluding themselves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020929.html Ha'aretz 14 September 2008] ''Olmert: There's no such thing as 'Greater Israel' any more'' By Barak Ravid "Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday reiterated his position that the vision of Israel holding onto the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of its sovereign territory was finished."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meir Kahane]], an [[ultra-nationalist]] [[Knesset]] member, who founded the American [[Jewish Defense League]] and the banned Israeli [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party, worked towards Greater Israel and other [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] goals.

Currently in Israel, in the debate relating to the borders of Israel, "Greater Israel" is generally used to refer to the territory of the [[State of Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]], the combined territory of the former [[Mandatory Palestine]]. However, because of the controversial nature of the term, the term [[Land of Israel]] is often used instead.

=== 10 Agorot coin controversy ===
{{main|10 agorot controversy}}
[[Zionism|Zionists]], and the [[Israel|State of Israel]], have been accused of plotting to expand Israel from the [[Nile]] to the [[Euphrates]]. This so-called [[10 agorot controversy]] is named after the Israeli coin&lt;ref name="coin"&gt;[http://www.boi.org.il/en/Currency/CurrentCurrencySeries/Pages/Default.aspx#Top]&lt;/ref&gt; brandished by PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] in 1988 as evidence for this accusation. The [[Bank of Israel]] denies this [[conspiracy theory]] since the coin is a replica of a historical coin dating from 37-40 BCE and the alleged "map" is actually the irregular shape of the ancient coin.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hidden Hand: Middle East Fears of Conspiracy |series= |author=Daniel Pipes |year=1998 |location= |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=51 |isbn=9780312176884 |quote=In fact, the coin contains no map; the outline behind the menorah traces the shape of the surviving Hasmonean coin. |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=9Y3vCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=10+Agorot+coin+arafat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j454QCElEE&amp;sig=_xThngqIU4RUcgadorDOH2-BYm0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd4s2BtqHMAhUsIMAKHT9SBl4Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=10%20Agorot%20coin%20arafat&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli flag controversy ===
Critics of Israel have stated the blue strips of the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] represent the [[Nile]] and [[Euphrates]] as the boundaries of [[land of Israel|Eretz Isra'el]] as [[Promised land|promised]] to the [[Jew]]s by [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 15.18: "The Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt [the Nile] unto the great river, the River Euphrates."&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was at a time made by [[Yasser Arafat]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/9766/arafat.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:30:29 Playboy Interview: Yasir Arafat], ''[[Playboy]]'', September 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.coM/books?id=RmnmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240|title=Unholy Land: In Search of Hope in Israel/Palestine|last=Raczka|first=Witt|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780761866732|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both [[Zionism|Zionists]] and [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionists]] have debunked this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Pipes|Pipes, Daniel]].[http://www.meforum.org/article/215 Imperial Israel: The Nile-to-Euphrates Calumny], ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', March, 1994.

'''Frederic Hardwicke Knight, QSO'''  (12 July 1911 –  25 August 2008) was a London-born photographer, historian and collector who emigrated to [[New Zealand]] in 1957 to take up a medical photography position in [[Dunedin]]. He lived at [[Broad Bay, New Zealand|Broad Bay]] until ten months before his death at a Dunedin nursing home. His publications include New Zealand's first comprehensive photographic history, many compilations of early Dunedin and [[Otago]] photographs, biographies of several early New Zealand photographers and of British photographer [[William Russell Sedgfield]], three books of architectural history and a seminal history of the [[Otago Peninsula]]. He was awarded a [[Queen's Service Order|QSO]] in 1991.  An eccentric [[polymath]], Knight was well known for his striking appearance, his ramshackle Broad Bay cottage crammed with his collections and his self-proclaimed exploits, most notably his claim to have found timbers on [[Mount Ararat]] that might have been [[Noah's Ark]].

== Life in England ==

Knight was born in the North London suburb of [[Stoke Newington]], the youngest of seven surviving children of Annie Sophia Hoskins and Charles Frederick Knight, a fancy goods salesman.&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Who's Who in New Zealand |edition=12th |editor-first=Max |editor-last=Lambert |date=1981 |publisher=Reed |location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Information supplied to ''Who's Who'' is not unfailingly reliable. The spelling of names given here is taken from the marriage certificate of Annie Sophia Hoskins and Charles Frederick Knight.}} Annie was an accomplished artist whose father was a print dealer. Charles's parents were enterprising shop-keepers originally from the [[Northamptonshire]] town of [[Wellingborough]], who claimed among their forebears the 16th-century printer of Bibles [[Christopher Barker (printer)|Christopher Barker]] and the botanist [[Joseph Banks]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The Knight family were staunch evangelical Christians. Despite periods of atheism, Knight continued to find inspiration in the Bible's teachings and stories throughout his life.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Knight's attended St John's College in Stoke Newington from the age of six. Suffering from a nervous complaint he was withdrawn and tutored at home before being enrolled in Paradise House School in Stoke Newington, also known as the Modern School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapterurl=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=1217 |chapter=Stoke Newington: Education |title=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes |date=1985 |pages=217–223 |via=[[British History Online]] |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended a London commercial college.

On graduating at the age of 16 he was employed by the [[National Union of Teachers]] as an advertising clerk, among other duties organising tours for holidaying teachers and accompanying tours of French battlefields. He later worked on the NUT's magazine ''[[The Schoolmaster]]''.  During the [[Great Depression]] he was made redundant more than once; other jobs included compiling ships' equipment inventories for Tankers Ltd and being a travelling salesman of silks and satins.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Never very dedicated to his paid employment, Knight spent long lunch hours exploring London and its second hand bookstalls and antique shops and taking photographs (a passion encouraged by his brother-in-law).Summer holidays and periods of unemployment were spent working in the [[Chilterns]] with his Bohemian brother Eric, a self-taught builder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Meet the Flintstones |magazine=Hertfordshire Lifestyle |date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelling in the [[West Country]] and Ireland with possible short forays into Europe.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

From February 1930 to September 1931 he was an Aircraftman Second Class (AC2) in the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|No. 600 (City of London) Squadron]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In 1935 and 1936 Hardwicke went to Russia and subsequently wrote admiringly of the [[Stalinist]] regime. He claimed to have worked as a photographer on an Armenian archaeological excavation and as a photo-journalist while travelling through Russia, the Caucasus, Armenia and the Near East, and to have found timbers on Mount Ararat that could have been the remains of Noah's Ark.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In 1935 he met Mary (Mollie) Ada Saunders, an [[Islington]] woman three years younger than himself. After a few years of Communistic 'trial marriage' they were formally married in 1939.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Shortly after Britain declared war on Germany the National Union of Teachers and its staff were evacuated to [[Toddington, Gloucestershire|Toddington]] near [[Gloucester]]. Knight avoided conscription by joining the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].  At first set to nursing and fire watching duties, he was later seconded to the Emergency Medical Services' plastic surgery unit at the [[Gloucester City General Hospital]] as a medical photographer.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

After the war Knight returned to London, his work at the NUT supplemented with freelance writing, photography, art work and editing.  In 1949 a son, Simon, was born. Shortly after this Hardwicke was appointed Director of Medical Photography of Enfield Group Hospitals based at [[Chase Farm Hospital]], Enfield.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Enfield Weekly Herald'', 6 September 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; A daughter, Deborah, was born in 1951.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

== Life in New Zealand ==

In 1957 the family emigrated to New Zealand where Knight took up the position of director of the medical photographic unit of the [[Otago Medical School]] and [[Dunedin Public Hospital]].&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; In 1965 he was elected president of the [[New Zealand Institute of Medical Photographers]].&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; Techniques of [[fluorescein angiography]] developed by Knight won international acclaim.

Knight was president of the [[Dunedin Film Society]] for several years starting in 1960 and that year also was elected president of the [[Otago Anthropological Society]] of which he was a founding member.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; He attended most of the society's archaeological excavations over the next four years, developing techniques for photographing and recording archaeological sites and writing an unpublished handbook on the subject.

In 1963-4 he was part of an archaeological expedition to [[Pitcairn Island]] sponsored by the [[United States National Science Foundation]],&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; during which he mapped the island and collected place-names and a wealth of other information which he wrote up in detail in a report and a private journal.

In 1967 the [[Archaeological Research Foundation]], a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] group dedicated to finding [[Noah's Ark]] on [[Mount Ararat]], paid Knight's travel expenses so he could show them where he had found timbers in 1936. Knight subsequently postulated the timbers were the remains of a shelter for animals, not a large boat, and claimed that after he left the ARF party he found archaeological evidence to support his theory that Noah and his family grazed their stock on Mount Ararat in summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cassells |first=Winston |title=In the Footsteps of Noah |magazine=Signature |date=December 1993 – January 1994 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight's interest in [[Otago]] local history began shortly after his arrival in New Zealand. Finding much of the area's history unrecorded he set about the task himself. Memoirs of the [[Otago Peninsula]]'s inhabitants supplemented with information from archival material formed the basis of a series of 1968 ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' articles under the pseudonym 'Sam Fossicker'. Knight's book  ''Otago Peninsula: A local history'' (1978) was commended by the judges of the [[AM Sherrard Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dunedin Author Commended |newspaper=Otago Daily Times |page=11 |date=16 March 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight's first book, ''Photography in New Zealand:  A social and technical history'' (1971) was the country’s first comprehensive photographic history. He subsequently published numerous books of early Dunedin and Otago photographs with supporting historical information  including  ''Dunedin Then'' (1974),  ''Princes Street by Gaslight'' (1977) and the popular seven-volume series ''Otago Cavalcade'' published between 1983 and 1985. In addition he wrote several biographies of early New Zealand photographers, notably one of the [[Burton Brothers]] (''Burton Brothers : Photographers'', 1980) and ''New Zealand Photographers : A selection'' (1981). He wrote articles for the ''[[British Journal of Photography]]'' and ''[[History of Photography (magazine)|History of Photography]]'' magazine and was on the editorial board of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://photoforum-nz.org/blog/?s=hardwicke+knight |title=Hardwicke Knight 1911–2008.

''Buildings of Dunedin: An illustrated architectural guide to New Zealand's Victorian city'' (co-written with Niel Wales, 1988) and ''Church Building in Otago'' (1993) are his main contributions in the field of architectural history.

In 1983 he produced a volume of his own photographs (''Hardwicke Knight Photographer'') . The photographs covered several genres including photojournalism, art photography and portraiture (of which Mollie was a frequent subject) and travel photography which revealed his fascination with a country’s architecture as well as its people. He also painted in watercolours, oils and pen and ink and owned a hand printing press on which he produced his own book plates, title pages and cards.

Knight was an avid, obsessive collector, and his [[Broad Bay, New Zealand|Broad Bay]] cottage and its makeshift additions became a virtual museum with his collections stacked floor to ceiling.  He stored much of his photographic equipment at the [[Otago Museum]], where he organised several photography exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Museum Challenge |newspaper=Otago Daily Times |page=4 |date=20 January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a significant part of Knight's photographic collection of over 20,000 items, specifically his collection of works by the [[Burton Brothers]] and a collection of vintage photographic equipment, was acquired by the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], the country's national museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000a3fd8 |title=Hardwicke Knight |website=[[Te papa|Te Papa Online]] |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other collections were dispersed after his death; much was auctioned in [[Adelaide]] and items related to New Zealand were auctioned in Dunedin or sold privately to local museums. 
 
In 1991 Knight was awarded a [[Queen's Service Order]]&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; and in 1996 an award presented by The City of Dunedin 'in appreciation of outstanding achievements as a citizen of the City.'  He returned to England only once, in 1992.

Knight's last years were troubled by failing eyesight, joint pain and digestive problems which were the legacy of a burst appendix in his early teens. Mollie died in 1999.  A few years later Ursula Stockinger came from Germany to live with him at Broad Bay and cared for him until his admission to Glamis, a Dunedin nursing home, in 2007. Sally, as he called her, had originally met Knight in 1951 at Chase Farm Hospital where she was training to be a nurse.

He co-founded the [[SS]]-organization ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' but was later pushed out by [[Heinrich Himmler]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Utrecht]] on 6 May 1885, Wirth studied [[Flemish Dutch]] philology, literature, history and musicology at Utrecht and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1910 from the [[University of Leipzig]] with a dissertation on the demise of the Dutch folk song.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"&gt;{{Citation | last =Mahsarski | first =Dirk | contribution = "Schwarmgeister und Phantasten" - die völkische Laienforschung | year =2013 | title = Graben für Germanien - Archäologie unterm Hakenkreuz| editor-last = Focke-Museum, Bremen| editor-first = | volume = | pages = 50–56| place = | publisher =Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft | isbn=978-3-534-25919-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught Flemish Dutch philosophy at the [[University of Bern]].

In 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Wirth volunteered for military service in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]]. However, due to his support for Flemish separatists in German-occupied [[Belgium]] he was dismissed from the service. In 1916, he was appointed by [[Wilhelm II]] as a professor (''Titularprofessor'').&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt; After the war ended, he founded a nationalist organization in the Netherlands.

In 1923, Wirth settled in [[Marburg]], Germany, and in 1925 joined the [[NSDAP]]. However, his membership was discontinued in 1927 when he failed to pay his dues.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt;

===Nazi Pre-history===
Wirth then published a paper about the "Prehistory of the Atlantic Nordic race" ''(German: Urgeschichte der atlantisch-nordischen Rasse)'', which found appeal in [[völkisch movement|völkisch circles]]. From October 1932, Wirth attempted to set up a ''Forschunsginstitut für Urgeschichte'' in [[Bad Doberan]] associated with a professorship at [[Rostock]] university, supported by the NSDAP state government of [[Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Headed by Wirth, it was extremely controversial in professional circles as well as among noted NSDAP intellectuals. Due to a lack of funds and Wirth's expensive way of life, the institute folded within a year. The ''Hermann-Wirth-Gesellschaft'', founded in 1928, also suffered.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt;

After the rise to power of the NSDAP, he rejoined the party in 1934 and shortly thereafter became a member of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt; (SS, membership number 258.776). He was re-awarded his former NSDAP number (20.151) personally by [[Adolf Hitler]].

In early summer 1933, friends within the NSDAP helped Wirth to be appointed to an extraordinary professorship without teaching responsibilities at the theological faculty of [[Berlin University]]. He also negotiated with the Prussian Ministry of Education about the establishment of an open-air museum ''Deutsches Ahnenerbe'' near Berlin. Wirth also re-founded his organization as ''Gesellschaft für germanische Ur- und Vorgeschichte'', with assistance from the journalist and Nazi functionary [[Johann von Leers]] and the industrialist [[Ludwig Roselius]]. The latter had supported Wirth since the 1920s and paid for the publication of ''Der Aufgang der Menschheit''.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt;

Between 1933 and 1935, there was a large philosophical clash encouraged by the Nazi party between the churches, and neo-paganism supported by völkisch theories.&lt;ref name=her&gt;Die Missionsanstalt Hermannsburg und der Nationalsozialismus: der Weg einer lutherischen Milieuinstitution zwischen Weimarer Republik und Nachkriegszeit, Gunther Schendel, LIT Verlag Münster, 2008 pp.300
&lt;/ref&gt; Wirth was among those who tried to reinterpret [[Christianity]] in terms of ethnic Nordic origin of original monotheism.&lt;ref name=her/&gt; The free-thinking neo-pagans founded a supporting group in 1933, and included Wirth, [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]], and until 1934 [[Ernst Bergmann (philosopher)|Ernst Bergmann]] and numerous ex-[[Communist]]s.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;Die Nation vor Gott. Zur Botschaft der Kirche im Dritten Reich. Editors Walter Künneth, Helmuth Schreiner, Berlin 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Wirth advanced plans to create an organization called ''Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V.'' which was intended to host and exhibit his collection. Although he was supported by Roselius, the ''[[Eingetragener Verein|Verein]]'' was seemingly never set up. But von Leers had brought Wirth into contact with [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Richard Walther Darré]] who were interested in Wirth's ideas.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt; From 1935, sponsored by Himmler and Darré, Wirth co-founded and then headed the ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', which was to "research German ancestral heritage", of the [[SS]]. In 1937, Himmler restructured the ''Ahnenerbe'', made Wirth the "Honorary President" with no real powers and replaced him as president with [[Walter Wüst]]. In 1938, Wirth also lost his department within the ''Ahnenerbe'' and in 1939 he lost his position as ''Ehrenpräsident''.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Halle| first1 =Uta|last2 =Mahsarski | first2 =Dirk | contribution = Forschungsstrukturen| year =2013 | title = Graben für Germanien - Archäologie unterm Hakenkreuz| editor-last = Focke-Museum, Bremen| editor-first = | volume = | pages = 57–64| place = | publisher =Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft | isbn=978-3-534-25919-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wirth was subsequently forced into exile along with other [[German mystic]]s that did not support National Socialism. He continued his research with state-funded aid, but being excluded from both academic and Nazi circles, was no longer considered by anyone as part of the Nazi regime.

===Post World War II===
Captured in 1945 by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], he was detained and interviewed for two years. He then moved to [[Sweden]], before returning to Marburg in 1954, where he lived as a private scholar.

Although he continued to defend National Socialist principles, Wirth's teachings about "Urkulturen" found resonance in the evolving alternative scene, and in the 1970s gained support from North American native groups. In the late 1970s, politicians in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] including the state government and delegates from [[Kusel]] supported a project to set up a museum to show Wirth's ethnographic collection in the tithe barn of [[Lichtenberg Castle (Palatinate)|Lichtenberg Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14315413.html ''Schenkel der Göttlichen.''] In: ''[[Der Spiegel]].'' 40/1980 (29 September 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wirth died in 1981 in Kusel.

==Philosophy==

Wirth claimed that civilization is a curse that only a simpler way of life, as documented in archaeological findings and historical records, could lift. He has been criticized for romantic nationalism and Germanomania.&lt;ref&gt;Kater, M. (1974). ''Das Ahnenerbe der SS 1935-1945: ein Beitrag zur Kulturpolitik Des Dritten Reiches'', Studien zur Zeitgeschichte/Institut für Zeitgeschichte, Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, pp.11-16 (as cited in  Arnold, Bettina, ''Pseudoarchaeology and nationalism'', a contribution in ''Archaeological Fantasies' (ed. Garrett G. Fagan), Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-30593-4}}, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; He was also criticized by German scholars of his time, like [[Bolko von Richthofen]], Gerhard Gloege, [[Arthur Hübner]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen|de}}, for gullibly refusing to accept the scientific evidence that proved ''[[Oera Linda Book|Ura Linda chronicle]]'' (a supposedly 6th–1st century BC chronicle of a Frisian family that he translated) a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Kater (1974), p.16 (as cited in Arnold (2006), p. 163)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wirth placed the origins of European civilization on the mythological island of [[Atlantis]], which he thought had been located in the North Atlantic, connecting North America and Europe. Its inhabitants supposedly were pure [[Aryan race|Aryans]], influencing the cultures not just of Europeans but also of the natives of North America and the wider "Old World" beyond Europe. According to Wirth, these Atlanteans worshipped a single deity whose aspect changed with the seasons and its son, the ''Heilsbringer''. In their religion, priestesses played a key role. Wirth thought that both the Jewish and the Christian faith were perversions of this original religion. He considered himself a symbologist and thought the Germanic people to be direct descendants of these inhabitants of Atlantis. Researching the Germanic culture thus was a way of reconstructing the original culture of the ancients. All of this research was considered explicitly political as well as religious.&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt;

Wirth's ideas inspired the design of ''[[Atlantis House|Haus Atlantis]]'' in the [[Böttcherstraße]] in [[Bremen]]. This was referred to in a speech by Hitler at the 1936 ''[[Reichsparteitag]]'', in which he denounced the "Böttcher-Straßen-Kultur".&lt;ref name="Katalog1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3527">The Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] introduced two cycles that have been named after him in later literature.

==History==
The first is described in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'' IV.2.  Hipparchus constructed a cycle by multiplying by 17 a cycle due to the [[Chaldea]]n astronomer [[Kidinnu]], so as to closely match an integer number of [[synodic month]]s (4267), [[anomalistic month]]s (4573), years (345), and days (126007 + about 1 hour); it is also close to a half-integer number of [[draconic month]]s (4630.53...), so it is an [[eclipse cycle]].  By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify the accuracy of the various periods that the Chaldean astronomers used. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Hipparchic eclipse cycle is made up of 25 [[inex]] minus 21 [[Saros (astronomy)|saros]] periods. There are only three or four eclipses in a series of eclipses separated by Hipparchic cycles. For example, the [[solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]] was preceded by one in 1672 and will be followed by one in 2362, but there are none before or after these.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |title=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses |url=https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SEcatalog.html |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is a calendar cycle: Hipparchus proposed a correction to the [[Calippic cycle]] (of 76 years), which itself was proposed as a correction to the [[Metonic cycle]] (of 19 years).  He may have published it in the book "On the Length of the Year" (Περὶ ἐνιαυσίου μεγέθους), which is lost.  From solstice observations, Hipparchus found that the [[tropical year]] is about {{frac|300}} of a day shorter than the {{frac|365|1|4}} days that Calippus used (see ''Almagest'' III.1).  So he proposed to make a 1-day correction after 4 Calippic cycles, such that 304 years = 3760 lunations = 111035 days.  This is a very decent approximation for an integer number of lunations in an integer number of days (error only 0.014 days).  But it is in fact 1.37 days longer than 304 tropical years: the mean tropical year is actually about {{frac|128}} day (11 minutes 15 seconds) shorter than the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian calendar year]] of {{frac|365|1|4}} days.  These differences cannot be corrected with any cycle that is a multiple of the 19-year cycle of 235 lunations: it is an accumulation of the mismatch between years and months in the basic Metonic cycle, and the lunar months need to be shifted systematically by a day with respect to the solar year (''i.e.'' the Metonic cycle itself needs to be corrected) after every 228 years.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
Indeed, from the values of the tropical year (365.2421896698 days) and the synodic month (29.530588853) cited in the respective articles of Wikipedia, it follows that the length of 228=12*19 tropical years  is about 83275.22 days, shorter than the length of 12*235 synodic months, namely about 83276.26 days, by one day plus about one hour. In fact, an even better correction would be to correcting by two days every 437 years, rather than one day every 228 years. The length of 437=23*19 tropical years, about 159610.837 days, is shorter than that of  23*235 synodic months, about 159612.833 days, by almost exactly two days, up to only six minutes.

'''Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq ibn Yasār ibn Khiyār''' ({{IPA-ar|ɪsˈħɑːq}}; according to some sources, ibn Khabbār, or Kūmān, or Kūtān,&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; {{lang-ar|محمد بن إسحاق بن يسار بن خيار}}, or simply '''ibn Isḥaq''', ابن إسحاق, meaning "the son of Isaac"; died 767 or 761&lt;ref name="Robinson 2003, p. xv"/&gt;) was an [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historian]] and [[hagiography|hagiographer]]. Ibn Ishaq collected oral traditions that formed the basis of an important [[Prophetic biography|biography]] of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].

==Life==
Born in [[Medina]] about the year A.H. 85 (704 A.D), ibn Isḥaq was the grandson of a Christian man of [[Kufa]] (in southern Iraq), by the name of Yasār. Yasār had been captured in a monastery in [[Ayn al-Tamr]] in one of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]'s campaigns, taken to Medina and became the slave of Qays ibn Makhrama ibn al-Muṭṭalib ibn ʿAbd Manāf ibn Quṣayy. Having accepted Islam, Yasār was manumitted and became his [[Mawali|mawlā]] (''client''), thus acquiring the [[nisbat (onomastics)|nisbat]] al-Muṭṭalibī. Yasār's three sons, Mūsā, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and Isḥāq, were all known as transmitters of akhbār, who collected and recounted tales of the past. Isḥāq married the daughter of another mawlā and from this marriage ibn Isḥāq was born.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 3| pages = 810–1| last = Jones| first = J. M. B.| title = ibn Isḥāḳ| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Newby, ''The Making of the Last Prophet'' (University of South Carolina 1989) at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no details of Isḥāq's early life, but in view of the family nature of early akhbār and [[hadith]] transmission, it was natural that he should follow in their footsteps. He was also influenced by the work of [[ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], who praised the young ibn Ishaq for his knowledge of maghāzī (literally, stories of military expeditions). Around the age of 30, ibn Isḥaq arrived in Alexandria and studied under Yazīd ibn Abī Ḥabīb. After his return to Medina, based on one account, he was ordered out of Medina for attributing a hadith to a woman he had not met (Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir, wife of [[Hishām ibn ʿUrwa]]).&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; But those who defended him, like [[Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah]], stated that Ibn Ishaq told them that he did meet her.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abī Ḥātim, ''Taqdima al-maʿrifa li kitāb al-jarḥ wa al-taʿdīl'', at "Sufyān ibn ʿUyayna"&lt;/ref&gt; Also ibn Ishaq disputed with the young [[Malik ibn Anas]], famous for the [[Maliki]] School of [[Fiqh]]. Leaving Medina (or forced to leave), he traveled eastwards towards what is now [[Iraq]], stopping in [[Kufa]], also [[al-Jazīra]], and into Iran as far as [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], before returning west. Eventually he settled in [[Baghdad]]. There, the new [[Abbasid]] dynasty, having overthrown the [[Umayyad]] caliphs, was establishing a new capital.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Newby, ''The Making of the Last Prophet'' (University of South Carolina 1989) at 6–7, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Isḥaq moved to the capital and found patrons in the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt; He became a tutor employed by the Abbasid caliph [[Al-Mansur]], who commissioned him to write an all-encompassing history book starting from the creation of [[Adam]] to the present day, known as "al-Mubtadaʾ wa al-Baʿth wa al-Maghāzī" (lit.

==Biography of Muhammad==
{{see also|Sirah Rasul Allah}}

===Original versions, survival===
Ibn Isḥaq collected oral traditions about the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. These traditions, which he orally dictated to his pupils,&lt;ref name="EQ-Sira" /&gt; are now known collectively as ''Sīratu Rasūli l-Lāh'' ({{lang-ar|سيرة رسول الله}} "Life of the Messenger of God") and survive mainly in the following sources:

* An edited copy, or [[recension]], of his work by his student al-Bakka'i, which was further edited by [[ibn Hisham]]. Al-Bakka'i's work [[Lost work|has perished]] and only ibn Hisham's has survived, in copies.&lt;ref name="Donner"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Darwin Press| isbn = 978-0-87850-127-4| last = Donner| first = Fred McGraw| title = Narratives of Islamic origins: the beginnings of Islamic historical writing| year = 1998 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An edited copy, or recension, prepared by his student Salamah ibn Fadl al-Ansari. This [[Lost work|also has perished]], and survives only in the copious extracts to be found in the voluminous ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]].&lt;ref name="Donner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Montgomery Watt and M. V. McDonald, "Translator's Forward" xi–xlvi, at xi–xiv, in ''The History of al-Tabari. Volume VI. Muhammad at Mecca'' (SUNY 1988). Regarding al-Tabari's narratives of Muhammad, the translators state, "The earliest and most important of these sources was Ibn Ishaq, whose book on the Prophet is usually known as the ''Sirah''. Discussed here are Ibn Ishaq and his ''Sirah'', the various recensions of it, Guillaume's translation, and Ibn Hisham.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fragments of several other recensions. Guillaume lists them on p.&amp;nbsp;xxx of his preface, but regards most of them as so fragmentary as to be of little worth.

According to Donner, the material in ibn Hisham and al-Tabari is "virtually the same".&lt;ref name="Donner"/&gt; However, there is some material to be found in al-Tabari that was not preserved by ibn Hisham. For example, al-Tabari includes the controversial episode of the [[Satanic Verses]], while ibn Hisham does not.&lt;ref name="EQ-Sira" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Ibn Ishaq (Guillaume's reconstruction, at pp.&amp;nbsp;165–167) and al-Tabari (SUNY edition, at VI: 107–112).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of previously unknown fragments of ibn Isḥaq's traditions, recent scholarship suggests that ibn Isḥaq did not commit to writing any of the traditions now extant, but they were narrated orally to his transmitters. These new texts, found in accounts by Salama al-Ḥarranī and Yūnus ibn Bukayr, were hitherto unknown and contain versions different from those found in other works.&lt;ref name="EI2-Sira"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 9| pages = 660–3| last = Raven| first = W. | title = SĪRA | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam| isbn = 978-90-04-10422-8| year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction of the text===

The original text of the ''Sīrat Rasūl Allāh'' by Ibn Ishaq did not survive. Yet it was one of the earliest substantial biographies of Muhammad. However, much of the original text was copied over into a work of his own by [[Ibn Hisham]] ([[Basra]]; [[Fustat]] c. 218 A.H.).&lt;ref&gt;Dates and places, and discussions, re Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham in Guillaume (pp.&amp;nbsp;xiii &amp; xli).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Hisham also "abbreviated, annotated, and sometimes altered" the text of Ibn Ishaq, according to Guillaume (at p.&amp;nbsp;xvii). [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|Interpolations]] made by Ibn Hisham are said to be recognizable and can be deleted, leaving as a remainder, a so-called "''[[edited]]''" version of Ibn Ishaq's original text (otherwise lost). In addition, Guillaume (at p.&amp;nbsp;xxxi) points out that Ibn Hisham's version ''omits'' various narratives in the text which were given by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] in his ''[[Tarikh al-Tabari|History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari (839–923) wrote his ''History'' in Arabic: ''Ta'rikh al-rusul wa'l-muluk'' (Eng: ''History of Prophets and Kings''). A 39-volume translation was published by State University of New York as ''The History of al-Tabari''; volumes six to nine concern the life of Muhammad.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Omitted by Ibn Hisham and found in al-Tabari are, e.g., at 1192 (''History of al-Tabari'' (SUNY 1988), VI: 107–112), and at 1341 (''History of al-Tabari'' (SUNY 1987), at VII: 69–73).&lt;/ref&gt; In these passages al-Tabari expressly cites Ibn Ishaq as a source.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., al-Tabari, ''The History of al-Tabari, volume VI. Muhammad at Mecca'' (SUNY 1988) at p.&amp;nbsp;56 (1134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See here above: "The text and its survival", esp. re Salamah ibn Fadl al-Ansari. Cf, Guillaume at p.&amp;nbsp;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus can be reconstructed an 'improved' "''edited''" text, i.e., by distinguishing or removing Ibn Hisham's additions, and by adding from al-Tabari passages attributed to Ibn Ishaq. Yet the result's degree of approximation to Ibn Ishaq's original text can only be conjectured. Such a reconstruction is available, e.g., in Guillaume's translation.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hisham's 'narrative' additions and his comments are removed from the text and isolated in a separate section (Guillaume at 3 note, pp.&amp;nbsp;691–798), while Ibn Hisham's philological additions are evidently omitted (cf., Guillaume at p.&amp;nbsp;xli).&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Ibn Ishaq's introductory chapters describe [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], before he then commences with the narratives surrounding the life of Muhammad (in Guillaume at pp.&amp;nbsp;109–690).

===Views of his ''Sīrat Rasūl Allāh''===

Notable scholars like the jurist [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] appreciated his efforts in collecting sīra narratives and accepted him on [[Prophetic biography|maghāzī]], despite having reservations on his methods on matters of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Ibn Ishaq also influenced later sīra writers like [[Ibn Hishām]] and [[Fatḥ al-Din Ibn Sayyid al-Nās|Ibn Sayyid al-Nās]]. Other scholars, like [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]], made use of his chronological ordering of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muḥammad Ibn ʻAbd al-Wahhāb|first=Imam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JRzr6mC55IC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Mukhtaṣar zād al-maʻād|year=2003|publisher= Darussalam publishers Ltd|isbn=978-9960-897-18-9|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
      
The most widely discussed criticism of his sīra was that of his contemporary [[Mālik ibn Anas]].&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Mālik rejected the stories of Muhammad and the Jews of Medina on the ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of Jewish converts.&lt;ref name="Arafat"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0035-869X| issue = 2| pages = 100–107| last = Arafat| first = W. N.| title = New Light on the Story of Banū Qurayẓa and the Jews of Medina| journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland| date = 1976-01-01| jstor = 25203706}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same stories have also been denounced as "odd tales" (gharāʾib) later by [[ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]].&lt;ref name="Arafat" /&gt; Mālik and others also thought that ibn Isḥāq exhibited [[Qadarīyah|Qadari]] tendencies, had a preference for [[Ali]] (Guillaume also found evidence of this, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxii &amp;xxiv),&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; and relied too heavily on what were later called the [[Isrā'īlīyāt]]. Furthermore, early literary critics, like ibn Sallām al-Jumaḥī and [[ibn al-Nadīm]], censured ibn Isḥāq for knowingly including forged poems in his biography,&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; and for attributing poems to persons not known to have written any poetry.&lt;ref name="EI2-Sira" /&gt; The 14th-century historian [[al-Dhahabī]], using [[hadith terminology]], noted that in addition to the forged (''makdhūb'') poetry, Ibn Isḥāq filled his sīra with many [[munqaṭiʿ]] (broken [[Isnad|chain of narration]]) and [[munkar]] (suspect narrator) reports.&lt;ref name="mizan" /&gt;
      
Guillaume notices that Ibn Isḥāq frequently uses a number of expressions to convey his skepticism or caution. Beside a frequent note that only God knows whether a particular statement is true or not (p.&amp;nbsp;xix), Guillaume suggests that Ibn Isḥāq deliberately substitute the ordinary term "ḥaddathanī" (he narrated to me) by a word of suspicion "zaʿama" ("he alleged") to show his skepticism about certain traditions (p.&amp;nbsp;xx).

===Translations===

In 1864 the Heidelberg professor [[Gustav Weil]] published an annotated German translation in two volumes. Several decades later the Hungarian scholar [[Edward Rehatsek]] prepared an English translation, but it was not published until over a half-century later.&lt;ref&gt;See bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known translation in a Western language is [[Alfred Guillaume]]'s 1955 English translation, but some have questioned the reliability of this translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Revised| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-00856-1| last = Humphreys| first = R. Stephen| title = Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry| year = 1991|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP| last = Tibawi| first = Abdul Latif| title = Ibn Isḥāq's Sīra, a critique of Guillaume's English translation: the life of Muhammad| year = 1956|authorlink=Abdul Latif Tibawi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Guillaume combined ibn Hisham and those materials in al-Tabari cited as ibn Isḥaq's whenever they differed or added to ibn Hisham, believing that in so doing he was restoring a lost work. The extracts from al-Tabari are clearly marked, although sometimes it is difficult to distinguish them from the main text (only a capital "T" is used).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Guillaume at pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Ibn Isḥaq wrote several works. His major work is ''al-Mubtadaʾ wa al-Baʿth wa al-Maghāzī''—the ''Kitab al-Mubtada'' and ''Kitab al-Mab'ath'' both survive in part, particularly ''al-Mab'ath'', and ''al-Mubtada'' otherwise in substantial fragments. He is also credited with the [[lost works]] ''Kitāb al-kh̲ulafāʾ'', which al-Umawwī related to him (Fihrist, 92; Udabāʾ, VI, 401) and a book of ''Sunan'' (Ḥād̲j̲d̲j̲ī Ḵh̲alīfa, II, 1008).&lt;ref name="EQ-Sira"&gt;Raven, Wim, Sīra and the Qurʾān – Ibn Isḥāq and his editors, ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an''. Ed. Jane Dammen McAuliffe. Vol. 5. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill Academic Publishers, 2006. p29-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Newby, ''The Making of the Last Prophet'' (University of South Carolina 1989) at 2–4, 5, 7–9, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability of his hadith==

In [[hadith studies]], ibn Isḥaq's hadith (considered separately from his prophetic biography) is generally thought to be "good" (''ḥasan'') (assuming an accurate and trustworthy [[isnad]], or chain of transmission)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 1st| publisher = King Saud University| author = M. R. Ahmad| title = Al-sīra al-nabawiyya fī dhawʾ al-maṣādir al-aṣliyya: dirāsa taḥlīlīyya| location = Riyadh| date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself having a reputation of being "sincere" or "trustworthy" (''ṣadūq''). However, a general analysis of his isnads has given him the negative distinction of being a ''mudallis'', meaning one who did not name his teacher, claiming instead to narrate directly from his teacher's teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = IIIT| isbn = 978-1-56564-418-2| last = Qaraḍāwī| first = Yūsuf| title = Approaching the Sunnah: comprehension and controversy| year = 2007| page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his tadlīs, many scholars including [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] hardly ever used his narrations in their [[sahih]] books.&lt;ref name="Zaheer"&gt;A Biography of the Prophet of Islam, By Mahdī Rizq Allāh Aḥmad, Syed Iqbal Zaheer, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi|al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī]], all scholars of ahadith except one no longer rely on any of his narrations, although truth is not foreign to him.&lt;ref&gt;al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, ''Tārīkh Baghdād''&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], rejected his narrations on all matters related to [[fiqh]].&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; [[Al-Dhahabi|Al-Dhahabī]] concluded that despite his good qualities any narration solely transmitted through him should probably be considered as containing ''[[Hadith terminology#Munkar|munkar]]'', for there is an issue with his memorizing. He added that some Imams mentioned him, including [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]], who cited five of Ibn Ishaq's ahadith in his ''Sahih''.&lt;ref name="mizan"&gt;Al-Dhahabī, ''Mīzān al-iʿtidāl fī naqd al-rijāl'', at "Muhammad ibn Ishaq"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamal al-Din Yusuf bin al-Amir Sayf al-Din Taghribirdi''' (Arabic: جمال الدين يوسف بن الأمير سيف الدين تغري بردي) or '''Ibn Taghribirdi'''&lt;ref&gt;For a more complete list of variations on the spelling and form of his name, see [[International Standard Name Identifier|ISNI]]'s listing for him [http://isni.org/isni/0000000116180016 Ibn Taghribirdi: variations].&lt;/ref&gt; (2 February 1411— 5 June 1470;  813-874 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]]) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] historian born into the Turkish [[Mamluk]] elite of [[Cairo]] in the 15th century.  He studied under [[al-Ayni]] and [[al-Maqrizi]], two of the leading Cairene historians and scholars of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=eb-wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=Ibn+Taghribirdi's+work&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YQCFst2YHO&amp;sig=0WZtyxWUzwG9SGhprUaT7Dmh7k8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ibn%20Taghribirdi's%20work&amp;f=false|title=The Chronicles and Annalistic Sources of the Early Mamluk Circassian Period|last=Massoud|first=Sami|date=2007-04-24|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047419792|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most famous work is a multi-volume chronicle of Egypt and the Mamluk sultanate called ''al-Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira''.  His style is annalistic and gives precise dates for most events;  this format makes it clear that Ibn Taghribirdi had privileged access to the sultans and their records.

'''J. A. van Aalst''' (14 October 1858 – after 1914) was a Belgian customs and postal officer in China, known for chronicling the history of [[Chinese music]] and dance.

Van Aalst was a government administrator for the Chinese Imperial Government of the [[Qing Dynasty]], who served in [[China]] during the late 19th century.  While providing service as a government official, he chronicled the history of Chinese music and dance, serving as the primary source in the western world of Chinese music until other sources emerged in the 1950s.  His most famous text is ''Chinese Music'' which was published in 1884 in [[Shanghai]] by the Statistical Dept of the Inspectorate General.  Van Aalst was an official in the employ of what later came to be called the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] and was during his tenure called the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. He was appointed to Postal Secretary in 1899. His boss, [[Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Hart]], was also a music lover, creator of one of the first brass bands in China.

The Italian composer, [[Giacomo Puccini]], used Van Aalst's text as a primary source for the Chinese musical portion of his opera, [[Turandot]], which was first performed in 1912 and set to [[Carlo Gozzi]]'s play of the same name.

'''Joseph-Jean Raikem''' or '''Jean-Joseph Raikem''' ([[Liège|Liege]], 28 April 1787 - 24 January 1875) was a [[Roman Catholic]] Belgian politician, president of the [[National Congress of Belgium]], magistrate and historian.

==Life==
&lt;!---
Jean Raikem kwam zich in het begin van de achttiende eeuw vanuit [[Engis]] in Luik vestigen als warme bakker.
De vader van Jean-Joseph, Antoine-Joseph Raikem, was de eerste universitair in de familie en werd advocaat in Luik.

Jean-Joseph deed zijn studies in de rechten aan de ''[[École de Droit in Brussel]]'' en werd in 1809 advocaat in Luik. Zijn eerste publicatie, in 1815, was een ''Code de la cour de cassation''. In 1829 werd hij tot stafhouder verkozen. Datzelfde jaar werd hij tot gemeenteraadslid van Luik verkozen en in juli 1830 werd hij tot Tweede Kamerlid verkozen, ambt dat hij nooit zou opnemen.

Toen de onlusten in augustus 1830 begonnen, werd hij door de Luikse Commissie voor Openbare Veiligheid in deputatie naar [[Den Haag]] gestuurd, samen met [[Jean Ghisbert de Leeuw]] en advocaat Dechamps, met de bedoeling redelijke voorwaarden van zelfbestuur voor te stellen. [[Willem I der Nederlanden|Willem I]] ontving ze op 30 augustus, maar de gesprekken leverden niets op. Op 15 oktober 1830 werd Raikem door het [[Voorlopig Bewind (België)|Voorlopig Bewind]] tot procureur-generaal benoemd bij het hof van beroep in Luik.
---&gt;

===National Congres===
&lt;!---
Raikem werd als één van de Luikse vertegenwoordigers naar het Nationaal Congres gezonden en hij speelde er een belangrijke rol, samen met zijn [[unionisme (Nederlanden)|unionistische]] geestesgenoten [[Joseph Lebeau]], [[Paul Devaux]] en [[Jean-Baptiste Nothomb]]. Zij zorgden voor ernst en orde in een inderhaast samengestelde assemblee van politieke 'amateurs'. Met zijn 75 tussenkomsten behoorde Raikem tot de tenoren van de assemblee. Hij was ook één van de drijvende krachten tijdens commissievergaderingen en in informele bijeenkomsten.

Het was vooral in de voorbereidende werkzaamheden voor de opmaak van de Grondwet dat Raikem zich liet gelden. Enkele van de hoofdstukken hadden alles aan zijn juridische kennis te danken, onder meer die betreffende de Wetgevende Kamers, het staatshoofd, de ministers, de rechterlijke macht, de provinciale en gemeentelijke instellingen.

In november 1830 stemde Raikem voor de goedkeuring van de onafhankelijkheid en voor de eeuwigdurende uitsluiting van de Nassaus. Hij hield over dit laatste trouwens een lange redevoering met alle argumenten die deze uitsluiting onvermijdelijk, noodzakelijk en dringend maakten.

Hoewel in Luik nogal sterk de idee van aanhechting bij Frankrijk leefde, was Raikem, samen met Lebeau, geen voorstander hiervan, zelfs niet van een koning die te nauw bij Frankrijk aansloot. Daarom steunden beiden de kandidatuur van de [[August van Leuchtenberg|hertog van Leuchtenberg]], hoewel er dan toch een meerderheid tot uiting kwam voor de [[Lodewijk van Orléans|hertog van Nemours]]. Raikem was het vervolgens die de kandidatuur voor het regentschap van [[Surlet de Chokier]] voorstelde, maar op de dag van de verkiezing was hij zelf afwezig. Hij werd vervolgens tweede ondervoorzitter en op 18 mei eerste ondervoorzitter van het Congres, dat hij voorzat van 13 juni tot 18 juli, dit wil zeggen tijdens de periode van stormachtige vergaderingen die werden gewijd aan het al dan niet aanvaarden van het [[Verdrag der XVIII artikelen]]. Hijzelf stemde voor de kandidatuur van [[Leopold I van België|Leopold van Saksen Coburg]] maar tegen de aanvaarding van het Verdrag der XVIII artikelen. 
---&gt;

===Kingdom of Belgium===
&lt;!---Na de troonsbestijging van Leopold I, werd Raikem Minister van Justitie in de eerste regering van het nieuwe koninkrijk (juli 1831 - september 1832). De eerste wet op de rechterlijke organisatie werd door hem voorgesteld. Hij bracht ook de Openbare Veiligheid (Sûreté) en het Gevangeniswezen onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de minister van justitie.

Ondertussen was hij door de kiezers van het arrondissement Luik verkozen tot volksvertegenwoordiger. In november 1832 werd hij tot voorzitter van de Kamer verkozen en bleef dit tot in 1839. In juni 1839 werd hij opnieuw minister van Justitie in de regering de Theux, de eerste niet-unionistische, volledig katholieke regering. In april 1840 werd deze opgevolgd door een volledig liberale regering. In november 1842 werd Raikem opnieuw Kamervoorzitter, maar bij de verkiezingen van 1843 verloor hij zijn zetel in Luik. In 1847 werd hij opnieuw herkozen, ditmaal voor het arrondissement Hasselt. Het jaar daarop verliet hij de politieke mandaten, als gevolg van de wet op de onverenigbaarheden.

Raikem bleef Luikse procureur-generaal tot aan zijn emeritaat in 1867. Gedurende meer dan dertig jaar sprak hij elk jaar een openingsrede uit, waarin hij zien visies op het gerecht uiteenzette. Het gaf hem de gelegenheid om onder meer de doodstraf in vraag te stellen, de verzachtende omstandigheden te bepleiten, het belang van de preventie te onderstrepen en de middelen aan te prijzen om recidive te vermijden en de heropvoeding van de gevangenen te bevorderen.

Hij was al de tachtig voorbij toen hij op pensioen werd gesteld. Hij werd toen opnieuw advocaat en werd in 1868 nog stafhouder. Als politicus behoorde hij tot de katholieke verkozenen. In zijn privéleven liet hij zich gelden als een diepgelovig man.

'''Kurdish nationalism''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: ''Kurdayetî'', کوردایەتی) holds that the [[Kurds|Kurdish people]] are deserving of a sovereign nation that would be partitioned out of areas in [[Turkey]], northern [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]] based on the promised nation of Kurdistan under the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

[[Early Kurdish nationalism]] had its roots in the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]], within which Kurds were a significant ethnic group. With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Kurdish-majority territories were divided between the newly formed [[State (polity)|states]] of Iraq, Syria and Turkey, making Kurds a significant ethnic minority in each state. Kurdish nationalist movements have long been suppressed by Turkey and the [[Arabs|Arab]]-majority states of Iraq and Syria, all of whom fear loss of territory to a potential independent Kurdistan. Kurds from Iran are also loyal to the nationalistic movement and this was demonstrated in Iraqi Kurdistans indepenedence referendum in 2017 where thousands of Iranian Kurds risked arrest to march and celebrate waving the banned Kurdish flag.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/8ff3ad1e-ebe9-48ed-a6b5-c6841f21258d&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-kurds-referendum-iran/iranian-kurds-march-in-support-of-independence-vote-in-northern-iraq-idUSL8N1M717N&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, Iraqi Kurds have pursued the goal of greater autonomy and even outright independence against the [[Ba'ath Party]] regimes, which responded with brutal repression including the massacre of 182,000 Kurds in the [[Anfal genocide]]. Since the 1980s, the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] led by Kurdish armed groups challenged the Turkish state, which responded with martial law. After the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]], Iraqi Kurds were protected against the armies of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] by [[NATO]]-enforced [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]], allowing them considerable autonomy and self-government outside the control of the Iraqi central government. After the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]  that ousted dictator Saddam Hussein, Iraqi Kurdistan became an autonomous region, enjoying a great measure of self-governance but stopping short of full independence.

Kurdish nationalism has long been espoused and promoted by the worldwide [[Kurdish population#Kurdish diaspora|Kurdish diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Andy.

==History==
[[File:Ancient Kurdistan.png|thumb|left|170px|Kurdistan in an antique map.]]
{{Main|History of the Kurds}}
The Kurdish nationalist struggle first emerged in the late 19th century when a unified movement demanded the establishment of a Kurdish state. Revolts did occur sporadically but only decades after the Ottoman centralist policies of the 19th century began did the first modern Kurdish nationalist movement emerge with uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful Shemdinan family, [[Sheikh Ubeydullah]]. In 1880, Ubeydullah, demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds and the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan. Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries. Feb 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5993-5}}. Pg 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising against [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] was ultimately suppressed by the Ottomans and Ubeydullah, along with other notables, were exiled to Istanbul. The Kurdish nationalist movement that emerged following World War I and end of the Ottoman Empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical [[secularization]] which the strongly [[Muslim]] Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local [[Tribal chief|chieftains]] and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant Turk [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnonationalism]] in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.&lt;ref name=natali&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ottoman Kurds and emergent Kurdish nationalism|journal=Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies|first=Denise|last=Natali|volume=13|issue=3|pages=383–387|doi= 10.1080/1066992042000300701|url=|format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western powers (particularly the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) fighting the Turks also promised the Kurds they would act as guarantors for Kurdish freedom, a promise they subsequently broke. One particular organization, the [[Society for the Rise of Kurdistan|Kürdistan Teali Cemiyeti]] (Society for the Advancement of Kurdistan, or SAK) was central to the forging of a distinct Kurdish identity. It took advantage of period of political liberalization in during the [[Second Constitutional Era]] (1908–1920) of Turkey to transform a renewed interest in [[Kurdish culture]] and language into a political nationalist movement based on ethnicity.&lt;ref name=natali/&gt; This emphasis on Kurds as a distinct ethnicity was encouraged by around the start of the 20th century [[Russia]]n [[anthropologist]]s who suggested that the Kurds were a European race (compared to the Asiatic Turks) based on physical characteristics and their language which is part of the Indo-European language group.&lt;ref name=laciner&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ideological And Historical Roots Of Kurdist Movements In Turkey: Ethnicity Demography, Politics |journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics |first=Bal |last=Laçiner |author2=Bal, Ihsan |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=473–504 |doi=10.1080/13537110490518282 |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |format= |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011225529/http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these researchers had ulterior political motives (to sow dissent in the Ottoman Empire) their findings were embraced and still accepted today by many. During the  relatively open government of the 1950s, Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests but this move towards integration was halted with the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=laciner/&gt; The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as [[Marxism|Marxist]] political thought influenced a new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local [[Feudalism|feudal]] authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority, eventually they would form the militant separatist Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan (PKK), or [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] in English.

==Ottoman Empire==
{{Main|Early Kurdish nationalism}}
[[File:Flickr - Gaspa - Cairo, museo militare (8).jpg|thumb|199px|[[Saladin|Saladin's]] heroism and leadership were a great inspiration for the rise of Kurdish nationalism during the [[Ottoman Empire]].]]
Under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], Kurds' primary form of identification was religious with [[Sunni Islam]] being the top in the hierarchy (millet-i hakimiye).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ottoman Empire embarked on a modernization and centralization campaign known as the [[Tanzimat]] (1829–1879), Kurdish regions retained much of their autonomy and tribal chiefs their power. The [[Sublime Porte]] made little attempt to alter the traditional power structure of "segmented, [[agrarian society|agrarian]] Kurdish societies" – [[Agha (title)|agha]], [[sheikh]], and [[tribal chief]]. Because of the Kurds' geographical position at the southern and eastern fringe of the empire and the mountainous [[topography]] of their territory, in addition to the limited transportation and communication system, agents of the state had little access to Kurdish provinces and were forced to make informal agreements with tribal chiefs. This bolstered the Kurds' authority and autonomy; for instance, the Ottoman [[qadi]] and [[mufti]] as a result did not have jurisdiction over [[religious law]] in most Kurd regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, the [[Young Turks]] come to power asserting a radical form of Turkish ethnic identity and closed Ottoman associations and non-Turkish schools. They launched a campaign of political oppression and resettlement against ethnic minorities – Kurds, [[Laz people]], and [[Armenians]], but in the wartime context they could not afford to antagonize ethnic minorities too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of World War I, Kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in Kurdish, celebrate unique traditions, and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] signed in 1920 "suggested" an independent Kurdish and Armenian state but after the establishment of the Turkish Republic by a Turk ethnonationalist government which balked at the treaty, the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne Treaty]] was signed which made no mention of the Kurds. The once politically unified Ottoman Kurdistan was then divided into the different administrative and political systems in Iraq, Turkey and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
{{see also|Kurdish rebellions in Turkey}}
By the enforcement of laws such as Article 57 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish Constitution of 1982]] which outlaws "any activity harmful to national unity and territorial integrity of the Turkish Republic", Kurdish civic rights can be constrained within the context of a Constitution guaranteeing equality  without acknowledging them as a distinct group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|McDermott|1981|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equal citizenship rights were enshrined in Turkey's [[Turkish Constitution of 1921|1920 Provisional Constitution]]. Article 8 asserted that the country was composed of both Turks and Kurds but under the law they would be treated as common citizens.&lt;ref name="Natali 2005 73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1923 formation of the Republic of Turkey marked the beginning of continuing period of reduced civic rights for Kurds. The [[Ottoman Caliphate|Caliphate]] was abolished a year later as well as all public expressions and institutions of Kurdish identity. Kurdish [[madrasa]]s, newspapers, religious fraternal organizations, and associations were shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To give an example of the early republican government's attitude towards the citizenship rights of Kurds, Law No. 1850 was introduced after popular revolts, giving after-the-fact legal sanction to civilians and military personnel who killed Kurds during the revolt.
 
Kurdish regions were placed under martial law and the use of the Kurdish language, dress, folklore, and names prohibited.  It was this continued repression that led to reemergence of Kurdish nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Gunes 2012 15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunes. 2012. "The Kurdish National Movement in Turkey: From Protest to Resistance". Routledge:Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Print. 2012. p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period the primary goal of the movement was to resolve its grievances with the Turkish government through legitimate channels.  These attempts were heavily suppressed.&lt;ref name="Gunes 2012 15"/&gt;

Civic rights were temporarily improved with the Turkish Constitution of 1961 which allowed freedom of expression, the press, and association for Kurds. The 1964 Political Parties Act criminalized Kurdish political parties and the acknowledgment of the existence of different languages and races in Turkey. The 1972 Law of Association further restricted rights to association and political organization.

The failure to address the Kurdish grievances throughout the 1960s and 1970s led to alternate avenues of resolution.&lt;ref name="Gunes 2012 15"/&gt;  In 1984 the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) started a [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|guerrilla insurgency]] against the Turkish Republic. The PKKs insurgency continued to be a violent insurgency until the lasting ceasefire in 1999. Throughout this period there was a significant loss of life in addition to many social and political changes.&lt;ref name="Gunes 2012 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunes. 2012. "The Kurdish National Movement in Turkey: From Protest to Resistance". Routledge:Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Print. 2012. Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Law 2932 was repealed and the Kurdish language was allowed for informal speech and music but not for political or education purposes or in the [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year a new Anti-Terror bill was passed which defined terrorism as "any kind of action with the aim of changing characteristics of the Republic" essentially criminalizing Kurdish political [[activism]] and many basic forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 laws were further liberalized allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts and other restrictions, including the giving of Kurdish names to infants have been removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvi.gov.tr/Sik_Sorulan_Sorular,Sorular.html?pageindex=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate after World War I===
After World War I Iraq came under a British mandate. To avoid unrest, the British granted the northern Kurdish region considerable autonomy and recognized their nationalist claims. They even tried to institutionalize Kurdish ethnic identity in the 1921 Provisional Iraqi Constitution which stated that Iraq was composed of two ethnic groups with equal rights, Arabs and Kurds, and enshrined the equal legal status of the Kurdish language with [[Arabic]]. The mandate government divided the country into two separate regions, one Arab, one Kurdish in administrative policy and practice.&lt;ref name="Natali 2005 28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two policies emerged regarding Kurds in Iraq: one for non-tribal urban dwellers and one for rural tribal population meant to discourage urban migration. The government institutionalized advantages for rural Kurds – tribes had special [[legal jurisdiction]], tax benefits, and informally guaranteed seats in parliament. In addition, they were exempt from two of the strongest facets of the modern state; they had their own schools and were outside the jurisdiction of national courts. This privileged position lasted into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Natali 2005 28"/&gt; Kurdish rights were further entrenched in 1932 by the Local Languages Law, a condition of the [[League of Nations]] (undoubtedly under British influence) being that to join, Iraq had to enact constitutional protection for the Kurds.&lt;ref name="harv|Short|McDermott|1981|p=9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|McDermott|1981|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political rights were fairly open in the interwar years as continued British internal interference and a series of weak government prevented any one movement from dominating national politics prevented the creation of a formal exclusionary citizenship. However, later the central governments [[nation-building]] strategy centered around a secular conception of national identity based upon a sentiment of Iraqi unity (al-wadha al-iraqiyya) with the government dominated by Sunni [[Arabist]]s.&lt;ref name="Natali 2005 28"/&gt; Within this new framework, as non-Arabs, the Kurds would experience unwelcome changes in status.&lt;ref name="Natali 2005 28"/&gt;

===After World War II===
The 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s demonstrated a pattern. The new Arabist leader would assert his belief in the Kurds as distinct and equal ethnic group in Iraq with political rights. For instance, the Constitution of 1960 claims "Kurds and Arabs are partners within this nation. The Constitution guarantees their rights within the framework of the Iraqi republic". Once successful at consolidating their power they would repress Kurdish political rights, militarize Kurdish regions, ban nationalist political parties, destroy Kurdish villages, and forcibly impose resettlement (especially in petroleum-rich areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, from late 1961 onwards there was near constant strife in Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="harv|Short|McDermott|1981|p=9"/&gt; A major development was made when the Iraqi government and Kurdish leaders signed the 1970 Peace Agreement. It promised Kurdish self-rule, recognition of the bi-national character of Iraq, political representation in the central government, extensive official language rights, the freedom of association and organization, and several other concessions aimed at restoring full civic rights to the Kurdish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|McDermott|1981|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to come into effect within four years. In 1974 the weaker Law of Autonomy in the Area of Kurdistan was actually implemented with much weaker citizenship protections and conflict soon resumed. The 1980s, especially during the [[Iran–Iraq war]], were a particularly low point for Kurdish rights within Iraq. Approximately 500,000 Kurdish civilians were sent to detention camps in southern and eastern Iraq and the [[Iraqi armed forces]] razed villages and hamlets in and near the battle area. It is also during this time that the Iraqi military used [[chemical weapons]] on Kurdish towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Gulf War===
{{See also|Kurdistan Regional Government|Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017}}
After the [[Gulf War]] an autonomous "safe haven" was established in Northern Iraq under UN with [[U.S. Air Force]] and British [[Royal Air Force]] air protection. Under the democratically elected [[Kurdish Regional Government]], citizens experienced [[civic rights]] never previously enjoyed. [[Students' union|Student union]]s, [[NGO]]s, and women's organizations emerged as forces in a new [[civil society|civic society]] and institutionalized tolerance for the region's own ethnic, religious, and language minorities, e.g., the [[Iraqi Turkmen]]. Since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the downfall of [[Saddam Hussein]], the Kurdish population has found itself drawn back into Iraq with promises of autonomy and citizenship based on a federal, ethnically inclusive model with strong [[minority rights]] and guarantees against discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Iraqi Constitution]] drafted in 2005 establishes Kurdish as an [[official language]] alongside Arabic, acknowledges the national rights of the Kurdish people, and contains the usual promises about absolute equality of citizens regardless of race, religion, gender, etc. How effective this constitution will be in safeguarding the equal citizenship of the Kurdish population is unclear in the current unstable domestic situation.

After the failed [[Sheikh Said rebellion|revolution of Sheikh Said]], thousands of Kurds fled their homes in southeastern Turkey to Syria, where they settled and were granted citizenship by the [[French Mandate of Syria|French mandate authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn Chatty|Chatty, Dawn]], 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8OsgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=Kurds+fled+turkey+to+syria+in+1925&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7tWQMS8h_V&amp;sig=d78gym03yMZiF_CkfcI3KMX2PN0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2VcVNjNE8L2iQLk04CYAQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Kurds%20fled%20turkey%20to%20syria%20in%201925&amp;f=false Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East]. Cambridge University Press. pp. 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ala kurdên rojava.svg|thumb|225px|The flag sometimes seen in Kurdish-held areas of Syria is often flown alongside the [[flag of Kurdistan]] as being adopted by the PKK-linked [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)]] (PYD) since 2012.]]
Under the [[French Mandate of Syria]], the Kurds enjoyed considerable rights as the French mandate authority encourage minority independence movements as part of a [[divide and rule]] strategy and recruited a large Kurdish segment for its local armed forces.&lt;ref name="McDowall 1992 122"&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of Kurdish civic rights escalated with the short-lived unification of [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] as the [[United Arab Republic]] in 1958, partly in response to more vocal Kurdish demands for democracy, recognition as an ethnic group, and complaints that the state police and military academies were closed to Kurds.&lt;ref name="McDowall 1992 122"/&gt; 120 000 Kurds (40% of the Syrian Kurd population) were stripped of their citizenship in the 1962 Census when the government claimed they were, in fact, Turks and Iraqis illegally residing in the country.&lt;ref name="harv|Short|McDermott|1981|p=13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|McDermott|1981|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stripped of their nationality however, these now stateless Kurds still found themselves subject to its obligations through [[conscription]] in the [[Military of Syria|military]]. The Kurdish language and cultural expressions were banned, a state that continues today. In 1962 the Government announced its “Arab Belt” plan (later renamed “plan for establishment of model [[State Farm|state farm]]s”) which would have forcibly expelled the Kurdish population from a 350&amp;nbsp;km long, 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;km deep strip of land along Syria’s northeast border and replaced them with Arab settlers but was never fully implemented.&lt;ref name="harv|Short|McDermott|1981|p=13"/&gt; There was no change in policy under the new [[Ba’athist]] regime post-1963. It refused to implement its program of land reforms that was benefiting Arab peasants where Kurds would predominantly benefit until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s on there was a relaxation of official treatment of Kurds but the late 1980s saw renewed widespread denial of Syrian citizenship status to domestic Kurds especially in refusing national [[identity document]]s such as passports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Syrian Civil War]], Syrian government forces have abandoned many Kurdish-populated areas, leaving the Kurds to fill the power vacuum and govern these areas autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurds seek autonomy in a democratic Syria

Many Kurds consider the Kurdish-majority regions of northern and northeastern Syria to be 'Western Kurdistan' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: ''[[Rojava|Rojavaye Kurdistane]]'') and seek political autonomy within Syria (akin to [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in [[Iraq]]) or outright independence as part of [[Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ankara Alarmed by Syrian Kurds' Autonomy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443687504577563183350590066|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Kurds more a chance than challenge to Turkey, if…|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/views/2012/07/27/228626.html|publisher=Al-Arabiya|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
{{See also|Iranian Kurdistan}}
The similarity between Kurdish and [[Persian language]] and [[Persian culture|culture]] compared to the Turks and Arabs, the more equal population balance between the ethnic majority Persians and ethnic minorities like the Kurds has resulted in a somewhat different citizenship experience for Iranian Kurds, as such most seek autonomy rather than independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Qajar Empire===
Iranian group identification and social order was based on religious identification with [[Islam]], specifically [[Shia Islam]], the dominant sect. While the majority of Kurds are Sunni, in Iran they were roughly evenly split between Sunnis, Shias, and Shia splinter groups like the [[Sufi]]s. Because of this preoccupation with religion over ethnicity, in practice Kurds were treated as part of the majority and enjoyed extensive citizenship rights. Unlike the Ottoman Empire, this social order was maintained while the imperial system declined and modern Iranian identity was forged by a reform movement in the late 19th century to the benefit of Kurds.

Under this regime, Sunni and Shia Kurds held a privileged position as Muslims. Unlike the other minorities, [[Christian]] Armenians, [[Jews]], [[Zoroastrians]] and others, they had the right to work in [[food production]] and buy [[crown land]]. They also benefited from the tuyal [[land tenure]] system which favoured Muslims. This advantage allowed Kurds to establish strong control over food production and land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The notable absence of ethnic restrictions on holding government office allowed Kurdish tribal leaders and notables to purchase office and establish a strong Kurdish presence in [[Iranian politics]] without having to culturally assimilate or deny ethnicity. This political presence was bolstered because the [[Qajar Empire|Qajars]] appointed many tribal chiefs to government positions in exchange for internal security assurances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this system many Kurds reached prominent military, political, and diplomatic positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptional in Iran during the 19th century and early 20th was that the nationalist reform movement did not develop a radical, exclusionary, ethnic-based conception of nationality but developed an Iranian identity that did not define itself as ethnically [[Persian people|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional monarchy===
{{main|Kurdish separatism in Iran}}
The existing beneficial social framework changed with the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]] by [[Reza Shah]] in 1925. Similar to other states, he tried to nation-build by creating an exclusionary nationality based on a secular, ethnically Persian Iranian identity and repress the cultural expressions and equal status of ethnic minorities. These minorities, including the Kurds were coerced into accepting Persian culture and many were arrested for speaking the Kurdish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurds were afforded a special position in the official state ethnic-based nationalism because of their cultural similarity to the Persians and their non-Arab ethnicity. Also, the distribution of seats in the [[Majlis]] (parliament) was based on religion, not ethnicity, the Kurds were able to exercise greater political power than non-Muslim minorities like the Armenians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state’s system of military conscription and centralized education served to integrate urban Kurdish populations but the majority remained rural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] withdrawal from Kurdish regions (where they had encouraged autonomous Kurdish government as the [[Mahabad Republic]]), the [[Shah]] banned some Kurdish political parties, expressions of cultural identity ended the open political party system and ruled by firman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|1992|p=70}},&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 there was a marked liberalization which allowed the activities of Kurdish cultural organizations and student associations but still limited political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other countries the Kurds were free to publish cultural and historical information in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with massive investment and military aid from the [[western world]], in the 1950s and 1960s Iran became a [[police state]] which clamped down on many civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Revolutionary Iran===
{{main|1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran}}
After the [[Iranian Revolution]], some Kurdish groups (chiefly the [[Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan]]) allied with Iranian leftist and communist groups against [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]'s government. The [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdish rebellion for autonomy in 1979]] was forcibly suppressed by Tehran, with thousands of Kurdish rebels and civilians killed as a result.

The new [[theocratic]] government developed a new exclusionary conception of nationalism based on very conservative Shia Islam. Once Khomeini consolidated power he expelled Sunni Kurds from government office, placed restrictions on freedom of expression, and militarized Kurdish regions as part of the war with Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still compared to other countries Kurds were still allowed limited publications, to celebrate holidays, wear traditional dress, and use Kurdish (except as a language of instruction). Significant improvements were made in 1997 whereby the government allowed a profusion of Kurdish language in media, although some of these publications were later restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PJAK insurrection===
{{main|Iran–PJAK conflict}}
The Iranian government has been facing a low-level guerrilla warfare against the ethnic secessionist Kurdish guerrilla group [[Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan]] (PJAK) since 2004. PJAK is closely affiliated with the Kurdish militant group [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) operating against [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2007/05/070530_mf_clash.shtml |title=BBCPersian.com |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdish population==
{{main|Kurdish population}}
{{See also|Kurds in Turkey|Kurds in Iran|Kurds in Iraq|Kurds in Syria}}
Accurate population figures for the Kurds are hard to establish for several reasons: several countries in the region do not break out Kurdish population in their censuses; competing political agendas seek to either maximize or minimize the size of the Kurdish population; different counting methods may include or exclude groups such as [[Zazas]]; both Iraq and Syria have suffered war and civil disturbance in recent years; and high population growth among Kurdish communities means that figures become outdated quickly.

The figures below are the best recent estimates available from apparently independent sources.

*Turkey: Research in 2010 indicated a population of 13.26 million Kurds living in Turkey, 18.3% of the overall population of 72.553 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Kürt Meselesini Yeniden Düşenmek |trans-title= |language=tr |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2010_12_KONDA_Kurt_Meselesini_Yeniden_Dusunmek.pdf |publisher=Konda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Marie Bennigsen-Broxup''' (1944 – 7 December 2012) was a leading [[Europe]]an expert on the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]], with particular emphasis on [[Muslim]] communities within these regions. She pioneered an area studies focus on the former Soviet south, founding new research publications dedicated to these regions, and later becoming active in advocacy for the post-Soviet Chechen leadership in the 1990s.

She was born in Paris in 1944, the daughter of the [[Russia]]n émigré  scholar of [[Islam]], [[Alexandre Bennigsen]]. Bennigsen joined the Society for ''Central Asian Studies'' in [[Oxford]] in 1981 and founded the [[London]]-based [[Central Asian Survey]] quarterly soon afterwards. She also edited ''Central Asia and Caucasus Chronicle'' from 1981 to 1990, and served as a consultant on Caucasian affairs to the French ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs.

In 1983 Bennigsen published ''The Islamic Threat to the Soviet State'', co-authored with her father. The Bennigsens’ study hypothesised that unruly Muslim nationalities could come to constitute a major threat to the Soviet Union, a view achieving wide popularity among Sovietologists in the 1980s. It was in the North Caucasus, however, that this prediction would eventually ring truest, and in particular, in Chechnya. Bennigsen first travelled to Chechnya and neighbouring Dagestan in 1992, just after the Soviet collapse and as Chechnya was embarking on a path towards separation from Russia. She became a close associate of the Chechen leadership, engaging in international advocacy for their cause, as well as numerous charitable causes for relief to the population of [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astudiof.it/ccharm/present_ccharm.pdf Children of Chechnya Action Relief Mission].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998–1999 Bennigsen conducted interviews with 20 Chechen field commanders and staff officers, including Aslan Maskhadov, the mastermind of the Chechen victory over Russian forces in the first Chechen war, later elected president of the republic in 1997 and assassinated by Russian special forces in 2005.

Marie Bennigsen died in December 2012 after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waynakh.com/eng/2012/12/in-memory-of-marie-bennigsen-broxup/&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by her husband Michael Broxup and their two sons.

'''Mayanism''' is a non-codified eclectic collection of [[New Age]] beliefs, influenced in part by [[Pre-Columbian]]  [[Maya mythology]] and some folk beliefs of the modern [[Maya peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoopes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adherents of this belief system are not to be confused with [[Mayanist]]s, scholars who research the historical [[Maya civilization]].

Contemporary Mayanism places less emphasis on contacts between the ancient Maya and [[lost lands]] than in the work of early writers such as [[Godfrey Higgins]], [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], alluding instead to possible contacts with [[extraterrestrial life]].  However, it continues to include references to [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2009|pp=304–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notions about extraterrestrial influence on the Maya can be traced to the book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' by [[Erich von Däniken]], whose [[ancient astronaut theories]] were in turn influenced by the work of [[Peter Kolosimo]] and especially the team of [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]], authors of ''[[Le Matin des magiciens]]''. These latter writers were inspired by the [[fantasy]] literature of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]&lt;ref&gt;Colavito 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and publications by [[Charles Fort]].  However, there remain elements of fascination with [[lost lands|lost continents]] and lost civilizations, especially as popularized by 19th century [[science fiction]] and [[speculative fiction]] by authors such as [[Jules Verne]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], and [[H. Rider Haggard]].

Mayanism experienced a revival in the 1970s through the work of [[Frank Waters]], a writer on the subject of [[Hopi]] mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waters|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Book of the Hopi'' is rejected "as largely ersatz by Hopi traditionalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Paper |first= Jordan |title= Native North American Religious Traditions: Dancing for Life |year= 2006 |publisher= Praeger |isbn= 978-0275990978 |page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Waters was the recipient of a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant to support research in Mexico and Central America.  This resulted in his 1975 book ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness,'' a discussion of [[Mesoamerica]]n culture strongly colored by Waters' beliefs in [[astrology]], [[prophecy]], and the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].{{sfn|Waters|1975}}  It has gained new momentum in the context of the [[2012 phenomenon]], especially as presented in the work of [[New Age]] author [[John Major Jenkins]], who asserts that Mayanism is "the essential core ideas or teachings of Maya religion and philosophy" in his 2009 book ''The 2012 Story: The Myths, Fallacies, and Truth Behind the Most Intriguing Date in History.''{{sfn|Jenkins|2009}}

Mayanism has gained renewed vigor due to [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] nonfiction by authors such as [[Erich von Däniken]], [[Zecharia Sitchin]], and [[Graham Hancock]], whose theories range from invoking [[ancient astronauts]] and other [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] from outer space to revivals of the idea that ancient peoples from [[lost lands]] brought wisdom and technology to the Mayas. The implication of this is that the Mayas had access to aspects of ancient knowledge, spiritualism, philosophy, and religion that are useful for coping with the modern world, whether by avoiding [[Armageddon]], embracing a mystical [[Apocalypse]], or constructing a future [[Utopia]].

Mayanism has a complex history that draws from many different sources on the fringes of mainstream [[archaeology]].  It has gained growing attention through its influence on [[popular culture]] through [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy literature]], and more recently [[Film|cinema]], [[graphic novels]], [[fantasy]] [[role-playing games]] (especially [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]), and [[video games]].  It has also drawn inspiration from the success of ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'' by [[James Redfield]], a novel that refers to the fictional discovery of a Pre-Columbian [[self-help]] manuscript in South America.

Mayanism has been promoted by specific publishing houses, most notably [[Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company]], which has produced a number of books on the theme of 2012 by authors such as [[José Argüelles]], [[John Major Jenkins]], [[Carl Johan Calleman]], and Barbara Hand Clow.  [[Tarcher|Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc.]] has published works by New Age authors [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] and [[John Major Jenkins]] that have further contributed to a growing interest in Mayanism.

==History==
Mayanism can be traced to sources such as the sixteenth-century book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' by [[Sir Thomas More]], who developed the concept of a [[utopia]] in the New World (an idea first explored by [[Christopher Columbus]] in his 1501 [[Book of Prophecies]]). During the eighteenth century, speculations about the origins of ancient [[Maya civilization]] sought to associate Maya history with Biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], the [[Tower of Babel]], and the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel. This included speculation about legendary culture heroes such as [[Votan]] and [[Quetzalcoatl]].

In the early nineteenth century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Lord Kingsborough]] contributed further to such speculation. Humboldt and Kingsborough were in turn cited by [[Godfrey Higgins]], whose ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' (1833) contributed to the emergence of [[perennial philosophy]] and claims that all religions had a common, ancient origin in a [[Golden Age]] of the distant past.

In the late nineteenth-century, [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] made significant academic contributions (including re-discovery of the [[Popol Vuh]]), but towards the end of his career became convinced that the ancient Maya culture could be traced to the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].  For example, in 1857 Brasseur identified [[Votan]] as a [[Phoenicia]]n ruler who founded [[Palenque]] and in an article published in 1872 attributed mythological Mesoamerican cataclysms to an early version of [[pole shift theory]]. Brasseur's work, some of which was illustrated by the talented but very inaccurate [[Jean-Frédéric Waldeck]], influenced other works of [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]], such as the research of [[Désiré Charnay]], [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], and [[James Churchward]].  Le Plongeon and Donnelly in turn influenced the work of writers such as [[Madame Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/colemansources1895.htm |title=The Sources of Madame Blavatsky's Writings|first= William Emmette |last= Coleman |publisher=Blavatskyarchives.com |accessdate=2012-06-17}} Originally published in {{cite book |title= A Modern Priestess of Isis |last= Solovyoff |first= Vsevolod Sergyeevich |year= 1895 |location= London |publisher= [[Longman]] |chapter= Appendix C |pages= 353–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; who brought misconceptions about the ancient Maya into early New Age circles.{{sfn|Washington|1993}}  These ideas became part of a belief system fostered by psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] in the early twentieth century and later popularized in the 1960s by author [[Jess Stearn]].  One example of early Mayanism is the creation of a group called the Mayan Temple by Harold D. Emerson of Brooklyn, a self-proclaimed Maya ''priest'' who edited a serial publication titled ''The Mayan, Devoted to Spiritual Enlightenment and Scientific Religion'' between 1933 and 1941.{{sfn|Thompson|1970|p=170}}  Attempts at a synthesis of religion and science, a common theme in Mayanism, are one of the contributions from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] while Emerson would be an early example of a [[plastic shaman]] in Mayanism.

==Basic beliefs==
Since Mayanism is used to refer to a diverse collection of beliefs, it has no central doctrine.  However, a basic premise is that the ancient Maya understood aspects of the human experience and human consciousness that remain poorly understood in modern [[Western culture]].  This includes insights into [[cosmology]] and [[eschatology]] as well as lost knowledge of advanced technology and [[ecology]] that, when known, can be used to improve the human condition and create a future Utopia.  However, as a New Age belief system, Mayanism scorns academic scholarship, giving preference to knowledge gained through [[revelation]] and [[prophecy]] and to [[traditional knowledge]] (or what is imagined to be traditional knowledge).  Mayanism literature frequently features beliefs and theories that ignore and reject physical evidence, facts, or knowledge, particularly when that evidence supports the academic ''Mayanist'' theories that contradict ''Mayanism's'' beliefs.  As a result, the beliefs of Mayanism tend to be characterized by a combination of [[esotericism]] and [[syncretism]], rather than being the result of either formal controlled field research or detailed scholarly research that has been based on a broad range of primary sources.

==December 21, 2012==
{{See also|2012 phenomenon}}
The significance of this date in Mayanism stems from the ending of the current ''[[baktun]]'' cycle of the [[Maya calendar]] in 2012, which many believe will create a global "consciousness shift" and the beginning of a new age.  This has come to be known as the [[2012 phenomenon]].  Speculation about this date can be traced to the first edition of ''The Maya'' (1966) by [[Michael D. Coe]], in which he suggested the date of December 24, 2011 as one on which the Maya believed "Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation.".{{sfn|Coe|1966}}  This date became the subject of speculation by [[Frank Waters]], who devotes two chapters to its interpretation, including discussion of an astrological chart for this date and its association with Hopi prophecies in ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness'' (1975).{{sfn|Waters|1975}}  The significance of the year 2012 (but not a specific day) was mentioned briefly by [[José Argüelles]] in ''The Transformative Vision: Reflections on the Nature and History of Human Expression'' (1975){{sfn|Argüelles|1975}} and (without reference to the ancient Maya) by [[Terence McKenna]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching'' (1975).{{sfn|McKenna &amp; McKenna|1975}}

Waters' book inspired further speculation in the mid-1980s, including revision of the date by the McKennas, Argüelles, and [[John Major Jenkins]] to one corresponding with the winter [[solstice]] in 2012.  Interpretations of the date became the subject of further speculation by [[José Argüelles]] in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology'' (1987), promoted for the 1987 [[Harmonic Convergence]]. It received further elaboration in the [[Novelty theory]] of [[Terence McKenna]].  The supposed prediction of an [[astronomical conjunction]] of the [[black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy with the winter [[solstice]] [[Sun]] on December 21, 2012, referred to by Jenkins in ''Maya Cosmogenesis 2012: The True Meaning of the Maya Calendar End-Date'' (1998){{sfn|Jenkins|1998}} and ''Galactic Alignment:The Transformation of Consciousness According to Mayan, Egyptian, and Vedic Traditions'' (2002){{sfn|Jenkins|2002}} as having been predicted by the ancient Maya and others, is a much-anticipated event in Mayanism. Although Jenkins suggests that ancient Maya knowledge of this event was based on observations of the "[[dark rift]]" in the Milky Way as seen from Earth (this ''dark rift'', it is said by some Mayan scholars, was believed by some Mayans to be one of the entrances to [[Xibalba]]), others see it as evidence of knowledge imparted via [[ancient astronaut theories|ancient contact with extraterrestrial intelligence]]. The relevance of modern "dark rift" observations to Pre-Columbian and traditional Maya beliefs is strongly debated, and academic archaeologists reject all theories regarding extraterrestrial contact, but it is clear that the promotion of Mayanism through interest in 2012 is contributing to the evolution of religious [[syncretism]] in contemporary Maya communities.  [[Psychonaut]] author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized [[New Age]] concepts about this date, linking it to beliefs about [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[entheogens]] and [[mediumship]] in his 2006 book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl''.{{sfn|Pinchbeck|2006}}

[[Carl Johan Calleman]] differs in that he sees 28 October 2011 and not 21 December 2012 as the pivotal end date. Calleman does not see the date as an apocalypse but a slow transformation of consciousness with people beginning to experience a higher 'unity consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.exopolitik.org/wissen/zukunftswissenschaften/bewusstsein/641-mayakalender-ausblick-auf-den-fuenften-tag-der-neunten-unterweltMaya |title=

==Mayanism, shamanism, and "Toltecs"==
[[Shamanism]] has become a significant component of Mayanism, in part due to the scholarly interpretation of ancient Maya rulers as shamans and the popularity of [[Carlos Castaneda]], whose books described his apprenticeship to a [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. However, Castaneda's work is seen as being fictional, inaccurate, misleading, and [[plagiarism|plagiaristic]], and there is no proof that don Juan (the sorcerer) is not a fictional character.{{sfn|de Mille|1976}}{{sfn|de Mille|1980}} Although the Yaqui are indigenous to the [[Sonoran Desert]] region of northern Mexico and southern Arizona, far from the Maya region, Mayanism often conflates the concept of [[Toltec (Castaneda)]] with the [[Toltec]] who interacted with the ancient Maya.  This stems from 19th century speculations by Brasseur and Charnay about the Toltecs as a white, [[Aryan race]] that brought advanced civilization to the Americas either through a migration from Asia across the Bering Strait (according to Charnay) or emigration from the lost continent of Atlantis (according to Brasseur).{{sfn|Evans|2004}}

On 13 February 2017, [[Jamaat-ul-Ahrar]] released a video announcing the launch of "Operation Ghazi", named after [[Abdul Rashid Ghazi]] who was killed in July 2007 inside the [[Lal Masjid, Islamabad|Lal Masjid]].&lt;ref name="pakistantoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/02/14/jamaat-ul-ahrar-gives-details-of-its-targets-in-a-video/ |title=Jamaat-ul-Ahrar gives details of its targets in a video |publisher=Pakistan Today |date= |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation started with the [[February 2017 Lahore suicide bombing|suicide bombing at]] [[The Mall, Lahore|the Mall]], in which 12 civilians and six police officers were killed.&lt;ref name="paktoday"/&gt;

In the video, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar stated that its future targets would be legislative bodies [[Pakistan Army]], intelligence agencies and supporting institutions; interest-based economic institutions; INGOs/NGOs and civil society organisations involved in the advocacy of human rights, women's rights and community awareness campaigns; liberal writers, political leaders and workers; media persons; and coeducational private schools, colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="pakistantoday1"/&gt;

''The Centrum Media'' released a video statement from [[Abdul Rashid Ghazi]]'s son, Haroon Rasheed Ghazi, addressing Jamaatul Ahrar. "We should come up with a political solution. This bloodshed is not in the interest of anyone. Our stance is very clear; we do not endorse any violent activities," he said.

==Operation Radd ul Fasaad==
On 22 February 2017, in response to the Operation Ghazi, [[Pakistan Army]] launched [[Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad]] (lit.

[[File:Tights (hosiery) panty overview.jpg|thumb|250px|Pantyhose brief styles: control-top, sheer-to-waist and simple-panty sections]]

'''Pantyhose''', called [[sheer (textile)|sheer]] [[tights]] in the United Kingdom and a few other countries, are close-fitting [[legwear]] covering the wearer's body from the waist to the toes. Mostly considered to be a [[garment]] for women and girls, pantyhose appeared in the 1960s {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} as a convenient alternative to [[stocking]]s and/or [[panties|control panties]] (which, in turn, replaced [[girdle]]s).

Like stockings or [[knee highs]], pantyhose are usually made of [[nylon]], or of other fibers blended with nylon. Pantyhose are designed to:
* Be attractive in appearance,
* Hide physical features such as blemishes, bruises, scars, hair, [[spider veins]], or [[varicose veins]],
* Reduce [[Panty line|visible panty lines]],&lt;ref name="Glen Raven 1"&gt;[[Glen Raven, Inc.]]: Turnpage advertisement "How do gals get this sleek bell bottom look without the bumps of garters and panties?'' - ''They don't wear any. They wear Glen Raven Panti-Legs in Cantrece.", USA, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Ease chafing between feet and [[footwear]], or between thighs.

Besides being worn as fashion, in Western society pantyhose are sometimes worn by women as part of [[formal dress]]. Also, the [[dress code]] of some companies and schools may require pantyhose or fashion tights to be worn when [[skirt]]s or [[shorts]] are worn as part of a [[uniform]].

==Terminology==
The term "pantyhose" originated in the United States and refers to the combination of ''[[panties]]'' (an [[American English]] term) with sheer nylon ''[[hosiery]]''. In British English, these garments are called "sheer [[tights]]". The term tights alone refers to all such garments regardless of whether they are sheer lingerie or sturdy outerwear.

In American English, the term "[[tights]]" typically refers to pantyhose-like garments made from thicker material, which are generally opaque or slightly translucent. Opaque leg wear made of material such as [[spandex]] are often worn by both sexes for athletic activities or as utility clothing, and are usually referred to as "[[leggings]]", a term that includes casual wear.  The primary difference between tights and leggings is that leggings can be worn as outerwear, whereas tights are not. In most cases, leggings will have a seam on the inside of the leg, whereas the legs of tights will be seamless.

==History==
The history of pantyhose, as for stockings, is tied to that of changes in styles of women's [[hemline]]s. Before the 1920s, it was generally expected that women would cover their legs in public, including their ankles; and dress and skirt hemlines were generally to the ground. The main exceptions were in sports and entertainment. In the 1920s, fashionable hemlines for women began to rise, exposing the legs to just below the knees. Stockings also came into vogue to maintain leg coverage, as well as some level of warmth. The most popular stockings were sheer hosiery which were first made of [[silk]] or [[rayon]] (then known as "artificial silk"), and after 1940 of nylon, which had been invented by [[DuPont]] in 1938. During the 1940s and 1950s, stage and film producers would sew stockings to the briefs of their actresses and dancers, as testified to by singer-actress-dancer [[Ann Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Robert Osborne|Osborne, Robert]] (host)|date= August 20, 1997|title= Private Screenings: Ann Miller|format= Television production|publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panty and Hose Miller"&gt;{{cite web|title =Private screenings: Ann Miller|url = http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/72685%7C0/Private-Screenings-Ann-Miller.html|deadurl= no|accessdate=2016-07-02|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023052541/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/72685%7C0/Private-Screenings-Ann-Miller.html|archivedate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These garments were seen in popular motion pictures such as [[Daddy Long Legs (1955 film)|''Daddy Long Legs'']].

In 1953, Allen Gant, Sr., of [[Glen Raven, Inc.|Glen Raven Knitting Mills]] developed a commercial equivalent to these hose that he named "Panti-Legs", but these were not brought  to the open market until about 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gant|first= Margaret Elizabeth|title= The Raven's Story|publisher=[[Glen Raven, Inc.]]|year=1979|location= Glen Raven, North Carolina|isbn=0-9603138-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Ernest G. Rice invented his own design for pantyhose similar to those worn today, and in 1956 he submitted a patent titled "Combination Stockings and Panty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=2826760|title=Combination Stockings and Panty|gdate=March 18, 1958|fdate=November 9, 1956|inventor=Ernest G. Rice}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was adopted by other makers, and this caused disputes in U.S. courts for many years before the patent was upheld some time after Rice's own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Tights, Inc. v. Acme-McCrary Corporation|vol=541|reporter=F.2d|opinion=1047|court=4th Cir.|date=1976|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/541/1047/139079/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until this time, there was little reason for women outside show business to wear "panty hose", as the longer hemlines allowed for the use of over-the-knee stockings secured with a [[garter belt]]. Nonetheless, during the 1960s, improved [[textile manufacturing]] processes made pantyhose increasingly more affordable, while man-made textiles such as [[spandex]] (or elastane) made them more comfortable and durable. The advent of the fashionable [[miniskirt]], which exposed the legs to well above the knee, made pantyhose a necessity to many women. In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and it has remained so ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=C. Roland|title=Business Policy: Text and Cases|publisher= R.D. Irwin|year= 1982|isbn=0-256-02626-2|page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantyhose became a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

[[File:Tights vending machine.jpg|thumb|Pantyhose vending machine at [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney]], Australia]]

From 1995 a steady decline began, leveling off in 2006 with U.S. sales less than half of what they had once been. This decline has been attributed to [[bare legs]] in fashion, changes in [[Dress code#Work place|workplace dress code]], and the increased popularity of trousers.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite web |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2007-01-01-pantyhose-usat_x.htm|title= Hope for sagging pantyhose sales?|first= Laura|last= Petrecca|date= January 1, 2007|publisher= ''[[USA Today]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102080839/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2007-01-01-pantyhose-usat_x.htm|archivedate= November 2, 2012|deadurl= no|quote= Pantyhose can feel like a tourniquet, and once a pair gets a snag, it usually has to be tossed. Going without discomfort costing from a few dollars to more than $40 a pair was a trend many women were happy to embrace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sales of traditional styles did not recover, the 2000s saw the rise of other specific styles.  [[Fishnet]] hose, patterns and colors, opaque tights, [[low-rise (fashion)|low-rise]] pantyhose, footless [[shapewear]], and [[pantyhose for men]] (playfully referred to as "mantyhose") all experienced increased sales. In the 2010s, an increasing popularity for form-fitting opague leggings paired with casual dress (and even some officewear) supplanted the fashion role previously held by pantyhose, although pantyhose remain popular as pair of formalwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Wellington|first= Elizabeth|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2008051494_pantyhose15.html|title= Pantyhose, once a fashion must, is on its last legs

==Composition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Pantyhose generally have a standard construction: the top of the waist is a strong elastic; the part covering the hips and the buttocks (the panty area) is composed of a thicker material than for the legs. The [[gusset]] or crotch covering the vagina is a stronger material, sometimes made of porous [[cotton]], but the legs of the pantyhose are made of the thinnest usable fabrics, and it has a consistent construction down to the wearer's toes. These can be reinforced to guard against wear and tear.

Most pantyhose are composed of nylon and a mixture of spandex, which provides the elasticity and form-fitting that is characteristic of modern pantyhose. The nylon fabric is somewhat prone to tearing ("running"), and it is common for very sheer hose to "run" soon after snagging on anything that is rough or sharp.

Variations in pantyhose construction exist, such as with [[fishnet]] pantyhose. Pantyhose may be composed of other materials such as silk, cotton, or [[wool]].

==Styles==
[[File:Legs in london.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fishnet pantyhose]]
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Pantyhose are available in a wide range of popular styles. The sheerness of the garment, expressed as a numerical "[[Denier (measure)|denier]]"/'dtex", ranges from three (extremely rare, very thin, barely visible) up to 15 (standard sheer), 30 (semi opaque) and finally 100 (opaque). 

Control-top pantyhose, intended to boost a slimmer figure, has a reinforced-panty section. The panty section may be visible when wearing short skirts or shorts.

Sheer-to-waist pantyhose is sheer throughout, with the panty portion being the same thickness and color as the leg portion, and are designed for use with high-slit gowns, miniskirts, hot pants, or lingerie. Often sheer-to-waist pantyhose will be reinforced along and on either side of the seam in the middle of the panty.

Open-crotch pantyhose, sometimes known as crotchless pantyhose, do not have a gusset. Instead, an opening is in place for hygiene or sexual-fetishism activities.

Some pantyhose have single- or double-panel gussets incorporated into them. In single-panel, there are two seams instead of the usual one, with a single seam on the opposite side; with double-panel gussets, there are two seams on either side.

==Concerns==
The disadvantages of pantyhose includes:
* Unlike cotton, nylon is not an absorbent material. As a result, perspiration is more likely to remain in contact with the feet, legs and genital area, thereby encouraging bacterial growth and associated odor. Some hosiery products contain silver to help prevent odor and sweating of the feet, thus making the wearing of hosiery a more pleasant experience. Wearing natural fiber silk stockings and tights is another means of reducing perspiration.
* Some women do not wear pantyhose for environmental reasons, noting that they usually cannot be recycled, and nylon pantyhose are not biodegradable. Disposing of the item contributes to overuse of landfill. Burning nylon pantyhose sometimes releases toxins into the atmosphere. 
This used to be the case but in the UK, local authorities accept clean, dry textiles along with other recyclables. This is both at recycling centres and curb-side collections. Textiles (including tights, pantyhose and stockings) which cannot be re-worn are recycled and turned into things like roofing felt. There are several internet sites which explain ways of reusing pantyhose (laddered or otherwise).
* Pantyhose have been criticized for being flimsy because the thin knit fabric is prone to tearing or laddering (or "running").&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; The wearer can cause a run in the hose by catching a toenail in the fabric when the hose is put on, by catching it on a rough surface like a corner of a desk, or a car, and by numerous other risks. Some women apply clear [[nail polish]] or [[hair spray]] to their hose to prevent runs from growing.

==Pantyhose for men==
{{main article|Pantyhose for men}}
While usually considered to be a woman's garment, pantyhose can also be worn by men, for example for thermal protection, therapeutic relief or simply as a lifestyle choice. Race horse jockeys may wear pantyhose under their uniform to enable them to glide freely over the legs and waist when the jockey's body moves at a rapid pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/8860806/Diary-Warwick-racecourse-stage-remembrance-day-for-gentleman-George-Mernagh.html|title= Diary: Warwick racecourse stage remembrance day for gentleman George Mernagh|first= Marcus|last= Armytage|date= October 31, 2011|location= London|publisher= ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120101102933/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/8860806/Diary-Warwick-racecourse-stage-remembrance-day-for-gentleman-George-Mernagh.html|archivedate= January 1, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 31, 2013|quote= It is one of the curiosities of racing that, to a man, jockeys go out to ride wearing that most feminine of undergarments; ladies nylon tights.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fishermen who surf fish from tropical beaches may wear pantyhose for protection from [[jellyfish]] whose stingers are triggered by contact with a chemical on bare skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/box-jellyfish|title=Box Jellyfish, Box Jellyfish Pictures, Box Jellyfish Facts - National Geographic|location= Washington, D.C.|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chesapeakebay.net/bfg_jellyfish.aspx?menuitem=14426|title= Jellyfish&amp;nbsp;— Bay Field Guide&amp;nbsp;— Chesapeake Bay Program|publisher= Chesapeakebay.net|date= n.d.|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130814000306/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/fieldguide/critter/jellyfish|archivedate= August 14, 2013|deadurl= yes|accessdate= June 6, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.reefed.edu.au/home/explorer/animals/marine_invertebrates/corals_and_jellyfish/jellyfish|title= Jellyfish |publisher= Reefed.edu.au|date= n.d.|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130514234112/http://www.reefed.edu.au/home/explorer/animals/marine_invertebrates/corals_and_jellyfish/jellyfish|archivedate= May 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, several manufacturers introduced pantyhose styles designed for men to cater to this niche market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1014067498437122120|title= Kingsize, Not Queen: Some Men Have Taken To Wearing Pantyhose|first= Kevin|last= Helliker|date= February 19, 2002|publisher= ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160429003654/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1014067498437122120|archivedate= April 29, 2016|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Earl McCauley''', often known as '''Pat McCauley''' (June 30, 1927 &amp;ndash; April 12, 2015), was an American [[journalist]] who from 1966 to 1994 was the editor of ''[[The Huntsville Times]]'' in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. No other editor of ''The Huntsville Times'' served longer than did McCauley.

==Background==

After graduation from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], McCauley moved in 1949 to Huntsville in far northern Alabama, where he worked for five years as a [[Journalist|reporter]] in the old Times Building at Green and Clinton streets under editor Reese Thomas Amis.&lt;ref name=att/&gt;

==Career==

McCauley arrived in Huntsville a few months before the [[Space Age]] and [[Wernher von Braun]]. McCauley was assigned to cover [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison County]] and Huntsville municipal affairs and the adjacent south [[Tennessee]] area. He reported on the [[boll weevil]] destroying [[cotton]] plants, labor discord in [[textile]] mills where workers received extremely low wages, the transformation  of the [[Redstone Arsenal]] from a conventional and chemical weapons center to the assembling of  rockets and missiles, the rebuilding of the Huntsville [[infrastructure]], and the formation of the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]]. He also covered the activities of [[U.S. Senator]] [[John Sparkman]] of Huntsville, the chairman of [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and the author of [[public housing]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Sparkman]] ran for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]] with [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson, II]], opposite the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]-[[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] slate. Stevenson-Sparkman won Alabama's then eleven [[electoral vote]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; A Madison County [[sheriff]], Oliver McPeters, was [[Impeachment|impeached]] in 1953. A new murder case, often unsolved, became an almost common occurrence in Huntsville.&lt;ref name=huntsvilleobit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.al.com/obituaries/huntsville/obituary.aspx?pid=174632885|title=Patrick Earl McCauley|work=[[The Huntsville Times]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he became the assistant director of the Southern Education Reporting Service, based in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, and financed by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=pemc/&gt; In this capacity he edited the journal ''Southern School News,'' advised researchers and journalists regarding [[Segregation in the United States|school desegregation]], and wrote two books on educational topics. His ''With All Deliberate Speed'', published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Row]],  is  a collection of [[essay]]s assessing the three years following the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas]]'' of May 17, 1954. The title is taken from a phrase in the court ruling regarding the timetable of desegregation. His other book, ''Southern Schools: Progress and Problems,'' is a statistical study of Southern education between 1947 and 1957.&lt;ref name=att&gt;{{cite news|title=Patrick McCauley|date=April 16, 2015|work=[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Nashville, McCauley obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]] from [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref name=pemc/&gt; 
 
In 1959, he returned to newspaper work for the ''[[Charlotte News]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], and in 1960 for ''[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]''.&lt;ref name=pemc/&gt; There, he was director of the New Orleans Jazz Club and edited its journal, ''The Second Line''. After six years in New Orleans, where he had engaged in work toward a [[Ph.D.]] at Tulane, he returned to Huntsville to accept the editorship there.&lt;ref name=att/&gt; The city of 16,000 in 1950 had grown through vast [[annexation]] to 140,000 by the middle 1960s. During his long tenure  at ''The Huntsville Times'', the publication grew from 40,000 to 65,000 in daily circulation, with 80,000 on Sundays.&lt;ref name=pemc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamapress.org/advertising_anas/|title=Patrick Earl McCauley|publisher=Alabama Press Association|author=Emily Featherston|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 17, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522072008/http://www.alabamapress.org/advertising_anas/|archivedate=May 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then housed in a new  plant on South Memorial Parkway, ''The Times'' was known in particular for coverage of [[civil rights]] issues and activities of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. As editor, he soon faced the horror of the [[Apollo I]] capsule fire on January 27, 1967, that claimed the lives of [[astronaut]]s [[Gus Grissom]], [[Roger B. Chaffee]], and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]. [[Saturn V]] was underway from 1966 to 1973; the moon landing was less than three years away. [[Boeing]] left and returned to operate in  Huntsville.&lt;ref name=huntsvilleobit/&gt;

In 2012, long after McCauley's retirement, ''The Huntsville Times'' faced  declining revenue and subscriptions and reduced daily publication to three times per week. Coincidentally, the same kind of changes for identical reasons impacted McCauley's former employer, ''The New Orleans Times-Picayune.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/al/2012/05/alabama_media_group_a_new_digi.html|date=May 24, 2012|title=Alabama Media Group, a new digitally focused company, will launch this fall with expanded online coverage and enhanced three-day-a-week newspapers|publisher=al.com|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

McCauley was a board member for thirty years and a president of the board of the [[Huntsville Symphony Orchestra]]. He was active in the Huntsville Literary Association and sat on the governing boards of the local Arts Council and the Historic Huntsville Foundation.&lt;ref name=pemc/&gt; He was a contributing author to the ''Historic Huntsville Quarterly of Local Architecture and Preservation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyconnections.info/hh/hhpics/pdf/hhq2/HHQ-Vol-XXXI-34-FalWin05.pdf|title=Historic Huntsville Quarterly of Local Architecture and Preservation|publisher=historyconnections.info|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCauley served on the ethics committee of Huntsville Hospital and the Liberal Arts Advisory Committee at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]]. He was president of the parish council of [[St. Mary of the Visitation Catholic Church (Huntsville, Alabama)|St. Mary of the Visitation]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] in Huntsville. At the time of his retirement, McCauley was the vice president of the Alabama Press Association and was slated as its president for 1994-1995. He served on the APA board for twenty years, in which position he was involved in a campaign to improve journalism education. He was active too in the [[American Society of News Editors]].&lt;ref name=pemc/&gt; He often entertained friends at his home and mastered [[Cajun cuisine]].&lt;ref name=att/&gt;

McCauley died at the age of eighty-seven in Huntsville. Among his survivors was a cousin, Emile Peter Oestriecher, III (born November 1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Home/Home?uid=3643435|title=Emile Oestriecher, November 1938|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Alexandria, Louisiana. After Catholic services at his church, he was interred alongside is wife, the former Imogene Morgan (1924&amp;ndash;2004), at Eva Cemetery in her native [[Eva, Alabama|Eva]] south of Huntsville in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]], Alabama.&lt;ref name=att/&gt;

She co-authored a biography on the French impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] and was a well-known contemporary art critic.

== Life and work ==
Paula Fish was an only child, born in Scituate, [[Massachusetts]], who grew up in Philadelphia. In her 20s she moved to New York City, where she was a dancer with the modern dance company [[Munt-Brooks]] (later known as "[[Alfred Brooks (dancer)|The Changing Scene]]" dance).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After a dance-related injury she decided to study art history at [[Hunter College]] in New York and earned her bachelor's and master's degree. In 1976 she earned her PhD in art history from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harper was married twice and never had children; she preferred using her two married names "Hays Harper" because of a dislike of her maiden name.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Harper was "instrumental" in the establishment of the [[Feminist Art Program]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paula Harper Memorial|last=Shabaka|first=Onajide|date=12 August 2012|publisher=[[Examiner.com]] (Miami)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper is credited with conceiving [[Womanhouse]], a 1972 art installation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelan|first=Peggy|title=Live Art in LA: Performance in Southern California, 1970-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaoZSpldJZ8C&amp;pg=PA38|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415684224|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.stanford.edu/women-art-revolution/transcript-interview-miriam-schapiro-1990|title=Transcript of Interview with Miriam Schapiro 1990 |last=Hershman|first=Lynn|date=30 May 1990|work=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the biggest and most celebrated exhibitions of art by and about women ever assembled".&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

In 1981 Paula Hays Harper collaborated with Ralph E. Shikes on a comprehensive biography of the 19th-century French Impressionist Camille Pissarro.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She taught at the [[University of Miami]] from 1983 until her retirement in 2011.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html?_r=0|title=Paula Hays Harper, Art Historian, Is Dead at 81|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=25 June 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped shape the Miami art scene and was a regular contributor and art critic in [[Art in America]] magazine and [[The Miami News]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{redirect|Post-medieval|the period of European history following the Middle Ages|Renaissance}}
'''Post-medieval archaeology''' is a term used in Europe to describe the study of the material past over the last 500 years. Increasingly the field is referred to as [[Historical archaeology]], a term in international usage. It is closely related to [[Industrial archaeology]], although [[post-medieval]] archaeology conventionally has not extended its studies past the mid 18th century. Such a 'cut-off' date is increasingly critiqued by work within [[historical archaeology]] and [[contemporary archaeology]].

The traditional date for the beginning of the post-medieval period in Britain has been 1485 when, following the [[Battle of Bosworth]] the [[Tudor dynasty]] took the throne. In practice, the medieval period is now often extended into the reign of the Tudor monarchs and the boundary between the two eras is not precise. As with all attempts to divide the archaeological record into neat chunks, efforts to impose an exact date on the transition are doomed to be questioned by current and new findings.

Given the relatively strong historical record running alongside the archaeological one, post-medieval archaeology is often better positioned to study the effects of known social and political change. The immediacy of the period means that it appeals in fields such as [[genealogy]] as well as to students of [[social history]]. 

Post-medieval sites include [[Nonsuch Palace]] in [[Surrey]], [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose Theatre]] in [[London]] and [[Fort Amherst]] in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].

{{History of Australia}}

The '''prehistory of Australia''' is the period between the first human habitation of the Australian continent and the colonization of Australia in 1788, which marks the start of consistent documentation of Australia. This period is estimated to have lasted between 40,000 and 60,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html | title=Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? | date= 24 July 2003 | accessdate=2 November 2007 | publisher=stonepages.com, Paola Arosio &amp; Diego Meozzi }} – reporting on news in ''The West Australian (19 July 2003)''&lt;/ref&gt; or longer.

This era is referred as [[prehistory]] rather than history because there was no consistent written documentation of human events before 1788.  As no metal technology was developed, the whole period falls into the [[Stone Age]].  Australia, in contrast to [[New Guinea]], has generally been held not to have had a [[Neolithic]] period, with a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle continuing until the arrival of Europeans.  This view can be challenged in terms of the definition of [[agriculture]], but "Neolithic" remains a rarely-used and not very useful concept in discussing Australian prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;White, Peter, [http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/10.%20White.pdf "Revisiting the ‘Neolithic Problem’ in Australia" PDF], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yuval Noah Harari]] has argued that "[t]he journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history ... It was the first time any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system."

The earliest evidence of humans in Australia is at least 65,000 years old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarkson|first1=Chris|last2=Jacobs|first2=Zenobia|last3=Marwick|first3=Ben|last4=Fullagar|first4=Richard|last5=Wallis|first5=Lynley|last6=Smith|first6=Mike|last7=Roberts|first7=Richard G.|last8=Hayes|first8=Elspeth|last9=Lowe|first9=Kelsey|last10=Carah|first10=Xavier|last11=Florin|first11=S.

There is considerable discussion among archeologists as to the route taken by the first migrants to Australia, widely taken to be ancestors of the modern Aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;The dominant view among archaeologists and palaeoanthropologists is that the earliest humans in Australia were among the ancestors of modern Aborigines. There is some evidence to the contrary. For instance, among the [[Lake Mungo remains]], the mtDNA of the remains known as LM3 do not indicate a close relationship to modern Aborigines, according to "Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins" (PNAS, volume 98, issue 2) by Adcock et al. This finding has not been widely accepted by the palaeoanthropological community.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration took place during the closing stages of the [[Pleistocene]], when sea levels were much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended [[Glacier|glaciation]] during the Pleistocene [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] resulted in decreases of sea levels by more than 100 metres in Australasia.{{sfn|Harry Lourandos|1997|p=80}} People appear to have arrived by sea during a period of glaciation, when [[New Guinea]] and [[Tasmania]] were joined to the continent of Australia.

The continental coastline extended much further out into the [[Timor Sea]], and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as [[Australia (continent)|Sahul]]), connected by an extensive [[land bridge]] across the [[Arafura Sea]], [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and [[Torres Strait]]. Nevertheless, the sea still presented a major obstacle so it is theorised that these ancestral people reached Australia by island hopping.{{sfn|Harry Lourandos|1997|p=80}} Two routes have been proposed. One follows an island chain between [[Sulawesi]] and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via [[Timor]].{{sfn|Harry Lourandos|1997|p=81}} [[Rupert Gerritsen]] has suggested an alternative theory, involving accidental colonisation as a result of tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Gerritsen]] (2011) ''Beyond the Frontier: Explorations in Ethnohistory'', Batavia Online Publishing: Canberra, pp. 70–103. {{ISBN|978-0-9872141-4-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The journey still required sea travel however, making them amongst the world's earlier mariners.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Laidlaw  "Aboriginal Society before European settlement" in Tim Gurry (ed) (1984) ''The European Occupation.'' Heinemann Educational Australia, Richmond, p. 40. {{ISBN|0-85859-250-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Cane]] wrote in 2013 that the first wave may have been prompted by the [[Toba catastrophe theory|eruption of Toba]] and if they arrived around 70,000 years ago could have crossed the water from Timor, when the sea level was low - but if they came later, around 50,000 years ago, a more likely route would be through the Moluccas to New Guinea. Given that the likely landfall regions have been under around 50 metres of water for the last 15,000 years, it is unlikely that the timing will ever be established with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cane; ''First Footprints - the epic story of the first Australians''; Allen &amp; Unwin; 2013; {{ISBN|978 1 74331 493 7}}; pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum widely accepted timeframe for the arrival of humans in Australia is placed at least 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Hiscock, Peter. (2008). ''Archaeology of Ancient Australia''. Routledge: London. {{ISBN|0-415-33811-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many sites dating from this time period have been excavated.

This has been interpreted as representing human activity, but the dating of the evidence has been strongly challenged.{{sfn|Harry Lourandos|1997|p=88}}

Charles Dortch has identified chert and calcrete flake stone tools, found at [[Rottnest Island]] in Western Australia, as possibly dating to at least 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesp, Patrick A., Murray-Wallace, Colin V. and C. E. Dortch, (1999), "Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by Aspartic Acid Racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka" (Australian Archaeology, No. 49 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  This seems to tie in accurately with [[Uranium-thorium dating|U/Th]] and [[Carbon-14 dating|14C]] results of a flint tool found embedded in Tamala limestone (Aminozone C)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dortch, West Australian, 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as both mtDNA and Y chromosome studies on the genetic distance of Australian Aboriginal genomes from African and other Eurasian ones.

The sharing of animal and plant species between [[Australia-New Guinea]] and nearby [[Indonesia]]n islands is another consequence of the early land bridges, which closed when sea levels rose with the end of the last glacial period. The sea level stabilised to near its present levels about [[4th millennium BC|6,000 years ago]], flooding the land bridge between Australia and New Guinea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Waves of migration===
It is unknown how many populations settled in Australia prior to European colonisation. Both "trihybrid" and single-origin hypotheses have received extensive discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Pygmies%20Extinction.htm | last=Windschuttle | first=Keith | author2=Gillin, Tim | title=The extinction of the Australian pygmies | date=June 2002 | accessdate=2 November 2007 | publisher=Keith Windschuttle (The Sydney Line) | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729090807/http://www.sydneyline.com/Pygmies%20Extinction.htm | archivedate=29 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Keith Windschuttle]], known for his belief that Aboriginal pre-history has become [[politicised]], argues that the assumption of a single origin is tied into ethnic solidarity, and multiple entry was suppressed because it could be used to justify white seizure of Aboriginal lands.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, Keith "The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847", Macleay Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Genome Diversity Project|Human genomic]] differences are being studied to find possible answers, but there is still insufficient evidence to distinguish a "wave invasion model" from a "single settlement" one. Some Y chromosomal studies indicate a recent influx of Y chromosomes from the Indian subcontinent. A 2012 paper by Alan J. Redd et al. on this topic notes that the indicated influx period corresponds to the timing of various other changes, specifically mentioning "The divergence times reported here correspond with a series of changes in the Australian anthropological record between 5,000 years ago and 3,000 years ago, including the introduction of the dingo; the spread of the Australian Small Tool tradition; the appearance of plant-processing technologies, especially complex detoxification of cycads; and the expansion of the Pama-Nyungan language over seven-eighths of Australia."  Although previously linked to the [[pariah dogs]] of India, recent testing of the mitochondrial DNA of [[dingos]] shows a closer connection to the dogs of Eastern Asia and North America, suggesting an introduction as a result of the Austronesian expansion from Southern China to Timor over the last 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Savolainen,Thomas Leitner, Alan N. Wilton, Elizabeth Matisoo-Smith, and Joakim Lundeberg (2004),"A detailed picture of the origin of the Australian dingo, obtained from the study of mitochondrial DNA"(Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2004 Aug 17; 101(33): 12387–12390.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent finding of kangaroo ticks on the pariah dogs of Thailand further suggests that this genetic expansion may have been a two-way process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/zdownload/papers/CurrentBiology.pdf | title = Gene Flow from the Indian Subcontinent to Australia: Evidence from the Y Chromosome | author1 = Alan J.

==Advent of fire farming and megafauna extinctions==
Archaeological evidence from ash deposits in the [[Coral Sea]] indicates that fire was already a significant part of the Australian landscape over 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Robin L. (1983), "Pollen and Charcoal Evidence for the Effects of Aboriginal Burning on Vegetation in Australia" (Archaeology in Oceania, Vol. 18, No. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the last 70,000 years it became more frequent with one explanation being the use by hunter-gatherers as a tool to drive game, to produce a green flush of new growth to attract animals, and to open up impenetrable forest.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, Bill (2011) "The Biggest Estate on Earth (Allen and Unwin).&lt;/ref&gt; Gammage claims that dense forest became more open [[sclerophyll]] forest, open forest became grassland and fire-tolerant species became more predominant: in particular, [[eucalyptus]], [[acacia]], [[banksia]], [[casuarina]] and grasses.

[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago, as sea levels were rising, showing some of the human archaeological sites]]
The changes to the fauna were even more dramatic: the [[megafauna]], species significantly larger than humans, disappeared, and many of the smaller species disappeared too. All told, about 60 different vertebrates became extinct, including the [[Diprotodon]] family (very large marsupial herbivores that looked rather like hippos), several large flightless birds, carnivorous kangaroos, ''[[Wonambi naracoortensis]]'', a 5-metre snake, a five-metre lizard and ''[[Meiolania]]'', a tortoise the size of a small car.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R.G., Flannery, T et al (2001) "New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: continent wide extinction about 46,000 years ago" (Science, Vol. 292, 8 June 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct cause of the mass extinctions is uncertain: it may have been fire, hunting, climate change or a combination of all or any of these factors, although the rapid decline of many species is still a matter of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Wroe, S. &amp; Field, J. (2006) "A review of the evidence of the human role in the extinction of Australian megafauna and an alternative explanation" ([[Quaternary Science Reviews]], Vol. 25, No. 21-22, Nov 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; With no large herbivores to keep the understorey vegetation down and rapidly recycle soil nutrients with their dung, fuel build-up became more rapid and fires burned hotter, further changing the landscape.  Against this theory is the evidence that in fact careful seasonal fires from Aboriginal land management practices reduced fuel loads, and prevent wildfires like those seen since European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, Bill (2011), "The Biggest Estate of Earth" (Allen and Unwin).&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 18,000 to 15,000 years ago saw increased aridity of the continent with lower temperatures and less rainfall than currently prevails. Between 16,000 and 14,000 years BP the rate of sea level rise was most rapid rising about 15 metres in 300 years according to Peter D. Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Ward, p. 30, ''The Flooded Earth. Our Future in a World Without Ice Caps'', Basic Books, New York, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-465-00949-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Pleistocene, roughly 13,000 years ago, the [[Torres Strait]] connection, the Bassian Plain between modern-day [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], and the link from [[Kangaroo Island]] began disappearing under the rising sea.  Various Aboriginal groups seem to have preserved oral histories of the [[Flandrian]] sea level rise, in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] and Northern Australia and also in the isolation of [[Rottnest Island]] from the southwestern Western Australian coast 12,000 years ago.  The finding of a chert deposit in the strait between the island and the mainland, and the use of chert as a predominate rock in the lithic industries of the region, enables the date to be fairly well established.

From that time on, the [[Tasmanian Aborigines]] were geographically isolated. By 9,000 years ago small islands in [[Bass Strait]], as well as [[Kangaroo Island]] were no longer inhabited.

Linguistic and genetic evidence shows that there has been long-term contact between Australians in the far north and the [[Austronesian]] people of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but that this appears to have been mostly trade with a little intermarriage, as opposed to direct colonisation.  [[Makassar|Macassan]] [[Proa|praus]] are also recorded in the Aboriginal stories from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], and there were some semi-permanent settlements established, and cases of Aboriginal settlers finding a home in Indonesia.

==Culture and technology==
The last 5,000 years were characterised by a general amelioration of the climate and an increase in temperature and rainfall and the development of a sophisticated [[tribe|tribal social structure]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bern (1979) "Ideology and Domination: towards a reconstruction of Australian Aboriginal social formation" (Oceania, Vol. 50, No. 2, Dec 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The main items of trade were songs and dances, along with [[flint]], precious stones, shells, seeds, spears, food items, etc.

The [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan language family]], which extends from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] to the southwest, covered all of Australia except for the southeast and Arnhem Land. There was also a marked continuity of religious ideas and stories throughout the country, with some [[songlines]] crossing from one side of the continent to the other.

The initiation of young boys and girls into adult knowledge was marked by ceremony and feasting. Behaviour was governed by strict rules regarding responsibilities to and from uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters as well as in-laws. The [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship systems]] observed by many communities included a division into [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]], with restrictions on intermarrying dictated by the moiety an individual belonged to.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, R.M &amp; C.H. The World of the First Australians; Aboriginal traditional life, past and present" (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra).&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing prehistoric Aboriginal culture and society during her 1999 [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer Lecture]], Australian historian and anthropologist [[Inga Clendinnen]] explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"They [...] developed steepling thought-structures – intellectual edifices so comprehensive that every creature and plant had its place within it. They travelled light, but they were walking [[atlas]]es, and walking encyclopedias of [[natural history]]. [...] Detailed observations of [[nature]] were elevated into drama by the development of multiple and multi-level narratives: narratives which made the intricate relationships between these observed phenomena memorable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These dramatic narratives identified the recurrent and therefore the timeless and the significant within the fleeting and the idiosyncratic. They were also very human, charged with [[morality|moral]] significance but with pathos, and with humour, too – after all, the [[Dreamtime]] creatures were not austere divinities, but fallible beings who happened to make the world and everything in it while going about their creaturely business. Traditional Aboriginal culture effortlessly fuses areas of understanding which Europeans 'naturally' keep separate: ecology, cosmology, theology, social morality, art, comedy, tragedy – the observed and the richly imagined fused into a seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Inga Clendinnen, [[Boyer Lectures]], [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyers/stories/s71107.htm "Inside the Contact Zone: Part 1"], 5 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political and religious power rested with community elders rather than hereditary chiefs. Disputes were settled communally in accordance with an elaborate system of tribal law. Vendettas and feuds were not uncommon, especially when laws and taboos were broken. Cremation of the dead was practised by 25,000 years ago, possibly before anywhere else on Earth, and early artwork in [[Koonalda Cave]], [[Nullarbor Plain]], has been dated back to 20,000 years ago.{{sfn|Geoffrey Blainey|1976|p=84}}

It has been estimated that in 1788 there were approximately half a million [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal people]], although other estimates have put the figure as high as a million or more.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Thomson, p. 153, ''Indigenous Australia: Indigenous Health'' in James Jupp (ed.), ''The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their Origins'', Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-80789-1}} This article says the likely aboriginal population of Australia in 1788 was around 750,000 or even over a million. There was also a chart from the Australian Bureau of Statistics – Experimental Projections of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population, Canberra, ABS, 1998 – with estimated populations for each state and for Australia as a whole total being 418,841. Epidemics of smallpox occurred in 1789 and 1829–31. The article notes that there is evidence these epidemics traveled several hundred kilometres 'severely depopulating' tribes who had not yet had first contact with Europeans.&lt;/ref&gt; These populations formed hundreds of distinct cultural and language groups. Most were hunter-gatherers with rich oral histories and advanced land-management practices developed over thousands of years since the ecological destruction of the initial colonisation phase.

In the most fertile and populous areas, they lived in semi-permanent settlements. In the fertile [[Murray River|Murray Basin]], the gathering and hunting economies to be found elsewhere on the continent had in large part given way to fish farming.  Sturt's expedition along the Murray led to a belief that the Aboriginal groups there were practicing agriculture as a result of the presence of large haystacks, used as permanent grain stores.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Josephine (1984), "Archaeology of the Dreamtime", University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little interest was shown by white settlers in the bulk of the Aboriginal people, and so little is known of their cultures and languages. Diseases decimated some indigenous populations just prior to the period where most Aborigines came into direct contact with Europeans.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} When [[James Cook|Cook]] first claimed [[New South Wales]] for Britain in 1770, the native population may have consisted of as many as 600 distinct tribes speaking 200–250  distinct [[Australian Aboriginal languages|languages]] and over 600 distinct [[dialects]] and sub-dialects.&lt;ref&gt;R.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Dixon, p. 18, ''The Languages of Australia'', Cambridge University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-108-01785-5}} Dixon says "There were around 600 distinct tribes in Australia, speaking between them about 200 different languages."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Mallan, p. 53, ''Language Politics and Minority Rights'' in Witold Tulasiewicz, Joseph I. Zajda (eds), ''Language awareness in the curriculum'', James Nicholas Publishers, Albert Park, {{ISBN|1-875408-21-5}} Estimates 200 languages and over 600 dialects in 1788.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Koch, p. 23, "An overview of Australian traditional languages" in Gerhard Leitner, Ian G. Malcolm (eds), ''The habitat of Australia's aboriginal languages: past, present and future''. Says that some 250 distinct languages present in 1788.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact outside Australia==
Aboriginal people have no cultural memory of living anywhere outside Australia.  Nevertheless, the people living along the northern coastline of Australia, in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]], [[Arnhem Land]], [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] had encounters with various visitors for many thousands of years. People and traded goods moved freely between Australia and New Guinea up to and even after the eventual flooding of the [[land bridge]] by rising sea levels, which was completed about 6,000 years ago.

However, trade and intercourse between the separated lands continued across the newly formed [[Torres Strait]], whose 150&amp;nbsp;km-wide channel remained readily navigable with the chain of [[Torres Strait Islands]] and [[coral reefs|reefs]] affording intermediary stopping points. The islands were settled by different seafaring [[Melanesian]] cultures such as the [[Torres Strait Islanders]] over 2500 years ago, and cultural interactions continued via this route with the Aboriginal people of northeast Australia.

Indonesian "[[Bajau]]" fishermen from the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] (e.g. [[Banda Islands|Banda]]) have fished off the coast of Australia for hundreds of years. [[Macassan contact with Australia|Macassan]] traders from [[Sulawesi]] regularly visited the coast of northern Australia to [[Trepanging|fish for trepang]], an edible [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]] to trade with the Chinese since at least the early 18th century.

There was a high degree of cultural exchange, evidenced in [[Australian Aboriginal art|Aboriginal rock and bark paintings]], the introduction of technologies such as dug-out canoes and items such as tobacco and tobacco pipes, Macassan words in Aboriginal languages (e.g. ''Balanda'' for white person), and descendants of [[Malay race|Malay]] people in Australian Aboriginal communities and vice versa, as a result of intermarriage and migration.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. Australian Aboriginal Studies 2004, Number 1. "Aboriginal-Makassan interactions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in northern Australia and contemporary sea rights claims." P.6-7. Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Retrieved on 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myths of the people of [[Arnhem Land]] have preserved accounts of the trepang-catching, rice-growing [[Baijini]] people, who, according to the myths, were in Australia in the earliest times, before the Macassans. The Baijini have been variously interpreted by modern researchers as a different group of presumably South East Asian people, such as [[Bajau]] visitors to Australia who may have visited Arnhem Land before the Macassans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Possible link to east Africa===
In 1944, a small number of copper coins with Arabic inscriptions were discovered on a beach in Jensen Bay on [[Marchinbar Island]], part of the [[Wessel Islands]] of the [[Northern Territory]]. These coins were later identified as from the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] of east Africa.  Only one such coin had ever previously been found outside east Africa (unearthed during an excavation in [[Oman]]).  The inscriptions on the Jensen Bay coins identify a ruling Sultan of Kilwa, but it is unclear whether the ruler was from the 10th century or the 14th century.  This discovery has been of interest to those historians who believe it likely that people made landfall in Australia or its offshore islands before the first generally accepted such discovery, by the Dutch sailor [[Willem Janszoon]] in [[Janszoon voyage of 1605–06|1606]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/were-the-african-coins-found-in-australia-from-a-wrecked-arab-dhow#ixzz2X52jSNzc Jonathan Gornall, Were the African coins found in Australia from a wrecked Arab dhow?, The National, 29 May 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706123113/http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/were-the-african-coins-found-in-australia-from-a-wrecked-arab-dhow |date=6 July 2013 }}.

The '''Chair of Ecclesiastical History''' of the [[University of Glasgow]] is the oldest chair of [[ecclesiastical history]] in the United Kingdom. 

It was founded in 1716 by King [[George I of Great Britain]].  The Crown granted 100&amp;nbsp;[[pound sterling|pounds]] per year for this purpose. This was, thus, a [[Regius_professor|Regius Chair]] until 1935, when constitutional arrangements in the Church of Scotland resulted in patronage being transferred to the University Court acting on a Board of Nomination consisting of representatives of the University Court and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''September 11th Victim Compensation Fund''' (VCF) was created by an [[Act of Congress]], the Air 
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (49 USC 40101),&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ042.107 Government statistics concerning 9-11 compensation program]&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] to compensate the victims of the attack (or their families) in exchange for their agreement not to sue the airline corporations involved. [[Kenneth Feinberg]] was appointed by [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] to be [[Special Master]] of the fund. He worked for 33 months ''[[pro bono]]''.  He developed the regulations governing the administration of the fund and administered all aspects of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Gets What: Fair Compensation after Tragedy and Financial Upheaval | first = Kenneth | last = Feinberg |date=June 2012 | publisher = [[PublicAffairs]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9781586489779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
Feinberg was responsible for making the decisions on how much each family of a victim would receive.  Feinberg had to estimate how much each victim would have earned in a full lifetime.  If a family accepted the offer, it was not possible to appeal.  Families unhappy with the offer were able to appeal in a nonadversarial, informal hearing to present their case however they wanted. Feinberg personally presided over more than 900 of the 1,600 hearings.  At the end of the process $7 billion was awarded to 97% of the families; the average payout was $1.8 million. A non-negotiable clause in the acceptance papers for the settlements was that the families were to never file suit against the airlines for any lack of security or otherwise unsafe procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Kenneth. What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 (2005), Perseus Books Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

A stumbling block to settlements was the fact that many of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] victims were highly compensated financial professionals. Families of these victims felt the compensation offers were too low, and, had a court considered their case on an individual basis, they would have been awarded much higher amounts. This concern had to be balanced against the time, complications, and risks of pursuing an individual case, and the real possibility that the airlines and their insurers could be bankrupted before being able to pay the claim. This is a separate fund from the similarly named [[September 11th Fund]], and from the [[World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company]].

==The 8-part Feinberg plan==
In his book titled ''What is Life Worth?'', Feinberg described the eight-part plan which was applied to approaching the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (see Publications section below). (i) Identifying someone with sufficient and exceptionally broad experience in mass tort action mediation, litigation, and settlement, which Feinberg possessed through his previous personal experience as a political activist and his work in the Agent Orange compensation settlement. (ii) To support and follow the unprecedented law of Congress for the proportional compensation of victims based on estimated loss from future earnings as a key legislated criterion. Hire a full staff of accountants and attorneys to track and service each claim individually. (iii) Accumulate all the reports and applications, along with counter-claims to gauge and initiate the direct compensation process. How the compensation fund  worked was in detail substantially different than the Agent Orange mass tort litigation case. (iv) The place of informed discretion in compensating claimants under the formula of keeping the domain of compensation (p47 of Feinberg's book) under the rule of thumb that 85% of the money should not go to 15% of the 'richest' claimant families, under the principle of "narrow the gap" between the largest and the smallest compensations paid to claimants. (v) With a mind to the future, the process of the program should be maintained and serviced as a precedent for future courts to defend in future compensation cases as needed. The actions taken should be uniform in their approach. (vi) There would be "no substitute for hard work and legal craftsmanship" of rigorous intellectual honesty. (vii) The support of Edward Kennedy would be recognized throughout the process whom Feinberg knew since 1975 (p7-8). (viii) Law suits were to be discouraged as contrary to the spirit of an enacted Law of Congress legislated to expedite the claim process of victims of September 11th.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Kenneth.

==Additional compensation==
In spite of the finding of the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'' that the Saudi Arabian government wasn't involved in the attacks, some 9/11 families sued the Saudi Arabian government in 2016 seeking additional [[restitution]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-30/sept-11-widow-sues-saudi-arabia-over-her-husband-s-death&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit accuses the Saudis of [[wrongful death]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">'''Stefan Kieniewicz''' (20 September 1907 in [[Dereszewicze]] - 2 May 1992 in [[Konstancin]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian and university professor, notable for his works on 19th century [[history of Poland]]. During his work at various universities he became the tutor of several generations of Polish historians and his views on the last two centuries of Poland's history remain influential in modern scholarly works.

==Life==
Stefan Kieniewicz was born on 20 September 1907 in his family's manor in the village of Dereszewicze in [[Polesie]]. In 1930 he graduated from the historical faculty of the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|Adam Mickiewicz University]] of [[Poznań]], where he studied under tutorship of, among others, [[Marceli Handelsman]] and [[Adam Skałkowski]], both being among the most notable historians of the epoch. In 1934 he passed his [[doctorate]] and started working as a historian at the Fiscal Archives in [[Warsaw]]. Among his pre-war works are a study on Polish society of [[Poznań]] during the [[Spring of Nations]] (published in 1935) and a biography of [[Adam Stanisław Sapieha|Adam Sapieha]] (published in 1939).

After the outbreak of [[World War II]] he remained in Warsaw, where he became one of the members of the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the Headquarters of [[Armia Krajowa]]. After the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944 he was taken prisoner and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]], where he remained until the liberation. After the war he returned to Poland, where he took part in rebuilding the [[Warsaw University]]. After receiving [[habilitation]] in 1946 he became a deputy professor and since 1949 an extraordinary professor. In 1958 he became an ordinary professor. Between 1953 and 1968 he collaborated with the Historical Institute of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAN), after which in 1970 he became a full member of the PAN. In 1976 he was also awarded with honorary membership of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Awarded with [[doctorate]] [[honoris causa]] of the [[Lublin University]], Kieniewicz died on 2 May 1992 in Warsaw's suburb of [[Konstancin]].

His son, Jan Kieniewicz (born 1938), is an emeritus humanities professor, specialist in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] studies and former Polish ambassador to [[Spain]].

{{History of the British Isles}}

'''Sub-Roman Britain''' refers to the transition period between the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Crisis of the Third Century]] around 235 (and the subsequent [[collapse of the Roman Empire|collapse]] and [[End of Roman rule in Britain|end of Roman Britain]]) and the start of the [[Early Medieval]] period. The term is derived from an [[archaeology|archaeological]] label for the material culture of [[Great Britain]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. The term '''Post-Roman Britain''' is also used for the period, mainly in non-archaeological contexts.

The term "sub-Roman" was originally used to describe archaeological remains such as [[potsherd]]s found in sites of the 5th and 6th centuries, and hinted at the decay of locally-made wares from a previous higher standard that had existed under the [[Roman Empire]]. It is now more often used to denote this period of history instead.

Although the culture of Britain in the period was mainly derived from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] sources, there were also [[Saxons]] settled as ''[[foederati]]'' in the area, originally from [[Lower Saxony|Saxony]] in northwestern Germany, although the term "Saxon" was used by the British for all Germanic incomers. Gradually the latter assumed more control, creating [[Anglo-Saxon England]] in the process. The [[Picts]] in northern Scotland were outside the applicable area.

==Meaning of terms==
The period of sub-Roman Britain traditionally covers the [[history of England|history of the area which subsequently became England]] from the end of [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman imperial rule]] in 410 to the arrival of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Saint Augustine]] in 597. The date taken for the end of this period is arbitrary in that the sub-Roman culture continued in northern England until the merger of [[Rheged]] (the kingdom of the [[Brigantes]]) with [[Northumbria]] by dynastic marriage in 633, and longer in the [[West of England]] (especially [[Cornwall]]) and [[Cumbria]] and in [[Wales]].

This period has attracted a great deal of academic and popular debate, in part because of the scarcity of the written source material. The term "post-Roman Britain" is also used for the period, mainly in non-archaeological contexts; "sub-Roman" and "post-Roman" are both terms that apply to the old [[Roman province]] of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], i.e. Britain south of the [[River Forth|Forth]]–[[River Clyde|Clyde]] line. The history of the area between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the Forth–Clyde line is similar to that of Wales (see [[Rheged]], [[Bernicia]], [[Gododdin]] and [[Strathclyde]]). North of the line lay a thinly-populated area including the kingdoms of the Maeatae (in [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Dalriada]] (in [[Argyll]]), and the kingdom whose ''kaer'' (castle) near Inverness was visited by [[Saint Columba]]. The Romans referred to these peoples collectively as ''Picti'' [[Picts]], meaning Painted Ones.

The term "[[Late Antiquity]]", implying wider horizons, is finding more use in the academic community, especially when transformations of classical culture common throughout the post-Roman West are examined; it is less successfully applied to Britain at the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The period may also be considered as part of the [[early Middle Ages]], if continuity with the following periods is stressed. Popular (and some academic) works use a range of more dramatic names for the period: the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], the Brythonic Age, the Age of Tyrants, or the Age of [[King Arthur|Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;John Morris, ''The Age of Arthur'' (1973) is his title for a popular history of the British Isles from 350 to 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written accounts==
There is very little extant written material available from this period, though there is a considerable amount from later periods that may be relevant. A lot of what is available deals with the first few decades of the 5th century only. The sources can usefully be classified into British and continental, and into contemporary and non-contemporary.

Two primary contemporary British sources exist: the ''Confessio'' of [[Saint Patrick]] and [[Gildas]]' ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' (''On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain'').&lt;ref&gt;Discussion in [[Ken Dark]], ''Britain and the End of the Roman Empire'', (Stroud: Tempus, 2000), pp.32–7&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick's ''Confessio'' and his ''Letter to [[Ceretic Guletic|Coroticus]]'' reveal aspects of life in Britain, from where he was abducted to Ireland. It is particularly useful in highlighting the state of [[Celtic Christianity|Christianity at the time]]. Gildas is the nearest to a source of Sub-Roman history but there are many problems in using it. The document represents British history as he and his audience understood it. Though a few other documents of the period do exist, such as Gildas' letters on monasticism, they are not directly relevant to British history. Gildas' ''De Excidio'' is a [[jeremiad]]: it is written as a polemic to warn contemporary rulers against sin, demonstrating through historical and biblical examples that bad rulers are always punished by God&amp;nbsp;– in the case of Britain, through the destructive wrath of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] invaders. The historical section of ''De Excidio'' is short, and the material in it is clearly selected with Gildas' purpose in mind. There are no absolute dates given, and some of the details, such as those regarding the [[Hadrian's Wall|Hadrian's]] and [[Antonine Wall|Antonine]] Walls are clearly wrong. Nevertheless, Gildas does provide us with an insight into some of the kingdoms that existed when he was writing, and how an educated monk perceived the situation that had developed between the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s and the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]].

There are more continental contemporary sources that mention Britain, though these are highly problematic. The most famous is the so-called ''Rescript of [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]]'', in which the Western Emperor Honorius tells the British ''[[civitates]]'' to look to their own defence. The first reference to this rescript is written by the 6th century [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Zosimus]] and is found in the middle of a discussion of southern [[Italy]]; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some, though not all, modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to [[Bruttium]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony Richard ''The Roman Government of Britain'' OUP Oxford (29 Sep 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-19-925237-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=izIMUEgzjm0C&amp;pg=PA461&amp;dq=bruttium+honorius&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=bruttium%20honorius&amp;f=false pp.461-463]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halsall, Guy ''Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376–568'' Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition (20 Dec 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-521-43491-1}} pp.217-218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion in [[Martin Millett]], ''The Romanization of Britain'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' ''Britannia'' vol. 13, 1982 p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallic Chronicles, [[Chronica Gallica of 452]] and [[Chronica Gallica of 511]], say prematurely that "Britain, abandoned by the Romans, passed into the power of the Saxons" and provide information about St [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]] and his visit(s) to Britain, though again this text has received considerable academic deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Jones (historian)|Michael Jones]] and [[John Casey (academic)|John Casey]], 'The Gallic Chronicle Restored: A Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain', ''Britannia'' 19, (1988), pp.367-98; [[R.W. Burgess]], 'The Dark Ages Return to Fifth-Century Britain: The 'Restored' Gallic Chronicle Exploded', ''Britannia'' 21, (1990), pp.185-195&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Procopius]], another 6th-century Byzantine writer, makes some references to Britain, though the accuracy of these is uncertain.

There are numerous later written sources that claim to provide accurate accounts of the period. The first to attempt this was the monk [[Bede]], writing in the early 8th century. He based his account of the Sub-Roman period in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (written around 731) heavily on Gildas, though he tried to provide dates for the events Gildas describes. It was written from an anti-Briton point of view. Later sources, such as the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' often attributed to [[Nennius]], the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (again written from a non-Briton point of view, based on West Saxon sources) and the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', are all heavily shrouded in myth and can only be used with caution as evidence for this period.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Dumville]], "Sub-Roman Britain: History and Legend", ''History'' 62, (1977), pp.173–192&lt;/ref&gt; There are also documents giving [[Welsh poetry]] (of [[Taliesin]] and [[Aneirin]]) and land deeds ([[Book of Llandaff|Llandaff charters]]) that appear to date back to the 6th century.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] there were many books written that purport to give the history of the Sub-Roman period. These have been influenced by the fictionalised account in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''). Therefore, they can only be regarded as showing how the legends grew. Not until modern times have serious studies of the period been undertaken.

Some "Lives of Saints" relating to Celtic clerics are early, but most are late and unreliable. [[Jude the Apostle|St. Thaddaeus]] is described as visiting a [[Roman villa]] at [[Chepstow]], while St Cuthbert visited deserted [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

==Archaeological evidence==
[[Archaeology]] provides further evidence for this period, though of a different nature from that provided by documents. Archaeology suggested to Richard Reece that the depopulation of Roman towns and the development of villa and estate organization was already occurring in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;, "Town and Country: The End of Roman Britain", ''World Archaeology'' '''12'''.1, (June 1980:77-92); Simon T. Loseby, "Power and towns in Late Roman Britain and early Anglo-Saxon England" in Gisela Ripoll and Josep M. Gurt, eds., ''Sedes regiae (ann. 400–800)'', (Barcelona, 2000:319-70 ([http://www.raco.cat/index.php/MemoriasRABL/article/viewFile/23771/23605 on-line text]) makes a strong case for the discontinuty of urban life.&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th and 6th centuries in Britain are marked by a sharp discontinuity in town life, perhaps always a somewhat artificial Roman imposition on the landscape, dependent on imperial military requirements and requirements of administration and tax collection; the exceptions are a handful of sites: [[Londinium]], [[Eboracum]], [[Canterbury]], [[Wroxeter]]&lt;ref&gt;Philip Barker's excavation in the Baths Basilica at Wroxeter, (1975) is noted by R. Reece, "Town and country: the end of Roman Britain", ''World Archaeology'', 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly [[Cambridge]], but the discontinuity in the episcopate, "the institution most responsible for the survival of towns in Gaul", as [[H. R. Loyn]] observes, speaks against town survival in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:15f: "it is altogether unlikely that organized town-life can have survived through the troubles of the fifth and sixth centuries. Gildas lamented the destruction of the twenty-eight cities of Britain, and there is no reason to doubt the essential truth of his statement" (p16).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman villa]] system, represented by some five hundred archaeological sites, did not survive either; unlike Gaul, in Britain not a single villa name survived into the Germanic period. It may be possible that the villa system did not survive the disastrous [[Pict]]ish [[Great Conspiracy|incursions in 367]] and following years.&lt;ref&gt;Loyn 1991:16f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sub-Roman period, building in stone came to an end; buildings were constructed of less durable materials than during the Roman period. However, [[brooch]]es, [[pottery]] and [[weapons]] from this period have survived. The study of [[burial]]s and [[cremation]]s, and the [[grave goods]] associated with these, has done much to expand the understanding of cultural identities in the period.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in A.S. Esmonde Cleary, "The Roman to medieval transition" in ''Britons and Romans: advancing an archaeological agenda''. ed. S. James &amp; M. Millett, (York: Council for British Archaeology, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeology has shown some evidence of continuity with [[Education in Ancient Rome|Roman education]], [[Roman commerce|trade with the Mediterranean]] and with [[Celtic art]].

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of settlements have revealed possible changes in social structures, and to what extent life in Britain continued unaltered in certain pockets into the early [[medieval]] period. Hilltops, the so-called "[[hillfort]]s", ''[[castra]]'' and [[monasteries]] have been excavated. Work on towns has been particularly important. Work on the hill-forts has shown evidence of refurbishment, and also of overseas trade, in this period. One of the earliest major excavations was at [[Tintagel]] (Radford 1939). This uncovered rectangular structures and much Mediterranean pottery. The buildings were initially interpreted as a monastery, but later as a princely stronghold and trading post. Another important excavation was at [[Dinas Powys]] (Alcock 1963) which showed evidence of metalworking. Alcock also led the excavations at [[South Cadbury]] (Alcock 1995). Many other sites have now been shown to have been occupied during the sub-Roman period, including [[Banna (Birdoswald)|Birdoswald]] and [[Saxon Shore]] forts.

Work on [[field systems]] and [[environmental archaeology]] has also highlighted how much [[Agriculture|agricultural practice]] continued and changed over the period.&lt;ref&gt;John Davey, "The Environs of South Cadbury in the Late Antique and Early Medieval Periods" in ''Debating Late Antiquity in Britain AD 300-700''. ed. Rob Collins &amp; James Gerrard, (Oxford: British Archaeological Review, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeology, however, has its limits, especially in dating. Although [[radiocarbon dating]] can provide a rough estimate, this is not accurate enough to associate archaeological finds with historical events. [[Dendrochronology]] is accurate enough to do this, though few suitable pieces of wood have been uncovered.
[[File:All Roman coins 1997 - 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|200px|Roman coins findings clearly indicate the areas of biggest "romanization" and presence in Roman Britain]]
Coins would normally be the most useful tool for dating, but not for sub-Roman Britain since no newly minted coins are believed to have entered circulation after the very early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Esmond Cleary, ''The Ending of Roman Britain'', (London: Batsford, 1989), pp.138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some archaeological evidence for [[Anglo-Saxons]] and Britons living on the same site. For example, in the cemetery at [[Wasperton]], [[Warwickshire]], one can see a family adopting Anglo-Saxon culture over a long period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Hamerow]], 'The earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms' in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, I, c.500-c.700''. ed. Paul Fouracre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakdown of Roman society==
Because of the sparse evidence for the period, many interpretations are possible. Some have taken all the sources at their face value (e.g. Alcock 1971, Morris 1973, Ashe 1985) and others set aside the non-contemporary sources. Any interpretation can only be tentative and dates more so.

At the start of the 5th century, [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] was part of the [[Western Roman Empire]] under [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worcester.ac.uk/8805.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, http://www.worcester.ac.uk/8816.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; But there were already signs of decline, and some [[Saxons]] may already have been in England as [[Foederati|mercenaries]]. Some Roman troops were withdrawn by [[Stilicho]] in 402, and bulk coin payments ceased around then. In 406 the army in Britain revolted, electing three successive "tyrants", the last of whom took further troops to [[Gaul]]. He established himself briefly as [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]] but was defeated and subsequently executed in 411. Meanwhile, there were barbarian raids on Britain in 408, but these seem to have been defeated. After 410 Honorius apparently sent letters to the cities of Britain telling them to fend for themselves, though this is sometimes disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony Richard The Roman Government of Britain OUP Oxford (29 Sep 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-19-925237-4}} pp.461-463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion in Martin Millett, The Romanization of Britain, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' Britannia vol. 13, 1982 p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal of most Roman troops did not end the Roman culture of the "lost province", which still remained part of the Roman cultural world, with inhabitants who identified themselves as Roman.

From the middle of the 5th century the Germanic raiders began to settle in the eastern river valleys.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:3.&lt;/ref&gt; Later civil wars seem to have broken out, which have been interpreted either as being between pro-Roman and independence groups or between "Established Church" and [[Pelagian]] parties (Myres 1965, Morris 1965), a class struggle between peasants and land owners (Thompson 1977, Wood 1984) and a coup by an urban elite (Snyder 1988). A recent view explored by Laycock&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, ''Britannia the Failed State'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; sees Britain violently fragmenting into kingdoms based on British tribal identities; 'violently' is disputable, but clearly most of the ''civitates'' gradually transformed into kingdoms. Life seems to have continued much as before in the countryside, and on a reduced scale in the towns as evidenced by the descriptions of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]' visits. Feuding kingships replaced the centrally governed [[Roman province]]s.

[[Gildas]] says that a "council" was convened by [[Vortigern]] to find ways of countering the barbarian threat. The council opted to hire Saxon mercenaries, following Roman practice. After a while these turned against the British and plundered the towns. A British leader, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], fought against them in a number of battles apparently over a long period. Towards the end of this period was the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], around 490, which later sources claimed was won by [[King Arthur]], though Gildas does not identify him. After this there was a long period of peace. The British seem to have been in control of England and Wales roughly west of a line from [[York]] to [[Bournemouth]]. The Saxons had control of eastern areas in an arc from [[East Yorkshire]] through [[Lincolnshire]] and perhaps [[Nottinghamshire]], to [[East Anglia]] and [[South East England]].

Writing in Latin, perhaps about 540, Gildas gives an account of the history of Britain, but the earlier part (for which other sources are available) is severely muddled. He castigates five rulers in western Britain&amp;nbsp;– Constantine of [[Dumnonia]], Aurelius Caninus, Vortipor of the [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Demetae]], Cuneglasus and Maglocunus ([[Mailcun]] or in later spelling [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]] of [[Gwynedd]]) &amp;nbsp;– for their sins. He also attacks the British clergy. He gives information on the British diet, dress and entertainment. He writes that Britons were killed, emigrated or were enslaved but gives no idea of numbers.

In the late 6th century there was another period of Saxon expansion, starting with the capture of [[Old Sarum|Searoburh]] in 552 by the dynasty that later ruled [[Wessex]], and including entry into the [[Cotswolds]] area after the [[Battle of Deorham]] (577), though the accuracy of the entries in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for this period has been questioned. These conquests are often said by modern writers, on no clear evidence, to have separated the Britons of [[South West England]] (known later as the West Welsh) from those of Wales. (Just after the period being discussed, the [[Battle of Chester]] in 611 might have separated the latter from those of the north of England.) Until the 570s, the Britons were still in control of about half of England and Wales.

==Kingdoms==
[[File:Britain.circa.540.jpg|thumb|341px]]
Various [[Britons (Celtic people)|British]] kingdoms existed at some point in the period. Some changed their names and some were absorbed by others. Not all of their names, especially in the southeast, are known, nor are the details of their political development; some authority structures left from the Roman period may have continued in charge of some areas for some time. At times some of the kingdoms were united by a ruler who was an overlord, while wars occurred between others. During the period the boundaries are likely to have changed. The major ones were:

* [[Bernicia|Bryneich]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Northumberland]]; eventually taken by the Angles of [[Bernicia]]
* [[Dumnonia]]&amp;nbsp;– south west England, [[Cornwall]] and much of [[Devon]]
* [[Lindinis]]&amp;nbsp;- [[Somerset]], [[Bristol]], and parts of [[Devon]], north [[Dorset]], and western [[Wiltshire]].
* [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]]&amp;nbsp;– south west Wales
* [[Ergyng]]&amp;nbsp;– south west [[Herefordshire]], northern [[Monmouthshire]] and the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire
* [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], [[Brycheiniog]] and [[Glywysing]]&amp;nbsp;– south Wales
* [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]&amp;nbsp;– mid Wales
* [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]&amp;nbsp;– north Wales
* [[Elmet]]&amp;nbsp;– south west Yorkshire
* [[Rheged]]&amp;nbsp;– Cumbria and Lancashire
* [[Ebrauc]]&amp;nbsp;– around York and northern Yorkshire
* [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]&amp;nbsp;– (c. 900&amp;nbsp;– c. 1100) in south west Scotland, Cumberland, Westmorland
* [[Gododdin]]&amp;nbsp;– centred on [[Traprain Law]] in [[Lothian]]

Some areas fell under the domination of Anglian or Saxon chieftains, later kingdoms:

* [[Bernicia]]&amp;nbsp;– the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia before joining with Deira to become Northumbria
* [[Deira]]&amp;nbsp;– the Anglian kingdom of Deira before joining with Bernicia to become Northumbria (East Yorkshire)
* [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]]&amp;nbsp;– including Suffolk and Norfolk
* [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]
* [[Hwicce]]&amp;nbsp;– most of Gloucestershire except the [[Forest of Dean]] and western [[Oxfordshire]].
* [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]&amp;nbsp;- including the  settlement of [[Haestingas]], containing people of possibly Jutish origin. 
* [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]]&amp;nbsp;– including [[Middle Saxons|Middlesex]] and Surrey
* [[Wessex]]&amp;nbsp;– formed from areas in the upper [[Thames valley]] and later incorporating an area of Jutish settlement in the Meon Valley and around Southampton (including Isle of Wight)
* [[Mercia]]&amp;nbsp;– centred on [[Repton]]
* [[Middle Anglia]]&amp;nbsp;– east Midlands, later joined with Mercia
* [[Northumbria]]&amp;nbsp;– formed from Bernicia and Deira

===Religion===
Officially the [[Roman Empire]] was [[Christian]] at the start of the 5th century, but there is evidence of rural [[pagan]] temples being refurbished at the start of this period in western England. However, most temples seem to have been replaced eventually by [[Early Christianity|Christian church]]es on the same site or nearby. "Celtic" churches or monasteries seem to have flourished during this period in the British areas, such as that at [[Glastonbury]], though mostly not until the 6th century; but the "Saxons" were pagan. This reinforced a great antipathy between the peoples. Many Roman cemeteries continued into much later times, such as that at [[Cannington, Somerset]]. In the east there was a gradual transition among the pagan Saxons from cremation to [[inhumation]]. Although the arrival of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Saint Augustine]] is traditionally seen as the significant Christianising event for the Saxons, a bishop had already arrived in Kent with the king's [[Merovingian]] wife. Other Saxons remained pagan after this time.

In 429, a British Deacon, [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]], had requested support from the Pope in Rome to combat [[Pelagianism]]. Bishops [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]] and [[Lupus of Troyes]] were sent. Germanus, a former military commander, is reported to have led the British to the "Hallelujah" victory, possibly in Wales or Herefordshire. Germanus is said&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, E. A. (1984) ''Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain''. Woodbridge: Boydell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, I. N. (1984) "The End of Roman Britain: Continental evidence and parallels", in M. Lapidge &amp; D. Dumville (eds.) ''Gildas: New Approaches''. Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell; pp.&amp;nbsp;1 – 25.&lt;/ref&gt; to have made a second visit to England later. Participation by a British bishop at a synod in Gaul demonstrates that at least some British churches were in full administrative and doctrinal touch with Gaul as late as 455.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north, [[Whithorn]] is said to be the earliest church in Scotland, being founded in 397 by [[Saint Ninian]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;[http://www.britannia.com/history/nararthist.html Williams, Peter N., "Arthurian Britain", Narrative History of Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceretic Guletic|Coroticus (or Ceretic)]] was a Christian king who was the recipient of the letter from [[Saint Patrick]]. His base may have been Dumbarton Rock on the River Clyde, and his descendant [[Rhydderch Hael]] is named in the ''Life of Saint Columba''. Rhydderch was a contemporary of [[Áedán mac Gabráin]] of [[Dal Riata]] and [[Urien]] of [[Rheged]] in the late 6th century, as well as of [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria|Æthelfrith]] of [[Bernicia]]. Unlike Columba, [[Kentigern]], the supposed apostle to the Britons of the Clyde and alleged founder of [[Glasgow]], is a shadowy figure.

===Linguistic evidence===
{{main|Celtic language-death in England}}
[[Linguistics]] is useful in the analysis of culture, and to an extent political associations.
[[Bede]] in ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (completed in 731) wrote that "currently, [there are in Britain] the languages of five peoples, namely that of the Angles ([[Old English|English]]), the Britons ([[Old Welsh|Welsh]]), the Scots ([[Old Gaelic|Gaelic]]), the [[Pictish language|Picts]] and the [[Medieval Latin|Latins]]" (''HE'' 1.1).&lt;ref&gt;''in praesenti ... quinque gentium linguis, ... Anglorum uidelicet, Brettonum, Scottorum, Pictorum et Latinorum''&lt;/ref&gt;
A review of the changes in the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic language]] during this period is given by [[Kenneth H. Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;See Kenneth Jackson, ''Language and History in Early Britain: A Chronological Survey of the Brittonic Languages'', (Edinburgh, 1953) for a traditional introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[Old English]], [[Brythonic languages|P-]] and [[Goidelic languages|Q-Celtic]] and Latin have provided evidence for contact among the Britons, the Gaels, and the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The consensus is that Old English has little evidence of linguistic contact. Some scholars have suggested that there is more evidence in the grammar than in the [[lexicon]], though this is challenged by many.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Roberts
  | first = Ian G.
  | title = 'Verbs and diachronic syntax: a comparative history of English and French Volume 28 of Studies in natural language and linguistic theory Volume 28 of NATO Asi Series. Series C, Mathematical and Physical Science'}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelderen&gt;{{cite book
  | last = van Gelderen
  | first = Elly
  | title = 'A History of the English Language'}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Latin continued to be used for writing but the extent of its use for speech has been much disputed.

Similarly, studies of place names give clues about the linguistic history of an area. England (except [[Cornwall]] and [[Cumbria]]) shows patchy evidence now of [[Celts|Celtic]] in its place names. There are scattered Celtic place names throughout, increasing towards the west. There are also Celtic river names and topographical names. An explanation of the toponymic and linguistic evidence is that Anglo-Saxon language and culture became dominant due to their political and social preeminence in the south and east of Britain. Names with a Latin element may suggest continuity of settlement, while some places are named for pagan Germanic deities. Names of British origin may or may not indicate survival of a British population. Names based on the Anglo-Saxon word for the British, ''wealh'', are also taken as indicating British survival. An example is Walton, meaning settlement of the British&lt;ref name=Hamerow&gt;Hamerow, H. 1993 ''Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2: The Anglo-Saxon Settlement'' (English Heritage Archaeological Report 21)&lt;/ref&gt; and this name is found in many parts of England, though it sometimes means ''Wall-town''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/in2/horton/&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving inscriptions on stones provide another source of information on the settlements of Britons and the Anglo-Saxons. Celtic inscribed stones from this period occur in western England, Wales and southern Scotland, and the CISP project has been set up to record these and provide information online. Later inscriptions in some areas are written in [[runes]] and provide information on the settlement of Angles. Inscriptions in parts of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall, are in [[ogham]], some containing forms which scholars have not been able to understand.

===Extent of the migrations===
Two contrasting models of the end of sub-Roman Britain have been described by Richard Reece as "decline and immigration" and "invasion and displacement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reece | first1 =  | year = 1989 | title = Models of continuity| url = | journal = Oxford Journal of Archaeology  | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 231–36 [234] | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.1989.tb00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been held that the Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britain in large numbers in the 5th and 6th centuries, substantially displacing the British people. The Anglo-Saxon historian [[Frank Stenton]] in 1943, although making considerable allowance for British survival, essentially sums up this view, arguing "that the greater part of southern England was overrun in the first phase of the war".&lt;ref&gt;F.M. Stenton, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', 3rd edition, (Oxford: University Press, 1973), p.30&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was based on the written sources, particularly [[Gildas]] but also the later sources such as the Anglo-Saxon historian [[Bede]], that cast the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons as a violent event. The toponymic and linguistic evidence was also considered to support this interpretation, as very few British place names survived in eastern Britain, very few [[British language (Celtic)|British Celtic]] words entered the [[Old English]] language and the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic language]] and peoples migrated from south-western Britain to [[Armorica]], which eventually became [[Brittany]]. This interpretation particularly appealed to earlier English historians, who wanted to further their view that England had developed differently from Europe, with a limited monarchy and love of liberty. This, it was argued, came from the mass Anglo-Saxon invasions. While this view was never universal&amp;nbsp;– [[Edward Gibbon]] believed that there had been a great deal of British survival&amp;nbsp;– it was the dominant paradigm. Though many scholars would now employ this argument,{{Clarify|date=July 2018}} the traditional view is still held by many other historians, [[Lawrence James]] writing in 2002 that England was "submerged by an Anglo-Saxon current which swept away the Romano-British."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''Warrior Race'', (London: Abacus. 2002), p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view has been partly deconstructed (considerably in some circles) since the 1990s, with a reduction in the numbers of Anglo-Saxons believed to have arrived in Britain. A lower figure is sometimes accepted, which would mean that it is highly unlikely that the existing British population was substantially displaced by the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jones, ''The End of Roman Britain'', pp.8-38.&lt;/ref&gt; If fewer Anglo-Saxons arrived, it is proposed that they formed a ruling elite, with acculturisation of the local population. Thus some "Saxon" graves may be of Britons, though many scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1635457 | year = 2006 | author1 = Thomas | first1 = M.

==End of Roman Britain==
{{Main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}
Various dates have been proposed to mark the end of [[Roman Britain]], including the end of [[Roman currency]] coinage importation in 402, [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]]'s rebellion in 407, the rebellion mentioned by [[Zosimus]] in 409, and the Rescript of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 410.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance E.A. Thompson, 'Britain, AD 406-410', ''Britannia'' 8, (1977), pp.303-18 and P. Bartholomew, 'Fifth-Century Facts', ''Britannia'' 13, (1982), pp.261-70&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern [[decolonisation]], the dating of the end of Roman Britain is complex, and the exact process is unknown.

There is some controversy as to why Roman rule ended in Britain. The view first advocated by [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] was that Rome left Britain.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Michael Jones, ''The End of Roman Britain'', (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996), pp.256-7&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was substantiated over time, most recently by A.S. Esmonde-Cleary.&lt;ref&gt;Esmonde-Cleary, ''The Ending of Roman Britain'', p.161&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, internal turmoil in the [[Roman Empire]] and the need to withdraw troops to fight off barbarian armies led Rome to abandon Britain. It was the collapse of the imperial system that led to the end of imperial rule in Britain. However, Michael Jones has advanced an alternative thesis that argues that Rome did not leave Britain, but that Britain left Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jones, ''The End of Roman Britain'', esp. chapters 4 and 7&lt;/ref&gt; He highlights the numerous [[usurper]]s who came from Britain in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, and points out that the supply of coinage to Britain had dried up by the early 5th century, so that administrators and troops were not getting paid. All of this, he argues, led the British people to rebel against Rome. Both of these arguments are open to criticism, and the question is still open.

It was a violent period, and there was probably widespread tension, alluded to in all the written sources. This may have led to the deaths of many Britons. There are also references to plagues. Laycock (''Britannia the Failed State'', 2008) suggests tribal conflict, possibly even starting before 410, may have sliced up much of Britain and helped destroy the economy. The evidence from land use suggests a decline in production, which might be a sign of population decline.&lt;ref&gt;Davey, ''The Environs of [[South Cadbury]]'', p50&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear that some British people migrated to Europe, and [[Armorica]] in northwest [[Gaul]] became known as [[Brittany]]. There is also evidence of British migration to [[Gallaecia]], in [[Hispania]]. The dates of these migrations are uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the migration from south western Britain to Brittany may have begun as early as 300 and had largely ended by 500. These settlers, unlikely to be refugees if the date was this early, made their presence felt in the naming of the westernmost, [[Atlantic]]-facing provinces of Armorica, Kerne/Cornouaille ("Kernow/[[Cornwall]]") and Domnonea ("[[Devon]]").&lt;ref&gt;Gwenaël le Duc, "The Colonisation of Brittany from Britain: New Approaches and Questions" in ''Celtic Connections: Proceedings of the Tenth International Congress of Celtic Studies. Volume One''. ed. Black, Gillies and Ó Maolaigh, (East Linton: Tuckwell Press, 1999), {{ISBN|1-898410-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is clear linguistic evidence for close contact between the south west of Britain and Brittany across the sub-Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Davies, "The Celtic Kingdoms" in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume I, c.500-c.700''. ed. Paul Fouracre, (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University]] Press, 2005), pp255–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in the north west corner of the [[Iberian peninsula]], another region of traditional [[Celts|Celtic]] culture, the [[Suebian]] ''Parochiale'', drawn up about 580, includes a list of the principal churches of each diocese in the metropolitanate of [[Braga]] (the ''ecclesia Britonensis'', now [[Bretoña]]), which was the seat of a bishop who ministered to the spiritual needs of the British immigrants to northwestern Spain: in 572 the bishop, Mailoc, had a Celtic name.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, ''Saint James's Catapult'', ch. 1, note 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers had brought their [[Celtic Christianity]] with them but finally accepted the Latin Rite at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo|Council of Toledo]] in 633. The diocese stretched from [[Ferrol, A Coruña|Ferrol]] to the [[Eo River]]. In Spain, the area has sometimes been dubbed "the third Britain" or "the last Britain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/monograficos/dumio/noticia.jsp?TEXTO=100000112193 "San Rosendo, bispo dunha Igrexa direfente nunha Galicia distinta"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132623/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/monograficos/dumio/noticia.jsp?TEXTO=100000112193 |date=12 October 2007 }} {{gl icon}}, ''La Voz de [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began appearing in western Britain, and are first referred to in Gildas' ''De Excidio''. To an extent these kingdoms may have derived from Roman structures.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Dark, ''Britain and the End of the Roman Empire'', pp.150–192&lt;/ref&gt; But it is also clear that they drew on a strong influence from [[Hibernia]], which was never part of the Roman Empire. Archaeology has helped further the study of these kingdoms, notably at sites like [[Tintagel]] or the [[hillfort]] at [[South Cadbury]].

In the north there developed the British kingdoms of the [[Hen Ogledd]], the "Old North", comprising [[Ebrauc]] (probable name), [[Bernicia|Bryneich]], [[Rheged]], [[Strathclyde]], [[Elmet]] and [[Gododdin]]. 5th- and 6th-century repairs along [[Hadrian's Wall]] have been uncovered, and at [[Whithorn]] in south western [[Scotland]] (possibly the site of [[Ninian]]'s monastery). Chance discoveries have helped document the continuing urban occupation of some Roman towns such as [[Wroxeter]] and [[Caerwent]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger White and Philip Barker, ''Wroxeter: Life and Death of a Roman City'', (Stroud: Tempus, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Continued urban use might be associated with an [[Christianity|ecclesiastical]] structure.

Western Britain has attracted those archaeologists who wish to place [[King Arthur]] as a historical figure.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Alcock, ''Arthur's Britain: History and Archaeology AD 367–634'', (Harmondsworth: Allen Lane, 1971), {{ISBN|0-7139-0245-0}}; Francis Pryor, ''Britain AD: A Quest for Arthur, England and the Anglo-Saxons.'' (Harper Collins, 2004), {{ISBN|0-00-718186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is little contemporary written evidence for this, archaeological evidence does suggest that a [[Romano-British]] king might have wielded considerable power during the sub-Roman period, as demonstrated by the creation of sites such as [[Tintagel]] and earthworks such as the [[Wansdyke (earthwork)|Wansdyke]]. Such interpretations continue to attract the popular imagination and the scepticism of academics.

While pushed back politically and linguistically, British scholars and ecclesiastics had a significant impact on the Anglo-Saxon newcomers through literacy, ecclesiastical social constructs and historical memory of the Roman period in Britain, particularly after the Christianizing of the Anglo-Saxons. Coming from a fully oral cultural background, the Anglo-Saxons were heavily influenced by the more developed Christianized and literate culture of the Britons. British scholars were often employed at Anglo-Saxon courts to assist in the management of the kingdoms. This reintroduced [[British culture]] to those parts of Britain lost to the British politically. The epitome of this process is the adoption of the legendary British war leader, [[King Arthur]], as the national hero of the English, due to the literary work of Welsh historians.

==Environmental change effects==
There is evidence for [[climate change]] in the 5th century, with conditions turning cooler and wetter. This shortened the growing season and made uplands unsuited to growing [[grain]]. [[Dendrochronology]] reveals a particular [[Climate changes of 535–536|climatic event in 540]].&lt;ref&gt;Davey, 'The Environs of South Cadbury', p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Jones suggests that declining agricultural production from land that was already fully exploited had considerable demographic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The End of Roman Britain'', pp.186-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population fluctuation==

===Theories for reduction===

====Background====
Slaves were important in the economy and the army in the Roman Empire. Estimates for the prevalence of slavery in the Roman Empire vary: some estimate that around 30% of the population of the Empire in the 1st century was enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to History]&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent study suggests 10-15% even for the early empire "as any greater estimate would require implausible levels of transformation in a pre-modern context."&lt;ref&gt;Slavery in the Later Roman World, CE 275-450, pp. 59-60, Kyle Harper, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The difference the lower percentage in the Later Roman Empire can be attributed to fewer slaves in sub elite households and agricultural estates&lt;ref&gt;op. cit, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; (replaced by a great expansion in various types of tenancy).&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic region was one of the main sources of slaves. It was mainly wholesale dealers, who followed the Roman armies, who sold slaves. After the Empire expanded, there were fewer places to obtain slaves. Around 210, [[piracy]] increased around the North Sea and boosted the supply, taken from villages in that area, along with those captured for ransom.  

Britain was not easily defensible. It did not pay completely the costs of occupation. Nevertheless the Romans were forced to keep 3 or 4 legions, 30-40,000 men with auxiliary units in place to defend it. They managed fairly well until the collapse of Roman authority after the garrison was reduced in size by Maximus in 388 and Stilicho in 401. It seems that post-350 the Roman government was having more difficulty in recruiting soldiers. 

In an effort to remedy the situation it resorted to payment instead of provision of recruit, the [[aurum tironicum]].  Landowners could pay a set fee to prevent any of their tenants from being pressed into the army (slaves were rarely resorted to even at critical moments in exchange for their freedom).&lt;ref&gt;A.H. M. Jones, LRE. pp. 184, 363, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Not enough men wanted to enter military service.  The gold from the tax led to a greater use of Germanic or other tribal groups who did not need to be expensively equipped, housed and paid pensions, as the tax was used to recruit mercenaries as Foederati, but it also drained the Treasury. Previously foreigners were put into units, the ''auxilia'', officered by Romans. Roman army units, the smaller Later Roman legions, continued to exist but gradually disappeared in the 5th century leaving defense of the Empire to hirelings. 

After the [[Battle of Adrianople]], the [[Foederati]], by the Treaty of 382, were allowed to remain with the Empire intact, which reversed the centuries-old Roman policy of destroying barbarian enemies by killing them all, selling them or incorporating them into the Roman army by scattering them across units. The [[Hospitalitas system]] granted a third of the land (or fees) of a region to barbarians who had invaded and occupied those lands assigned to them. In return, these people declared loyalty to the Emperor and provided military support, whilst retaining their independence. If the theory is correct, Germanic peoples may have been resident in Britain before and after these reforms. One thing led to another to create a spiral. 

The policy of substituting mercenaries who were paid in gold which should have gone to support the professional standing army and accommodation to their presence spelled the doom of the Western Empire. The ''federates,'' operating from within the boundaries of the Empire, eventually became the new landlords, as there was no professional Roman army to subdue them. 

Ancient authors bitterly comment on this series of policy mistakes. The East which relied far less on mercenaries escaped Britain's fate. The Britons in the decades post-410 repeated the mistakes the emperors had done with the Visigoths, Burgundians, Sueves, Vandals and Franks - they invited mercenaries to protect them, then those same mercenaries subsequently took control over Britain.

====Plague of Justinian====
{{Main|Plague of Justinian}}
The population of Britain may have decreased by between 1.5 and 3 million after the Roman period, perhaps caused by environmental changes (the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]]) and, subsequently, by [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[smallpox]] (around 600, the smallpox spread from India into Europe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1200696 Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the Plague of Justinian entered the [[Mediterranean]] world in the 6th century and first arrived in the British Isles in 544 or 545, when it reached Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2279/is_n156/ai_20059971/pg_2 6th-10th century AD]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated{{By whom|date=January 2012}} that the [[Plague of Justinian]] killed as many as 100 million people across the world. As a result, [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] fell by around 50% between 550 and 700.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The later medieval Welsh [[Lludd and Llefelys]] mentions a series of three plagues affecting the British of London.

====Anglo-Saxon settlement====
According to research led by [[University College London]], [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlers could have enjoyed a substantial social and economic advantage over the native [[Britons (Celtic people)|Celtic Britons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm English and Welsh are races apart]&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in what is now [[England]], for more than 300 years from the middle of the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1635457 Evidence for an apartheid-like social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/genetics/dn9575-apartheid-slashed-celtic-genes-in-early-england.html 'Apartheid' slashed Celtic genes in early England]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this scenario, assuming that the Anglo-Saxons were just Germanic [[Ingaevones]], has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/04/23/sciinvade123.xml Germanic invaders 'did not bring apartheid' to Anglo-Saxon Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13752-germanic-invaders-may-not-have-ruled-by-apatheid.html Germanic Invaders may not have ruled by apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John E Pattison. Is it necessary to assume an apartheid-like social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England? ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', 275(1650), 2423-2429, 2008 doi: 10.1098/rspb.2008.0352 http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1650/2423.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pattison, John E. (2011) "Integration versus Apartheid in post-Roman Britain: a Response to Thomas et al. (2008)," Human Biology: Vol. 83: Iss. 6, Article 9. pp.715-733, 2011. Abstract available at: http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol83/iss6/9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minor migrations theories====
The traditional view about the numbers of Anglo-Saxons arriving in Britain during this period has been deconstructed. Incoming people uniting with the existing population could explain why the island conquest was as slow and incomplete as it was, and why the island was exposed to external attacks by [[Danelaw|Danish pirates]] and [[Normans]], as well as other issues about the population composition.

===Stephen Oppenheimer's theory===
[[Stephen Oppenheimer]], basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have had a significant impact on the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an [[Iberians|Iberian]] genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the [[Basque people]] of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]], from 90% in [[Wales]] to 66% in [[East Anglia]]. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow&amp;nbsp;– one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe&amp;nbsp;– which occurred just after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. He reports work on linguistics by Forster and Toth which suggests that [[Indo-European languages]] began to fragment some 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. He claims that the [[Celtic languages]] split from the Indo-European earlier than previously suspected, some 6000 years ago. He claims that the English language split from the other [[Germanic languages]] before the Roman period, and became the English that was spoken by the [[Belgae]] tribes of what is now southern and eastern [[England]], northeastern France, and [[Belgium]] prior to their conquest by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and long before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/blog/?p=516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, S. (2006). The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story: Constable and Robinson, London. {{ISBN|978-1-84529-158-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Sykes]] came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer in his research, which he set forth in his 2006 published book ''Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History'', published in the United States and Canada as ''Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland''. In its summary of their article "Who were the Celts?", the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]] note, "It is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject. However, early studies have, so far, tended to produce implausible conclusions from very small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and archaeology".&lt;ref name="Amgueddfa 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts? ...

'''Trần Văn Giáp''' ([[Hanoi]], 1902 - 25 November 1973) was a Vietnamese historian who wrote the first widely published histories of [[Buddhism in Vietnam]] in French. The two volumes, for [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]] respectively were published in Paris in 1932. Giáp was an authority on Hán-Nôm (i.e. both Chinese and [[Vietnamese language|Demotic]] script) literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Weller Taylor|author2=John K. Whitmore|title=Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts|year=1995|page=83|quote=Giáp was undoubtedly a scholar well versed in the field of Hán-Nôm (i.e. Chinese and Demotic Script) literature, yet his knowledge of Buddhism in general and Chinese Buddhist history and literature in particular left much to be desired.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Vietnam he published various other histories in Vietnamese, both in Latin alphabet [[quốc ngữ]] and Chinese [[chữ Nho]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">The '''Welsh Archaeological Trusts''' consists of four Welsh [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Trust organisations established in the mid-1970s to respond to [[rescue archaeology]] together with providing a uniform local archaeology service across [[Wales]].

The Trusts maintain Historic [[Built environment|Environment]] Records for their respective areas to provide archaeological advice to central government, planning authorities and other public bodies. [[Cadw]] supports this [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] management together with associated archaeological projects and conservation of sites and historic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/housingandcommunity/grants/voluntary/archaeologicaltrusts/?lang=en  The Welsh Assembly Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

The four [[Charitable trust|trusts]] comprise:

*[[Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust]]
*[[Dyfed Archaeological Trust]]
*[[Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust]]
*[[Gwynedd Archaeological Trust]] 

On 1 July 2010 the four Welsh Trusts launched their online searchable HER website known as ''Archwilio'', at the Treftadaeth Conference in Swansea.
The site was launched by [[Alun Ffred Jones]] AM, Minister for Heritage, who observed ''“Wales is the first country in Britain that has made all its archaeological records available online”, and “Archwilio will be a tremendous asset not only for the people of Wales but also for those further afield who have an interest in the rich archaeology and cultural heritage of our country”''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ggat.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/the-welsh-trusts-launch-archwilio/ The Welsh Trusts launch Archwilio]&lt;/ref&gt; The site contains the combined record of the four Trusts and gives the public free access to over 100,000 pieces of information about historic sites across Wales.

{{Japanese name|Ōtori}}
{{nihongo|'''Ōtori Keisuke'''|大鳥 圭介||extra=14 April 1833 &amp;ndash; 15 June 1911}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] military leader and diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Louis G. (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vl7Auu2UVEsC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq= "Ōtori Keisuke"] in ''Japan at War: An Encyclopedia,'' p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Ōtori Keisuke was born in Akamatsu Village, in the [[Akō, Hyōgo|Akō]] domain of [[Harima Province]] (modern-day Hyōgo), the son of physician Kobayashi Naosuke. At a young age, he entered the Shizutani school in [[Bizen Province|Bizen]], engaging in [[Chinese studies]], and continued his education at the renowned [[Rangaku]] school of [[Ogata Kōan]], where he studied [[Dutch language]] and medicine.  Further learning was obtained in [[Edo]], where Ōtori travelled to attend the school of [[Tsuboi Tadamasu]], known for instructing students engaged in the study and translation of Dutch.  While in Edo he also received education from [[Egawa Tarōzaemon]] regarding [[military strategy]], and studied [[English language|English]] with [[Nakahama Manjirō]], thus coming into possession of an uncommonly thorough, for his era, appreciation of Western culture.  As a result, in 1859, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] appointed him as an instructor to its ''Kaiseijo'' institute, and it was from there that Ōtori entered the shogunate army.

===Time in the Tokugawa Army===
After entering the Tokugawa army, Ōtori displayed promise as a student, quickly becoming a senior instructor of [[infantry]] tactics.  After a period spent as a student of [[Jules Brunet]] in [[Yokohama]], learning specifics of French infantry tactics, he was promoted to ({{nihongo| Infantry Magistrate |歩兵奉行|Hohei bugyō}}), a rank equivalent to a four-star general in a modern Western army.

Ōtori used his status as a respected scholar of Western studies to take the rather unexpected step of making suggestions on governmental reform to the Shōgun. In 1864, he issued a petition expressing his views on the benefits of a [[bicameral legislature]] to the government. In his position with the military, Ōtori was able to create of an elite brigade, the [[Denshūtai]], modeled after advice provided by strategists attached to the [[French military mission to Japan (1867–68)|1867–68 French military mission to Japan]].  Consisting of 800 men, the Denshūtai's members were chosen on the basis of capability rather than background; a matter of particular determination for Ōtori, who remained mindful of his own relatively humble birth.

===Boshin War===
In the aftermath of military failure at the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]] in early 1868, Shōgun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] returned to Edo and expressed serious consideration towards pledging allegiance to the new [[Meiji government]].  Otori and [[Oguri Tadamasa]] did not intend to lay down their arms without battle, and indicated their intention to continue the war but, following the surrender of [[Edo Castle]], Ōtori gathered 500 men of the Shogunate Army at Hō'on-ji Temple in [[Asakusa]], and left Edo.  Upon arriving in [[Ichikawamisato|Ichikawa]] he joined with [[Hijikata Toshizō]] of the ''[[Shinsengumi]],'' [[Akizuki Tōnosuke]] of [[Aizu]], [[Tatsumi Naofumi]] of [[Kuwana, Mie|Kuwana]], and others, expanding his force to 2000 men. Dividing the infantry into three groups, he ordered them to attack.  One unit was marched towards [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]], defeating an Imperial Army detachment on the way at [[Oyama, Tochigi|Koyama]] in [[Shimotsuke Province]]. The detached unit under Hijikata had also defeated an Imperial army force at [[Utsunomiya]] Castle, and proceeded to enter the castle by way of Koyama.  Ultimately, however, for Ōtori Keisuke, there would be no more military victories.

Upon reaching the domain seat of [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Wakamatsu]], Ōtori's men mounted a fighting retreat while defending the western approaches to Aizu.  In his search for reinforcements, Ōtori unsuccessfully petitioned [[Matsudaira Katamori]] to gather peasants from the surrounding villages and, although continuing to remain in the vicinity of Wakamatsu for some time, was eventually forced to retreat in the face of an advance from the Imperial Army, making his way to [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]]. There he met with [[Enomoto Takeaki]], who had arrived in [[Matsushima Bay]] with six warships of the former Shogunate. Boarding these ships, the force headed for [[Hakodate]], [[Hokkaidō]].

Soon afterward, the [[Republic of Ezo]] was established, and as a result of the first attempt at [[democracy|democratic elections]] that Japan had ever seen, Ōtori was elected Minister of the Army. However, in terms of battlefield experience, Ōtori was expert mostly in theory; while his second-in-command [[Hijikata Toshizō]] was far more experienced in combat, and Ōtori's awkwardness, as well as his tendency to laugh and say ''Mata maketa yo!'' ("Oh I lost again!") in the face of defeat gave him a bad reputation with his men.

In the [[Battle of Hakodate]] when the Imperial Army surrounded the [[Goryōkaku]] fortress, [[Enomoto Takeaki]] wanted to go down fighting; however, it was Ōtori who suggested a peaceful surrender, changing Enomoto's mind with his words of "If it's dying you want you can do it anytime."

Ōtori was taken into custody and transferred to a prison in [[Tokyo]]; a building which ironically he had built himself as Ōdaira-mae Infantry Barracks.

===Later life===
While in prison, Ōtori continued to make use of his knowledge of Western learning, to the benefit of his fellow prisoners.  An anecdote recounts that during his imprisonment, he not only reformed the bad habits of the prison director, but also managed to institute a parliamentary system amongst the prisoners.

After his release in 1872, Ōtori agreed to work in the [[Meiji government]], first becoming involved in [[land reclamation]], and later becoming president of the [[Gakushūin]] Peers' School in 1886. In 1889, Ōtori was sent as an ambassador to [[China]]'s [[Qing dynasty]] and [[Korea]]'s [[Joseon]] dynasty. He also had an instrumental role in the opening of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

Ōtori was also involved in efforts to preserve history. Beginning in 1898, he assisted with the editing and publication of the magazine ''Kyū Bakufu'', which focused on archiving memoirs and accounts of the former Shogunate by the men who had made up its ranks. He also contributed to the building of a monument to the war dead in [[Hakodate]].

Ōtori Keisuke died from [[esophageal cancer]] two months after his 78th birthday.
