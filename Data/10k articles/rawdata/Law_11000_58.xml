{{Politics of Fiji}}
{{History of Fiji}}
[[Fiji]]'s [[Fijian general election, March 1977|parliamentary election]] of March 1977 precipitated a constitutional crisis, which was the first major challenge to the country's democratic institutions since independence in 1970.

Politics in the years before and after independence had been dominated by the conflicting interests of the [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] communities.  At that time, Indo-Fijians slightly outnumbered ethnic Fijians, but by holding a virtual monopoly of the ethnic Fijian vote and by making significant inroads into the Indo-Fijian electorate (taking almost a quarter of their votes in the [[Fijian general election, 1972|election of 1972]]), [[Kamisese Mara|''Ratu Sir'' Kamisese Mara]]'s [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]] had maintained its grip on power.  A split in the indigenous vote in 1977, however, resulted in a narrow win for the Indo-Fijian-dominated [[National Federation Party]] (NFP).  [[Sidiq Koya]], the NFP leader, was expected to become [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]].

Instead, the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], [[George Cakobau|''Ratu Sir'' George Cakobau]], called on Mara to form a [[caretaker government]], pending [[Fijian general election, September 1977|new elections]] scheduled for September.  The events that led to his decision, and his reasons for it, are still mired in controversy, with different parties involved telling different versions of the situation, and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] have abounded.  What is known is that a leadership struggle immediately following the election seriously fractured the NFP.  It failed to name a [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] for three days, and a crisis began to develop.  A prominent NFP parliamentarian, [[Jai Ram Reddy]], wondered aloud on national radio whether his party was ready to form a government, and whether it would in fact be able to do so.  Ratu Mara claimed in his 1996 autobiography, ''"[[The Pacific Way]]"'', that NFP politicians had approached him and asked him to remain in office, but with an NFP Cabinet; he claimed to have refused.

Some accused Reddy of sabotaging the formation of a government in order to challenge Koya for the leadership of the party, a charge that has never been proven.  Other possible traitors within the NFP were also named.  [[Fiji Labour Party]] leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] claimed in his 2004 book, ''"[[Children of the Indus]]"'', that parliamentarians [[Chand Ramrakha]] and [[Irene Jai Narayan]] had betrayed their own leader by telling the Governor-General that not all NFP caucus members would support Koya for Prime Minister.  "''There is also some basis to the story that Karam Ramrakha and Irene Jai Narayan had informed Ratu George secretly that Koya did not enjoy the support of all NFP parliamentarians. Regrettably, at the hour of his triumph Koya had been stabbed in the back by his own people,"'' he wrote (page 130).  Ramrakha, now a lawyer based in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], sued for defamation, saying that the claim was false and had damaged his reputation.

Others, both in Fiji and abroad, accused the Governor-General, a [[Ratu|high chief]] in the Fijian [[House of Chiefs (Fiji)|chiefly hierarchy]], of deliberate bias, and took his usurping of a popular election to preserve the government of his fellow-chief (and distant cousin), Ratu Mara, as an indication that the indigenous Fijian elite would not tolerate an Indo-Fijian-led government.  Proponents of this theory point to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|coups of 1987]] and [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|of 2000]], both of which toppled governments dominated or led by Indo-Fijians, as evidence of their belief.  Whether this controversial opinion is true or not, few doubt that Cakobau was pleased to be able to reappoint the government dominated by indigenous Fijians.

In a public statement, Ratu Cakobau defended his actions thus:

''"In the recent general election, the people of Fiji did not give a clear mandate to either of the major political parties. It therefore became the duty of the Governor-General under the Constitution to appoint as Prime Minister the Member of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] who appeared to him best able to command the support of the majority of the Members of the House. The Governor-General has not been able to act sooner as it was not until this afternoon that he was informed who had been elected leader of the National Federation Party. The Governor-General, after taking all relevant circumstances into account, has come to the firm conclusion that the person best able to command support of the majority of the Members is the Leader of the Alliance Party, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. In compliance with the Constitution and acting in his own deliberate judgment the Governor-General has accordingly appointed Ratu Sir Kamisese as Prime Minister."''

The September election called to resolve the impasse resulted in a landslide win for the Fijian Alliance, which remained in power for another decade.

The '''Agreement for the Suppression of the Circulation of Obscene Publications''' is a multilateral anti-pornography treaty that was initially negotiated and concluded in Paris in 1910. It was amended by a 1949 Protocol. As of 2013, the treaty has 57 state parties.

The treaty was concluded on 4 May 1910 in Paris and was initially entitled the '''Agreement for the Repression of Obscene Publications'''. The treaty was initially agreed to by a number of states, including [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[German Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the United States, the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Through the treaty, the states agreed to designate a government authority tasked with sharing with the other states information regarding obscenity offences "where the various acts constituting the offence have taken place in different countries". The treaty applied to "obscene writings, designs, pictures or objects". In 1923, states agreed to criminalise the creation, distribution, and trade of obscene works via the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene Publications]].

In 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] agreed to a Protocol which would amend the 1910 treaty. On 4 May 1949 at [[Lake Success, New York]], the Protocol was signed by a number of states. Ultimately, the Protocol was ratified by 35 states, which caused the revised treaty to come into force on 1 March 1950. One of the changes made by the Protocol was the name of the treaty. As of 2013, the 1949 version of the treaty remains in force and has 57 state parties.

'''Amount in controversy''' (sometimes called '''jurisdictional amount''') is a term used in [[civil procedure]] to denote the amount at stake in a lawsuit, in particular in connection with a requirement that persons seeking to bring a [[lawsuit]] in a particular [[court]] must be suing for a certain minimum amount (or below a certain maximum amount) before that court may hear the case.

==United States==
{{US fed civ pro}}
===In federal courts===
====Diversity jurisdiction====
In [[United States federal courts]], the term currently applies only to cases brought under [[diversity jurisdiction]], meaning that the court is able to hear the case only because it is between citizens of different states. In such cases, the [[U.S. Congress]] has decreed in 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) that the court may hear such suits only where "the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000." This amount represents a significant increase from earlier years.

Congress first established the amount in controversy requirement when it created diversity jurisdiction in the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], pursuant to its powers under [[Article III of the U.S. Constitution]], the amount being $500. It was raised to $2,000 in 1887, to $3,000 in 1911, to $10,000 in 1958, to $50,000 in 1988, and finally to the current $75,000 in 1996.

The use of the word "exceeds" in Section 1332 implies that the amount in controversy must be more than $75,000; a case removed from state court to federal court must be remanded back to state court if the amount in controversy is exactly $75,000.00.&lt;ref&gt;''Freeland v. Liberty Mutual Fire. Ins. Co.'', 632 F.3d 250 (6th Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal question jurisdiction====
Congress did not create a consistent [[federal question jurisdiction]], which allows federal courts to hear any case alleging a violation of the Constitution, laws, and [[treaties]] of the United States, until 1875, when Congress created the statute which is now found at {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1331}}: "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." At that time, such cases had the same amount in controversy requirement as the diversity cases. Congress eliminated this requirement in actions against the United States in 1976 and in all federal question cases in 1980.

====Aggregation of claims====
Where a single plaintiff has multiple unrelated claims against a single defendant, that plaintiff can ''aggregate'' those claims &amp;ndash; that is, add the amounts together &amp;ndash; to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement. In cases involving more than one defendant, a plaintiff may aggregate the amount claimed against multiple defendants “only if the defendants are jointly liable.” ''Middle Tennessee News Co., Inc. v. Charnel of Cincinnati, Inc.'', 250 F.3d 1077, 1081 (7th Cir.  2001). However, “if the defendants are severally liable, plaintiff must satisfy the amount in controversy requirement against each individual defendant.” The 5-4 decision in ''[[Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.]]'', 545 U.S. 546 (2005), held that a federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over claims of other plaintiffs who do not meet the jurisdictional amount for a diversity action, when at least one plaintiff in the action does satisfy the jurisdictional amount.

====Legal certainty test==== 
The standard for [[Involuntary dismissal|dismissing]] a [[complaint]] for lack of meeting the amount in controversy is a rather high one in federal court.  In 1938, Justice [[Owen Roberts]] set forth the "legal-certainty test",&lt;ref&gt;Subrin, Stephen N.; [[Martha Minow|Minow, Martha L.]]; Brodin, Mark S.; and Main, Thomas O.  ''Civil Procedure:  Doctrine, Practice, and Context, Second Edition''.  p. 698.  [[Aspen Publishers]], 2004.  {{ISBN|0-7355-4086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still used today:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It must appear to a '''legal certainty''' that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.  The inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his bad faith or oust the jurisdiction.  Nor does the fact that the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense to the claim.  But if, from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent to a legal certainty that the plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed or if, from the proofs, the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount, and that his claim was therefore colorable for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, the suit will be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/303/283/case.html ''St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.'', 303 U.S. 283, 289 (1938)] (''emphasis added'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The validity of the amount of [[damages]] claimed is considered a threshold [[Question of law|issue of law]] for a judge to decide at the commencement of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/8145/Legal-Certainty.html Thomson-Gale Encyclopedia of American Law, courtesy of Jrank]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The legal certainty test is often heavily litigated in [[personal injury]] or [[wrongful death]] cases, in the situation where they are [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] by a defendant to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, and then the plaintiff moves to remand to state court.  Since the 1970s, many states have prohibited plaintiffs in such cases from demanding a specific amount of money in the [[ad quod damnum|ad damnum]] section of their complaints, because of serious problems with unscrupulous attorneys gaining undue publicity by simply demanding outrageous and unrealistic damage amounts like $1 trillion.  Therefore, many such complaints cannot and do not state an amount in controversy on their face, which puts defendants in the awkward position of having to submit evidence to the federal court that plaintiffs ''could'' theoretically recover a sum in excess of $75,000, while simultaneously maintaining that plaintiffs are not entitled to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Singer v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.'', 116 F.3d 373 (9th Cir. 1997).  The court explained: "The parties to this case were caught between the California statute prohibiting statement of an ad damnum, and the traditional federal removal framework, which bases removal on the amount stated in the ad damnum."&lt;/ref&gt;

===In state courts===
Each state has the power to set its own amount in controversy requirements for its own courts, but every state must offer some outlet for citizens to sue for violations of their rights, even if they are seeking no money. Most states have several levels of trial courts, with different amount-in-controversy requirements which must be met to gain access to higher levels of courts. For example, in the state of [[Virginia]], the lowest level of court, the [[Virginia General District Court]] has exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases where the amount in controversy is $4,500 or less, and shares authority with the [[Virginia Circuit Court]] to try cases involving sums above $4,500 and up to $25,000. The Virginia Circuit Court, in turn, has exclusive jurisdiction where the amount in controversy is greater than $25,000.

A few states like California have decided that it is more efficient to unify all trial courts so that judges and support staff can be more easily reassigned where needed.  However, in California, nearly all lawsuits involving an amount in controversy up to $25,000 are classified as "limited civil actions," which are subject to special simplified procedural rules intended to hold down litigation costs.&lt;ref&gt;See [[California Code of Civil Procedure]] Section 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglo-Saxon charters''' are documents from the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval period in England]], which typically made a grant of [[Real Estate|land]], or recorded a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s: the oldest surviving charters granted land to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], but from the eighth century, surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to [[lay person|lay people]].

The term ''charter'' covers a range of written legal documentation including diplomas, [[writ]]s and [[Will and testament|wills]].&lt;ref name=Sawyer&gt;P.H. Sawyer, ''Anglo-Saxon Charters: an Annotated List and Bibliography'', (London, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on [[parchment]] in [[Latin]], but often contained sections in the [[vernacular]], describing the bounds of [[Estate (land)|estates]], which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early [[Normans|Norman]] periods. Land held by virtue of a charter was known as ''[[Bookland (type of land)|bookland]]''.

Charters have provided [[historian]]s with fundamental source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon England, complementing the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and other literary sources. They are catalogued in [[Peter Hayes Sawyer|Peter Sawyer]]'s ''Annotated List'' and are usually referred to by their Sawyer number (e.g. S407).

The Anglo-Saxon charter can take many forms: it can be a [[lease]] (often presented as a [[chirograph]]), a will, an agreement, a writ or, most commonly, a grant of land.&lt;ref name=Sawyer/&gt; Our picture is skewed towards those that regard land, particularly in the earlier period (though it must also be admitted that the emergence of wills and chirorographs also owed much to later development).  Land charters can further be subdivided into ''royal charters'', or diplomas, and ''private charters'' (donations by figures other than the king).

Over a thousand Anglo-Saxon charters are extant today, as a result of being maintained in the archives of [[Monastery|religious houses]]. These preserved their charters so as to record their right to land. The oldest extant original charter, now in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] archive, was issued in 679 by King [[Hlothhere of Kent|Hlothhere]] of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] granting land to the [[Reculver Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S 8|url=http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/8.html|website=The Electronic Sawyer: Online catalogue of Anglo-Saxon charters|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some surviving charters are later copies, which sometimes include [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Worcestershire Anglo-Saxon charter bounds|first1=Della|last1=Hooke|first2=P. H.|last2=Sawyer|publisher=Boydell|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-Saxon charters were sometimes used in [[Anglo-Saxon laws|legal disputes]], and the recording of the contents of a charter within a legal document has ensured the survival of text when the original charter has been lost. Overall, some two hundred charters exist in the original form, whilst others are post-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] copies, that were often made by the compilers of [[Cartulary|cartularies]] (collections of [[deed|title-deeds]]) or by early modern [[Antiquary|antiquaries]]. The earliest cartularies containing copies of Anglo-Saxon charters come from Worcester, early-11th-century ''Liber Wigorniensis'' and ''[[Hemming's Cartulary]]'' of a century later; a much later example, ''Wilton Cartulary'', compiled in the mid-13th century at [[Wilton Abbey]], still includes a significant amount of Anglo-Saxon material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartularies|url=http://www.kemble.asnc.cam.ac.uk/node/212|website=Kemble: The Anglo-Saxon Charters Website|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of charters in legal disputes over land as evidence of [[Real Estate|land]] tenure, gave rise to numerous charter [[Forgery|forgeries]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010212150101/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/chartwww/STEVEN~1/stev04.htm Stephenson's 1898 lectures on "The Anglo-Saxon Chancery"]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes by those same monastic houses in whose archives they were preserved. The primary motivation for forging charters was to provide evidence of [[Property|rights]] to land. Often forging was focussed on providing written evidence for the holdings recorded as belonging to a religious house in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''. It is important when studying charters to establish their authenticity.  The study of charters to determine authenticity gave rise to [[diplomatics]] – the science of ancient documents.

Anglo-Saxon charters are catalogued in [[Peter Hayes Sawyer|Peter Sawyer]]'s 'Annotated List',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sawyer|first= P.H.|year=1968|title=Anglo-Saxon Charters: an Annotated List and Bibliography|place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are usually referred to by their Sawyer number (e.g. S407).

== Charter forms ==
[[File:Aethelbald charter Cyneberht 736.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ismere Diploma]], a 736 charter of king [[Æthelbald of Mercia]]]]
The three most common forms of Anglo-Saxon charter are diplomas, writs and wills.

=== Diplomas ===
The largest number of surviving charters are diplomas, or royal charters, that granted privileges and rights, usually over land. The typical diploma had three sections:&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic William Maitland|F.W. Maitland]], ''Domesday Book and Beyond'' (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; ''protocol'', ''corpus'', and ''[[eschatocol]]''. The protocol opened the charter by invoking [[God]] and enumerating the pious considerations for the King's act (proem). The corpus was usually in Latin and named the [[beneficiary]], recorded the grant or transfer (dispositive clause), reserved common burdens (reservation clause) and invoked the wrath of God on anyone who failed to observe it (anathema or sanction). The corpus' final section, which was often in [[Old English language|Old English]], described the boundaries of the land (boundary clause). The eschatocol was composed of a dating clause and witness-list, which usually included powerful lay and ecclesiastical members of the [[Court (royal)|king's court]].

Much of the language of the diploma was explicitly religious&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Stenton]], ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (OUP, reissued 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; - that a grant was made for the benefit of the grantor's [[soul]] or that anyone breaking the charter would be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]. Charters typically opened by situating themselves firmly within the [[Christianity|Christian order]], with a pictorial ([[Christian cross|cross]], [[Chi Rho|chrismon]] or [[Alpha and Omega|alpha-omega]]) and a verbal invocation to God. Many early charters were granted in anticipation of the founding of a [[monastery]]. The document served a largely [[Secularity|secular]] purpose&amp;nbsp;— to document the legal possession of land and to free that land from certain duties that would otherwise be attached to it.

=== Writs ===
[[File:S 1140 Writ of King Edward to Westminster Abbey granting land at Perton AD 1062 x 1066 (Westminster Abbey, W. A. M. XII).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Writ of King [[Edward the Confessor]] granting land at [[Perton]] in [[Staffordshire]] to [[Westminster Abbey]], 1062–1066]]
The second most common form of Anglo-Saxon charter, although far fewer in number than the diploma, is the royal writ. These differed from the diploma in both form and function. A writ was an instruction from the king to a named official or group of recipients. It started with a greeting and was authenticated by a royal seal. The writ did not require witnesses and was often written in [[Old English]].&lt;ref name=Harmer&gt;{{cite book|first=Florence|last=Harmer|authorlink=Florence Harmer|title=Anglo-Saxon Writs (compilation)|year=1989|publisher=Paul Watkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the Normans, the use of writs was extended to cover many other aspects of royal business and was written in Latin. [[Florence Harmer]] provided the text (and translation when written in Old English) of 120 pre-Conquest royal writs.

=== Wills ===
[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Opening page of [[Alfred the Great]]'s will drawn up circa 885 (11th-century copy)]]
Anglo-Saxon wills were intended to make gifts of property (including land) after the writer's death, but they were not wills in the modern sense.&lt;ref name=Whitelock /&gt;

Wills are rarer than writs. The first dedicated study, ''Anglo-Saxon Wills'' by [[Dorothy Whitelock]] was able to identify 39 documents.&lt;ref name=Whitelock&gt;{{cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Wills|first=Dorothy|last=Whitelock|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1930|authorlink=Dorothy Whitelock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number grew to 55 with publication of another 16 among the ''Anglo-Saxon Charters'' by Agnes Jane Robertson in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Agnes Jane Robertson]]|title=Anglo-Saxon Charters|date=1939|publisher=Cambridge University Press}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGGPx-41OtgC google books preview] of the 2009 reissue&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1939, contributions to the list were few and far between; in her 2011 ''Wills and Will-making in Anglo-Saxon England'' Linda Tollerton published the most up-to-date corpus, with 68 examples in total. The surviving documents are very unevenly distributed both in time and space: from the 9th century, for example, only 9 wills are known, and 6 of them are in  Canterbury. Not a single will from any period is known from further North than [[Burton upon Trent]] in [[Staffordshire]]. Furthermore, only 22 wills can be found in manuscripts written before 1066; originals are even rarer, as some, like those of [[Alfred the Great]] or [[Wulfric Spot]], are known to be pre-Conquest copies, while still other may in fact be mere extracts or ancient forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Tollerton|title=Wills and Will-making in Anglo-Saxon England|date=2011|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|isbn=9781903153376}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=dX4pBw0QtF4C&amp;pg=PA1 google books preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two wills of kings have been preserved, those of [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] and [[Eadred]], both in later copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/1507.html S 1507]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/1515.html S 1515]&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Saxon women whose wills survive include [[Wynflaed|Wynflæd]] (mother of [[Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury]] and grandmother of Kings [[Eadwig]] and [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/1539.html S 1539]&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Edmund I]]'s second wife [[Æthelflæd of Damerham|Æthelflæd]] and her sister Ælfflæd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/1494.html S 1494]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/1486.html S 1486]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boundary descriptions ==

A typical royal diploma had a clause describing the boundaries of the territory that is the subject of the charter. There are also boundary descriptions in a number of leases and two wills. In the earliest examples, these boundary descriptions are short, in Latin and with few boundary points. In time, the descriptions became longer, more detailed and written in Old English. By the end of the 9th century, all boundary clauses were written in Old English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Reed|title=Discovering Past Landscapes|publisher=Croom Helm|year=1984|chapter=Anglo-Saxon Charter Boundaries|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many charters, particularly those that have survived in later copies, do not have boundary clauses. In some instances, space has been left for a boundary clause that was never copied. A few boundary descriptions survive that do not appear to be related to any surviving charter.

The content of these boundary descriptions varied, but in many instances these descriptions revealed the Anglo-Saxons' ideas about their landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langscape.org.uk/index.html The Language of Landscape: Reading the Anglo-Saxon Countryside]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical significance ==
[[File:Edgar from Winchester Charter.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A page from the charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] to the [[New Minster, Winchester]]. Unusually, the charter is in the form of a book.]]

Charters have provided fundamental source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon England that complements the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and other literary sources. They are often used by historians as sources for the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref&gt;For example {{cite book|title=The diplomas of King Æthelred the Unready 978 - 1016: A study in their use as historical evidence|first= S D|last=Keynes|publisher=Cambridge|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently kings who gave land in charters. By seeing what land was awarded, it is possible to see the extent of a king's control and how he exercised his power. In 846, [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]] granted land in [[Devon]] by charter, perhaps dividing the spoils from this recently conquered territory among his men.

Charters give lists of persons that attested the document and so it is possible to see who was present at the king's court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/haywardp/hist422/seminars/eight.htm Sources for Medieval History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206092725/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/haywardp/hist422/seminars/eight.htm |date=February 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very detailed diplomas drafted by the scribe known as "[[Æthelstan A]]" show that several [[Wales|Welsh]] kings, including [[Hywel Dda]], attended the court of [[Æthelstan]] in the late 920s and the 930s. A person's absence from court can be equally revealing: [[Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York]] from 931 to 956, failed to attest any royal charters between 936 and 941, during which time the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] was fought between Æthelstan and an alliance of the [[Hiberno-Norse]] king of [[Dublin]], [[Olaf Guthfrithson]] and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] king, [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine]]. Wulfstan was rather independently-minded and his absence from the [[Wessex|West Saxon]] court can be linked with possible participation at Brunanburh and his later activity as a kind of [[kingmaker]] in [[York]]. It is also possible to trace a man's career at court through his position in the witness list, as in the case of [[Eadric Streona]] at the court of [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred 'the Unready']] in the early 11th century.

Burdens that were due by landowners to the [[monarch|king]], such as providing [[soldiers]], resources and man-power, were sometimes relieved in charters.&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://ascharters.net/charters/1186a?q=&amp;page= charter S1186a] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015939/http://ascharters.net/charters/1186a?q=&amp;page= |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives historians the opportunity to examine aspects of Anglo-Saxon society.

==Published charters==
A joint committee of the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Historical Society]] was set up in 1966 to oversee a definitive edition of the entire corpus of Anglo-Saxon charters. The edition is to be published in approximately thirty volumes. The late Professor [[Nicholas Brooks]] was chairman of the committee in charge; he has been replaced by Professor [[Simon Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050601083502/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/chartwww/charthome.html Anglo Saxon Charters Homepage]; [https://www.britac.ac.uk/arp/ascharters.cfm British Academy Anglo-Saxon Charters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215355/https://www.britac.ac.uk/arp/ascharters.cfm |date=April 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following volumes have been published as of 2016:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/anglo-saxon-charters|title=Anglo-Saxon Charters|publisher=British Academy|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JanBrewer PresObama.jpg|thumb|Then-Governor of Arizona [[Jan Brewer]] meeting with then-President [[Barack Obama]] in June 2010 in the wake of SB&amp;nbsp;1070, to discuss immigration and border security issues.&lt;ref name="az-wh-meet"/&gt;]]
The '''Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act''' (introduced as '''Arizona Senate Bill 1070''' and thus often referred to simply as '''Arizona SB&amp;nbsp;1070''') is a 2010 legislative [[Act (document)|Act]] in the U.S. state of [[Arizona]] that at the time of passage in 2010 was the broadest and strictest anti-[[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] measure passed in the United States.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;  It has received national and international attention and has spurred considerable controversy.&lt;ref name=CNN_LA_boycott/&gt;&lt;ref name="az-3mo"/&gt;

U.S. Federal law requires aliens older than 18 to possess proper identification at all times; violation of this requirement is a federal [[misdemeanor]] crime.&lt;ref name="usc|8|1304e"&gt;{{usc|8|1304(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arizona act additionally made it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents,&lt;ref name="sb1070sect3"/&gt; required that state law enforcement officers attempt to determine an individual's immigration status during a "lawful stop, detention or arrest", when there is [[reasonable suspicion]] that the individual is an illegal immigrant.&lt;ref name="hb2162sect3"&gt;Police may "transport" said alien to a federal facility "in this state or any other point" where such a facility exists.  Arizona HB&amp;nbsp;2162, §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radiolingua.com/2010/06/news-time-spanish-premium-samples/ | title=News Time Spanish  | date=June 1, 2010 | publisher=[[Radio Lingua Network]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law barred state or local officials or agencies from restricting enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s,&lt;ref name="sb1070sect2"/&gt; and imposed penalties on those sheltering, hiring and transporting unregistered aliens.&lt;ref name="sb1070sect5"/&gt; The paragraph on intent in the legislation says it embodies an "attrition through enforcement" doctrine.&lt;ref name="sb1070sect1"&gt;Arizona SB&amp;nbsp;1070, §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cis-attr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cis.org/Enforcement-IllegalPopulation | publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]] | title=Attrition Through Enforcement: A Cost-Effective Strategy to Shrink the Illegal Population | author=Vaughan, Jessica M. | date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the legislation say it encourages [[racial profiling]], while supporters say the law prohibits the use of race as the sole basis for investigating immigration status.&lt;ref name="ap-dissa-2"/&gt;  The law was modified by Arizona House Bill 2162 within a week of its signing with the goal of addressing some of these concerns. There have been protests in opposition to the law in over 70 U.S. cities,&lt;ref name="cbc-may1"/&gt; including boycotts and calls for boycotts of Arizona.&lt;ref name="wapo-boy"/&gt;

The Act was signed into law by Governor [[Jan Brewer]] on April 23, 2010.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html?ref=us | title=U.S.'s Toughest Immigration Law Is Signed in Arizona | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 24, 2010 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was scheduled to go into effect on July 29, 2010, ninety days after [[Adjournment sine die|the end of the legislative session]].&lt;ref name="geneffdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azleg.gov/GeneralEffectiveDates.asp | publisher=[[Arizona State Legislature]] | title=General Effective Dates | accessdate = April 30, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100514150141/http://www.azleg.gov/GeneralEffectiveDates.asp| archivedate= May 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars1-103"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/1/00103.htm | title=Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 1-103 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | author=[[Arizona State Legislature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal challenges over its [[constitutionality]] and compliance with [[civil rights]] law were filed, including one by the [[United States Department of Justice]], that also asked for an injunction against enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name="Feds sue" /&gt;  The day before the law was to take effect, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked the law's most controversial provisions.&lt;ref name="cnn-blocks"/&gt;  In June 2012, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled on the case ''[[Arizona v. United States]]'', upholding the provision requiring immigration status checks during law enforcement stops but striking down three other provisions as violations of the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="wapo-sc-ruling"/&gt;

== Provisions ==
U.S. federal law requires aliens 14 years old or older who are in the country for longer than 30 days to register with the U.S. government&lt;ref name="usc|8|1302"&gt;{{usc|8|1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have registration documents in their possession at all times.&lt;ref name="usc|8|1304e"/&gt; The Act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an illegal alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents&lt;ref name="sb1070sect3"&gt;Arizona SB&amp;nbsp;1070, §3.&lt;/ref&gt; and obligates police to make an attempt, when practicable during a "lawful stop, detention or arrest",&lt;ref name="hb2162sect3"/&gt; to determine a person's immigration status if there is [[reasonable suspicion]] that the person is an illegal alien.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect2&gt;Arizona SB&amp;nbsp;1070, §2.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Judge Bolton's Jul 28, 2010 injunction held that the literal requirement to arrest "any person" applied --&gt;Any person arrested cannot be released without confirmation of the person's legal immigration status by the federal government pursuant to §&amp;nbsp;1373(c) of [[Title 8 of the United States Code]].&lt;ref name="sb1070sect2"/&gt; A first offense carries a fine of up to $100, plus court costs, and up to 20&amp;nbsp;days in jail; subsequent offenses can result in up to 30&amp;nbsp;days in jail&lt;ref name="hb2162sect4"&gt;Arizona HB&amp;nbsp;2162, §4.&lt;/ref&gt; (SB&amp;nbsp;1070 required a ''minimum'' fine of $500 for a first violation, and for a second violation a minimum $1,000 fine and a maximum jail sentence of 6 months).&lt;ref name=sb1070sect5&gt;Arizona SB&amp;nbsp;1070, §5.&lt;/ref&gt; A person is "presumed to not&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE: the wording of the law is indeed "not... unlawfully" (double negative)--&gt; be an immigrant who is unlawfully present in the United States" if he or she presents any of the following four forms of identification: a valid Arizona [[Driver's license in the United States|driver license]]; a valid Arizona [[Driver's license in the United States#Non-driver identification cards|nonoperating identification license]]; a valid [[Blood quantum laws|tribal enrollment card]] or other tribal identification; or any valid [[Identity documents in the United States|federal, state, or local government-issued identification]], if the issuer requires proof of legal presence in the United States as a condition of issuance.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect2/&gt;

The Act also prohibits state, county, and local officials from limiting or restricting "the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law" and provides that any legal Arizona resident can sue the agencies or officials in question to compel such full enforcement.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect2/&gt;&lt;ref name="az-signing"/&gt; If the person who brings suit prevails, that person may be entitled to reimbursement of court costs and reasonable attorney fees.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect2/&gt;

In addition, the Act makes it a crime for anyone, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, to hire or to be hired from a vehicle which "blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic." Vehicles used in such manner are subject to mandatory immobilization or impoundment. Moreover, for a person in violation of a criminal law, it is an additional offense to transport an illegal alien "in furtherance" of the illegal alien's unauthorized presence in the U.S., to "conceal, harbor or shield" an illegal alien, or to encourage or induce an illegal alien to immigrate to the state, if the person "knows or recklessly disregards the fact" that the alien is in the U.S. without authorization or that immigration would be illegal.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect5/&gt; Violation is a class&amp;nbsp;1 misdemeanor if fewer than ten illegal aliens are involved, and a class&amp;nbsp;6 felony if ten or more are involved. The offender is subject to a fine of at least $1,000 for each illegal alien involved. The transportation provision includes exceptions for child protective services workers, and ambulance attendants and emergency medical technicians.&lt;ref name=sb1070sect5/&gt;

===Arizona HB 2162===
On April 30, 2010, the Arizona legislature passed and Governor Brewer signed, House Bill 2162, which modified the Act that had been signed a week earlier, with the amended text stating that "prosecutors would not investigate complaints based on race, color or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/04/30/arizona.immigration.law.changes/ | title=Arizona governor signs changes into immigration law | author=Silverleib, Alan | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new text also states that police may only investigate immigration status incident to a "lawful stop, detention, or arrest", lowers the original fine from a minimum of $500(?) to a maximum of $100,&lt;ref name="hb2162sect4"/&gt; and changes incarceration limits  for first-time offenders from 6&amp;nbsp;months to 20&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name="hb2162sect3"/&gt;

==Background and passage==
Arizona is the first state to enact such far-reaching legislation.&lt;ref name="az-chal"/&gt; Prior law in Arizona, like the law in most other states, does not mandate that law enforcement personnel ask about the immigration status of those they encounter.&lt;ref name="ap-dissa"/&gt;  Many police departments discourage such inquiries to avoid deterring immigrants from reporting crimes and cooperating in other investigations.&lt;ref name="ap-dissa"/&gt;

Arizona had an estimated 460,000 illegal aliens in April 2010,&lt;ref name="ap-dissa"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/24/AR2010042402200.html | title=Immigration advocacy groups to challenge Arizona law | author=Cooper, Jonathan J. | author2=Davenport, Paul| agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure that had increased fivefold since 1990.&lt;ref name="ap-oth-border"/&gt;  As the state with the most illegal crossings of the [[Mexico – United States border]], its remote and dangerous deserts are the unlawful entry point for thousands of illegal Mexicans and Central Americans.&lt;ref name="ap-dissa-2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36768649/ | title=Ariz. immigration law target of protest | author=Cooper, Jonathan J. | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1990s, Tucson Border Patrol Sector had become the location for the most number of arrests by the [[United States Border Patrol]].&lt;ref name="ap-oth-border"/&gt;

Whether illegal aliens commit a disproportionate number of crimes is uncertain, with different authorities and academics claiming that the rate for this group was the same, greater, or less than that of the overall population.&lt;ref name="nyt-crime-rates"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/us/20crime.html | title=On Border Violence, Truth Pales Compared to Ideas | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 20, 2010 | page=18}} The decreased rate in property crimes was noted in a correction on June 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also anxiety that the  [[Mexican Drug War]], which had caused thousands of deaths, would spill over into the U.S.&lt;ref name="nyt-crime-rates"/&gt;  Moreover, by the late 2000s (decade) Phoenix was seeing an average of one kidnapping per day, earning it the reputation as America's worst city in that regard.&lt;ref name="ap-oth-border"/&gt;

Arizona has a history of passing restrictions on illegal immigration, including legislation in 2007 that imposed heavy sanctions on employers hiring illegal aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070601929_pf.html | author=[[David S. Broder|Broder, David S.]] | title=Arizona's Border Burden | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measures similar to SB&amp;nbsp;1070 had been passed by the legislature in 2006 and 2008, only to be vetoed by Democratic Governor [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mex-amer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/immigration-law/SB-1070_p2.html |title=Governor Jan Brewer Signs (S.B. 1070) Toughest Illegal Immigration Law in U.S. |first=Tito |last=Rodriguez |publisher=Mexican-American.org |date=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513024102/http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/immigration-law/SB-1070_p2.html |archivedate=May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time-battle"/&gt; She was subsequently appointed as [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] in the [[Obama administration]] and was replaced by Republican [[Secretary of State of Arizona]] Jan Brewer.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wkpo-law"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/politics/23179490/detail.html |title=Ariz.

The 'attrition through enforcement' doctrine is one that think tanks such as the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] have been supporting for several years.&lt;ref name="cis-attr"/&gt;

[[File:Russell Pearce by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|State Senator [[Russell Pearce]], sponsor of the bill]]
Impetus for SB&amp;nbsp;1070 is attributed to shifting demographics leading to a larger Hispanic population, increased drugs- and human smuggling-related violence in Mexico and Arizona, and a struggling state economy and economic anxiety during the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref name="az-3mo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-reasons"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29arizona.html | title=Welcome to Arizona, Outpost of Contradictions | author=Archibold, Randal C. | author2=Steinhauer, Jennifer | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 29, 2010 | page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; State residents were also frustrated by the lack of federal progress on immigration,&lt;ref name="az-3mo"/&gt; which they viewed as even more disappointing given that Napolitano was in the administration.&lt;ref name="nyt-reasons"/&gt;

The major sponsor of, and legislative force behind, the bill was State Senator [[Russell Pearce]], who had long been one of Arizona's most vocal opponents of illegal aliens&lt;ref name="wkpo-house"/&gt; and who had successfully pushed through several prior pieces of tough legislation against those he termed "invaders on the American sovereignty".&lt;ref name="npr20080312"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man Behind Arizona's Toughest Immigrant Laws|first=Ted|last=Robbins|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=March 12, 2008|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88125098|work=[[Morning Edition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="az-p-k"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/05/31/20100531arizona-immigration-law-kris-kobach.html | title=Arizona immigration law was crafted by activist | author=Rau, Alia Beard | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the drafting of the bill was done by [[Kris Kobach]],&lt;ref name="az-p-k"/&gt; a professor at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law]]&lt;ref name="time-bill"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1982268,00.html | title=Arizona's Tough New Law Against Illegal Immigrants | author=O'Leary, Kevin | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a figure long associated with the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] who had written immigration-related bills in many other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;  Pearce and Kobach had worked together on past legislative efforts regarding immigration, and Pearce contacted Kobach when he was ready to pursue the idea of the state enforcing federal immigration laws.&lt;ref name="az-p-k"/&gt;  A December 2009 meeting of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) in Washington, D.C., resulted in that body drafting [[model act|model legislation]] that embodied the ideas that Pearce presented.&lt;ref name="npr-origins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130833741 | title=Prison Economics Help Drive Ariz. Immigration Law | author=[[Laura Sullivan|Sullivan, Laura]] | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(One theory explaining the impetus behind the bill was that ALEC is largely funded by contributions of corporate members and among those members are several companies in the private prisons industry, such as the [[Corrections Corporation of America]], [[Management and Training Corporation]], and [[GEO Group]], and that these companies stood to benefit by a large increase in the number of illegal aliens being sent to jail.&lt;ref name="npr-origins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="int-corps"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/6084/corporate_con_game/ | title=Corporate Con Game | magazine=[[In These Times]] | first= Beau | last=Hodai | date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearce later denied that he created the bill for any reason other than stopping illegal immigration and denied that he submitted the idea to ALEC for any reason other than helping it pass in Arizona and, potentially, in other states.&lt;ref name="npr-origins"/&gt;)

The proposed bill reached the Arizona legislature in January 2010 and gained 36 cosponsors.&lt;ref name="npr-origins"/&gt;  The [[Arizona State Senate]] approved an early version of the bill in February 2010.&lt;ref name="wkpo-house"/&gt; Saying, "Enough is enough," Pearce stated figuratively that this new bill would remove handcuffs from law enforcement and place them on violent offenders.&lt;ref name="wkpo-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap042310"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/23/politics/main6426967.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;3 | title=Thousands Protest Ariz.

On March 27, 2010, 58-year-old [[Robert Krentz]] and his dog were shot and killed while Krentz was doing fence work on his large ranch roughly {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the [[Mexico - United States border|Mexican border]]. This incident gave a tangible public face to fears about immigration-related crime.&lt;ref name="nyt-crime-rates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanc-bkg"/&gt;  Arizona police were not able to name a murder suspect but traced a set of footprints from the crime scene south towards the border. The resulting speculation that the killer was an illegal alien increased support among the public for the measure.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-crime-rates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time-battle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanc-bkg"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/world/Obama+criticizes+controversial+immigration/2944444/story.html | title=Obama criticizes controversial immigration law | author=Alberts, Sheldon | agency=[[Canwest News Service]] | publisher=[[Global BC]] | date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while there was talk of naming the law after Krentz.&lt;ref name="time-battle"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1993872,00.html | title=The Battle for Arizona | author= Thornburgh, Nathan | author2=Douglas | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=June 14, 2010 | pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some state legislators (both for and against the law) believe, however, that the impact of the Krentz killing has been overstated as a factor in the bill's passing.&lt;ref name="az-3mo"/&gt;

Sponsor Pearce called the bill's signing "a good day for America."&lt;ref name="az-signing"/&gt;
News of the law and the debate around immigration gained national attention, especially on cable news television channels, where topics that attract strong opinions are often given extra airtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.journalism.org/index_report/pej_news_coverage_index_april_1925_2010 | title=PEJ News Coverage Index: April 19–25, 2010 | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | accessdate=June 13, 2010 | author=Morgan, Jon| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100508193727/http://www.journalism.org/index_report/pej_news_coverage_index_april_1925_2010| archivedate= May 8, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, those voting on the bill were later surprised by the reaction it gained.  State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because we thought we could try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them."&lt;ref name="az-3mo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/07/25/20100725immigration-law-history-politics.html | title=Arizona immigration law ripples through history, U.S. politics | author=Nowicki, Dan | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State Representative [[Kyrsten Sinema]], the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one."&lt;ref name="az-3mo"/&gt;

The immigration issue also gained center stage in the re-election campaign of Republican U.S. Senator from Arizona [[John McCain]], who had been a past champion of federal immigration reform measures such as the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]].&lt;ref name="vanc-bkg"/&gt;  Also [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 2010|faced with a primary battle]] – against the more conservative [[J.

In September 2014, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton ordered the primary sponsor of Arizona’s 2010 immigration law to comply with a subpoena calling for him to turn over his emails and documents about the contentious statute. Challengers of the bill want to determine from these whether there was a discriminatory intent in composing the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge orders Pearce to comply with subpoena|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/judge-orders-pearce-to-comply-with-subpoena/|website=Washington Times|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public officials===

====United States====
In the United States, supporters and opponents of the bill have roughly followed party lines, with most [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] opposing the bill and most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] supporting it.

The bill was criticized by President [[Barack Obama]] who called it "misguided" and said it would "undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe."&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanc-bkg"/&gt; Obama did later note that the HB&amp;nbsp;2162 modification had stipulated that the law not be applied in a discriminatory fashion, but the president said there was still the possibility of suspected illegal immigrants "being harassed and arrested".&lt;ref name="csm-visit"/&gt;  He repeatedly called for federal [[Immigration reform#Immigration reform in the United States|immigration reform]] legislation to forestall such actions among the states and as the only long-term solution to the problem of illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanc-bkg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csm-visit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-obama"/&gt;  Governor Brewer and President Obama met at the [[White House]] in early June 2010 to discuss immigration and border security issues in the wake of SB&amp;nbsp;1070; the meeting was termed pleasant, but brought about little change in the participants' stances.&lt;ref name="az-wh-meet"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/06/03/20100603arizona-governor-meets-with-obama.html | title=Brewer calls Obama meeting a 'success' | author=Rough, Ginger | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Immigration Reform Leaders Arrested 4.jpg|thumb|right|A sign at a rally against the law in Washington, DC]]

Secretary of Homeland Security and former Arizona governor [[Janet Napolitano]] testified before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] that she had "deep concerns" about the law and that it would divert necessary law enforcement resources from combating violent criminals.&lt;ref name="lat042810"/&gt; (As governor, Napolitano had consistently vetoed similar legislation throughout her term.&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mex-amer"/&gt;) U.S. Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] said the federal government was considering several options, including a court challenge based on the law leading to possible civil rights violations.&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/05/09/holder.arizona.immigration/ | title=Holder: Feds may sue over Arizona immigration law | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Posner (lawyer)|Michael Posner]], the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], brought up the law in discussions with a Chinese delegation to illustrate human rights areas the U.S. needed to improve on.&lt;ref name="fox-china"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/19/gop-senators-diplomat-apologize-arizona-law-comment-chinese/ | title=McCain, Kyl Call on Diplomat to Apologize for Arizona Law Comment to Chinese | publisher=[[Fox News]] | date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led McCain and fellow senator from Arizona [[Jon Kyl]] to strongly object to any possibly implied comparison of the law to [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights abuses in China]].&lt;ref name="fox-china"/&gt; Senior Democratic U.S. Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] of New York and Mayor of New York City [[Michael Bloomberg]] have criticized the law, with Bloomberg stating that it sends exactly the wrong message to international companies and travelers.&lt;ref name="nydn062410"/&gt;

Democrat [[Linda Sánchez]], U.S. Representative from [[California's 39th congressional district]], has claimed that [[white supremacy]] groups are in part to blame for the law's passage, saying, "There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups.

One Arizona Democrat who defended some of the motivation behind the bill was Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]], who said her constituents were "sick and tired" of the federal government failing to protect the border, that the current situation was "completely unacceptable", and that the legislation was a "clear calling that the federal government needs to do a better job".&lt;ref name="cnn042810"/&gt;  However, she stopped short of supporting the law itself, saying it "does nothing to secure our border" and that it "stands in direct contradiction to our past and, as a result, threatens our future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://giffords.house.gov/2010/04/us-rep-gabrielle-giffords-statement-on-arizonas-new-immigration-law-and-the-need-to-secure-our-borde.shtml |title=U.S. Rep.

U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] included the dispute over SB&amp;nbsp;1070 in an August 2010 report to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], as an example to other countries of how fractious issues can be resolved under the rule of law.&lt;ref name="fox083010"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/30/state-department-stands-decision-include-arizona-human-rights-report/ | title=State Department Stands By Decision to Include Arizona in U.N.

====Mexico====
Mexican President [[Felipe Calderón]]'s office said that "the Mexican government condemns the approval of the law [and] the criminalization of migration."&lt;ref name="ap-dissa-2"/&gt; President Calderón also characterized the new law as a "violation of human rights".&lt;ref name="wapo-mex"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/26/AR2010042603810.html | title=Mexican officials condemn Arizona's tough new immigration law | author=Booth, William | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calderón repeated his criticism during a subsequent [[state visit]] to the White House.&lt;ref name="csm-visit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/0519/Obama-and-Calderon-agree-Arizona-immigration-law-is-wrong | title=Obama and Calderón agree: Arizona immigration law is wrong | author=LaFranchi, Howard | newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure was also strongly criticized by Mexican health minister [[José Ángel Córdova]], former education minister [[Josefina Vázquez Mota]], and Governor of Baja California [[José Guadalupe Osuna Millán]], with Osuna saying it "could disrupt the indispensable economic, political and cultural exchanges of the entire border region."&lt;ref name="wapo-mex"/&gt; The [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Mexican Foreign Ministry]] issued a [[travel advisory]] for its citizens visiting Arizona, saying "It must be assumed that every Mexican citizen may be harassed and questioned without further cause at any time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Secretariat of External Relations]] | location=Mexico | url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/csocial/contenido/comunicados/2010/abr/cp_121eng.html | title=Travel alert | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-04-27-immigration_N.htm | title=Mexico issues travel alert over new Ariz. immigration law  | author=Johnson, Kevin | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these comments, Chris Hawley of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that "Mexico has a law that is no different from Arizona's", referring to legislation which gives local police forces the power to check documents of people suspected of being in the country illegally.&lt;ref name="usa-mex-law"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-25-mexico-migrants_N.htm | title=Activists blast Mexico's immigration law | author=Hawley, Chris | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immigration and human rights activists have also noted that Mexican authorities frequently engage in racial profiling, harassment, and shakedowns against migrants from Central America.&lt;ref name="usa-mex-law"/&gt;

The law imperiled the 28th annual, binational [[Border Governors Conference]], scheduled to be held in Phoenix in September 2010 and to be hosted by Governor Brewer.&lt;ref name="nyt-bgc"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/us/07governors.html | title=Law in Arizona Is Causing Split in Border Talks | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 7, 2010 | page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The governors of the six Mexican states belonging to the conference vowed to boycott it in protest of the law, saying SB&amp;nbsp;1070 is "based on ethnic and cultural prejudice contrary to fundamental rights," and Brewer said in response that she was canceling the gathering.&lt;ref name="nyt-bgc"/&gt;  Governors [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] of California, U.S. border governors who oppose the law, supported moving the conference to another state and going forward with it,&lt;ref name="nyt-bgc"/&gt; and it was subsequently held in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] without Brewer attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newmexicoindependent.com/60435/schwarzenegger-to-cohost-border-guvs-conference-in-santa-fe |title=Schwarzenegger to cohost border guvs conference in Santa Fe |author=Doland, Gwyneth |newspaper=[[The New Mexico Independent]] |date=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802001303/http://newmexicoindependent.com/60435/schwarzenegger-to-cohost-border-guvs-conference-in-santa-fe |archivedate=August 2, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona law enforcement===
Arizona's law enforcement groups have been split on the bill,&lt;ref name="wkpo-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wkpo-enf"/&gt; with statewide rank-and-file police officer groups generally supporting it and police chief associations opposing it.&lt;ref name="az-signing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-pol-split"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=10669418 | title=Ariz. Immigration Law Divides Police Across US | author=Cooper, Jonathan J. | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the legislation, calling the provisions of the bill "problematic" and expressing that it will negatively affect the ability of law enforcement agencies across the state to fulfill their many responsibilities in a timely manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.leei.us/main/media/AACOP_STATEMENT_ON_SENATE_BILL_1070.pdf | title=AACOP Statement on Senate Bill 1070 | publisher=Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police | accessdate=April 25, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425075256/http://www.leei.us/main/media/AACOP_STATEMENT_ON_SENATE_BILL_1070.pdf | archivedate=April 25, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some officers have repeated the past concern that illegal immigrants may come to fear the police and not contact them in situations of emergency or in instances where they have valuable knowledge of a crime.&lt;ref name="ap-pol-split"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/29/AR2010042904970.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2010042905051 | title=Arizona Law on Immigration Puts Police in Tight Spot | author=Slevin, Peter | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which represents the city's police officers, has supported the legislation and lobbied aggressively for its passage.&lt;ref name="wkpo-enf"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/news/23155537/detail.html |title=Police Agencies Split Over Immigration Bill |author=Johnson, Elias |publisher=[[KPHO-TV]] |date=April 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614061030/http://www.kpho.com/news/23155537/detail.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-pol-split"/&gt;  Officers supporting the measure say they have many indicators other than race they can use to determine whether someone may be an illegal immigrant, such as absent identification or conflicting statements made.&lt;ref name="ap-pol-split"/&gt;

The measure was hailed by [[Joe Arpaio]], Sheriff of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]] – known for his tough crackdowns on illegal immigration within his own jurisdiction – who hoped the measure would cause the federal action  to seal the border.&lt;ref name="ap-dissa-3"/&gt;  Arpaio said, "I think they'll be afraid that other states will follow this new law that's now been passed."&lt;ref name="ap-dissa-3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36753942/ns/us_news-life/ | title=Foes to fight Ariz. immigration law | author=Cooper, Jonathan J. | author2=Davenport, Paul | work=[[Today (NBC program)|Today]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious organizations and perspectives===
Activists within the church were present on both sides of the immigration debate,&lt;ref name="slct-faith"/&gt; and both proponents and opponents of the law appealed to religious arguments for support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=10598741 | title=Religion becomes a topic of discussion in immigration debate | author=Adams, Andrew | publisher=[[KSL-TV]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Senator Pearce, a devout member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which has a substantial population in Arizona, frequently said that his efforts to push forward this legislation was based on that church's [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|13 Articles of Faith]], one of which instructs in obeying the law.&lt;ref name="slct-faith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="az-faith"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/05/18/20100518arizona-immigration-law-mormon-church.html | title=Arizona immigration law fallout harms LDS Church outreach | author=González, Daniel | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This association caused a backlash against the LDS Church and threatened its proselytizing efforts among the area's Hispanic population.&lt;ref name="az-faith"/&gt;  The church emphasized that it took no position on the law or immigration in general and that Pearce did not speak for it.&lt;ref name="slct-faith"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49496927-76/immigration-law-church-lds.html.csp | title=Mormons on both sides in immigration controversy | author=Stack, Peggy Fletcher |authorlink=Peggy Fletcher Stack | newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="az-faith"/&gt;  It later endorsed the [[Utah Compact]] on immigration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/church-supports-principles-of-utah-compact-on-immigration | title=Church Supports Principles of ''Utah Compact'' on Immigration | publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] | date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year, took an official position on the issue which opposed Pearce's approach to immigration, saying, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is concerned that any state legislation that only contains enforcement provisions is likely to fall short of the high moral standard of treating each other as children of God.  The Church supports an approach where illegal immigrants are allowed to square themselves with the law and continue to work without this necessarily leading to citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/immigration-church-issues-new-statement | title=Immigration: Church Issues New Statement  | publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] | date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] denounced the law, characterizing it as draconian and saying it "could lead to the wrongful questioning and arrest of U.S. citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/us_bishops_oppose_draconian_arizona_immigration_law/ | title=US bishops oppose 'draconian' Arizona immigration law | publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]/[[EWTN News]] | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Council of Churches]] also criticized the law, saying that it ran counter to centuries of biblical teachings regarding justice and neighborliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ncccusa.org/news/100426arizonalaw.html | title=Religious leaders say new Arizona immigration law is unjust, dangerous and contrary to biblical teaching | publisher=[[National Council of Churches]] | date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns over potential civil rights violations===
The [[National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials]] said the legislation was "an unconstitutional and costly measure that will violate the civil rights of all Arizonans."&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article410982.ece | title=Furore over Arizona immigration bill | author=Lakshman, Narayan | newspaper=[[The Hindu]] | date=April 26, 2010 | location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor [[Chris Coleman (politician)|Chris Coleman]] of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], labeled it as "draconian" as did Democratic [[Texas House of Representatives]] member [[Garnet Coleman]].&lt;ref name="draco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/news/100428-arizona-immigration-law-controversy-spills-into-texas | title=Arizona Immigration Law Controversy Spills into Texas | author=Shieh, Pattie | publisher=[[KRIV (TV)|KRIV]] | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin Kneedler, the U.S. Deputy Solicitor General, also criticized the legislation for its potential infringement on the civil liberties of Arizona's citizens and lawful permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioproject.org/2010/11/arizonas-sb-1070-the-battle-for-immigrants-rights/ "Arizona's SB 1070: the Battle for Immigrant's Rights"] Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project. November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents with the law have rejected such criticism, and argued that the law was reasonable, limited, and carefully crafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/A-carefully-crafted-immigration-law-in-Arizona-92136104.html | title=A carefully crafted immigration law in Arizona | author=[[Byron York|York, Byron]] | newspaper=[[The Washington Examiner]] | date=April 26, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stewart Baker]], a former Homeland Security official in the [[George W. Bush administration]], said, "The coverage of this law and the text of the law are a little hard to square. There's nothing in the law that requires cities to stop people without cause, or encourages racial or ethnic profiling by itself."&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;

Republican member with the Arizona House of Representatives [[Steve Montenegro]] supported the law, saying that "This bill has nothing to do with race or profiling. It has to do with the law. We are seeing a lot of crime here in Arizona because of the open borders that we have."&lt;ref name="ksaz-monte"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/montenegro-supports-immigration-law-4-28-2010 |title=Hispanic Rep.

As one of the main drafters of the law, Kobach has stated that the way the law has been written makes any form of [[racial profiling]] illegal.  In particular, Kobach references the phrase in the law that directly states that officers "may not solely consider race, color, or national origin."&lt;ref name="Kobach NYT" /&gt;  Kobach also disagrees that the "reasonable suspicion" clause of the bill specifically allows for racial profiling, replying that the term "reasonable suspicion" has been used in other laws prior and therefore has "legal precedent".&lt;ref name="Kobach NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kobach|first=Kris|title=Why Arizona Drew a Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/opinion/29kobach.html|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are ongoing arguments in legal journal articles that racial profiling does exist and threatens [[human security]], particularly community security of the Mexicans living in the United States.

In its final form, HB&amp;nbsp;2162 limits the use of race.  It states: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution."&lt;ref name="hb2162sect3"/&gt; The U.S. and Arizona supreme courts have held that race may be considered in enforcing immigration law. In ''[[United States v. Brignoni-Ponce]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court found: “The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/422/873/case.html ''United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,''], 422 U.S. 873, 886–87 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The Arizona Supreme Court agrees that “enforcement of immigration laws often involves a relevant consideration of ethnic factors.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4830883310689136313&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''State v. Graciano,''], 653 P.2d 683, 687 n.7 (Ariz. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  Both decisions say that race alone, however, is an insufficient basis to stop or arrest.

But he then suffered a startling defeat when he lost a November 2011 [[recall election]].&lt;ref name="az-recall"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2011/11/11/20111111mesa-pearce-recall-shockwaves.html | title=Russell Pearce recall shock waves assessed in Mesa | author=Nelson, Gary | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the reasons given for his loss were the desire for greater civility in politics and a lessening of the tension over [[immigration policy]], and a loss of support for Pearce among LDS Church members based on character issues.&lt;ref name="az-recall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/09/politics/arizona-recall-vote/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | title=Author of tough Arizona immigration law loses recall election | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1111/Mormon_voters_recalled_Pearce_over_character_not_immigration.html?showall | title=Mormon voters recalled Pearce over 'character,' not immigration | author=[[Ben Smith (journalist)|Smith, Ben]] | newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reasons for the defeat, such as concerns over Pearce's ethics in taking free trips or the involvement of a third candidacy in the recall election, had little to do with SB&amp;nbsp;1070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kpho.com/story/15989405/pearce-ousted-in-recall | title=Russell Pearce ousted in historic recall election | publisher=[[KPHO-TV]] | date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2012, Pearce lost a comeback bid in the Republican primary for the nomination for a state senate seat to businessman Bob Worsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Gary|title=Worsley beats Russell Pearce in Mesa Senate race|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20120828mesa-gop-legislative-primary-worsley-leads-pearce.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearce was given another government job by the Maricopa County Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2014/07/18/russell-pearce-gets-job-with-county-treasurers-office/12842331/&lt;/ref&gt;

Drafter of the law Kris Kobach won election as [[Secretary of State of Kansas]], first defeating two other candidates in a Republican primary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kmbc.com/election-results/24454813/detail.html | title=2010 Kansas Republican Primary election results for Kansas Secretary of State | publisher=[[KMBC-TV]] | date= August 4, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307131534/http://www.kmbc.com/election-results/24454813/detail.html | archivedate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then winning the general election against Democratic incumbent [[Chris Biggs]] by a wide margin.

State Attorney General Goddard did get the Democratic nomination in the [[Arizona gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Arizona gubernatorial election]].  Governor Jan Brewer went on to defeat him by a 54 to 42 percent margin in the November 2010 general election. A 2016 study found that the up-tick in Brewer's approval ratings due to the legislation "proved enduring enough to turn a losing race for re-election into a victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Jeeyoung|last2=Norpoth|first2=Helmut|date=December 1, 2016|title=Policy popularity: The Arizona immigration law|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379416302116|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=44|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2016.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

=== Supremacy Clause vs. concurrent enforcement ===
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) criticized the statute as a violation of the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which states that federal law, so long as it is constitutional, is paramount over state laws.&lt;ref name="az-chal"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/04/25/20100425immigration-bill-jan-brewer-arizona.html | title=Court fight looms on new immigration law | author=Nowicki, Dan | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aclu-sec"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/16/ACLUAZImmig.pdf | title=ACLU of Arizona Section By Section Analysis of SB 1070 'Immigration; Law Enforcement; Safe Neighborhoods' As Amended by HB 2162 | publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] | date=May 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], a constitutional scholar and dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]] said, "The law is clearly pre-empted by federal law under Supreme Court precedents."&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;

According to Kobach, the law embodies the doctrine of "concurrent enforcement" (the state law parallels applicable federal law without any conflict),&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLJKobachInterview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202456983126 | title=The law prof behind the Arizona immigration law | newspaper=[[National Law Journal]] | date =April 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kobach stated that he believed that it would thus survive any challenge: "There are some things that states can do and some that states can't do, but this law threads the needle perfectly.... Arizona only penalizes what is already a crime under federal law."&lt;ref name="time-bill"/&gt; State Senator Pearce noted that some past state laws on immigration enforcement had been upheld in federal courts.&lt;ref name="az-chal"/&gt;
In ''Gonzales v. City of Peoria'' (9th Cir. 1983),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/722/468/ ''Gonzales v. City of Peoria''], 722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; a court held that the [[Immigration and Naturalization Act]] precludes local enforcement of the Act's civil provisions but not the Act's criminal provisions. The [[US Attorney General]] may enter a written agreement with a state or local government agency under which that agency's employees perform the function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|8|1357(g)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
however, such an agreement is not required for the agency's employees to perform those functions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{USC|8|1357(g)(10)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, various legal experts were divided on whether the law would survive a court challenge, with one law professor saying it "sits right on that thin line of pure state criminal law and federally controlled immigration law."&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/us/28legal.html | title=A Law Facing a Tough Road Through the Courts | author=Schwartz, John | author2=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 28, 2010 | page=A17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past lower court decisions in the area were not always consistent, and a decision on the bill's legality from the [[US Supreme Court]] was one possible outcome.&lt;ref name="nyt-legal"/&gt;

===Initial court actions===

On April 27, 2010, Roberto Javier Frisancho, a natural born citizen and resident of Washington, D.C., who planned on visiting Arizona, filed the first lawsuit against S.B. 1070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frisancho v. Brewer et al|url=https://dockets.justia.com/docket/arizona/azdce/2:2010cv00926/518556/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 29, 2010, the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders and a Tucson police officer, Martin Escobar, filed suit against SB&amp;nbsp;1070, both doing so separately in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8653132.stm | title=Tough Arizona immigration law faces legal challenges | first=Rajesh | last=Mirchandani | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-suits"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/nation/la-na-obama-immigration-20100430 | title=Obama administration considers challenges to Arizona immigration law | author=Serrano, Richard A. | author2=Nicholas, Peter | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Coalition's filing claimed that the law usurped federal responsibilities under the Supremacy Clause that it led to racial profiling by imposing a "reasonable suspicion" requirement upon police officers to check the immigration status of those they come in official conduct with, which would, in turn, be subject to too much personal interpretation by each officer.&lt;ref name="lat-suits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_5f4f524e-53e0-11df-b705-001cc4c03286.html | title=2 lawsuits challenge Arizona's immigration law | author=Fischer, Howard | agency=Capitol Media Services | newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] | date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escobar's suit argued that there was no race-neutral criteria available to him to suspect that a person was an illegal immigrant and that implementation of the law would hinder police investigations in areas that were predominantly Hispanic.&lt;ref name="ap-pol-split"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ads-suit2"/&gt; The suit also claimed the Act violated federal law because the police and the city have no authority to perform immigration-related duties.&lt;ref name="ads-suit2"/&gt; The Tucson police department insisted that Escobar was not acting on its behalf and that it had received many calls from citizens complaining about his suit.&lt;ref name="ads-suit2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_e8a094d4-53ab-11df-92c8-001cc4c002e0.html | title=Tucson cop first to sue to block AZ immigration law | author=Pedersen, Brian J. | newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] | date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Phoenix police officer, David Salgado, quickly followed with his own federal suit, claiming that to enforce the law would require him to violate the rights of Hispanics.&lt;ref name="az-suit3"/&gt; He also said that he would be forced to spend his own time and resources studying the law's requirements and that he was liable to being sued whether he enforced the law or not.&lt;ref name="az-suit3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2010/04/30/20100430immigrationsuit0430.html | title=3 lawsuits challenge legality of new law | author=Rau, Alia Beard | author2=Rough, Ginger | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/05/15/20100515arizona-immigration-law-officer-lawsuits.html | title=Phoenix, Tucson officers sue over Arizona's new immigration law | author=Madrid, Ofelia | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] became the first two cities to authorize legal action against the state over the Act.&lt;ref name="cbs050510"/&gt; [[San Luis, Arizona|San Luis]] later joined them.&lt;ref name="fox-suit"/&gt; However, as of mid-late May, none of them had actually filed a suit.&lt;ref name="az-joint"/&gt; In late May, however, the city of Tucson filed a [[cross-claim]] and joined Officer Escobar in his suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12578063 |title=City of Tucson joins officer's lawsuit against SB 1070 |author=Nunez, Steve |author2=Pryor, Bryan |publisher=[[KGUN-TV]] |date=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604061013/http://www.kgun9.com/global/story.asp?s=12578063 |archivedate=June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, a joint [[class action lawsuit]], ''Friendly House et al. v. Whiting'', was filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of ten individuals and fourteen labor, religious, and civil rights organizations.&lt;ref name="abc15-buy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox-suit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/17/aclu-civil-rights-groups-file-suit-arizona-immigration-law/ | title=ACLU, Civil Rights Groups File Suit Against Arizona Immigration Law | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Fox News]] | date=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="az-joint"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/05/18/20100518arizona-immigration-law-organizations-lawsuits.html | title=14 organizations, 10 individuals file suit over Arizona's immigration law | author=Rau, Alia Beard | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aclu-joint"&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights-racial-justice/aclu-and-civil-rights-groups-file-legal-challenge-arizona-racial-pr | title=ACLU And Civil Rights Groups File Legal Challenge To Arizona Racial Profiling Law | publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] | date=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal counsel filing the action, the largest of those filed, was a collaboration of the ACLU, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], the [[National Immigration Law Center]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[National Day Laborer Organizing Network]], and the [[Asian Pacific American Legal Center]].&lt;ref name="az-joint"/&gt;  The suit seeks to prevent SB&amp;nbsp;1070 from going into effect by charging: 
*It violates the federal Supremacy Clause by attempting to bypass federal immigration law;
*It violates the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] rights of racial and national origin minorities by subjecting them to stops, detentions, and arrests based on their race or origin;
*It violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of [[freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]] by exposing speakers to scrutiny based on their language or accent;
*it violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]'s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because it allows for warrantless searches in absence of probable cause;
*It violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause by being impermissibly vague;
*It infringes on constitutional provisions that protect the right to travel without being stopped, questioned, or detained.&lt;ref name="az-joint"/&gt;

This suit named County's Attorney and Sheriffs as defendants, rather than the State of Arizona or Governor Brewer, as the earlier suits had.&lt;ref name="fox-suit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="az-joint"/&gt; On June 4, the ACLU and others filed a request for an [[injunction]], arguing that the Act's scheduled start date of July 29 should be postponed until the underlying legal challenges against it were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/06/05/new-challenge-to-arizona-immigration-law/?test=latestnews |title=New Challenge to Arizona Immigration Law |author=Ross, Lee |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=June 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608145621/http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/06/05/new-challenge-to-arizona-immigration-law/?test=latestnews |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, the state affiliate of the [[National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]], alleged in an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief for the ACLU et al. case that the prolonged detentions mandated by the law if reasonable suspicion that someone subject to a lawful stop was an illegal alien are not justifiable except under the [[probable cause]] standard and so the law requires violations of Fourth Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldwaterstate.blogspot.com/2010/06/important-new-sb-1070-brief-filed-aacj.html|work=Goldwater State (weblog)|author=Bennett Kalafut|title=Important new SB 1070 brief filed: AACJ says law requires 4th Amendment violations.|date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aacj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacj.org/resources/uploads/amicuscuriaebrief.aacj.final.pdf |title=Amicus curiae brief by Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice in support of plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, No. CV-10-01061-JWS |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724212152/http://www.aacj.org/resources/uploads/amicuscuriaebrief.aacj.final.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] also filed an ''amicus curiae'' brief in support of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/Civil_Rights/2010/pdf/motion_forleavetofile_amicusbrief.pdf|title=Motion for leave to file brief of amicus curiae Anti-Defamation League in support of plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, No. CV 10-1061-PHX-JWS|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Mexico]] said that the law was unconstitutional and would lead to unlawful discrimination against Mexican citizens and damage to relations between the two nations.&lt;ref name="mex-chal"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10386190.stm | title=Mexico joins Arizona immigration lawsuit | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, so many ''amicus curiae'' briefs have been filed regarding the law that size limits were imposed upon them.&lt;ref name="ap-donations"/&gt;

Kobach remained optimistic that the suits would fail: "I think it will be difficult for the plaintiffs challenging this. They are heavy on political rhetoric but light on legal arguments."&lt;ref name="az-p-k"/&gt; In late May 2010, Governor Brewer issued an executive order to create the Governor's Border Security and Immigration Legal Defense Fund to handle suits over the law.&lt;ref name="ap-donations"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/05/27/2010-05-27_arizona_governor_jan_brewer_creates_legal_defense_fund_for_suits_over_immigratio.html | title=Arizona Governor Jan Brewer creates legal defense fund for suits over immigration law SB1070 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer got into a dispute with Arizona Attorney General [[Terry Goddard]] over whether he would defend the law against legal challenges, as a state attorney general normally would.&lt;ref name="nyt-memday"/&gt; Brewer accused Goddard, who opposed the law personally and was one of Brewer's possible rivals in the gubernatorial election, of colluding with the US Justice Department as it deliberated whether to challenge the law in court.&lt;ref name="nyt-memday"/&gt;  Goddard subsequently agreed to withdraw from the state's defense.&lt;ref name="ap-donations"/&gt;

===Department of Justice lawsuit===
{{main|United States of America v. Arizona}}
The [[United States Department of Justice]] filed a lawsuit against the state of Arizona in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona]] on July 6, 2010, asking for the law to be declared invalid since it interferes with the immigration regulations "exclusively vested in the federal government."&lt;ref name="Feds sue"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/06/arizona.immigration.lawsuit/index.html?hpt=T2 | title=Feds sue to overturn Arizona immigration law  | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-feds"/&gt; In a brief to the press, the department's lawyers referenced the notion of [[federal pre-emption]] and stated, "The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country....&lt;ref name="wapo-feds"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070601928.html?hpid=topnews | title=Justice Department sues Arizona over immigration law | author=Markon, Jerry | author2=Shear, Michael D. | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immigration framework set forth by Congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns – concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state."&lt;ref name="Feds sue" /&gt; That pointed to an additional practical argument: the law would result in federal authorities losing focus on their broader priorities to deal with an influx of deportations from Arizona.&lt;ref name="wapo-feds"/&gt; The Justice Department requested for the federal courts to enjoin enforcement of the law before it could go into effect.&lt;ref name="Feds sue" /&gt; The suit did not argue that the law will lead to racial profiling, but department officials said they would continue to monitor that aspect if the measure went into effect.&lt;ref name="wapo-feds"/&gt;

A direct suit of a state by the federal government is rare, and the action held possible political consequences for the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 U.S. midterm elections]] as well.&lt;ref name="wapo-feds"/&gt;  It was also seen as a pre-emptive measure to discourage other states considering similar laws from moving forward with them.&lt;ref name="nyt-feds"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/us/07immig.html | title=Justice Dept.

By July 8, total donations were over $500,000, with the large majority of them being for $100 or less and coming from around the nation.&lt;ref name="ap-donations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/immigration-defense-fund-donations-7-8-2010 |title=Donations to Immigration Law's Defense Fund Top $500K |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[KSAZ-TV]] |date=July 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073948/http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/immigration-defense-fund-donations-7-8-2010 |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Bolton's ruling let a number of other aspects of the law take effect on July 29, including the ability to prevent state officials from maintaining "[[sanctuary city]]" policies and allowing civil suits against those policies, the mandating that state officials work with federal officials on matters related to illegal immigration, and the prohibition of stopping a vehicle in traffic to pick up day laborers.&lt;ref name="nyt-blocks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox-blocks"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/28/supporters-arizonas-immigration-law-solace-remaining-portions/ | title=Arizona Immigration Law Still a 'Powerful Deterrent,' Supporters Say | publisher=[[Fox News]] | date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those parts of the law were challenged not by the Justice Department but by some of the other suits.&lt;ref name="nyt-blocks"/&gt;

A three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit heard arguments in the appeal case on November 1, 2010, and it gave indications that it might reinstate but weaken parts of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/11/01/MNDP1G54K0.DTL | title=Court signals backing for Arizona immigration law | author=Egelko, Bob | newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Arizona filed a countersuit against the federal government in the ''United States v.

On April 11, 2011, the Ninth Circuit panel upheld the district court's ban on parts of the law taking effect, thus ruling in favor of the Obama administration and against Arizona.

===US Supreme Court ruling===
On June 25, 2012, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case ''[[Arizona v. United States]]''. It determined, by a 5–3 majority, with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] writing the opinion, that Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of SB&amp;nbsp;1070 were pre-empted by federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf ''Arizona v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16052">'''Article 48''' of the [[Weimar constitution|constitution]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] of [[Germany]] (1919–1933) allowed the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|President]], under certain circumstances, to take emergency measures without the prior consent of the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]''. This power was understood to include the promulgation of "emergency decrees (''{{lang|de|Notverordnungen}}'')".&lt;ref&gt;Singular, ''{{lang|de|Notverordnung}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The text of the Article neither precisely defined the kind of emergency that would justify its usage nor gave the President the power to enact, issue, or otherwise promulgate legislation. However, such an inherent Presidential legislative power was clearly implied, as the Article expressly gave the Reichstag the power to cancel the emergency decree by a simple majority vote. That parliamentary power implied that a decree could, either by its express terms or its operation, impinge on the Reichstag's constitutional function.&lt;ref name="mommsen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mommsen | first = Hans | coauthors = | title = The Rise and Fall of Weimar Democracy | publisher = UNC Press | year = 1998 | pages = 57–58 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8078-4721-6}} ("''Mommsen''")(confirming that only a simple majority of Reichstag was necessary to overturn an emergency decree)&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 48 required the President to inform the Reichstag immediately of the issuance of the emergency decree and gave the Reichstag the power to nullify the emergency decree by simple majority action. The [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]], the upper house, was not involved in the process at all.&lt;ref name="mommsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | coauthors = | title = The Coming of the Third Reich | publisher = Penguin | year = 2004 | pages = 80–84 | url = | doi = | isbn = 1-59420-004-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Reichstag nullified the decree, the President could retaliate by using the power, under Article 25, to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections within 60 days.

==History==
Following the [[Treaty of Versailles]], there was a period of [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] between 1921 and 1923, then the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] between 1923 and 1925. [[Friedrich Ebert]], a Social Democrat and the Republic's first President, used Article 48 on 136 occasions, including the deposition of lawfully elected governments in Saxony and Thuringia when those appeared disorderly.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; On 29 August 1921 an emergency proclamation was issued limiting the wearing of imperial military uniforms to current serving members of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 100,000 Berliners Rally for Republic | work=[[The New York Times]] | date= 31 August 1921 | pages= 1, 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= New Governments of Central Europe | first1= Malbone Watson | last1= Graham | first2= Robert Cedric | last2= Binkley | year= 1924 | page= 499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert had granted [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Wilhelm Cuno]] considerable latitude under Article 48 to deal with the inflation and with matters related to the Mark.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The [[Emminger Reform]] of 4 January 1924 abolished the [[jury]] system as [[trier of fact|triers of fact]] within the [[judiciary of Germany]] and replaced it with a mixed system of [[judge]]s and [[lay judge]]s which still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= On Uses and Misuses of Comparative Law | first = Otto | last= Kahn-Freund | at= footnote 73, p. 18 | authorlink= Otto Kahn-Freund | journal= [[Modern Law Review]] | volume= 37 | issue= 1 | date= January 1974 | jstor= 1094713 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 48 was used by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1930 to deal with the [[Great Depression|economic crisis of the time]].  During spring and summer 1930, [[Chancellor]] [[Heinrich Brüning]]&lt;ref&gt;He was appointed Chancellor on 30 March 1930 after considerable political intrigue&lt;/ref&gt; found his government unable to obtain a parliamentary majority for its financial reform bill, which was voted down by the ''Reichstag,''&lt;ref&gt;On 16 July, the Chancellor presented his wide-ranging financial bill to the ''Reichstag''; it sought, among other things, to reform government finances through both higher taxes and decreases in government spending (an obviously deflationary policy). The government bill was rejected by the ''Reichstag'', by a vote of 256 to 193,&lt;/ref&gt;  but the government did not seriously try to negotiate with the Parliament to find a ''[[modus vivendi]]''. Instead, Brüning asked Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 in order to promulgate the bill as an emergency decree and thereby give Brüning's government the authority to act without the consent of the ''Reichstag''.&lt;ref&gt;This was, in fact, the first time that a bill which had been legislatively rejected was later promulgated by way of executive decree, and the constitutionality of such "second bite at the apple" tactics has been questioned (Kershaw, pp 320-325).&lt;/ref&gt; When Hindenburg gave his authority and issued the decree, the ''Reichstag'' repudiated the decree, by a small majority&lt;ref&gt;The Social Democrats cooperated with the Nazis to reject the decree, as did [[Alfred Hugenberg]]'s Nationalists and the Communists. ''See'' Maehl, ''The German Socialist Party'', p 168. The decree was voted down, by a vote of 236 to 221.&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 July 1930. Under Article 48, this vote by a majority of the ''Reichstag'' members invalidated the presidential decree. Faced with a breakdown of parliamentary rule at a time when the economic situation demanded action, Brüning asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The ''Reichstag'' was accordingly dissolved on 18 July and new elections were scheduled for 14 September 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Under the constitution, new elections had to be held within 60 days of the dissolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historians have not been kind to Brüning. According to Maehl (p 168), the Chancellor "foolishly" dissolved the Reichstag as a result of the financial imbroglio. The decision to dissolve parliament was, in Kershaw's phrase, one of "breathtaking irresponsibility." Brüning had stunningly misjudged the discontent and anger within the country. It is difficult to avoid the conclusions that (a) the democratic processes{{mdash}}namely, parliamentary negotiation to achieve a working majority, either on a single piece of legislation or on a legislative program{{mdash}}were just too difficult for this cast of characters and (b) the parties were too parochial and self-interested to cooperate in the greater interests of the whole (Kershaw, Vol 1, pp 324-325: Hubris, pp 73-75;  Collier, p 167). Collier maintains that this single act{{mdash}}the dissolution in the face of a legitimate exercise by the Parliamentary body of its constitutional authority{{mdash}}was one of them most crucial steps in the Nazi rise to power, as it demonstrated the contempt in which the President and his advisers held the concept of democracy and the function of the Reichstag. "It ... marks the shift from parliamentary ... to presidential government ... [which] gave the Nazis a 'legal' route to success that Hitler so needed" (Collier and Pedley, p 167).&lt;/ref&gt;

The election produced increased representation in the Reichstag for both the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] and, most dramatically, for the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], at the expense of the moderate middle-class parties.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[German election, 1930|Election Results]]. The Nazis increased their seats from a pitiful 12 to a respectable 107, out of a total of 577, becoming the second largest party in the Reichstag as a result; only the Social Democrats were larger at 143 seats.&lt;/ref&gt; Forming a parliamentary majority became even more difficult for Brüning.  In fact, just to conduct the normal business of government, he was forced to invoke Article 48 several times between 1930 and 1932. Subsequent governments under chancellors [[Franz von Papen]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] during the tumultuous year 1932 obtained President Hindenburg's decree of legislation under Article 48 when they too found it impossible to obtain a parliamentary majority as the extremist parties on the left and right gained power.

The invocation of Article 48 by successive governments helped seal the fate of the Weimar Republic. While Brüning's first invocation of a ''Notverordnung'' may have been well-intentioned, the power to rule by decree became increasingly used not in response to a specific emergency but as a substitute for parliamentary leadership. The excessive use of the decree power and the fact that successive chancellors were no longer responsible to the ''Reichstag'' probably played a significant part in the loss of public confidence in constitutional democracy, in turn leading to the rise of the extremist parties.

===Nazi use===
On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was named [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]]. Lacking a majority in the ''Reichstag'', Hitler formed a coalition with the National-Conservatives ([[German National People's Party]] (German: Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP)). Not long afterwards, he called [[German federal election, March 1933|elections]] for 5 March. Six days before the election, on 27 February, the [[Reichstag fire]] damaged the house of Parliament in Berlin. Claiming that the fire was the first step in a [[Communist]] revolution, the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to get the President, Hindenburg, to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], officially the ''[[:de:Reichstagsbrandverordnung|Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat]]'' (Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State).

Under the decree, issued by Hindenburg on the basis of Article 48, the government was given authority to curtail constitutional rights including habeas corpus, free expression of opinion, freedom of the press, rights of assembly, and the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications. Constitutional restrictions on searches and confiscation of property were likewise suspended.

The ''Reichstag'' Fire Decree was one of the first steps the Nazis took toward the establishment of a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in Germany. With several key government posts in the hands of Nazis and with the constitutional protections on civil liberties suspended by the decree, the Nazis were able to use police power to suppress, intimidate and arrest their opposition, in particular the Communists. Hitler's subversion of the Constitution under Article 48 thus had the mark of legality.

The 5 March elections gave the Nazi-DNVP coalition a narrow majority in the ''Reichstag''.  Nonetheless, the Nazis were able to maneuver on 23 March 1933 the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] by the required two-thirds parliamentary majority, effectively abrogating the authority of the Reichstag and placing its authority in the hands of the Cabinet (in effect, the Chancellor). Over the years, Hitler used Article 48 to give his dictatorship the stamp of legality. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48. The Reichstag Fire Decree remained in effect for the entire Nazi era; thus, for the next 12 years, Hitler ruled under what amounted to martial law.

===Lessons learned===
The misuse of Article 48 was fresh in the minds of the framers of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].  They decided to significantly curb the powers of the [[President of Germany|president]], to the point that he, unlike his Weimar predecessor, has little de facto executive power. Also, to prevent a government from being forced to rely on decrees to carry on normal business, they stipulated that a chancellor may be removed from office only if there is already a positive majority for a prospective successor.

'''Bahá'í laws''' are laws and ordinances used in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and are a fundamental part of Bahá'í practice.&lt;ref name="PSmith158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws are based on authenticated texts from [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and also includes subsequent interpretations from [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and [[Shoghi Effendi]], and legislation by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref name="PSmith159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í law is presented as a set of general principles and guidelines and individuals must apply them as they best seem fit.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; While some of the social laws are enforced by Bahá'í institutions, the emphasis is placed on individuals following the laws based on their conscience, understanding and reasoning, and Bahá'ís are expected to follow the laws for the love of Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; The laws are seen as the method of the maintenance of order and security in the world.&lt;ref name="PSmith158"/&gt;

==History==
The Bahá'í Faith had its roots in the [[Bábism|Bábí Religion]] which was started by the [[Báb]] in the mid-19th century in [[Persia]]. Originally Bábís adhered to the [[Sharia|Islamic law]]s, but this changed when the Báb wrote a Bábí code of law in the [[Bayán (exposition)|Bayán]], which replaced them. However, the Báb's laws were not widely practiced by the Bábís, and instead many Bábís became [[antinomian]]; they also marked their new religious identity by deliberately not abiding by Islamic practice.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh, as both his initial role as Bábí leader, and then as Bábí messianic figure, condemned the antinomian tendencies of the community. At the request of his followers, he eventually wrote a book of laws, the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', which he completed while he was in [[Acre, Israel|Acre, Palestine]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

==Sources==
The main source of Bahá'í law is the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'', but it is supplemented by some supplementary texts written by Bahá'u'lláh, as well as further interpretations by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], and [[Shoghi Effendi]], heads of the religion after Bahá'u'lláh's death, as well as legislation by the [[Universal House of Justice]], the international governing body of the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; The writings of Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi are considered fundamental and unchangeable, while the application of some of them depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice. Legislation by the Universal House of Justice is seen as subsidiary and is subject to alteration and/or repeal by the Universal House of Justice to account for changing circumstances.&lt;ref name="PSmith160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws written by the Báb are not applicable, except when Bahá'u'lláh specifically reiterated them.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the ordinances of his book of laws was the best method for the maintenance of world order and security, and that Bahá'ís should obey the laws with "joy and gladness", and that true liberty could be obtained by obedience to the laws.&lt;ref name="PSmith158"/&gt;

==Gradualism==
Bahá'u'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to "tact and wisdom", and that they do not cause "disturbance and dissension."&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aqdas6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to [[Middle East]]ern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; Other Bahá'í laws such as the prohibition to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] have also been applied gradually in countries where it goes against social norms, and for which most Bahá'ís are new to the religion. Shoghi Effendi also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith160"/&gt;  He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í  lives the laws could not be practiced.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice.

==Individual conscience==
In [[Bahá'í literature]] the laws are not seen as a constricting code, or a ritual, but are described as the "choice wine", and a means to happiness.
The laws are generally presented as a set of general principles and guidelines which each individual Bahá'í must apply to their own lives as they see fit.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; Bahá'í law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Bahá'í behaviour;&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Bahá'í behaviour, such as how to dress, are a matter of individual choice and not Bahá'í law.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

The practice of Bahá'í law is firmly placed on individual conscience, understanding and reasoning.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; The Bahá'í laws are not considered as binding to anyone until they become a Bahá'í, and becoming a Bahá'í is not conditional on a person's level of adherence to the laws; an individual is expected to gradually apply laws on a personal basis.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; Bahá'ís are expected to follow the laws not because they will be punished for breaking them, but instead because they love Bahá'u'lláh and that they fear God.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt;  The teachings of the Bahá'í Faith state that individuals are answerable to God.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt;  The observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual, but some laws may be enforced to a degree by Bahá'í institutions, by the loss of Bahá'í administrative rights, if they bring the Bahá'í community into public disrepute.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

==Laws and ordinances==
The ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' goes over both religious and civil laws such as the recitation of a daily [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]], the time of [[Nineteen Day Fast|fasting]], the laws of inheritance, the abolishment of priests, the prohibition of such things as [[slavery]], [[asceticism]], and [[gambling]], the condemnation of such things as idleness and backbiting, the specification of punishments for such things as [[murder]] and [[arson]], the stating of the requirement of each person to practice a profession, and the emphasis for the necessity of the education of children, as well as the need to strictly obey the government of one's country.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Aqdas | first = A | last = Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh also writes about general principles including statements telling his followers to work with people of all religions with amity, and warns his followers to guard against such things as [[fanaticism]] and pride.  He also encourages such things as cleanliness and truthfulness.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

===Prayer===
{{Main|Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|Obligatory Bahá'í prayers}}

The act of prayer is one of the most important Bahá'í laws for individual discipline and Bahá'í are enjoined to pray daily.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith consists of two distinct types, obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer.&lt;ref name="walbridge"&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Walbridge | title = Prayer and worship | url = http://bahai-library.com/walbridge_encyclopedia_prayer_worship | accessdate = 2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of prayer in the Bahá'í Faith is to get closer to God and to Bahá'u'lláh and to help better one's own conduct and to request divine assistance.&lt;ref name="smith_prayer"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= prayer |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís must individually recite an [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh. Obligatory prayer is performed individually while facing the [[Qiblih]], preceded by [[Ritual purification|ablutions]].&lt;ref name="PSmith161-62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain exemptions from obligatory prayer are given to those who are ill, in danger, and women in their courses.&lt;ref name="smith_prayer"/&gt;

In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, Bahá'í scripture directs believers daily to offer [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|devotional prayer]] as well as to meditate and study sacred scripture. In contrast with the fixed form prescribed for obligatory prayers, there is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bahá'í Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem.&lt;ref name="PSmith161-62"/&gt;

===Fasting===
{{main|Nineteen Day Fast}}

The Bahá'í fast is a nineteen-day period of the year, during which Bahá'í are asked adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset [[fasting|fast]]. Along with obligatory prayer, it is one of the greatest obligations of a Bahá'í, and its chief purpose is spiritual; to reinvigorate the soul and bring the person closer to God.&lt;ref name="PSmith_fasting"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= fasting |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of fasting, from March 2 through March 20, Bahá'ís in good health between the ages of 15 and 70 abstain from eating and drinking. Exemptions are available for people who are travelling, ill, pregnant, nursing, menstruating, or engaged in heavy labour.&lt;ref name="PSmith162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasting is an individual spiritual obligation, and cannot be enforced by Bahá'í institutions.&lt;ref name="PSmith162"/&gt;

===Marriage and family life===
{{main|Bahá'í marriage}}

The Bahá'í teachings recommend [[marriage]], but it is not obligatory.&lt;ref name="PSmith165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage is emphasized as an assistance to one's self, as well as for the benefit of society; it is seen as both a physical relationship and a spiritual relationship that would continue in all the worlds of God.&lt;ref name="PSmith165"/&gt;

The requirements of Bahá'í marriage include that the partners be over the age of 15, and is dependent on the consent of the couple and all their living biological parents, so to strengthen the ties between the families.&lt;ref name="PSmith165"/&gt; According to the Bahá'í teachings, sexuality is a normal part of married life and is intended to enhance the relationship. However, sexual relationships are permitted only between a man and woman who are married. This precludes marriages that are [[Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith|homosexual]] or [[polygamous]] as well as any sexual relationship outside of marriage. [[Interreligious marriage]]s are permitted, and [[interracial marriages]] are encouraged.  [[Divorce]] is permitted, although discouraged, and is granted after a year of separation if the couple is unable to reconcile their differences.&lt;ref name="PSmith165"/&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that parents need to raise their [[children]] to be moral and religious, but not fanatical.&lt;ref name="PSmith166"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are required to provide an [[education]] to their children, and children have a duty to obey their parents, which is seen as obeying God.  Shoghi Effendi stated that preserving family unity is of utmost importance, and Bahá'ís are counselled to balance their desire to serve the religion with their responsibilities as parents, spouses and children.&lt;ref name="PSmith166"/&gt;

===Inheritance===
In the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'', Bahá'u'lláh wrote that all Bahá'ís must write a will where they have complete freedom in determining how to dispose of their property. Bahá'u'lláh, however, did create a schedule of inheritance in case of [[intestacy]], that is, when the individual dies without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="PSmith169"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system of inheritance in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' is based on the provisions written by the [[Báb]] and provides for distribution of the deceased's estate among seven categories of heirs.:&lt;ref name="PSmith169"/&gt; children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers, with higher categories obtaining a larger share.&lt;ref name="PSmith_inheritance"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= inheritance |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In cases where some of the categories of heirs do not exist, the share falls partly to the children and partly to the [[Local Spiritual Assembly]]. The distribution among heirs is uneven: children receive nine parts; the spouse receives eight; the father, seven; the mother, six; the brothers, five; the sisters, four; and the teachers, three.&lt;ref name="PSmith_inheritance"/&gt;

===Backbiting and gossip===
[[Gossip]] and [[backbiting]] are prohibited and viewed as particularly damaging to the individual and their relationships.&lt;ref name="PSmith_backbite"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= backbiting |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backbiting, speaking of the faults of others in their absence, is described as the greatest sin and the most hated human characteristic. This practice is seen as having a deeply negative effect on the community as well as the individuals involved.&lt;ref name="PSmith_backbite"/&gt;

:"On no subject are the Bahá'í teachings more emphatic than on the necessity to abstain from fault-finding and backbiting while being ever eager to discover and root out our own faults and overcome our own failings. ..."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi quoted in {{harvnb|Hornby|1983|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol, drugs and tobacco===
Bahá'ís are forbidden to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or to take drugs, except by a doctor's order.  The reason being that God has given human beings reason and intoxicants take that away and lead the mind astray.&lt;ref name="PSmith168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-medicinal use of [[opium]] and other mind-altering [[drug]]s are particularly condemned in the Bahá'í scriptures.&lt;ref name="PSmith168"/&gt;  Bahá'ís are also asked to try to avoid working in jobs that involve the manufacturing or large-scale sale of alcohol and avoid any involvement in the drug trade.&lt;ref name="PSmith168"/&gt; Smoking [[tobacco]] is not forbidden but is discouraged.&lt;ref name="PSmith168"/&gt;

===Huqúqu'lláh and giving to funds===
[[Huqúqu'lláh]], the "Right of God", is a law which requires Bahá'ís to pay 19% of their surplus net-worth (i.e. those things that they do not need to live comfortably), after the discharge of all debts. The sum is calculated annually; however, it is paid only if the annual net worth amount increases - if their net worth stays the same or decreases the amount of Huqúqu'lláh is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Research Department of the Universal House of Justice|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payment is an individual spiritual obligation, and is seen as a spiritual bounty to bring the individual closer to God.  No Bahá'í can be solicited for it, and the contribution is confidential and a personal matter.&lt;ref name="PSmith163-64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money collected is used by the Universal House of Justice for such things as the promotion of the religion, the upkeep of properties, and general charity.&lt;ref name="PSmith163-64"/&gt;

Bahá'ís are also expected to make financial contributions to Bahá'í [[funds]].  However, contributions are strictly confidential, including whether or not a believer makes one, and is up to individual discretion. Donations are never solicited, and contributions are not accepted from non-Bahá'í sources.&lt;ref name="PSmith186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|pt|Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal}}''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''National Library of Portugal'') is the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[national library]], fulfilling the function of [[Legal deposit|legal deposit and copyright]].

== History ==
[[File:António Ribeiro dos Santos.jpg|thumb|left|António Ribeiro dos Santos, the first director of the library.]]
The library was created by Decree of 29 February 1796, under the name of '''Royal Public Library of the Court'''. The library's objective was to allow the general public access to the court's collections, thus bucking the trend of the time only available to scholars and sages could access the treasures, manuscripts, paintings, and books of the royal court.

In the dawn of the victory of the Liberals and the abolition of the religious orders (1834), the institution was renamed the National Library of Lisbon and was officially entrusted with all or part of the libraries of numerous monasteries and convents. The arrival of these large collections made it absolutely necessary to move to larger premises, and the choice fell on the Convento de São Francisco.

Over the more than 130 years in which it operated in the Chiado area of the city, the BNL experienced periods of modernisation and enrichment and times of greyness and lethargy. We should particularly note the efforts that were made in the 19th century to absorb the collections of the abolished religious establishments, organise bibliographic exhibitions and publish catalogues of a variety of collections.

The proclamation of the Republic (1910) was followed by the incorporation of a new wave of libraries from another round of abolitions of religious institutions. Between 1920 and 1926 the BNL enjoyed a phase in which it took a major step forward in the field of library and information science and benefited from a flourishing cultural life, all of which was promoted by the so-called “Library Group”.

The growth of the collections and the need for conditions suited to the conservation of the Library’s rich holdings made it indispensable to construct a purpose-designed building that would provide the largest Portuguese bibliographic collection with a proper home. Work began in 1958, to a design by the architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro, and the Library was transferred to the new building in the Campo Grande area in 1969.

The process of computerising the Library began in the 1980s, alongside a broader project intended to support all of Portugal’s libraries in this respect, which resulted in the creation of the National Bibliographic Database – PORBASE. At the same time as it adapted to the process of technological evolution, the Library continued to enrich its collections. Of particular significance was the creation of an Archive of Writers’ Personal Papers, but a number of major initiatives were also undertaken with regard to the standardisation of library and information techniques, preservation and conservation, and cultural activities.

At the beginning of this century the Library has been accompanying the international trend towards the digitisation of bibliographic collections, with the creation of the {{illm|Biblioteca Nacional Digital|pt}} (National Digital Library, BND), which is constantly growing and works closely with other European institutions.

Already more than 200 years old, in 2007 the Institution was renamed the National Library of Portugal (BNP) and began a restructuring process that is seeking to help both enrich and publicise the nation’s bibliographic heritage, and to modernise, rationalise and improve its own operations in such a way as to serve the public, the professional community, and publishers and booksellers.

== Mission and activities ==
The BNP’s mission is to collect, process and preserve the Portuguese documentary heritage, including documents in Portuguese and about Portugal, whatever their format or carrier. It is also charged with studying and disseminating that heritage and ensuring the conditions which people need in order to be able to enjoy it, as well as classifying and inventorying the nation’s bibliographic heritage assets.

Under this definition, which is set out in the Organic Law governing the BNP, the Library continues to pursue the essence of the fundamental purposes and objectives for which it was created in 1796, but is also responsible for the provision of a more varied range of services to both Portuguese culture and the public in general – among other ways, via the Online Catalogue of our collections and the Digital National Library – and the professionals in the publishing and information and documentation sectors.

To this end the BNP acts as the National Bibliographic Agency, which is responsible for the mandatory legal deposit of publications and the country’s [[ISSN]], [[ISMN]] and CIP (Cataloguing in Publication) services, the recording and dissemination of the Portuguese National Bibliography, and the coordination and management of PORBASE – the National Bibliographic Database. In this respect it has also undertaken a variety of actions that help to promote the professional development of libraries, in conjunction with its role as the body with responsibility for national standards concerning documentation and information in Portugal.

Protecting and enhancing the country’s bibliographic heritage are another two fundamental aspects of the BNP’s mission, in its dual role as the entity that is responsible for preserving and controlling that heritage and the keeper of Portugal’s largest collection of bibliographic treasures. It is also charged with studying and publicising the latter in Portugal and abroad, which is accomplished by means of a range of projects involving inter-institutional cooperation, exhibitions, research activities and publications.

== Collections ==
The National Library of Portugal is the largest library in the country and a prestigious institution on the cultural scene. It collects, processes and preserves the nation’s bibliographic heritage and makes it available to the intellectual and scientific community.

The National Library of Portugal has a wide variety of collections that encompass documentation from every era, of every type and on every subject. A combination of the legal deposit system, acquisitions and donations mean that our holdings are constantly evolving. A special emphasis is placed on Portuguese works.

=== General collection ===
The General Collection is the BNP’s largest, with more than 3 million items, most of which are Portuguese publications. It covers the period from the 16th to the 21st centuries.
Initially composed of the holdings of the Library of the Royal Board of Censorship and the libraries of convents that were abolished in 1834, the collection is divided into sections of monographs by major topic, a set of special collections that have been donated to us over the years, and a huge collection of 50,000 Portuguese periodical titles and around 240 foreign ones.
The General Collection systematically contains everything that has been published in Portugal and provided to the Library under the Legal Deposit system since 1931. It also includes the theses and other academic works produced at Portugal’s universities, which have also been subject to mandatory legal deposit since 1986.

=== Rare Books and Manuscripts ===
The various collections that we generically term "Rare books and manuscripts" encompass the most valuable and important heritage assets in the BNP’s holdings. 
The collection of Manuscripts is currently actually made up of six collections, with library and archive documents of various genres and types and with a wide range of origins, from the 12th century to the present day. The overall collection contains a total of around 15,000 codices and 36,000 sundry manuscripts. 
The collection of rare Printed Books is made up of a selection of works whose rarity, age or publishing characteristics earn them a place in the BNP’s "Valuable Reserve" of printed books, which numbers more than 30,000 items. There are two main sections, which are divided on the basis of age: up until 1500 ([[Incunabula]]); and printed since 1501 (Rare books). We also have a number of other collections, which are grouped on the basis of a number of different criteria, such as subject, printer, or special characteristics. 
The Historical Archive contains archive documents from a variety of sources, with an emphasis on personal and family archives. The oldest documents date from the 11th century. In total there are around 466 separate collections (or parts of collection). The BNP’s own Historical Archive is included under this heading. 
The Archive of Contemporary Portuguese Culture (ACPC) is currently home to the collections of personal papers of 148 writers and other figures from the 19th and 20th centuries. Leading names include [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Eça de Queirós]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[Camilo Pessanha]], [[Antero de Quental]], Oliveira Martins, Jaime Cortesão, [[Raul Proença]], [[Vitorino Nemésio]], [[Vergílio Ferreira]] and [[José Saramago]], among others.

=== Cartography ===
The Cartography collection holds around 6,800 titles composed of both printed and manuscript atlases, maps and plans that have been made and/or published since the 16th century. Although the collection includes cartographic representations of every part of the world, the majority of the items portray Portugal and its former overseas domains.

=== Iconography ===
The Iconographic collections contain around 117,000 images on paper and have constituted a specialised section of the Library since 1976. They were originally formed from three initial collections that belonged to the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division (Prints, Drawings, and Religious Pictures), but were organised into a separate collection when the Library became fully aware of their importance to the study of history, sociology, art and so on, and came to recognise their heritage value.

=== Music ===
The BNP’s Music Collection is one of the most important in Portugal, and is especially useful for historical and musicological research. It contains more than 50,000 items ranging from the 12th to the 20th centuries, most of which were produced in Portugal. In addition to printed and manuscript scores, it offers books and periodicals on musical subjects, librettos, programmes, posters, photographs, a variety of personal and institutional archives and other material linked to the production of music and musical recordings.

=== Reading for the Visually Impaired ===
The reading service for the Visually Impaired has held and produced works in Braille and audio books since 1969. The service uses the paper, magnetic tape and digital formats. It has more than 7,000 items in Braille, including 4,000 musical works, and 1,575 audio titles.

'''''Canadian Western Bank v Alberta''''' [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3 is a [[landmark decision]] in [[Canadian constitutional law]] by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] (SCC) relating to the [[division of powers]] between Federal and Provincial legislative bodies.

==Background==
In 2000, [[Alberta]] enacted changes to its ''Insurance Act'' purporting to make federally chartered banks subject to the provincial licensing scheme governing the promotion of [[insurance]] products.  Upon the coming into force of that Act, the Bank, together with other [[Big Five (banks)|chartered bank]]s, brought an application for a declaration:

* that their promotion of certain insurance products authorized by the ''[[Bank Act (Canada)|Bank Act]]'' was banking within the meaning of s. 91(15) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', and
* that the ''Insurance Act'' and its associated regulations were constitutionally inapplicable to the banks' promotion of insurance by virtue of the doctrine of [[interjurisdictional immunity]] or, alternatively, inoperative by virtue of the doctrine of [[paramountcy (Canada)|federal paramountcy]].

The [[trial court]] dismissed the bank application and said:

* the ''Insurance Act'' is a valid exercise of provincial powers under §92(13),
* interjurisdictional immunity also fails because [[insurance]] is not "at the core" of [[banking]], and
* federal paramountcy does not apply because there is no operational conflict between federal and provincial law.

The [[appeal court]] reaffirmed the trial court decision.

==Decision==

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the appeal court.

The ''Insurance Act'' and its associated regulations apply to the banks' promotion of insurance. The fact that Parliament allows a bank to enter into a provincially regulated line of business such as insurance cannot, by federal statute, unilaterally broaden the scope of an exclusive federal legislative power granted by the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.

===Assessing constitutionality of legislation===

It was emphasized by the Court that all constitutional legal challenges to legislation should follow the same approach:

#  the pith and substance of the provincial law and the federal law should be examined to ensure that they are both validly enacted laws and to determine the nature of the overlap, if any, between them.
# the applicability of the provincial law to the federal undertaking or matter in question must be resolved with reference to the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity.
#only if both the provincial law and the federal law have been found to be valid pieces of legislation, and only if the provincial law is found to be applicable to the federal matter in question, then both statutes must be compared to determine whether the overlap between them constitutes a conflict sufficient to trigger the application of the doctrine of federal paramountcy.

===Pith and substance===

If the constitutionality of legislation is being questioned in relation to the division of powers under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'',  an analysis of its [[pith and substance]] must be undertaken. There is an inquiry into the true nature of the law in question for the purpose of identifying the matter to which it essentially relates.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

* If its pith and substance can be related to a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the legislature that enacted it, the courts will declare it ''[[intra vires]]''.
* If, however, it can more properly be said to relate to a matter that is outside the jurisdiction of that legislature, it will be held to be invalid owing to this violation of the division of powers.
* The corollary to this analysis is that legislation whose pith and substance falls within the jurisdiction of the legislature that enacted it may, at least to a certain extent, affect matters beyond the legislature's jurisdiction without necessarily being unconstitutional. The dominant purpose of the legislation is still decisive.
* Merely incidental effects will not disturb the constitutionality of an otherwise ''intra vires'' law.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The pith and substance doctrine is founded on the recognition that it is in practice impossible for a legislature to exercise its jurisdiction over a matter effectively without incidentally affecting matters within the jurisdiction of another level of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some matters are by their very nature impossible to categorize under a single head of power: they may have both provincial and federal aspects.  The [[double aspect]] doctrine, which applies in the course of a pith and substance analysis, ensures that the policies of the elected legislators of both levels of government are respected. The double aspect doctrine recognizes that both Parliament and the provincial legislatures can adopt valid legislation on a single subject depending on the perspective from which the legislation is considered, that is, depending on the various aspects of the matter in question.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', para. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain circumstances, however, the powers of one level of government must be protected against intrusions, even incidental ones, by the other level. The courts have developed the doctrines of [[interjurisdictional immunity]] and [[paramountcy (Canada)|federal paramountcy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', para. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interjurisdictional immunity===

The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity recognizes that the Canadian Constitution is based on an allocation of exclusive powers to both levels of government, not concurrent powers, but the powers are bound to interact. It is a doctrine of limited application that should be restricted to its proper limit.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Interjurisdictional immunity should in general be reserved for situations already covered by precedent. In practice, it is largely reserved for heads of power that deal with federal things, persons, or undertakings, or if, in the past, its application has been considered absolutely indispensable or necessary to achieve the purpose for which exclusive legislative jurisdiction was conferred, as discerned from the constitutional division of powers as a whole, or what is absolutely indispensable or necessary to enable an undertaking to carry out its mandate in what makes it specifically of one jurisdiction or the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', para. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

While in theory, a consideration of interjurisdictional immunity is apt for consideration after the pith and substance analysis, in practice, the absence of prior case law favouring its application to the subject matter at hand will generally justify a court proceeding directly to the consideration of federal paramountcy.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is properly available, the level of the intrusion on the core of the power of the other level of government must be considered. To trigger the application of the immunity, it is not enough for the provincial legislation simply to affect that which makes a federal subject or object of rights specifically of federal jurisdiction.  The difference between "affects" and "impairs" is that the former does not imply any adverse consequence whereas the latter does. In the absence of impairment, interjurisdictional immunity does not apply. It is only if the adverse impact of a law adopted by one level of government increases in severity from affecting to impairing that the core competence of the other level of government or the vital or essential part of an undertaking it duly constitutes is placed in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal paramountcy===

According to the doctrine of federal paramountcy, if the operational effects of provincial legislation are incompatible with federal legislation, the federal legislation must prevail and the provincial legislation is rendered inoperative to the extent of the incompatibility. The doctrine applies not only to cases in which the provincial legislature has legislated pursuant to its ancillary power to trench on an area of federal jurisdiction, but also to situations in which the provincial legislature acts within its primary powers, and Parliament pursuant to its ancillary powers. To trigger the application of the doctrine, the onus is on the party relying on the doctrine of federal paramountcy to demonstrate that the federal and provincial laws are in fact incompatible by establishing either that it is impossible to comply with both laws or that to apply the provincial law would frustrate the purpose of the federal law.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Western'', par. 69-75&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6740">The '''''Concio''''' (from the Latin contio, "assembly"), in the [[Republic of Venice]], was the general assembly of freemen ([[citizens]] and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s) from which the [[Doge]] was elected. It was in use between the years 742 and 1423 before it lost its function when the ''[[Serrata del Maggior Consiglio]]'' passed power into the hands of the aristocratic class interior.

==History==

===The origin and the conquest of power for the election of the Doge===

The origin of the popular assembly is uncertain. Assemblies of free men were already in existence in the 6th–7th centuries in various cities of maritime Venice for the election of local magistrates (or [[tribunes]]). Although the Venetian traditions called for a general meeting of Venetians, in 697 the appointment of the first Doge, [[Paolo Lucio Anafesto]], would have been the prerogative of the Byzantine Emperor through the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].

The first actual election was probably that of the third Doge, [[Orso Ipato]], when in 726 the Venetians, rejecting measures imposed by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] of the '[[Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian]], chose their own leadership autonomously. Upon the death of Orso however, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] replaced the government with a ducal courts annually in the ''[[magistri militum]]'' until 742 when the emperor formally granted the populate the right to elect the Doge.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Charles: ''La Repubblica di Venezia'', p.21., Newton &amp; Compton Editori.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the assembly at this time had yet be precisely defined and author John Deacon reports that in 887 Doge Giovanni Participazio II had to reaffirm that it was the responsibility of the people's assembly to elect the Doge.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni diacono, ''Cronaca'', in ''Cronache veneziane antichissime'', Fonti per la storia d'Italia IX, Roma 1890, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The struggle for power===
Despite the power delegated to the Concio, over time several [[Dukes]] tried to change the assembly,turning the [[monarchy]] from being an [[Elective Monarchy|elective]] into a [[hereditary]] arrangement. One strategy chosen was to circumvent the electoral power of the Concio by associating the [[throne]] with a [[co-regent]], also called co-Dux, selected from children or close relatives. This person would, on the death of the Doge, automatically succeed him, with the co-regent being already on the throne and thus in a position of strength.

It is unclear what role that the Assembly had at the time in the coronation of coreggenti, and whether it could exert some form of confirmation of their appointment. However between the 8th and 11th centuries, there were at least fifteen coreggenti that were associated with the throne.

This chaotic phase was resolved in 1032 when the Concio refused to recognize the coronation of Domenico Orseolo and appointed Flabanico Domenico in his place. At this time the Concio enacted the first law of the Constitutional Republic. This law forbade the practice of association to the throne, separated the perpetual [[Orseoli]] from the government, and provided two ducal councilors for the Doge, to constantly supervise his actions.

===The training of municipal institutions and the loss of power of Concio===
After this period the Concio in effect was the supreme arbiter of the state. It now faced the need to create permanent organizations that were able to replace the previous ducal power structures. At the same time, the ancient noble families were no longer committed to push for a hereditary sovereign and began to form, along with other prominent families, a class of aristocrats able to influence and direct the city politics.

In 1143, the city installed its first Consilium Sapientium, who was appointed by and responsible to support the Doge permanently in government. The new communal form of the State was sanctioned by the ''[[Veneciarum Commune]]'' ("City of Venice") documents.

The first step that marked the beginning of the decline of the power of Concio occurred in 1172. At this time, the Consilium Sapientium, became the Great Council and was entrusted with the ordinary legislative power. Also at this time, it decided to entrust the election ducal seven elected by voters. A second event came six years later in 1178 when the Concio lost significant control over the appointment of the doge. From that, the seven electors from this nominated no longer directly choose the Doge: they instead began to raffle four with the task of appointing the forty ducal actual voters. The [[Council of Forty]] sold out the task and then remained in power as an assembly of the government and as a [[supreme court]].

In 1207 the appointment of members of the Great Council was entrusted to a small group of three voters and then subsequently increased to seven in 1230. A consequence of this choices was that the aristocratic part increased in these municipal bodies. The [[status quo]] of popular power supported by an aristocratic power cracked in 1286 when two attempts, rejected, to foreclose access to the Great Council families popular, marked the opening of hostilities between the two factions. Rejected again in 1296, with difficulty, the proposed Serrata was finally approved at the urging of the Doge [[Pietro Gradenigo]] on 28 February 1297.

After these events, in 1300 and in 1310 a [[Marin Bocconio|plot of Marin Bocconio]] and [[Bajamonte Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] attempted a restoration of the people. However, these failed and the aristocratic form of the state was now a reality.

===The abolition===
Deprived of any real power, the Concio of the People survived only as a formal meeting at dell'acclamazione under the new Doge that was elected. The body still presented the crowd with a ritual phrase:

:( VEC )
::"Costui è il nostro signore, il [[Doge]], se vi piace!"

:( EN )
::"He is our lord, the Doge, if you like!" (ritual presentation of the new Doge to the People)

The meeting was at this point useless and officially abolished in 1423. However, the custom of ritual request for approval to the people remained in use until the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|fall of the Republic]] in 1797.

{{italic title}}
The '''Consumer Protection Act''' ({{lang-fr|'''Loi sur la protection du consommateur'''}}) is a [[Quebec law]] which gives protections to [[consumer]]s in dealing with merchants and businesses. It requires merchants to deal honestly in all matters of advertising, and in fair contracts.

== Aims and objectives of the Act ==
The Act applies to all contracts made in Quebec between a consumer and a merchant, in its capacity of conducting its business. The contract can be either for a product or a service.

The main purpose of the act is to level out inequalities in [[bargaining power]] between the consumer and the merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Anne-Marie|last=Beaudoin|title=Pour une réforme du droit de la consommation au Québec|language=fr|trans-title=On the legal reform of consumer rights in Quebec|place=Cowansville|publisher=Yvon Blais|date=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law annuls any contract term that contravenes this (similarly to, say, the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] in the United Kingdom).

== History and context of adoption ==

=== The emergence of consumerism ===
In the 1960s, [[consumerism]] became prominent in the United States, after its [[industrialisation]]. [[Market economy|Market economies]] flourished. The consumer movement was a response in Europe, and in Canada, to what was perceived as overwhelming [[market forces]] to the detriment of the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historique de la Loi sur la protection du consommateur|first=Myriam|last=Jézéquel|url=http://www.barreau.qc.ca/publications/journal/vol35/no21/historique.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumerism in Quebec ===
In Quebec, the emergence of a consumerist movement cast a light on the absence of consumer protection laws, notably the lack of legal obligations for businesses: the law was ''[[caveat emptor]]'', let the buyer beware. But slowly, laws were introduced, culminating in the first Consumer Protection Act in 1971, pushed forward by the lawyer [[Claude Masse]], who was later to become known as the main author of the law.&lt;ref name="Heureaux"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicole|last=L'Heureux|first2=Marc|last2=Lacoursière|title=Droit de la consommation|edition=6th|language=fr|trans-title=Consumer rights|place=Cowansville|publisher=Yvon Blais|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==

=== Amendments after adoption ===
Important amendments were made to the Act in 1978, seven years after the law was first adopted: these were mostly about advertising and guarantees (warranties). After this first major reform, several other smaller amendments have been enacted to cover new commercial practices.

=== Bill 24 (2011) ===
As an example, on 8 June 2011, the Quebec government ran through the "{{lang|fr|projet de loi 24}}" (Bill 24).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law|&lt;!--session=39|house=Quebec Parliament|section=60--&gt;|date=2 December 2009|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-24-39-2.html|title=Loi visant principalement à lutter contre le surendettement des consommateurs et à moderniser les règles relatives au crédit à la consommation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[white paper]] reformed and re-established the rights and responsibilities of the Act for [[consumer credit]] contracts and [[mortgage]]s; it put new responsibilities on lenders.

== Contents ==

=== Requirement for written contracts ===
Some contracts, especially those concerning credit terms that are established between a consumer and a merchant, must be made in writing. The law requires such contracts to be written in [[French language]] and signed by both parties, a copy to be given to the consumer.

A consumer has some minimal [[legal right]]s over the form of the contract, for example not to be held hostage over [[latent defect]]s in the product, and that a guarantee will do what it says.&lt;ref name="Masse"&gt;{{cite work|first=Claude|last=Masse|title=Loi sur la protection du consommateur : analyse et commentaire|place=[[Cowansville]]|language=fr|trans-title=Consumer protection law: analysis and commentary|publisher=Yvon Blais|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance selling regulations, and time to change one's mind ===
Contracts that are negotiated at a distance rather than in person (be it by post, email, telephone or Internet) without the personal presence of the merchant's negotiator have specific extra rights. The consumer may, within seven days, annul the contract.
 
The LPC allows internet trade but fixes the boundaries.. The rules state, amongst other things, that the consumer's consent must be obtained and also enforces lots of [[small print]] in the contract. In some circumstances, the seven-day rule can be extended.

A change of mind by the consumer should not imply that the seller was in any bad faith, but the object of the law is to give a "cooling off period" where the consumer may change his mind. If a seller wishes to enter into such a market, it is the seller's risk to do so: [[caveat vendor]]. That risk cannot be transferred to the consumer.

=== Credit contracts, insurance contracts and hire purchase in the motor trade ===
All credit contracts are covered by the Act. Responsibility for issuing credit is that of the creditor, that is, the merchant. The Act requires all creditors to inform them of any issuance. It is perfectly legal to ask the consumer to pay a premium for [[credit card]] purchases or any other form of credit, or to buy a car or motorcycle on [[closed-end leasing|lease]], but the rate of charge must be declared to the consumer.

The law is intended to prevent exorbitant [[interest rate]]s, and discourage meaningless guarantees. Recourse to the law is via the civil courts, as detailed below. The aim of the law is to make sure a fair price is paid for the credit and to give the consumer rights of redress if he thinks he has been overcharged.

=== In practice: Allowed or forbidden? ===
The right is reserved for merchants, producers and advertisers to make representation to the Act or to negotiate with the consumer. For example, if it is a matter of credit, there are a series of measures relating to advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law|title=Règlement d'application de la Loi sur la protection du consommateur|chapter=P-40.1, r.1|publisher=Parliament of Quebec|date=0000|language=French|trans-title=Regulations on the application of the Consumer Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without exception, sellers must clearly state the prices they will charge for credit. Some things given as "guarantees" must also be divulged to the consumer up-front. In general, advertising must be honest. Advertising to children less than thirteen years of age is forbidden.

Some traders, notably [[itinerant trader]]s ("[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]"s and "[[busker]]"s), may be excluded from these rules, if they have a permit issued by the Office de la protection du consommateur (the Office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/Index.aspx|title=Office de la protection du consommateur}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law gives authority to the Office that in certain circumstances it may suspend, annul, or refuse to issue such permits.

=== Legal recourse and penalties ===
Several avenues are available through the [[Quebec law|Quebec civil law]] system if a consumer believes he has been mistreated.

The consumer may demand that the contract be annulled if there is no evidence that he signed it, and it is the trader's responsibility to show he had.

At the last resort, the usual rules of the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] can be enforced in court, and the Act may ask for [[damages (law)|damages]]. This rarely happens, though, because usually cases are agreed between the merchant and the consumer before it comes to court.

Were it to come to it, the court can place impositions on the trader to remove or amend terms in their consumer contracts, or to stop them trading altogether.

== Office de la protection du consommateur ==
The ''Office de la protection du consommateur'' is established under the Act with responsibility to ensure the law is obeyed. Its remit, for overseeing the consumer protection laws, in practice comes in two parts:
#active surveillance of the law, and to uphold [[trading standards]]
#investigations and judgments on complaints by consumers after the fact.&lt;ref name="Heureaux"/&gt;

The Office is also responsible for registering consumer complaints, researching them, and publishing the results of its research in [[mass media]]. The Office does not, itself, take on the role of a prosecutor with any case that a consumer may wish to bring against a merchant.&lt;ref name="Masse"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">'''''Delegata potestas non potest delegari''''' is a principle in  [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]] that means in [[Latin]] that "no [[subdelegate|delegated]] powers can be further delegated." Alternatively, it can be stated '''''delegatus non potest delegare''''' ("one to whom power is [[delegate]]d cannot himself further delegate that power").&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is present in several [[jurisdictions]] such as that of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[India]] as well as in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]].

==Canada==
The principle was first articulated in [[Canada]] in 1943, in an article in the ''Canadian Bar Review'' by John Willis. While it is acknowledged as "the seminal articulation of the law governing the subdelegation of statutory and discretionary powers"&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; and it is still often cited,&lt;ref&gt;''Comeau's Sea Foods Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 12''&lt;/ref&gt; it has not achieved the rigid standing that was originally intended. The maxim has had some success as an operating principle in the restriction of delegation of legislative and judicial powers, but the demands of modern governmental regulatory practices have inhibited its application in the delegation of administrative powers.&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; Exceptions are rare and dependent on the statute conferring power.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ramawad v. Canada (Minister of manpower and Immigration) 2 S.C.R. 375''&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In [[India]], the law was first stated in ''A K ROY v. State Of Punjab'', (1986) 4 SCC 326, that sub delegation of delegated power is ultra vires to the Enabling Act.&lt;ref&gt; (1986) 4 SCC 326 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|last=manupatra|title=In Re: The Delhi Laws Act, 1912, the Ajmer-Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947 and the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950|url=|publisher=Manupatra|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In [[United States]], one of the earliest mentions of the principle occurred when it was cited by counsel for one of the litigants before the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] in 1794, in ''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794). The summary of the case reports, "Mr. Wilson had given no power to Noarth to transact his business; but if he even had, it is a maxim, that delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794).&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim was first cited by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''United States v. Sav. Bank'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881) in which the case summary reports that one of the litigants argued, "The duty imposed by statute on the commissioner cannot be delegated to a collector. Delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=SavBank&gt;''[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/104/104.US.728.html United States v. Sav. Bank]'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881); ''see also'', ''[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/276/276.US.394.242.html J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States]'', 276 U.S. 394, 405-406 (U.S. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In [[Australia]] the maxim has been largely superseded by [[Statute]] and [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;M Aronson and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2013) at 6.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D C Pearce and S Argument, Delegated Legislation in Australia (Lexis Nexis, 2012) at 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Creyke &amp; J McMillan, Control of Government Action: Text, Cases and Commentary, (3rd ed, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;There is a long line of authorities applying the [[Carltona doctrine|Carltona principles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Carltona doctrine|Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works]] [1943] 2 All ER 560.&lt;/ref&gt; to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners  (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 11 and 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DPP v His Honor Judge Fricke [1993] 1 VR 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though courts have found that where a stature expressly requires a personal action, such delegation is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kutlu v Director of professional Services Review (2011)197 FCR 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs(1997) 147 ALR 673 at 682.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dooney''&lt;ref&gt;Dooney v Henry (2000) 174 ALR 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Australia]]([[Ian Callinan|Callinan J]]),&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Groves, H. P. Lee, Australian Administrative Law: Fundamentals, Principles and Doctrines ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XP2WI_VrBWgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=No+permanent+head+of+a+department+in+the+Public+Service+is+expected+to+discharge+personally+all+the+duties+which+are+performed+in+his+name+and+for+which+he+is+accountable+to+the+responsible+Minister&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJyfpPkKfb&amp;sig=vN4vEYRQBh4YGyxjlrZ2kpdCgFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qMWWitnWAhWJE7wKHdcWCawQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=No%20permanent%20head%20of%20a%20department%20in%20the%20Public%20Service%20is%20expected%20to%20discharge%20personally%20all%20the%20duties%20which%20are%20performed%20in%20his%20name%20and%20for%20which%20he%20is%20accountable%20to%20the%20responsible%20Minister&amp;f=false  p262].&lt;/ref&gt; observed that&lt;I&gt; "No permanent head of a department in the Public Service is expected to discharge personally all the duties which are performed in his name and for which he is accountable to the responsible Minister&lt;/I&gt;."

This caselaw has been backed up by [[legislation]]. Section 34AA and 34AAB of the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]s &lt;i&gt;[[Acts Interpretation Act 1901]]&lt;/i&gt; clearly create a statutory power to delegate, contrary to the maxim. The federal legislation is echoed in some state legislation &lt;ref&gt;See for example &lt;I&gt;The Interpretation Act 1987&lt;/I&gt; of [[New South Wales]]  section 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts Interpretation Act 1915 ([[South Australia|SA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1918 ([[Western Australia|WA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic canon law==
{{canon law}}
Canon 137 of the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' states:

:§ 1 Ordinary executive power can be delegated either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the law expressly provides otherwise.

:§ 2 Executive power delegated by the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]] can be subdelegated, either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the delegation was deliberately given to the individual alone, or unless subdelegation was expressly prohibited.

:§ 3 Executive power delegated by another authority having ordinary power, if delegated for all cases, can be subdelegated only for individual cases; if delegated for a determinate act or acts, it cannot be subdelegated, except by the express grant of the person delegating.

:§ 4 No subdelegated power can again be subdelegated, unless this was expressly granted by the person delegating.

'''Electric Transit, Inc.''' (ETI) was a [[joint venture]] between the [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] group in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[AAI Corporation]] in the United States which made [[trolleybus]]es for the [[Trolleybuses in Dayton|Dayton]] and [[Trolleybuses in San Francisco|San Francisco trolleybus systems]], constructing a total of 330 trolleybuses. ETI was formed in 1994, and ownership was divided as 65% by [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] and 35% by [[AAI Corporation|AAI]]. The latter was a wholly owned subsidiary of United Industrial Corporation. Up to that time, Škoda had built more than 12,000 trolleybuses since 1935,&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;Wilkins, Van. "New Electric Trolley Buses in Dayton", in ''Bus World'' (ISSN 0162-9689). Summer 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; but none for cities outside Europe and Asia.

The company was awarded its first contract in November 1994, when the [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority]], of [[Dayton, Ohio]] placed an order for 63 two-axle trolleybuses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (now GDRTA)]] (Nov. 1, 1994). “RTA Awards Official Contract for 63 New Electric Trolleybuses.” ''[[Press release]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was later reduced to 61 vehicles,&lt;ref name= TM206&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine (TM)'' No. 206, March–April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to 57.&lt;ref name= TM207&gt;''TM'' No. 207, May–June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[prototype]] trolleybuses were delivered in December 1995 and January 1996.&lt;ref name=TM206/&gt; These were designated by ETI as model 14TrE, the E standing for "export", and were given fleet numbers 9601–9603 by MVRTA.&lt;ref name=TM207/&gt; Following modifications to the design, construction of the 54 production-series ETI trolleybuses for Dayton took place in 1998–99. These were model 14TrE2 and were numbered 9801–9854 in MVRTA's fleet. Among the modifications were the moving of the [[wheelchair lift]] from the rear door to the front door, which necessitated widening the body from {{convert|98|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|102|in|mm|abbr=on}} and changing from a one-piece windshield to a two-piece one.&lt;ref name="wilkins"/&gt;

In July 1997, the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni) contracted with ETI for the provision of 250 trolleybuses, comprising 220 [[Rigid bus|standard/two-axle]] ({{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}) and 30 [[Articulated bus|articulated]] ({{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}) vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Finnie, Chuck (June 1, 1999). “Muni trolley firm in crisis”, ''San Francisco Examiner'', p. A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; ETI designated the two types for San Francisco as models 14TrSF and 15TrSF, respectively. In February 2000, Muni exercised contract options to purchase an additional 20 two-axle and three articulated vehicles. Two prototypes for the two-axle trolleybuses (numbered 5401–5402) were received by Muni in January 1999 and June 1999, respectively, while an articulated prototype (No. 7101) was received in April 2000. The 238 production-series two-axle trolleybuses (Nos. 5403–5640) were delivered between May 2001 and early 2004. The production-series articulateds (7102–7133) were all delivered in 2003. All 273 of Muni's ETI trolleybuses had entered service by April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''TM'' No. 256, July–August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With both the Dayton and San Francisco orders, the chassis/body-frame (or shell) and motors of each vehicle were fabricated at Škoda's plant in [[Ostrov (Karlovy Vary District)|Ostrov nad Ohří]], [[Czech Republic]], then shipped to a facility in [[Hunt Valley, Maryland]] (near other [[AAI Corporation|AAI]] facilities) for initial fitting-out.&lt;ref name="frames"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bus frames have arrived|newspaper=[[Dayton Business Journal]]|date=March 25, 1997|url= http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/1997/03/24/daily7.html|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Trolley Buses: Procurement Program Highlights|publisher=[[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency|San Francisco MTA]]|url=http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218092119/http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2011 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except in the case of the prototypes, final fitting-out was undertaken in leased premises located in the two cities purchasing the vehicles, Dayton and San Francisco.

ETI originally was based in Dayton,&lt;ref name="frames"/&gt; but after completion of the contract for that city, the Dayton office was closed and ETI moved its administrative office to Hunt Valley, sharing space with partner AAI there.

In 2003, ETI engaged in a competitive bidding for a large contract (245 trolleybuses) being offered by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]], [[Canada]] for supply of trolleybuses to the [[Trolleybuses in Vancouver|Vancouver trolleybus system]], but lost out to [[New Flyer Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouc, Frantisek (July 15, 2004).

== Background ==
Leonardo Esteban appealed a [[Board of Veterans' Appeals]] (BVA) decision that denied entitlement to an increased rating for residuals of an injury to the right side of the face. Mr. Esteban served on active duty between July 1946 and April 1949. In January 1949, he injured his face during a motor vehicle accident in Japan.

In 1977, he attended a VA examination. The examination noted that there were four scars on the right side of his face. The report also detailed that there was an injury to the [[facial muscles]] and that he was experiencing pain in the area. The Veteran was ultimately granted service connection under diagnostic code 7800 at 10% disabling.

In 1988, while in the process of filing a claim for an increased evaluation, the Veteran provided medical evidence that he had paralysis on the right side of his face. BVA denied this claim for an increased evaluation. In June 1991, he filed again and provided medical evidence showing that he had impaired sensation on the side of his face and disfiguring scars. The report also showed that he had difficult with [[mastication]] and pain. The VA Regional Office denied a higher evaluation. The Board affirmed this decision, but conceded that the Veteran could be rated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7804 or 5325. However, the Board held that the Veteran was not entitled to multiple evaluations for the same disability. Therefore, the 10% disability was confirmed.

== Analysis ==
The Court rejected the argument by the Board. The Court noted that the rating criteria under diagnostic code 7800 was entirely cosmetic in nature, while the rating criteria under 7804 dealt only with the pain associated with the scarring itself. Additionally, diagnostic code 5325 only dealt with facial muscle damage resulting in difficulty with mastication. Therefore, his symptomatology was distinct and separate, thereby not in violation of [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/4.14 38. C.F.R. §4.14]. For these reasons, the Court held that the Veteran was entitled to separate evaluations under all three diagnostic codes, as none of the symptomatology for any one of the three conditions were duplicative or overlapping of the other two conditions.

== Decision ==
The appellant's motion was granted, the BVA decision reversed, and the case was [[remanded]].

{{Wiktionarypar|exhibit}}

An '''exhibit''', in a [[Criminal Law|criminal]] [[prosecution]] or a [[civil trial]], is [[physical evidence|physical]] or [[documentary evidence]] brought before the [[jury]].  The artifact or document itself is presented for the jury's inspection. Examples may include a [[weapon]] allegedly used in the crime, an [[invoice]] or written [[contract]], a [[photograph]], or a [[video recording]].

The main concept behind correct evidence handling is that the item recovered is the same as that produced in the court room.

The usual term applied to such handling is "chain of custody". The term denotes the links in the handling of the exhibit in question. For example, details of the item, the place, date, time it was recovered, and by whom it was recovered - the first link. The subsequent links in the chain refer to anyone required to handle the exhibit, mainly for identification purposes. The final link is the production of the item in court. This particular level of auditable handling is paramount when dealing with items of a forensic nature, as it reduces the opportunity for the defense to challenge the authenticity of the item.

The chain of custody can be less stringent when dealing with property which has a unique identifying feature like a serial number. In such a case, the physical security becomes the main concern of the person recovering the item. Such security is normally achieved by booking the item into a central evidence room.

The exhibits in any one law case are often labelled Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc. to distinguish between them.

==Other uses==
In [[personal injury]] cases, a legal or medical exhibit is created containing drawings or illustrations of human anatomy with graphic, medically accurate depictions of injuries and surgeries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of an accident or injury. Legal exhibits are commonly used by trial attorneys in personal injury cases to maximize the value of the case, enhance settlement negotiations, increase effectiveness of medical expert testimony and maximize trial presentation. The most common types of personal injury claims are road traffic accidents, accidents at work, tripping accidents, assault claims, accidents in the home, product defect accidents (product liability) and holiday accidents. This also includes medical or dental accidents and wrongful death cases resulting from the negligence of a health care provider.

A '''gaming control board''' ('''GCB'''), also called by various names including '''gambling control board''', '''casino control board''', '''gambling board''', and '''gaming commission''') is a [[government agency]] charged with [[Regulation|regulating]] [[casino]] and other types of gaming in a defined geographical area, usually a state, and of enforcing [[gaming law]] in general. The official name of this regulatory body varies among [[jurisdiction]]s.

==Rules and regulations==
Gaming control boards are usually responsible for promulgating rules and regulations that dictate how gaming activities are to be conducted within a jurisdiction. The rules and regulations stem from the jurisdiction's [[enabling act]]. Generally, the enabling act is passed by the [[legislature]] and sets forth the broad [[policy]] of the jurisdiction with regard to gaming; while the rules and regulations provide detailed requirements that must be satisfied by a gaming establishment, its owners, employees, and [[vendor]]s. Typically, rules and regulations cover a broad range of activity, including [[license|licensing]], [[accounting]] systems, rules of [[casino game]]s, and [[audit]]ing.

===Licensing===
Gaming control boards also have complete authority to grant or deny licenses to gaming establishments, their ownership, employees, and vendors. Generally, in order to obtain a license, an applicant must demonstrate that they possess good character, [[honesty]] and [[integrity]]. License application forms typically require detailed personal information. Based upon the type of license being sought, an applicant may also be required to disclose details regarding previous business relationships, employment history, criminal records, and financial stability.

Generally, the '''gaming license''' application process and subsequent investigation is quite burdensome in comparison to the process of obtaining other government-issued licenses. The difficulty of the process is intended to dissuade participation by unsavory people and [[organized crime]].

Recently, in order to simplify the application process, various gaming control boards have collaborated on the design of "multi-jurisdictional" application forms. Persons or vendors who are involved in gaming in multiple jurisdictions may now complete one application form and submit copies to each jurisdiction.

==Enforcement==
In some cases, Gaming Control Boards are responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations that they create. In other cases, a separate body or a division of the Gaming Control Board carries out the enforcement function. Most Gaming Control Boards have full authority to hear and decide [[civil law (common law)|civil]] cases brought before them by the enforcement body and thus are considered [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial bodies]].

=====Tribes=====
In the United States, some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribal nations have established their own gaming control boards for the purpose of regulating [[Native American gaming|tribe-owned casinos]] located within [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. Although the tribal nation also owns the casino, appointing an independent gaming control board to oversee regulatory activities provides tribal members with assurances that the casino is operated within expected standards and that tribal revenue is accurately collected and reported. Native American casinos are subject to the provisions of the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which is enforced by the [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] (NIGC). The NIGC establishes minimum internal control standards and other requirements that each Native American gaming control board must follow. However, the NIGC does not have jurisdiction over state-regulated entities.

'''Godbold's Vegetable Balsam''' was an English patent medicine concocted by Nathaniel Godbold (d.1799) in 1785, and produced by Godbold and later his sons into the 19th century.

Godbold was originally a gingerbread baker, but his product became one of the best-selling patent medicines of the 18th century for syphilis and various other maladies.  Though profits tailed off after the first ten years, Godbold made a small fortune and purchased a country estate from his profits.

==Novel advertising==
After his death in 1799, his epitaph at the [[Church of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul, Godalming]] was a literal advertisement for the product.&lt;ref&gt;Epitaph

==Ingredients==
An examination of the product around 1808 noted "we do not discover any property that can possibly entitle it to the appellation of a balsam, but the propriety of the term vegetable, we cannot dispute, as vinegar, sugar, and honey are vegetable productions." The product claimed to be produced from forty-two different vegetables, preserved separately in syrups, mixed with other gums and ingredients, and dissolved in double-distilled vinegar with some [[storax]] dissolved in spirits of wine and oil of cinnamon. It was then claimed to be bottled and held for three years before use. These elaborate directions would be impossible to ever follow, and scientific observers concluded the product was simply an "oxymel" (a form of [[mead]] created from honey and wine vinegar), though at times with some variation in ingredients.&lt;ref name="1832one"&gt;Macaulay, Alexander.

{{Evidence law}}

'''Hearsay''' is the legal term for certain statements—offered as evidence during a trial or hearing for the purpose of attempting to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statements—that were not made while testifying at the trial or hearing itself. In general, the witness will attempt to make a statement such as, "Sally told me Tom was in town" (for the purpose of proving that Tom was indeed "in town"), as opposed to "I saw Tom in town." Hearsay is not allowed as evidence in the United States, unless one of nearly thirty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Hearsay" Evidence |url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/evidence-witnesses/hearsay-evidence.html |work=Findlaw for the Public |accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; exceptions applies to the particular statement being made.

The hearsay rule is an analytic rule of evidence that defines hearsay and provides for both exceptions and exemptions from that rule. There is no all-encompassing definition of hearsay in the United States. However, most evidentiary codes defining hearsay adopt verbatim the rule as laid out in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], which reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;F.R.E. 801: Hearsay is a statement that the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and a party offers that statement in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this, the phrase "Out-of-court" is shorthand for any statement other than one made under oath and in front of the factfinder (the jury, or the judge in a bench trial) during the same proceeding in which it is being offered in evidence. "Matter asserted" means the matter asserted in the statement offered into evidence, not the matter "asserted" by the party offering the evidence. Evidence typically is introduced to support not just one proposition but a series of propositions, linked together in an inferential chain. If ''any one'' of the propositions in the inferential chain is "the truth of the matter asserted" in the out-of-court statement, the evidence falls within the traditional definition of hearsay. The declarant is the person that makes the out-of-court statement—not the person bringing the action (lawsuit).

Note: In ''hearsay'' law, "witness" means someone who testifies under oath, from the witness stand and "declarant" refers to someone who makes a statement of any kind, whether or not under oath, and whether in or out of court (according to the Federal Rules of Evidence).

In ''everyday'' law, "witness" means someone who sees or observes something and "declarant" means someone who says something under oath. The distinctions in the definitions of these words is important to consider in hearsay law.

Historically, the rule against hearsay was aimed at prohibiting the use of another person's statement, as equivalent to testimony by the witness to the fact. Unless the second person is brought to testify in court where they may be placed under oath and cross-examined, the factfinder cannot gauge the witness' credibility.

==Theory==
The theory of the rule excluding hearsay is that assertions made by human beings are often unreliable; such statements are often insincere, subject to flaws in memory and perception, or infected with errors in narration at the time they are given. Furthermore, someone testifying in court regarding another's out-of-court statement may have misheard or misremembered that statement, in addition to possibly having misinterpreted the speaker's sincerity, etc. The law therefore finds it necessary to subject this form of evidence to "scrutiny or analysis calculated to discover and expose in detail its possible weaknesses, and thus to enable the tribunal (judge or jury) to estimate it at no more than its actual value".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Wigmore|Wigmore]] on Evidence §1360&lt;/ref&gt;

Three tests are calculated to expose possible weaknesses in a statement:
# Assertions must be taken under oath
# Assertions must be made in front of the tribunal (judge or jury)
# Assertions must be subject to cross-examination.

Assertions not subject to these three tests are (with some exceptions) prohibited insofar as they are offered testimonially (for the truth of what they assert).

==Federal Rules of Evidence==
The Federal Rules of Evidence (See Article VIII) provide a general definition of hearsay as a "statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted". Subject to two classes of "exemptions", this definition classifies a statement as hearsay if the statement meets two requirements: (1) the statement must be extrajudicial (i.e. not made by this witness in this proceeding). (2) The statement must be offered to prove the truth of what the statement asserts if anything.

However, as noted below, the Federal Rules of Evidence also provide two specific categories of ''exemptions'' of certain kinds of statements from this rule; statements in these categories are defined as "Non-hearsay".

Typically, one can classify a statement as hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence using a three-step analysis. A statement will be considered hearsay if it is:

# An assertive statement
# Made by an out-of-court declarant
# Is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein.

An "assertive statement" is generally defined as the intentional communication of fact. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an assertive statement can be oral, written, or non-verbal conduct if it was intended to be an assertion. However, any verbal or non-verbal conduct that was not intended to communicate a fact will not be considered an assertive statement.

In order for the statement to satisfy the "out-of-court declarant" element of hearsay, very simply stated, the statement must have been made outside of the courtroom that the present proceeding is taking place in—meaning that if the statement was made in another courtroom, it is still made by an "out-of-court" declarant.
(However, some "out-of-court" statements under oath may still be admissible as a declaration against interest.)

Lastly, if a statement is being offered for its truth—meaning that its relevance depends upon the jury believing the substance of the statement—then it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. If a statement is relevant for any other purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted therein, then the statement will not be considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

==Application==
Generally in [[common law]] courts the "hearsay rule" applies, which says that a trier of fact (judge or jury) cannot be informed of a hearsay statement unless it meets certain strict requirements. However, the rules for admissibility are more relaxed in court systems based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. In the civil law system, the courts, whether consisting only of judges or featuring a [[jury]], have wide latitude to appreciate the evidence brought before them.

[Note: [[Louisiana]], a civil-law jurisdiction, does not share the above referenced feature generally found in civil-law jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Louisiana follows rules predicated upon the Federal Rules of Evidence.]

Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the hearsay rule only applies to actual trials. Hearsay is admissible as evidence in many other judicial proceedings, such as [[grand jury]] deliberations, [[probation]] hearings, [[parole]] revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.

In criminal law, ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]'', 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated the standard for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the [[Confrontation Clause]] of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. ''Crawford'' gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the declarant knows that the statement is likely to be used in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest. When statements are directly accusatory, the defense needs an opportunity to explore the accuser's motives. Where statements are the product of police interrogation, there is a need to ensure that the testimony is not the product of improper coercion or intimidation.

''Ohio v. Roberts'', 448 U.S. 56 (1980), set forth a two-pronged test in order for hearsay to be admissible against a criminal defendant: (1) the declarant generally must be shown to be unavailable; and (2) the statement must have been made under circumstances providing sufficient "indicia of reliability". With respect to the second prong, a reliability determination may assume that hearsay is sufficiently reliable for constitutional purposes if it satisfies a "firmly rooted" hearsay exception. In practice this means that lower courts need to make reliability determinations only for hearsay that is offered under a "catchall" exception, such as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm#Rule807 Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 807], or under new or non-traditional hearsay exceptions that are not "firmly rooted". However, ''Crawford v. Washington'' overruled ''Ohio v. Roberts''.

==Common misconceptions==
One major misconception about the hearsay rule is that hearsay is never admissible in court. While the general rule is that such evidence is inadmissible, there are many exceptions.

There are two other common misconceptions concerning the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The hearsay rule applies to all out-of-court statements whether oral, written or otherwise.&lt;ref name="Non-verbal assertion"&gt;[[Federal Rules of Evidence|FRE]] 801(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Rules of Evidence defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion. Even written documents made under oath, such as affidavits or notarized statements, are subject to the 'hearsay rule'.

The second common misconception is that all out-of-court statements are hearsay. This is not the case. An out of court statement may or may not be hearsay depending on the purpose for which it is offered. If the statement is being offered to prove the truth of what it asserts, then it becomes hearsay. When offered for any other purpose the statement is not hearsay. For example: Witness testifies that yesterday he spoke to Jim (who was in Vermont) on the phone and that Jim made the following statement, "It's raining in Vermont!" If the attorney is seeking to use this statement to prove that it was in fact raining in Vermont, then it is hearsay. But, if the attorney is seeking to use the statement to prove that the phone lines were working that day, or that Jim had not lost the power of speech, or for any other purpose, then the statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.

Consider an additional example:
:A police officer, hears cries of "Help, John is trying to kill me!" from inside a house. Believing that there is a crime in progress, the officer kicks the front door down and enters the home to discover the homeowner, John, assaulting a victim, Monica, who is crying and visibly shaking. John is charged with attempted murder. Two separate trials might result from these circumstances.
:#First, a criminal trial against John, who proclaims his innocence and demands a trial for the criminal charges alleged.
:#Second, a civil trial in which John sues the police officer for invading his home, wherein the officer will assert that there was just cause to enter the home because he had a genuine belief that a crime was occurring.

In the first trial, the issue is whether John attempted to kill Monica. The officer is asked to testify to what he heard Monica scream from inside the house: "Help, John is trying to kill me!" This statement would be hearsay. The officer is being asked to testify to what Monica said to prove that John attempted to murder Monica. Unless the attorney can show that this statement falls within an exception to the hearsay rule, the factfinder (the judge or jury) may not consider Monica's statement (this particular statement, however, would likely be admissible because of "Excited Utterance" and "Present sense impression" exceptions).

In the second trial, however, the issue is not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the statement is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer ''believed'' that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.

A person's ''own'' prior statements can be hearsay. For example, suppose a person is testifying on the stand. In relation to an automobile accident where a blue truck struck a yellow car, the witness testifies, "I told the police officer the truck was blue" to establish the color of the car (as opposed to whether he had lied to police, or the officer had falsified the witness reports). This statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted, and is therefore hearsay. The witness is testifying about what someone said in the past. The fact that it is his own statement does not change the hearsay nature of the statement.

If the witness testifies, "The truck that struck the yellow car was blue," the statement is ''not'' hearsay. The witness is not testifying about a past statement. He is not relating in court what someone outside of court said, but is merely relating an observation.

The rule that a person's own statements can be considered hearsay may be confusing. By "forgetting" who is testifying on the stand and merely looking for statements like "I said", "I wrote", "I testified before that", "The document says", and the like, most confusion can be eliminated.

In this example, simple logic tells that there is a difference: while the first statement may be true, it does not assert anything about the truth of the matter stated. The witness may have told the officer that the truck was blue, but that may not have been the truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.

==Non-hearsay under the Federal Rules==
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, two broad categories of statements are exempt from the rule's general definition. These are referred to as hearsay "exemptions" and are of two types:

===Admission by a party-opponent===
{{Main|Party admission}}
An admission by a party-opponent is a statement offered against another party that meets one of five criteria:
#The party against whom the statement is being offered is also the declarant of that statement either personally or in a representative capacity.
#The party against whom the statement is being offered manifested an adoption or belief in the statement's truth.
#The party against whom the statement is being offered authorized the declarant to make the statement.
#The statement is made by an agent of the party against whom it is being offered and concerns a matter within the scope of the employment and is made during the course of that employment.
#The declarant was a co-conspirator of the party against whom the statement is being offered and the statement is in furtherance of their conspiracy.

The theory underlying this "exemption" is derived from the nature of the hearsay rule itself. The hearsay rule operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying "I object to this statement as untrustworthy because I am not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" But what if the defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, "hearsay" in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, "This statement is unreliable because ''I'' cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" In this situation the objection of the Hearsay rule falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another way of looking at it is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him ''has'' an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.

===Prior statement of a witness===
A prior statement is not hearsay if the person who made the statement (the "declarant") is currently testifying and is subject to cross-examination at the current trial/hearing/proceeding/deposition, '''and'''

* (A) the prior statement is [[Witness impeachment#Impeachment categories|'''''inconsistent''''']] with the declarant's testimony at the current trial/hearing/proceeding/deposition and the prior statement was given under oath at a prior trial/hearing/proceeding/deposition—in which case it may be used both for impeachment and substantively; '''or''' 
* (B) the prior statement is '''''consistent''''' with the declarant's testimony, and is offered to rebut a charge that the declarant has made a recent fabrication, or a charge of the declarant's improper influence or motive, i.e. the declarant's [[Witness impeachment#Impeachment categories|bias]]; '''or'''
* (C) the prior statement was an identification of a person made after perceiving that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801 | title=F.R.E. 801(d)(1)(A)-(C) | work=[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute] | accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
Some statements are defined as hearsay, but may nevertheless be admissible as [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] in court. These statements relate to ''exceptions'' to the general rule on hearsay. Some (but not all) exceptions to the hearsay rule apply only when the [[declarant]] is unavailable for testimony at the trial or hearing.

Many of the exceptions listed below are treated more extensively in individual articles.

===Exceptions where the declarant's availability is irrelevant===
#'''''[[Excited utterances]]''''': Statements relating to startling events or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Brian A. |editor1-last=Garner |editor1-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]] |edition=7 |page=585 |year=1999 |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |location=St. Paul, Minn. |isbn=0314199500}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, and the victim is still under the stress of the event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance does not have to be made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.
#'''''[[Present sense impression]]''''': A statement expressing the declarant's impression of a condition existing at the time the statement was made, such as "it's hot in here" or "we're going really fast." Unlike an excited utterance, it need not be made in response to a startling event. Instead, it is admissible because it is a condition that the witness would likely have been experiencing at the same time as the declarant, and would instantly be able to corroborate.
#'''''Declarations of present state of mind''''': Much like a present-sense impression describes the outside world, declarant's statement to the effect of "I am angry!" or "I am [[Napoleon]]!" will be admissible to prove that the declarant was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant's mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements are also used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the declarant, like his saying, "I'm gonna go buy some groceries and get the oil changed in my car on my way home from work." Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. Any statements contained therein that attribute fault or causation to an individual will generally ''not'' be admissible under this exception.
#'''''[[Business records exception]]''''': business records created during the ordinary course of business are considered reliable and can usually be brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the business records exception.
#'''''[[Prior inconsistent statements]]''''': Many states have departed from the approach of the federal rules with respect to inconsistent statements. Under current law in these jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness (even when not made under oath at a judicial proceeding or deposition) is admissible as substantive evidence provided the declarant signed the statement.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', ''e.g.'', ''[[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady|Commonwealth v. Brady]]'', 507 A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986). Although proposed on numerous occasions, this exception ''has not'' been adopted in federal court.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Other exceptions, declarant's availability immaterial''''': In the United States [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], separate exceptions are made for '''''public records''''', '''''family records''''', and records in '''''[[ancient document]]s''''' of established authenticity. When regular or public records are kept, the ''absence'' of such records may also be used as admissible hearsay evidence.

===Exceptions available where the declarant is unavailable===
*'''''[[Dying declarations]]''''' and other '''''statements under belief of impending death''''': often depicted in movies; the police officer asks the person on his deathbed, "Who attacked you?" and the victim replies, "The butler did it." In reality, case law has ruled out this exception in [[criminal law]], because the witness should always be cross examined in court; however, there is an exception to this exception for criminal cases: even though generally inadmissible to matters relating to criminal law, the exception has been carved out for actions relating to homicide cases [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)].
*'''''[[Declaration against interest]]''''': A statement that would incriminate or expose the declarant to liability to such an extent that it can be assumed he would only make such a statement if it were true. It would be assumed that one would lie to further one's interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing oneself to criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.&lt;ref name="Statement against interest"&gt;[[Federal Rules of Evidence|FRE]] 804(b)(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''''Admission of guilt''''': if a declarant makes a statement, verbal or otherwise, as an admission of guilt of ''the matter at hand'', that statement is admissible. Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.&lt;ref name="Admission"&gt;[[Federal Rules of Evidence|FRE]] 801(d)(2)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Prior testimony''''': if the testimony was given under oath and the party against whom the testimony is being proffered was present and had the opportunity to cross examine the witness at that time. Often used to enter [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s into the court record at trial.
*'''''Forfeiture by wrongdoing''''': the party against whom the statement is now offered (1) intentionally made the declarant unavailable; (2) with intent to prevent declarant's testimony; (3) by wrongdoing.

===Theories supporting exceptions===
In some jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the limited exceptions format to the rule have been replaced by a more general theory of exceptions to the hearsay rule that allows courts to decide when documents, testimony or other evidentiary proof can be used that might not otherwise be considered. &lt;!-- [more can be written about this]. --&gt;

The underlying rationale for many of the hearsay exceptions is that the circumstances of a particular statement make them reliable enough to be heard by a trier of fact. Statements made during the course of medical treatment, for example, are considered reliable because patients typically have little reason to lie to a doctor while they are being treated, and will generally be accurate in describing their ailments.

This, of course, is not always true. Patients do sometimes lie to their doctors (to get painkillers to which they are not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.

They were a usual accompaniment to [[feudal tenures]] and conferred power  on great families. Both before and after [[Act of Union 1707|the Union]] frequent attempts were made by statute to restrict them, since they were recognized as a source of danger to the state. All were finally abolished by the [[Heritable Jurisdictions Act]] in 1747, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], with compensation available upon formal application by the dispossessed.

[[File:International Military Tribunal Ichigaya Court.jpg|thumb|The International Military Tribunal for the Far East was convened at Ichigaya Court, formerly the Imperial Japanese Army H building, in [[Ichigaya]], Tokyo.]]

The '''International Military Tribunal for the Far East''' ('''IMTFE'''), also known as the '''Tokyo Trial''' or the '''Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal''', was a [[military trial]] convened on April 29, 1946, to [[Criminal procedure|try]] the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for [[crimes against peace|joint conspiracy to start and wage war]] (categorized as "Class A" crimes), conventional war crimes ("Class B") and crimes against humanity ("Class C").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More about the IMTFE|url=http://libguides.law.uga.edu/c.php?g=177176&amp;p=1164581|website=Guides @ Georgia Law|publisher=The University of Georgia School of Law|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven countries ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], [[British India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) provided judges and prosecutors for the court. The defense comprised Japanese and American lawyers.

Twenty-eight Japanese military and political leaders were charged with 55 separate counts encompassing the waging of aggressive war, murder and conventional war crimes committed against prisoners-of-war, civilian internees and the inhabitants of occupied territories. The defendants included former prime ministers, former foreign ministers and former military commanders. In the course of the proceedings, the court ruled that 45 of the counts, including all the murder charges, were either redundant or not authorized under the IMTFE Charter.

Two defendants died during the proceedings and one was ruled unfit to stand trial. All remaining defendants were found guilty of at least one count. Sentences ranged from seven years' imprisonment to execution.

The tribunal was adjourned on November 12, 1948.

==Background==

The Tribunal was established to implement the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]], the [[Potsdam Declaration]], the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]]. The Potsdam Declaration (July 1945) had stated, "stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners," though it did not specifically foreshadow trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html|title=Potsdam Declaration|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of reference for the Tribunal were set out in the IMTFE Charter, issued on January 19, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.3_1946%20Tokyo%20Charter.pdf|title=IMTFE Charter|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was major disagreement, both among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and within their administrations, about whom to try and how to try them. Despite the lack of consensus, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]], decided to initiate arrests. On September 11, a week after the surrender, he ordered the arrest of 39 suspects—most of them members of General [[Hideki Tōjō]]'s war cabinet. Tōjō tried to commit suicide, but was resuscitated with the help of U.S. doctors.

==Creation of the court==
[[File:IMTFE judges.jpg|thumb|The judges]]

On January 19, 1946, MacArthur issued a special proclamation ordering the establishment of an International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE). On the same day, he also approved the [[Tokyo Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (CIMTFE), which prescribed how it was to be formed, the crimes that it was to consider, and how the tribunal was to function. The charter generally followed the model set by the [[Nuremberg trials]]. On April 25, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the CIMTFE, the original Rules of Procedure of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East with amendments were promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imtfech.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222030537/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imtfech.htm |title=Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East|accessdate=May 12, 2012|archivedate=February 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Within documents relating to the IMTFE, it is also referred to as the "Charter".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rules of Procedure of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. April 25, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tokyo War Crimes Trial==

[[File:IMTFE court chamber.jpg|thumb|View of the Tribunal in session: the bench of judges is on the right, the defendants on the left, and the prosecutors in the back]]

Following months of preparation, the IMTFE convened on April 29, 1946. The trials were held in the War Ministry office in Tokyo.

On May 3 the prosecution opened its case, charging the defendants with crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The trial continued for more than two and a half years, hearing testimony from 419 witnesses and admitting 4,336 exhibits of evidence, including depositions and affidavits from 779 other individuals.

===Charges===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Following the model used at the Nuremberg trials in Germany, the Allies established three broad categories. "Class A" charges, alleging crimes against peace, were to be brought against Japan's top leaders who had planned and directed the war. Class B and C charges, which could be leveled at Japanese of any rank, covered conventional war crimes and crimes against humanity, respectively. Unlike the Nuremberg trials, the charge of crimes against peace was a prerequisite to prosecution—only those individuals whose crimes included crimes against peace could be prosecuted by the Tribunal. In the event, no Class C charges were heard in Tokyo.

The indictment accused the defendants of promoting a scheme of conquest that "contemplated and carried out ... murdering, maiming and ill-treating [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (and) [[civilian internee]]s ... [[Unfree labour|forcing them to labor]] under inhumane conditions ... [[Looting|plundering]] [[public property|public]] and [[private property]], wantonly destroying [[cities]], [[town]]s and [[village]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s beyond any justification of [[military necessity]]; (perpetrating) [[mass murder]], [[War rape|rape]], pillage, [[brigandage]], [[torture]] and other barbaric cruelties upon the helpless [[civilian]] [[population]] of the over-run countries."

Keenan issued a press statement along with the indictment: "War and treaty-breakers should be stripped of the glamour of national heroes and exposed as what they really are—plain, ordinary murderers."

===Evidence and testimony===

The prosecution began opening statements on May 3, 1946, and took 192 days to present its case, finishing on January 24, 1947. It submitted its evidence in fifteen phases.

The Charter provided that evidence against the accused could include any document "without proof of its issuance or signature" as well as diaries, letters, press reports, and sworn or unsworn out-of-court statements relating to the charges.{{sfn|Brackman|1987|p=60}} Article 13 of the Charter read, in part: "The tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence ... and shall admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value."{{sfn|Minear|1971|p=118}}

Wartime press releases of the Allies were admitted as evidence by the prosecution, while those sought to be entered by the defense were excluded. The recollection of a conversation with a long-dead man was admitted. Letters allegedly written by Japanese citizens were admitted with no proof of authenticity and no opportunity for cross examination by the defense.{{sfn|Minear|1971|p=120}}

The Tribunal embraced the [[best evidence rule]] once the Prosecution had rested.{{sfn|Minear|1971|pp=122–123}} The best evidence rule dictates that the "best" or most authentic evidence must be produced (for example, a map instead of a description of the map; an original instead of a copy; and a witness instead of a description of what the witness may have said). Justice Pal, one of two justices to vote for acquittal on all counts, observed, "in a proceeding where we had to allow the prosecution to bring in any amount of hearsay evidence, it was somewhat misplaced caution to introduce this best evidence rule particularly when it operated practically against the defense only."{{sfn|Minear|1971|pp=122–123}}

To prove their case, the prosecution team relied on the doctrine of "[[command responsibility]]." This doctrine was that it did not require proof of criminal orders. The prosecution had to prove three things: that war crimes were systematic or widespread; the accused knew that troops were committing atrocities; and the accused had power or authority to stop the crimes.

The prosecution argued that a 1927 document known as the [[Tanaka Memorial]] showed that a "common plan or conspiracy" to commit "crimes against peace" bound the accused together. Thus, the prosecution argued that the conspiracy had begun in 1927 and continued through to the end of the war in 1945. The Tanaka Memorial is now considered by most historians to have been a forgery; however, it was not regarded as such at the time.{{CN|date=May 2018}}

===Defense===

The defendants were represented by over a hundred attorneys, three-quarters of them Japanese and one-quarter American, plus a support staff. The defense opened its case on January 27, 1947, and finished its presentation 225 days later on September 9, 1947.

The defense argued that the trial could never be free from substantial doubt as to its "legality, fairness and impartiality."&lt;ref&gt;George Furness, a Defense Counsel, stated, "[w]e say that regardless of the known integrity of the individual members of this tribunal they cannot, under the circumstances of their appointment, be impartial; that under the circumstances this trial, both in the present day and in history, will never be free from substantial doubt as to its legality, fairness and impartiality."&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense challenged the indictment, arguing that crimes against peace, and more specifically, the undefined concepts of conspiracy and aggressive war, had yet to be established as crimes in [[international law]]; in effect, the IMTFE was contradicting accepted legal procedure by trying the defendants retroactively for violating laws which had not existed when the alleged crimes had been committed. The defense insisted that there was no basis in international law for holding individuals responsible for acts of state, as the Tokyo Trial proposed to do. The defense attacked the notion of negative criminality, by which the defendants were to be tried for failing to prevent breaches of law and war crimes by others, as likewise having no basis in international law.

The defense argued that Allied Powers' violations of international law should be examined.

Former Foreign Minister [[Shigenori Tōgō]] maintained that Japan had had no choice but to enter the war for self-defense purposes. He asserted that "[because of the [[Hull Note]]] we felt at the time that Japan was being driven either to war or suicide."

===Judgment===

After the defense had finished its presentation on September 9, 1947 the IMT spent fifteen months reaching judgment and drafting its 1,781-page opinion. The reading of the judgment and the sentences lasted from December 4 to 12, 1948. Five of the eleven justices released separate opinions outside the court.

In his concurring opinion Justice [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] of Australia took issue with Emperor Hirohito's legal status, writing, "The suggestion that the Emperor was bound to act on advice is contrary to the evidence." While refraining from personal indictment of Hirohito, Webb indicated that Hirohito bore responsibility as a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] who accepted "ministerial and other advice for war" and that "no ruler can commit the crime of launching aggressive war and then validly claim to be excused for doing so because his life would otherwise have been in danger ... It will remain that the men who advised the commission of a crime, if it be one, are in no worse position than the man who directs the crime be committed."{{sfn|Röling|Rüter|1977|p=478}}

Justice [[Delfín Jaranilla]] of the Philippines disagreed with the penalties imposed by the tribunal as being "too lenient, not exemplary and deterrent, and not commensurate with the gravity of the offence or offences committed."

Justice Henri Bernard of France argued that the tribunal's course of action was flawed due to Hirohito's absence and the lack of sufficient deliberation by the judges. He concluded that Japan's declaration of war "had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present Defendants could only be considered as accomplices"{{sfn|Röling|Rüter|1977|p=496}} and that a "verdict reached by a Tribunal after a defective procedure cannot be a valid one."

"It is well-nigh impossible to define the concept of initiating or waging a war of aggression both accurately and comprehensively," wrote Justice [[Bert Röling]] of the Netherlands in his dissent. He stated, "I think that not only should there have been neutrals in the court, but there should have been Japanese also." He argued that they would always have been a minority and therefore would not have been able to sway the balance of the trial. However, "they could have convincingly argued issues of government policy which were unfamiliar to the Allied justices." Pointing out the difficulties and limitations in holding individuals responsible for an act of state and making omission of responsibility a crime, Röling called for the acquittal of several defendants, including Hirota.

Justice [[Radhabinod Pal]] of the British empire produced a 1,235-page judgment&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdh-fact.com/mail-magazine/452/|title=SDHF Newsletter No. 18: “Dissentient Judgment of Justice Pal” {{!}} Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdh-fact.com|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he dismissed the legitimacy of the IMTFE as [[victor's justice]]: "I would hold that each and every one of the accused must be found not guilty of each and every one of the charges in the indictment and should be acquitted on all those charges." While taking into account the influence of wartime propaganda, exaggerations, and distortions of facts in the evidence, and "over-zealous" and "hostile" witnesses, Pal concluded, "The evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by the members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian population of some of the territories occupied by them as also against the prisoners of war."

===Sentencing===

One defendant, [[Shūmei Ōkawa]], was found mentally unfit for trial and the charges were dropped.

Two defendants, [[Yōsuke Matsuoka|Matsuoka Yosuke]] and [[Osami Nagano|Nagano Osami]], died of natural causes during the trial.

Six defendants were sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace (Class A, Class B and Class C):
* General [[Kenji Doihara]], chief of the intelligence services in Manchukuo
* [[Kōki Hirota]], prime minister (later foreign minister)
* General [[Seishirō Itagaki]], war minister
* General [[Heitarō Kimura]], commander, Burma Area Army
* Lieutenant General [[Akira Mutō]], chief of staff, 14th Area Army
* General [[Hideki Tojo|Hideki Tōjō]], commander, Kwantung Army (later prime minister)
One defendant was sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity (Class B and Class C):
*General [[Iwane Matsui]], commander, Shanghai Expeditionary Force and Central China Area Army

They were executed at [[Sugamo Prison]] in [[Ikebukuro]] on December 23, 1948. MacArthur, afraid of embarrassing and antagonizing the Japanese people, defied the wishes of President Truman and barred photography of any kind, instead bringing in four members of the Allied Council to act as official witnesses.

Sixteen defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment. Three (Koiso, Shiratori, and Umezu) died in prison, while the other thirteen were [[parole]]d between 1954 and 1956:
* General [[Sadao Araki]], war minister
* Colonel [[Kingoro Hashimoto|Kingorō Hashimoto]], major instigator of the [[second Sino-Japanese War]]
* Field Marshal [[Shunroku Hata]], war minister
* Baron [[Hiranuma Kiichirō|Kiichirō Hiranuma]], prime minister
* [[Naoki Hoshino]], Chief Cabinet Secretary
* [[Okinori Kaya]], finance minister
* Marquis [[Kōichi Kido]], [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan|Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal]]
* General [[Kuniaki Koiso]], governor of Korea, later prime minister
* General [[Jirō Minami]], commander, Kwantung Army
* Admiral [[:ja:岡敬純|Takazumi Oka]], naval minister
* Lieutenant General [[Hiroshi Ōshima]], Ambassador to Germany
* General [[:ja:佐藤賢了|Kenryō Satō]], chief of the Military Affairs Bureau
* Admiral [[Shigetarō Shimada]], naval minister
* [[Toshio Shiratori]], Ambassador to Italy
* Lieutenant General [[Teiichi Suzuki]], president of the Cabinet Planning Board
* General [[Yoshijirō Umezu]], war minister

Foreign minister [[Shigenori Tōgō]] was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and died in prison in 1949. Foreign minister [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] was sentenced to 7 years. He later served as Foreign Minister and as Deputy Prime Minister of post-war Japan.

The verdict and sentences of the tribunal were confirmed by MacArthur on November 24, 1948, two days after a perfunctory meeting with members of the [[Allied Commission#Japan|Allied Control Commission for Japan]], who acted as the local representatives of the nations of the Far Eastern Commission. Six of those representatives made no recommendations for clemency. Australia, Canada, India, and the Netherlands were willing to see the general make some reductions in sentences. He chose not to do so. The issue of clemency was thereafter to disturb Japanese relations with the Allied powers until the late 1950s, when a majority of the Allied powers agreed to release the last of the convicted major war criminals from captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Sandra; Cribb, Robert; Trefalt, Beatrice; Aszkielowicz, Dean (2017).

==Other war crimes trials==

More than 5,700 lower-ranking personnel were charged with conventional war crimes in separate trials convened by [[Australia]], [[Nationalist Government|China]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], the [[Netherlands Indies]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. The charges covered a wide range of crimes including prisoner abuse, rape, sexual slavery, torture, ill-treatment of labourers, execution without trial, and inhumane medical experiments. The trials took place in around fifty locations in Asia and the Pacific. Most trials were completed by 1949, but Australia held some trials in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Sandra; Cribb, Robert; Trefalt, Beatrice; Aszkielowicz, Dean (2017). ''Japanese War Criminals: the Politics of Justice after the Second World War''. New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231179225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nationalist Government|China]] held 13 tribunals, resulting in 504 convictions and 149 executions.

Of the 5,700 Japanese individuals indicted for Class B war crimes, 984 were sentenced to death; 475 received life sentences; 2,944 were given more limited prison terms; 1,018 were acquitted; and 279 were never brought to trial or not sentenced. The number of death sentences by country is as follows: the Netherlands 236, Great Britain 223, Australia 153, China 149, United States 140, France 26, and Philippines 17.{{sfn|Dower|1999|p=447}} 

The Soviet Union and Chinese Communist forces also held trials of Japanese war criminals. The [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] held by the Soviets tried and found guilty some members of Japan's bacteriological and chemical warfare unit, also known as [[Unit 731]]. However, those who surrendered to the Americans were never brought to trial. As [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]], MacArthur gave [[immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] to [[Shiro Ishii]] and all members of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on [[Human subject research|human experimentation]]. On May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that "additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as 'War Crimes' evidence."{{sfn|Gold|2003|p=109}} The deal was concluded in 1948.&lt;ref name="Drayton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/10/foreignpolicy.usa |title=An Ethical Blank Check: British and US Mythology About the Second World War Ignores Our Own Crimes and Legitimizes Anglo-American Warmaking |first=Richard |last=Drayton |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 10, 2005 |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Charges of victors' justice===

The United States had provided the funds and staff necessary for running the Tribunal and also held the function of Chief Prosecutor. The argument was made that it was difficult, if not impossible, to uphold the requirement of impartiality with which such an organ should be invested. This apparent conflict gave the impression that the tribunal was no more than a means for the dispensation of victor's justice. Solis Horowitz argues that IMTFE had an American bias: unlike the [[Nuremberg trials]], there was only a single prosecution team, led by an American, although the members of the tribunal represented eleven different Allied countries.{{sfn|Horowitz|1950}} The IMTFE had less official support than the Nuremberg trials. Keenan, a former U.S. assistant attorney general, had a much lower position than Nuremberg's [[Robert H. Jackson]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

Justice Delfin had been captured by the Japanese and walked the [[Bataan Death March]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Radhabinod Pal argued that the exclusion of Western colonialism and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] from the list of crimes and the lack of judges from the vanquished nations on the bench signified the "failure of the Tribunal to provide anything other than the opportunity for the victors to retaliate".&lt;ref name="brook"&gt;"The Tokyo Judgment and the Rape of Nanking", by [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]], ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he was not alone among Indian jurists, with one prominent Calcutta barrister writing that the Tribunal was little more than "a sword in a [judge's] wig."

Justice Röling stated, "[o]f course, in Japan we were all aware of the [[Bombing of Tokyo|bombings and the burnings of Tokyo]] and [[Yokohama]] and [[Air raids on Japan|other big cities]]. It was horrible that we went there for the purpose of vindicating the laws of war, and yet saw every day how the Allies had violated them dreadfully."

However, in respect to Pal and Röling's statement about the conduct of air attacks, there was no [[Positive international law|positive]] or specific [[Customary international law|customary]] [[international humanitarian law]] with respect to [[aerial warfare]] before and during World War II. [[Ben Bruce Blakeney]], an American defense counsel for Japanese defendants, argued that "[i]f the killing of [[Isaac C. Kidd|Admiral Kidd]] by the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] is [[murder]], we know the name of the very man who[se] hands loosed the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]]," even though Pearl Harbor was classified as a war crime under the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]], as it happened without a [[declaration of war]] and without a just cause for [[self-defense]]. Similarly, the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities by Japanese Imperial Forces was never raised in the Tokyo Trials in fear of America being accused the same thing for its air attacks on Japanese cities. As a result, Japanese pilots and officers escaped prosecution for their aerial raids on Pearl Harbor and cities in China and other Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror from the Sky: The Bombing of German Cities in World War II |year=2010 |page=167 |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=1-8454-5844-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pal's dissenting opinion===

[[British Raj|Indian]] [[jurist]] [[Radhabinod Pal]] raised substantive objections in a dissenting opinion: he found the entire prosecution case to be weak regarding the conspiracy to commit an act of aggressive war, which would include the brutalization and subjugation of conquered nations. About the [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanking Massacre]]—while acknowledging the brutality of the incident—he said that there was nothing to show that it was the "product of government policy" or that Japanese government officials were directly responsible. There is "no evidence, testimonial or circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that would in any way lead to the inference that the government in any way permitted the commission of such offenses," he said.&lt;ref name="brook"/&gt; In any case, he added, conspiracy to wage aggressive war was not illegal in 1937, or at any point since.&lt;ref name="brook"/&gt; Pal was the only judge to argue for the acquittal of all of the defendants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Exoneration of the imperial family===

The [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] and other members of The Imperial Family might have been regarded as potential suspects. They included career officer [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu]], [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni|Prince Higashikuni]], and [[Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda|Prince Takeda]].{{sfn|Dower|1999|p= }}{{sfn|Bix|2001|p= }} [[Herbert P. Bix|Herbert Bix]] explained, "The [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman Administration]] and [[General MacArthur]] both believed the occupation reforms would be implemented smoothly if they used Hirohito to legitimise their changes."&lt;ref name="Bix 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.harpercollins.com/author/authorExtra.aspx?authorID=13941&amp;isbn13=9780060931308&amp;displayType=bookinterview |title=Herbert P. Bix on ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''| publisher = HarperCollins |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as November 26, 1945, MacArthur confirmed to Admiral [[Mitsumasa Yonai]] that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary.{{sfn|Dower|1999|pp=323–325}} Before the war crimes trials actually convened, SCAP, the IPS, and court officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the emperor. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals. People arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated in the [[Sugamo Prison]] solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.{{sfn|Dower|1999|pp=323–325}}

According to historian [[Herbert P. Bix|Herbert Bix]], Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]] "immediately on landing in Japan went to work to protect Hirohito from the role he had played during and at the end of the war" and "allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the emperor would be spared from indictment."{{sfn|Bix|2001|p=583}}

Bix also argues that "MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war" and "months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to [[Hideki Tojo|Hideki Tōjō]]."{{sfn|Bix|2001|p=585}} According to a written report by Shūichi Mizota, Admiral [[Mitsumasa Yonai]]'s interpreter, Fellers met the two men at his office on March 6, 1946, and told Yonai, "It would be most convenient if the Japanese side could prove to us that the emperor is completely blameless. I think the forthcoming trials offer the best opportunity to do that. Tōjō, in particular, should be made to bear all responsibility at this trial."&lt;ref&gt;Kumao Toyoda 豊田隈雄, ''Sensô saiban yoroku''『戦争裁判余録』, Taiseisha Kabushiki Kaisha,泰生社 1986, p.170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bix|2001|p=584}}

Historian [[John W. Dower]] wrote that the campaign to absolve Emperor Hirohito of responsibility "knew no bounds." He argued that with MacArthur's full approval, the prosecution effectively acted as "a defense team for the emperor," who was presented as "an almost saintly figure" let alone someone culpable of war crimes.{{sfn|Dower|1999|pp=323–325}} He stated, "Even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Shōwa regime cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the [[Cold War]], release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]]."{{sfn|Dower|1999|p=562}}

Three justices wrote an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' about the criminal responsibility of Hirohito. Judge-in-Chief Webb declared, "No ruler can commit the crime of launching aggressive war and then validly claim to be excused for doing so because his life would otherwise have been in danger ... It will remain that the men who advised the commission of a crime, if it be one, are in no worse position than the man who directs the crime be committed."{{sfn|Röling|Rüter|1977|p=478}}

Justice Henri Bernard of France concluded that Japan's declaration of war "had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present Defendants could only be considered as accomplices."{{sfn|Röling|Rüter|1977|p=496}}

Justice Röling did not find the emperor's immunity objectionable and further argued that five defendants (Kido, Hata, Hirota, Shigemitsu, and Tōgō) should have been acquitted.

===Failure to prosecute for inhumane medical experimentation===

[[Shirō Ishii]], commander of [[Unit 731]] received immunity in exchange for data gathered from his experiments on live prisoners. In 1981 [[John W. Powell]] published an article in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' detailing the experiments of Unit 731 and its open-air tests of germ warfare on civilians. It was printed with a statement by Judge Röling, the last surviving member of the Tokyo Tribunal, who wrote, "As one of the judges in the International Military Tribunal, it is a bitter experience for me to be informed now that centrally ordered Japanese war criminality of the most disgusting kind was kept secret from the Court by the U.S. government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barenblatt|first=Daniel|title=A Plague upon Humanity|publisher= Harper Collins|year= 2004| page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure to prosecute other suspects===

Forty-two suspects, such as [[Nobusuke Kishi]], who later became Prime Minister, and [[Yoshisuke Aikawa]], head of [[Nissan]], were imprisoned in the expectation that they would be prosecuted at a second Tokyo Tribunal but they were never charged. They were released in 1947 and 1948.

==Aftermath==

===Release of the remaining 42 "Class A" suspects===

The International Prosecution Section of the SCAP decided to try the seventy Japanese apprehended for "Class A" war crimes in three groups. The first group of 28 were major leaders in the military, political, and diplomatic sphere. The second group (23 people) and the third group (nineteen people) were industrial and financial magnates who had been engaged in weapons manufacturing industries or were accused of trafficking in narcotics, as well as a number of lesser known leaders in military, political, and diplomatic spheres. The most notable among these were:

* [[Nobusuke Kishi]]: In charge of industry and commerce of Manchukuo, 1936–40; Minister of Industry and Commerce under Tojo administration.
* [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]]: Leader of the pro-[[Zaibatsu]] faction of [[Rikken Seiyukai]].
* [[Yoshisuke Ayukawa]]: Sworn brother of Fusanosuke Kuhara, founder of Japan Industrial Corporation; went to Manchuria after the [[Mukden Incident]] (1931), at the invitation of his relative Nobusuke Kishi, where he founded the Manchurian Heavy Industry Development Company.
* [[Toshizō Nishio]]: Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Commander-in-Chief of China Expeditionary Army, 1939–41; war-time Minister of Education.
*[[Kisaburō Andō]]: Garrison Commander of Port Arthur and Minister of Interior in the Tojo cabinet.
* [[Yoshio Kodama]]: A radical ultranationalist. War profiteer, smuggler and underground crime boss.
*[[Ryōichi Sasakawa]]: Ultranationalist businessman and philanthropist.
* [[Kazuo Aoki]]: Administrator of Manchurian affairs; Minister of Treasury in Nobuyoki Abe's cabinet; followed Abe to China as an advisor; [[Ministry of Greater East Asia|Minister of Greater East Asia]] in the Tojo cabinet.
* [[Masayuki Tani]]: Ambassador to Manchukuo, Minister of Foreign Affairs and concurrently Director of the Intelligence Bureau; Ambassador to the [[Wang Jingwei regime|Reorganized National Government of China]].
* Eiji Amo: Chief of the Intelligence Section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Director of Intelligence Bureau in the Tojo cabinet.
* Yakichiro Suma: Consul General at Nanking; in 1938, he served as counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Washington; after 1941, Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain.

All remaining people apprehended and accused of Class A war crimes who had not yet come to trial were set free by MacArthur in 1947 and 1948.

===San Francisco Peace Treaty===

Under Article 11 of the [[Treaty of San Francisco|San Francisco Peace Treaty]], signed on September 8, 1951, Japan accepted the jurisdiction of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Article 11 of the treaty reads:

{{quote | Japan accepts the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts both within and outside Japan, and will carry out the sentences imposed thereby upon Japanese nationals imprisoned in Japan. The power to grant clemency, reduce sentences and parole with respect to such prisoners may not be exercised except on the decision of the government or governments which imposed the sentence in each instance, and on the recommendation of Japan. In the case of persons sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, such power may not be exercised except on the decision of a majority of the governments represented on the Tribunal, and on the recommendation of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwandocuments.org/sanfrancisco01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221045459/http://www.taiwandocuments.org/sanfrancisco01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 21, 2001 |title=Taiwan Documents Project – Treaty of Peace with Japan |accessdate=April 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Parole for war criminals movement===

In 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and Europe, detained in the countries where they had been convicted. Some executions had not yet been carried out, as Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts. Sentences were reduced in some cases, and a system of parole was instituted, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their sovereignty).

The focus changed from the top wartime leaders to "ordinary" war criminals (Class B and C in Japan), and an intense and broadly-supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued. The issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.

On March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole after fifteen years of those who had received life sentences. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill health.

Many Japanese reacted to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal by demanding parole for the detainees or mitigation of their sentences. Shortly after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the "unfairness of the war crimes tribunals" and the "misery and hardship of the families of war criminals." The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. The government commented that "public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing."

The parole for war criminals movement was driven by two groups: people who had "a sense of pity" for the prisoners demanded, "Just set them free" (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done. The war criminals themselves called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement.

On September 4, 1952, President Truman issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals. Its purpose was to advise the President regarding recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole of Japanese war criminals sentenced by military tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S. Truman – Executive Order 10393 – Establishment of the Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 1954, Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] rejected a proposed amnesty for the imprisoned war criminals but instead agreed to "change the ground rules" by reducing the period required for eligibility for parole from 15 years to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Law and War |first=Peter H. |last=Maguire |page=255  |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12051-7 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1958, all Japanese war criminals were released from prison and politically rehabilitated. [[Hashimoto Kingorô]], [[Shunroku Hata|Hata Shunroku]], [[Minami Jirô]], and [[Oka Takazumi]] were all released on parole in 1954. [[Sadao Araki|Araki Sadao]], [[Hiranuma Kiichirô]], [[Naoki Hoshino|Hoshino Naoki]], [[Okinori Kaya|Kaya Okinori]], [[Kido Kôichi]], [[Ôshima Hiroshi]], [[Shimada Shigetarô]], and [[Suzuki Teiichi]] were released on parole in 1955. [[Satô Kenryô]], whom many—including Judge Röling—regarded as the one least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. With the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the Japanese government announced on April 7, 1957, that the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free.

==Legacy==

In 1978 the ''[[kami]]'' of 1,068 convicted war criminals, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals, were secretly enshrined at [[Yasukuni Shrine]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/08/13/japan.shrine/ |title=Where war criminals are venerated |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |date=January 4, 2003 |work=[[CNN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those enshrined include Hideki Tōjō, Kenji Doihara, Iwane Matsui, Heitarō Kimura, Kōki Hirota, Seishirō Itagaki, Akira Mutō, Yosuke Matsuoka, Osami Nagano, Toshio Shiratori, Kiichirō Hiranuma, Kuniaki Koiso and Yoshijirō Umezu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japanfocus.org/products/topdf/2443|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016212351/http://japanfocus.org/products/topdf/2443|title=Enshrinement Politics: War Dead and War Criminals at Yasukuni Shrine|publisher=JapanFocus |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2012|archivedate=October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, visits made by Japanese government officials to the Shrine have aroused protests in China and South Korea.

[[Arnold Brackman]], who had covered the trials for [[United Press International]], wrote ''The Other Nuremberg: The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial,'' a rebuttal to charges that the trial had been "victors' justice"; this rebuttal was published posthumously in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Arnold C. (1987), ''The Other Nuremberg:  The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial,'' New York:  Morrow.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of 3,000 Japanese people conducted by ''[[Asahi Shimbun|Asahi News]]'' as the 60th anniversary approached in 2006, 70% of those questioned were unaware of the details of the trials, a figure that rose to 90% for those in the 20–29 age group. Some 76% of the people polled recognized a degree of aggression on Japan's part during the war, while only 7% believed it was a war strictly for self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansfieldfdn.org/polls/poll-06-3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108001700/http://www.mansfieldfdn.org/polls/poll-06-3.htm|title=''Asahi Shimbun'' May 2, 2006 "Tokyo Trials Poll"|date=April 2006|publisher=Mansfield Asian Opinion Poll Database |accessdate=May 9, 2012|archivedate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A South Korean government commission cleared 83 of the 148 Koreans convicted by the Allies of war crimes during World War II. The commission ruled that the Koreans, who were categorized as Class B and Class C war criminals, were in fact victims of Japanese imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rjkoehler.com/2006/11/13/korean-war-criminals-cleared/ |title=Korean war criminals cleared |first=Robert |last=Koehler |work=rjkoehler.com |date=November 13, 2006 |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522225940/http://www.rjkoehler.com/2006/11/13/korean-war-criminals-cleared/ |archivedate=May 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential concerns from the Japanese Imperial Family===

Some time before the situation emerged about his expected accession to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] [[Japanese imperial transition, 2019|at the end of April 2019]], some degree of concern was voiced by current [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] on the occasion of his 55th birthday in February 2015 about how Japanese history in regards to its World War II involvement would be remembered by his future subjects; as Naruhito put it at that time: that it was "important to look back on the past humbly and correctly," in reference to Japan's role in World War II-era war crimes and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to, in his own words: "correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-war-ii-should-not-be-forgotten-japans-prince-naruhito-n311561 |title=World War II Should Not Be Forgotten, Japan's Prince Naruhito Says |last=Itasaka |first=Kiko |date=February 24, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''rights in the [[United States|United States of America]]''' vary by [[:Category:LGBT rights in the United States by state|jurisdiction]]. Since June 26, 2003, sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex as well as same-sex [[Romeo and Juliet laws|adolescents of a close age]] has been legal nationwide, pursuant to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''. {{as of|2015|June|26|df=US}}, all states license and recognize [[same-sex marriage in the United States|marriage between same-sex couples]] as a result of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.

However, the United States has no federal law outlawing discrimination nationwide other than from federal executive orders which have a more limited scope than from protections through federal legislation. This leaves residents of some states unprotected against discrimination in [[LGBT employment discrimination in the United States|employment]], [[LGBT housing discrimination in the United States|housing]], and private or public services. Thus, LGBT persons in the United States may face challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents.

The strongest expansions in LGBT rights in the United States have come from the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In four landmark rulings between the years 1996 and 2015, the Supreme Court [[Romer v. Evans|invalidated a state law]] banning protected class recognition based upon homosexuality, [[Lawrence v. Texas|struck down sodomy laws]] nationwide, [[United States v. Windsor|struck down Section 3]] of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], and [[Obergefell v. Hodges|made same-sex marriage legal]] nationwide.

[[LGBT rights]]-related laws regarding family and anti-discrimination still vary by state. The [[age of consent]] in each jurisdiction varies from age 16 to 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/future/landmark_lawrence.html|title=Lawrence v Texas (2003)|last=McBride|first=Alex|publisher=PBS|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some jurisdictions maintaining different ages of consent for males/females or for same-sex/opposite-sex relations.

Twenty-two states plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]] outlaw discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]], and twenty states plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico outlaw discrimination based on [[gender identity]] or expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/4844.htm |title=Employment Non-Discrimination Laws on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity |publisher=Hrc.org |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081024021510/http://www.hrc.org/issues/4844.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] are also punishable by federal law under the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] of 2009. In 2012 the U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] ruled that [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow gender identity-based employment discrimination because it is considered sexual discrimination.&lt;ref name="Edgeboston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgeboston.com/news/national/news//132290/in_landmark_ruling,_feds_add_transgendered_to_anti-discrimination_law |title=In Landmark Ruling, Feds Add Transgendered to Anti-Discrimination Law :: EDGE Boston, MA |publisher=Edgeboston.com |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] concluded that [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow sexual orientation discrimination in employment because it is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Dale |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/16/anti-gay-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-says-the-eeoc/ |title=Anti-gay discrimination is sex discrimination, says the EEOC |publisher=The Washington Post |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatectate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tatectate |first=Curtis |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article27469123.html |title=EEOC: Federal law bans workplace bias against gays, lesbians, bisexuals &amp;#124; Miami Herald Miami Herald |publisher=Miamiherald.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT adoption in the United States|Adoption of children by same-sex married couples]] is legal nationwide since June 2015 following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Obergefell v.

Civil rights for LGBT people in the United States are advocated by a variety of organizations at all levels and concentrations of political and legal life, including the [[Human Rights Campaign]],&lt;ref name=wwd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/about_us/what_we_do.asp |title=What We Do |publisher=Human Rights Campaign |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731083704/http://www.hrc.org/about_us/what_we_do.asp |archivedate=July 31, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lambda Legal]], [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]] (GLAD), [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transequality.org/|title=National Center for Transgender Equality|website=National Center for Transgender Equality}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]].

====Medical facilities====
On April 14, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] to the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] to draft new rules for all hospitals accepting [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] funds. They would require facilities to grant visitation and medical decision-making rights to gay and lesbian partners, as well as designees of others such as widows and widowers.&lt;ref name="nytimesobama"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/us/politics/16webhosp.html|date=April 16, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2011|title=Obama Widens Medical Rights for Gay Partners|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rights are not protected by law in many states. Obama said he was inspired by the case of a Florida family, where one of the mothers died while her partner and four children were denied visitation by the hospital.&lt;ref name="nytimesobama" /&gt;

====Housing====

[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.

{{Main|Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity}}

The '''Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity''' ('''FHEO''') is an agency within the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. FHEO is responsible for administering and enforcing federal fair housing laws and establishing policies that make sure all Americans have equal access to the housing of their choice. [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Housing discrimination]] refers to discrimination against potential or current tenants by landlords. In the United States, there is no federal law against such discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, but at least twenty-two states and many major cities have enacted laws prohibiting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.findlaw.com/civil-rights/housing-discrimination/tenant-fair-housing-orientation.html |title=Renter's Rights Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination – Findlaw for the Public |publisher=Public.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; See, for example, [[Washington House Bill 2661]].

In 2012, The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] issued a regulation to prohibit LGBT discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is responsible for enforcing a variety of fair housing laws, which prohibit discrimination in both privately owned and publicly assisted housing including:
*The [[Fair Housing Act]]
*Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]
*Section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]
*Section 109 of Title 1 of the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]]
*Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]
*[[Architectural Barriers Act of 1968]]
*[[Age Discrimination Act of 1975]]
*[[Title IX|Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972]]

====Employment====

{{legend|#00ffff|'''Sexual orientation''' discrimination prohibited in public employment only}}
{{legend|#cccccc|No state-level protections based on '''sexual orientation''' and/or '''gender identity'''}}]]
{{Main|LGBT employment discrimination in the United States}}
There is no federal statute addressing employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Protections at the national level are limited. Some regulations protect government employees but do not extend their protections to the private sector. Twenty-two states, the [[Washington, DC|District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], and over 140 cities and counties have enacted bans on discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or sexual identity. [[Employment discrimination]] refers to discriminatory employment practices such as bias in hiring, promotion, job assignment, termination, and compensation, and various types of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Sociology|jstor=10.1086/661653|title=Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States|volume= 117|issue=2|pages=586–626|author=András Tilcsik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Employment discrimination law in the United States|In the United States]] there is "very little statutory, [[common law]], and case law establishing employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation as a legal wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Orientation and the Law § 5:17&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidents have established certain protections for some employees of the federal government by [[executive order]]. In 1995, President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Executive Order 12968]] establishing criteria for the issuance of security clearances included sexual orientation for the first time in its non-discrimination language: "The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information." It also said that "no inference" about suitability for access to classified information "may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|title=Clinton Ends Ban on Security Clearance for Gay Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/05/us/clinton-ends-ban-on-security-clearance-for-gay-workers.html|accessdate=August 4, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton's [[Executive Order 13087]] in 1998 prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce. It applied to the large majority of federal employees, but not to the [[excepted service]]s such as the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinton6.nara.gov/1998/05/1998-05-28-statement-on-amendment-to-eeo-executive-order.html |title=1998-05-28 Statement on Amendment to EEO Executive Order |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=May 5, 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820143222/http://clinton6.nara.gov/1998/05/1998-05-28-statement-on-amendment-to-eeo-executive-order.html |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of 2010, the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration included gender identity among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC). In 2012 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] ruled that [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow gender identity-based employment discrimination because it is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Edgeboston.com"/&gt; In 2015, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] concluded that [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow sexual orientation discrimination in employment because it is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatectate"/&gt;

On July 21, 2014, President Obama signed [[Executive Order 13672]], adding "gender identity" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring in the federal civilian workforce and both "sexual orientation" and gender identity" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring and employment on the part of federal government contractors and sub-contractors.&lt;ref name="The White House"&gt;{{cite news|title=Executive Order – Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/executive-order-further-amendments-executive-order-11478-equal-employmen|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=The White House|agency=Office of the Press Secretary|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama signs edict banning discrimination against federal LGBT employees|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/21/obama-signs-enda.html|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Al Jazeera|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hate crime laws====
{{Main|Hate crime laws in the United States}}
Hate crime laws (also known as ''bias crimes laws'') protect against crimes motivated by feelings of enmity against a protected class. Until 2009, a [[Hate crime laws in the United States#1969 law|1969 federal law]] defined hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, color, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity. In October 2009, Congress passed the [[Matthew Shepard Act]], which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, gender-identity, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|date=|title=Resisting Hate Crime Discourse: Queer and Intersectional Challenges to Neoliberal Hate Crime Laws|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10612-013-9228-x|journal=Critical Criminology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It removed the requirement that the victim of a hate crime be engaged in a federally protected activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/10/senate_approves_hate_crimes_me.html | title=Hate crimes bill set to become law | work=Washington Post | date=October 22, 2009 | accessdate=October 22, 2009 | last=Pershing | first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama signed the legislation on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baywindows.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=98285 |title=President Barack Obama signs hate crimes legislation into law |publisher=Baywindows.com |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110722003600/http://www.baywindows.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=98285 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two statutes, the [[Hate crimes in the United States#Hate Crime Statistics Act (1990)|Hate Crime Statistics Act]] (1990) and the [[Hate crime laws in the United States#Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997|Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act]] (1997), require the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], as well as college/university campus security authorities, to collect and publish hate crime statistics.

Frequently, the media, and politicians (and as a result, society) sensationalize transgender identities and oppression is reinforced. Aware of this trend, in 2016, a coalition of over 250 anti-sexual assault and domestic violence organizations have released a joint letter decrying the trend of portraying transgender people in restrooms as sexual predators as untrue and harmful.

Many transgender advocates also advocate for converting single-occupant, gender-segregated restrooms into single-occupant, all-gender restrooms by simply changing the signs due to the high rates of harassment and even violence faced by the transgender community when accessing gender-segregated restrooms according to their gender expression. All-Gender/Gender-Neutral restrooms are also beneficial to nursing mothers, parents with different-sex children, and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-86390263/|title=Chicago Tribune|website=my.chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transgender advocates affirm all-gender restrooms as well as access to gendered restrooms as a matter of choice, safety, privacy, and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/4/01/bathroom-bills-selfies-and-erasure-nonbinary-trans-people|title=Bathroom Bills, Selfies, and the Erasure of Nonbinary Trans People|date=April 1, 2016|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement to obtain [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|civil marriage rights]] and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s but remained unsuccessful for over forty years. On May 17, 2004, [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]]'s decision six months earlier.&lt;ref name="festive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Belluck|first=Oam|title=With Festive Mood, Gay Weddings Begin in Massachusetts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/national/17CND-GAYS.html |accessdate=January 11, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before nationwide legalization, same-sex marriage became legal in 36 states; 24 states by court order, 9 by legislative action, and 3 by [[referendum]]. Some states had legalized same-sex marriage by more than one of the three actions.

On June 26, 2015 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that states must license and recognize same-sex marriages. Consequently, same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Officials in [[LGBT rights in American Samoa|American Samoa]] are discussing whether the ruling applies to the territory; currently same-sex marriages are neither licensed nor recognized there.

Fourteen state and the [[District of Columbia]] legislators have passed same-sex marriage bills in their states, of which four were vetoed by the governors with Vermont overriding its governor's veto. In total ten states legalized same-sex marriage through legislation without judicial order.

The events of the [[Hawaii Supreme Court]] prompted the United States Congress to enact the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, which forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and relieved states of the requirement that they recognize same-sex unions performed in other jurisdictions.

There was a backlash after Massachusetts legalized same sex marriage during the 2004 election cycle where fourteen states amended their constitution to ban recognition of same-sex marriages and many banning civil unions as well.

In all twenty-eight states passed state constitutional amendments that banned same-sex marriage to be legalized by judicial or legislative action:
[[Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment|Alabama]], [[Alaska Ballot Measure 2 (1998)|Alaska]], [[Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)|Arizona]], [[California Proposition 8|California]], [[Colorado Amendment 43 (2006)|Colorado]], [[Florida Amendment 2|Florida]], [[Georgia Constitutional Amendment 1 (2004)|Georgia]], [[Idaho Amendment 2 (2006)|Idaho]], [[Kansas proposed amendment 1 (2005)|Kansas]], [[Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 1 (2004)|Kentucky]], [[Louisiana Constitutional Amendment 1 (2004)|Louisiana]], [[Michigan State Proposal – 04-2 (2004)|Michigan]], [[Mississippi Amendment 1 (2004)|Mississippi]], [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2004)|Missouri]], [[Montana Initiative 96 (2004)|Montana]], [[Nebraska Initiative Measure 416 (2000)|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Question 2 (2002)|Nevada]], [[North Carolina Amendment 1|North Carolina]], [[North Dakota Constitutional Measure 1 (2004)|North Dakota]], [[Ohio State Issue 1 (2004)|Ohio]], [[Oklahoma State Question 711 (2004)|Oklahoma]], [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)|Oregon]], [[South Carolina Amendment 1 (2006)|South Carolina]], [[South Dakota Amendment C (2006)|South Dakota]], [[Tennessee Amendment 1 (2006)|Tennessee]], [[Texas proposition 2 (2005)|Texas]], [[Utah Constitutional Amendment 3|Utah]], [[Marshall-Newman Amendment|Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin Referendum 1 (2006)|Wisconsin]].

Hawaii voters approved a narrower [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|constitutional amendment]] empowering the legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage, which they had already done in 1993.

On November 6, 2012, [[Minnesota]] became the first state to vote down a [[Minnesota Amendment 1|proposed constitutional amendment]] banning same-sex marriage. The amendment failed with a 53% to 47% vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/249158/ |title=Minnesota voters reject marriage amendment |publisher=Duluth News Tribune |date=November 7, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |author=Davis, Don |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108163511/http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/249158/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All state constitutional bans have been declared unconstitutional in June 2015 in ''Obergefell''.

;State statutes
{{Main|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States#Efforts to prohibit same-sex unions}}
After the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 many state legislators enacted state statutes, nicknamed mini-DOMA's, that ban same sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857 |title=8 States with Legal Gay Marriage and 39 States with Same-Sex Marriage Bans - Gay Marriage - ProCon.org |publisher=Gaymarriage.procon.org |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1972 with Maryland, all states but New Mexico passed a statute banning same-sex marriage prior to nationwide legalization in ''Obergefell'' in June 2015.

===State adoption laws===

Same-sex couples are allowed to adopt in states and territories following the ruling in ''Obergefell'' legalizing same-sex marriage. Prior to ''Obergefell'', various states by legislative and judicial action had allowed joint adoption by same-sex couples.

===Public opinion===

A March 2014 public opinion poll by ''Washington Post''/ABC News showed support for same-sex marriage at 59% among Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craighill|first=Peyton|title=Support for same-sex marriage hits new high; half say Constitution guarantees right|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/support-for-same-sex-marriage-hits-new-high-half-say-constitution-guarantees-right/2014/03/04/f737e87e-a3e5-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 7, 2014|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a February 2014 ''New York Times''/CBS News opinion poll showed 56% support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Views on Voting and the Political Parties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/26/us/political-parties-poll.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 7, 2014|date=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2012 Gallup poll indicated 61% support for gays and lesbians being allowed to adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/159272/americans-favor-rights-gays-lesbians-inherit-adopt.aspx|title=Americans Favor Rights for Gays, Lesbians to Inherit, Adopt|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support====
The main supporters of LGBT rights in the U.S. have generally been political [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[libertarianism|libertarians]]. Regionally, support for the LGBT rights movement has been strongest in the areas of the [[Northeastern United States|North]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West coast]], and in other states with large urban populations. The national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has held the official platform support most initiatives since 2012 for LGBT rights. However, there are some [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party include the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], [[GOProud]], Young Conservatives for the Freedom To Marry, and [[College Republicans]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University]]. A poll in March 2014 found that 40% of Republicans support same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craighill, Peyton M. |first=Clement, Scott|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/support-for-same-sex-marriage-hits-new-high-half-say-constitution-guarantees-right/2014/03/04/f737e87e-a3e5-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html |title=Support for same-sex marriage hits new high; half say Constitution guarantees right |accessdate=March 6, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 52% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents between the age of 18–49 years old supported same-sex marriage in a joint ''Washington Post''-ABC News poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage support hits new high in Post-ABC poll |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/gay-marriage-support-hits-new-high-in-post-abc-poll/ |publisher=The Washington Post |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 Pew Forum Poll showed that American Muslims are more likely than Evangelicals to support same-sex marriage 42% to 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/chapter-4-social-and-political-attitudes/|title=Chapter 4: Social and Political Attitudes|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=''Pew Forum''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====
The main opponents of LGBT rights in the U.S. have generally been political and religious [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]. Conservatives cite various Bible passages from the Old and New Testaments as their justification for opposing LGBT rights. Regionally, [[LGBT rights opposition]] has been strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]] and in other states with a large rural and conservative population.

As the movement for same-sex marriage has developed, many national and/or international organizations have opposed that movement. Those organizations include the [[American Family Association]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[Save Our Children]], [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality|NARTH]], the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gop.com/images/2004platform.pdf|format=PDF|title=Republican Party 2004 Platform|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119011635/http://www.gop.com/images/2004platform.pdf|archivedate=January 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[homosexuality and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/public-issues/same-gender-attraction |accessdate=April 8, 2008|title=LDS Newsroom – Same-Gender Attraction |date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Baptist Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimamerica.org/PAGES/NEWS/news.aspx?story=1264 |title=SBC Officially Opposes "Homosexual Marriage|publisher=The Southern Baptist Convention|date=July 26, 2003|accessdate=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alliance for Marriage]], [[Alliance Defense Fund]], [[Liberty Counsel]], and the [[National Organization for Marriage]].

==United States Supreme Court decisions==

In March 1956, a Federal District Court ruled that ''ONE: The Homosexual Magazine'', was obscene under the Federal [[Comstock laws]] and thus could not be sent through the United States Postal Service. This ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but in 1958, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a landmark ruling in ''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', 355 U.S. 371, which overturned the previous rulings under a new legal precedent that had been established by the landmark case, ''[[Roth v. United States]]'', 354 U.S. 476 (1957). As a result, gay newspapers, magazines and other publications could be lawfully distributed through the public mail service.
On May 22, 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], which among other things banned homosexuals, as constitutional. This ban remained in effect until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chang-Muy |first1=Fernando |title=Social Work with Immigrants and Refugees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLkG9HR2yFsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=August 12, 2011|year=2009|publisher=Springer Publishing Company, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, a [[Tacoma, Washington]] teacher of twelve years with a perfect record was terminated after a former student [[outing|outed]] him to the vice-principal. The [[Washington Supreme Court]] found that homosexuality was immoral and impaired his efficiency as a teacher. The court supported its conclusion in various ways, including the definition of homosexuality in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the criminal nature of homosexual conduct, and finding that an "immoral" person could not be trusted to instruct students as his presence would be inherently disruptive. On October 3, 1977, the United States Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]], although Justices Brennan and Marshall would have granted cert. This was the first homosexual discrimination decision to be aired on national network news. In fact, it was simultaneously aired on all three national network evening news shows, reaching approximately 60 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2006/network-tv-intro/audience/ |title=Network Audience |publisher=State of the Media |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920121116/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2006/network-tv-intro/audience/ |archive-date=September 20, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=491117 |title=Supreme Court / Homosexuality and Women's Pensions Cases / Bakke / Protests NBC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=October 3, 1977 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=249215 |title=Supreme Court / Homosexuality Case / Nixon Tapes / Other Cases To Come CBS News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=October 3, 1977 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=46346 |title=Supreme Court / Washington Homosexual Firing / Bakke / Other Cases ABC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=October 3, 1977 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/www/orgs/glstn/teachers.legal.rights |title=Overview of the Rights of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Teachers |publisher= |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Supreme Court heard ''[[National Gay Task Force v. Board of Education|Board of Education v. National Gay Task Force]]'', which concerned First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges against a law that allowed schools to fire teachers for public homosexual conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19850115&amp;id=_xE9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fS4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4067,5624349 Supreme Court Hears Debate on Law Banning Gay Teachers] Aaron Epstein, Bangor Daily News, January 15, 1985 Accessed via Google News Archive Search July 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Court affirmed the lower court by an equally divided vote 4–4 allowing the Tenth Circuit's ruling that partially struck down the law to stand without setting precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Board of Education v.

On June 30, 1986, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', that same-sex intimate conduct was not protected under the [[right to privacy]] established under the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

On May 20, 1996, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' against an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that would have prevented any city, town or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to protect homosexual or bisexual citizens from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation.

On March 4, 1998, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' that federal laws banning on-the-job [[sexual harassment]] also applied when both parties are the same sex. The lower courts, however, have reached differing conclusions about whether this ruling applies to harassment motivated by anti-gay animus.

On June 28, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''[[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]]'' that the [[Boy Scouts of America]] had a First Amendment right to exclude people from its organization on the basis of [[sexual orientation]], irrespective of any applicable civil rights laws.

Prior to the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]],'' same-sex sexual activity was illegal in fourteen US states, Puerto Rico, and the US military.

===Rulings supporting marriage for same-sex couples===

Ten years after the ''Lawrence'' decision, the Supreme Court ruled on June 26, 2013 by a 5–4 vote in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' that section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], that forbade the federal government from recognizing lawfully performed same-sex marriages, was found to violate the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage cannot be prohibited by a state. Consequently, same-sex marriages are licensed and recognized as valid and enforced in all states and areas subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Constitution.

===George Washington===

====Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army====
To train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General [[George Washington]] brought in [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality. He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about sexual behavior at his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben, and he received a Congressional pension after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History ; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA1007|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

The first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] was brought to trial before a court-martial. According to General Washington's report: "...Lieutt. Enslin of [[colonel|Colo]]. [[Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment|Malcolm's Regiment]] tried for attempting to commit ''sodomy'' ..."  Washington's secretary described the results of the trial:  "His [[Excellency]] the [[Commander in Chief]] approves the sentence and with Abhorrence &amp; Detestation of such Infamous Crimes orders Lieut.

In 1801, Congress enacted the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] that continued all criminal laws of Maryland and Virginia in the now formally structured District, with those of Maryland applying to that portion of the District ceded from Maryland, and those of Virginia applying to that portion ceded from Virginia. At the time, Maryland had a sodomy law applicable only to free males with a punishment of "labour for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding seven years for the same crime, on the public roads of the said county, or in making, repairing or cleaning the streets or bason [sic] of Baltimore-town;" it imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. Similarly, Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for free persons committing sodomy, but imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. The law went into effect on February 27, 1801.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/districtofcolumbia.htm |title=District of Columbia |publisher=Glapn.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Jefferson===

====Governor of Virginia====
In 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote a law in Virginia which contained a maximum punishment of [[castration]] for men who engaged in sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs10.html |title=Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, what was intended by Jefferson as a liberalization of the sodomy laws in Virginia at that time was rejected by the Virginia Legislature, which continued to prescribe death as the maximum penalty for the crime of sodomy in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patricia S.

===Andrew Jackson===
In 1831, Congress established penalties in the District of Columbia for a number of crimes, but not for sodomy. It specified that "every other felony, misdemeanor, or offence not provided for by this act, may and shall be punished as heretofore[.]" At the time, Maryland and Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for committing sodomy. It went into effect in March 2, 1831.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

===William Henry Harrison===
====Governor of the Indiana Territory====
In 1807, [[William Henry Harrison]] signed into law a comprehensive criminal code that included the first sodomy law for the [[Indiana Territory]] that eliminated the gender-specifics, reduced the penalty for a maximum of 1 to 5 years in prison, a fine of $100 to $500, up to 500 lashes on the back, and a permanent loss of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/indiana.htm|title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States – Indiana|website=Glapn.org|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Harrison===
In 1892, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that states that "for the preservation of the public peace and the protection of property within the District of Columbia." Labeled in the law as vagrants were "all public prostitutes, and all such persons who lead a notoriously lewd or lascivious course of life[.]" All offenders had to post bond of up to $200 for good behavior for a period of six months. The law went into effect on July 29, 1892.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

==Early 20th century presidents==
===William McKinley===
In 1898, Congress deleted the word "notoriously" from the provision concerning a lewd or lascivious course of life, thereby allowing prosecution of persons without the condition of notoriety. The bond for good behavior was raised to $500, and the law was made gender-neutral. The law went into effect on July 8, 1898.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1901, Congress adopted a new code for the District of Columbia that expressly recognized common-law crimes, with a penalty for them of up to five years and/or a $1,000 fine. The law went into effect on March 3, 1901.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

===Woodrow Wilson===
On December 14, 1916, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] vetoed the [[Immigration Act of 1917]], which would have excluded individuals from entering the United States who were found "mentally defective" or who had a "constitutional psychopathic inferiority." A similar Public Health Service definition of homosexuals was used simultaneously by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to reinforce the language of the Immigration Act of 1917 and effectively ban all homosexual immigrants who disclosed their sexual minority status. On February 5, 1917, the Congress overrode Wilson's veto, implementing the Immigration Act of 1917 into law.&lt;ref name="Sexual Orientation and Asylum in the United States"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v6i3/immigration.htm |title=Opening the Doors of Immigration: Sexual Orientation and Asylum in the United States |publisher=Wcl.american.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020822211541/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v6i3/immigration.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1917, the [[Articles of War]] of 1916 are implemented. This included a revision of the Articles of War of 1806, the new regulations detail statutes governing U.S. military discipline and justice. Under the category Miscellaneous Crimes and Offences, Article 93 states that any person subject to military law who commits "assault with intent to commit sodomy" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref name="usni"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline |title=Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military |publisher=usni.org |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1920, Congress modified Article 93 of the Articles of War of 1916. It was changed to make the act of sodomy itself a crime, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy.&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt; It went into effect on February 4, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004163647/http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html |archivedate=October 4, 2008 |title=The Articles of War |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franklin Roosevelt===

====Assistant Secretary of the Navy====
In 1919, Democratic Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] requests an investigation into "vice and depravity" in the sea services after a sting operation in which undercover operatives attempt to seduce sailors suspected of being homosexual had already begun at the Naval base in Newport, Rhode Island. At least 17 sailors are jailed and court-martialed before public outcry prompts a Republican-led Senate committee to condemn the methods of the operation. Roosevelt denied he had any knowledge that entrapment had been used or that he would have approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence R. Murphy, "Perverts by Official Order: The Campaign Against Homosexuals by the United States Navy," Lawrence R. Murphy, Haworth Press, 1988,  {{ISBN|0866567089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidency====
In 1935, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that made it a crime for "any person to invite, entice, persuade, or to address for the purpose of inviting, enticing, or persuading any person or persons...to accompany, to go with, to follow him or her to his or her residence, or to any other house or building, inclosure, or other place, for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose." It imposed a fine of up to $100, up to 90 days in jail, and courts were permitted to "impose conditions" on anyone convicted under this law, including "medical and mental examination, diagnosis and treatment by proper public health and welfare authorities, and such other terms and conditions as the court may deem best for the protection of the community and the punishment, control, and rehabilitation of the defendant." The law went into effect on August 14, 1935.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1941, Congress enacted a new solicitation law for the District of Columbia that labeled a "vagrant" any person who "engages in or commits acts of fornication or perversion for hire." The law went into effect on December 17, 1941.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

===Harry Truman===
In 1948, Congress enacted the first sodomy law in the District of Columbia, which established a penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,000 for sodomy. Also included with this sodomy law was a psychopathic offender law and a law "to provide for the treatment of sexual psychopaths in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes." The law went into effect on June 9, 1948.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

On May 5, 1950, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as "any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence."&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt;

On June 25, 1952, the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] was vetoed by President Truman because he regarded the bill as "un-American" and discriminatory. The bill prohibits "aliens afflicted with a psychopathic personality, epilepsy, or a mental defect" from entry into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jacobson |first1=David |title=Rights Across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship |date=September 5, 1997 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press  |isbn=978-0801857706 |pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tichenor |first1=David J. |title=Dividing Lines: The Politics of Immigration Control in America |series=Princeton Studies in American Politics |date=May 6, 2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press  |isbn=978-0691088051 |page=195 |quote=quotes part of this passage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14175 |title=Harry S.

===Dwight D. Eisenhower===

On April 27, 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed [[Executive Order 10450]] which prohibits Federal employees from being members of a group or organization considered subversive. The order lists "sexual perversion" as a security risk constituting grounds for termination or denial of employment. The order went into effect on May 27, 1953.&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt;

Without explicitly referring to homosexuality, the executive order responded to several years of charges that the presence of homosexual employees in the State Department posed blackmail risks. Attorney General [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]] explained that the new order was designed to encompass both loyalty and security risks and he differentiated between the two: "Employees could be a security risk and still not be disloyal or have any traitorous thoughts, but it may be that their personal habits are such that they might be subject to blackmail by people who seek to destroy the safety of our country."&lt;ref name=lavender&gt;David K. Johnson, ''The Lavender Scare: the Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), 123–4. Eisenhower in his memoirs written years later explicitly referenced "instability, alcoholism, homosexuality."&lt;/ref&gt;

The press recognized the revolutionary nature of the new executive order. The ''Washington Post'' said that it established not a loyalty test but a "suitability test." Some in government referred to their new "integrity-security" program. Some of those the press expected to be excluded from federal employment included "a person who drinks too much," "an incorrigible gossip," "homosexuals," and "neurotics."&lt;ref name=lavender /&gt;

In 1953, Congress changed the solicitation law in the District of Columbia so that the jail term of up to 90 days was retained, but the maximum fine was raised to $250, and the reference to the power of judges to "impose conditions" on the defendant was removed. The law went into effect on June 29, 1953.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

===Lyndon B. Johnson===

====Senator of Texas====
On February 2, 1950, Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] voted for [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/81-1950/s243 |title=HR 4080.

====Presidency====
On October 19, 1964, [[Walter Jenkins]], a longtime top aide to President Johnson, had been arrested by [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia Police]] in a [[YMCA]] restroom. He and another man were booked on a disorderly conduct charge.&lt;ref&gt;White, 367; ''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876303,00.html "The Jenkins Report," October 30, 1964], accessed November 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a controversy prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], the American Mental Health Foundation wrote a letter to President Johnson protesting the "hysteria" surrounding the case:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/22/archives/jemins-defended-by-mental-group.html "Jenkins Defended by Mental Group," October 22, 1964], accessed November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

:The private life and inclinations of a citizen, Government employee or not, does not necessarily have any bearing on his capacities, usefulness, and sense of responsibility in his occupation. The fact that an individual is homosexual, as has been strongly implied in the case of Mr. Jenkins, does not per se make him more unstable and more a security risk than any heterosexual person.

After reelection during his second term on October 3, 1965, Johnson signed the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], which added "sexual deviation" as a medical ground for denying prospective immigrants entry into the United States. The bill went into effect on June 30, 1968.&lt;ref name="Sexual Orientation and Asylum in the United States" /&gt;

==Presidents after Stonewall==

===Richard Nixon===

====Presidency====
In August 1970, [[Richard Nixon]], on the issue of same-sex marriage, said "I can't go that far; that's the year 2000! Negroes [and whites], okay. But that's too far!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witness to Power: The Nixon Years |last=Ehrlichman |first=John |date=January 1, 1982 |page=239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1971, in a conversation with [[John D. Ehrlichman]] and [[H. R. Haldeman]], Nixon went on to discuss negative perception of homosexuality. He made the assertion that it led to the fall of [[Ancient Greece]], referring to the promotion of same-sex relations in Ancient Greece. He also related homosexuality with areas of San Francisco known for a large gay male population, saying he would not shake hands with persons there.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1972, San Francisco's Gay Activists Alliance disbanded and formed the Gay Voter's League, a group that campaigned for the reelection of President Richard Nixon.&lt;ref name="Republican Party (United States) gay rights" /&gt; In October 1972, representative of the Committee to Re-elect the President addressed gay voters on behalf of Richard M.

===Gerald Ford===

====House Minority Leader and Representative of Michigan's 5th congressional district====

On August 25, 1965, Rep. [[Gerald Ford]] voted for the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h125 |title=TO PASS H.R. 2580, THE AMENDED IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT |publisher=Govtrack.us |date=August 25, 1965 |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidency====
On March 5, 1976, when asked about the issue of gay rights, with respect to hiring, employment, and housing, [[Gerald Ford]] said "I recognize that this is a very new and serious problem in our society. I have always tried to be an understanding person as far as people are concerned who are different than myself. That doesn't mean that I agree with or would concur in what is done by them or their position in society. I think this is a problem we have to face up to, and I can't give you a pat answer tonight. I just would be dishonest to say that there is a pat answer under these very difficult circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Gerald_Ford_Civil_Rights.htm |title=Gerald Ford on Civil Rights |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, during that year's presidential campaign, President Gerald Ford was "zapped" by activists in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] over federal immigration rules. The protests forced President Ford to admit that he was not aware that homosexuality was used as a basis for exclusion in immigration rulings.&lt;ref name="Republican Party (United States) gay rights" /&gt;

====Post presidency====
[[Gerald Ford]], as former president, formally opposed the [[Briggs Initiative]] in 1977, which sought to ban homosexuals from teaching in public school. In October 2001, he broke with conservative members of the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to be treated equally. Period." He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Deb. [http://pageoneq.com/news/2006/ford122806.html "Gerald Ford: Treat gay couples equally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120021813/http://pageoneq.com/news/2006/ford122806.html |date=January 20, 2013 }}.

===Jimmy Carter===

====Post governorship of Georgia====
In February 1976, Carter said he opposed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but in June 1976 he withdrew his support of a gay rights plank in the Democratic Party platform.&lt;ref name="gay rights 2002" /&gt;

====Presidency====
In 1977, under the guidance of Jimmy Carter, a policy was removed which barred employment of gays from employment in the [[foreign service]] and [[Internal Revenue Service]] ended its policy that forced LGBT education and charity groups to publicly state that homosexuality is a "sickness, disturbance, or diseased pathology."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} That same year, fourteen gay and lesbian activists were invited to the White House for the first official visit ever. Jimmy Carter publicly opposed the [[Briggs Initiative]]. However, in March 1980, Carter issued a formal statement indicating he would not issue an executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in the US federal government and that he would not support including a gay rights plank in the Democratic Party platform.&lt;ref name="gay rights 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gay and Lesbian Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook |last=Haider-Markel |first=Donald P. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the US Military]] |last=Shilts |first=Randy |authorlink=Randy Shilts |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1980, the [[United States Department of Justice]] announced that immigration officials would no longer be allowed to ask whether an individual entering the United States was gay and therefore ineligible for admission.&lt;ref name= nunes&gt;Nunes, Donnel.

===Ronald Reagan===

====Post governorship of California====
The first chapter of what would become the national [[Log Cabin Republicans]] (LCR) formed in 1978 to fight California's [[Briggs Initiative]], a ballot initiative that would have banned homosexuals from teaching in public schools. The chapter worked diligently and successfully convinced Governor Reagan to publicly oppose the measure.&lt;ref name="Republican Party (United States) gay rights" /&gt; Reagan penned an op-ed against the Briggs Initiative in which he wrote, "Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child's teachers do not really influence this."&lt;ref name="gay lovers wh" /&gt;

====Presidency====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#LGBT Rights}}

On the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 campaign trail]], he spoke of the gay civil rights movement:

{{quote|My criticism is that [the gay movement] isn't just asking for civil rights; it's asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can I.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shilts|Shilts 2005]]: 368&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No civil rights legislation for LGBT individuals passed during Reagan's tenure. Additionally, Reagan has been criticized by some LGBT groups for allegedly ignoring (by failing to adequately address or fund) the growing [[AIDS epidemic]], even as it took thousands of lives in the 1980s. Reagan's Surgeon General from 1982 to 1989, Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]], claims that his attempts to address the issue were shut out by the Reagan Administration. According to Koop, the prevailing view of the Reagan Administration was that "transmission of AIDS was understood to be primarily in the homosexual population and in those who abused intravenous drugs" and therefore that people dying from AIDS were "only getting what they justly deserve."&lt;ref&gt;White, Allen (June 8, 2004).

On August 18, 1984, President Reagan issued a statement on the issue of same-sex marriage that read:

{{quote|Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of the bond between a man and a woman. It is the means by which families are created and society itself is extended into the future. In the Judeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband and wife participate with God in the creation of a new human life. It is for these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to protect this unique relationship. In part the erosion of these values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most reject. We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government endorsement of homosexuality.}}

Mr. Reagan made the comment in response to a questionnaire from the conservative publishers of the Presidential Biblical Scoreboard, a magazine-type compilation of past statements and voting records of national candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CAMPAIGN NOTES; Reagan Would Not Ease Stand on Homosexuals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/18/us/campaign-notes-reagan-would-not-ease-stand-on-homosexuals.html|accessdate=August 16, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 18, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidency====
[[Bill Clinton]]'s legacy on gay rights is a matter of controversy. LGBT rights activist [[Richard Socarides]] credits Clinton as the first President to publicly champion gay rights,&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt; but Clinton's signing of DOMA and DADT have led critics like [[Andrew Sullivan]] to argue Clinton was a detriment to rather than an ally for the LGBT rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew (March 29, 2013). [http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/03/29/dissent-of-the-day-46/ "Dissents of the Day."] ''The Dish''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]", which allowed [[homosexuality|gay men and women]] to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret, and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Feder | first1 = Jody | title = "Don't Ask, Don't Tell": A Legal Analysis | publisher = DIANE Publishing | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4379-2208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met with staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA). According to [[David Mixner]], Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that "the President should lift the ban ... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Stranger_Among_Friends.html?id=0Jeg2X025UgC |title=see pages 495–497 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= November 25, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2013|isbn=9780307429582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stranger Among Friends. – book reviews |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 |newspaper=[[Washington Monthly]] |author=John Cloud |date=November 1996 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826114431/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826/ |archivedate=August 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President [[Harry Truman]] used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name="The Natural"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Klein |first=Joe |title=The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton |publisher=Doubleday |year=2002 |isbn=0-7679-1412-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not "out of whack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html|title=President seeks better implementation of 'don't ask, don't tell'|date=December 11, 1999 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/content-detail.html |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |title=PUBLIC LAW 104 – 199 – DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA "was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election." In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a "very reactionary Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/ |work=New York |author=Frank Rich |title=Bill Clinton's shifting justifications for signing the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration spokesman [[Richard Socarides]] said, "...&amp;nbsp;the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected."&lt;ref name=metroweekly&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6613 |work=MetroWeekly |author=Chris Geidner |title=Becoming Law |date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist [[Evan Wolfson]] has called these claims "historic revisionism".&lt;ref name=metroweekly/&gt; In a July 2, 2011 editorial ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/opinion/sunday/03sun1.html |work=The New York Times |title=Unfinished Business: The Defense of Marriage Act |date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 Texas Gubernatorial election political awareness test, he answered no to the questions of whether Texas government should include sexual orientation in Texas' anti-discrimination laws and whether he supports Texas recognizing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/22369/george-bush/ |title=Texas Gubernatorial Election 1998 National Political Awareness Test |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which would have increased punishment for criminals motivated by hatred of a victim's gender, religion, ethnic background or sexual orientation, was killed in committee by Texas Senate Republicans. Governor Bush was criticized for letting the hate crimes bill die in a Texas Senate committee. Bush spokesman Sullivan said the governor never took a position on the bill. According to Louvon Harris, sister of James Byrd, said that Bush's opposition to the bill reportedly revolved around the fact that it would cover gays and lesbians. The governor's office "contacted the family and asked if we would consider taking sexual orientation out of the bill, and our answer was no, because the bill is for everybody. Everybody should be protected by the law." said Harris. In a 2000 presidential debate, [[Al Gore]] would attack Bush for allowing the bill to die in committee, with Bush responding Texas already had a hate crimes statute, and nothing more was needed.&lt;ref name="Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act" /&gt; George W.

During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of [[gay rights]] legislation. In a 2000 Republican presidential debate, George W.

====Presidency====
[[George W. Bush]] was mostly neutral towards LGBT rights as president. In his eight years of office, Bush's views on [[gay rights]] were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but Bush's critics felt as if he failed to enforce the executive order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401496.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays | first=Christopher | last=Lee | date=May 25, 2005 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained Clinton's Office of National AIDS Policy and was the first Republican president to appoint an openly gay man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]] as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position | first=Christopher | last=Heredia | date=April 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also became the second President, after President Clinton, to select openly gay appointees to his administration. Bush's nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E. Guest]], became the second openly gay man U.S. Ambassador and the first to be confirmed by the Senate. He did not repeal any of the spousal benefits that Clinton had introduced for same-sex federal employees. He did not attempt to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell]], nor make an effort to change it.&lt;ref name="Bush civil rights" /&gt;

In April 2002, White House officials held an unannounced briefing in April for the Log Cabin Republicans. On June 27, 2002, President Bush has signed a bill allowing death benefits to be paid to [[domestic partner]]s of firefighters and police officers who die in the line of duty, permanently extending a federal death benefit to same-sex couples for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike Allen |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-06-27/news/0206260935_1_death-benefits-domestic-partners-federal-benefit |title=Bush Approves Federal Same-sex Death Benefits |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=June 27, 2002 |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that sodomy laws against consenting adults was unconstitutional.

Obama also called for full equality during his second [[inaugural address]] on January 21, 2013: "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."

I felt it was important for us to answer that question honestly. And the answer is no." The administration took the position that the Supreme Court should apply "heightened scrutiny" to California's ban—a standard under which legal experts say no state ban could survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/01/obama-gay-marriage-supreme-court-states/1956951/|title=Obama: I would rule against all gay marriage bans|date=March 1, 2013 | work=USA Today|first1=Richard|last1=Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2017, when asked by a White House reporter if President Trump agreed that it would be okay for bakers to put up signs in their business windows saying "We don't bake cakes for gay weddings.", as his [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] had argued before the Supreme Court, White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Sanders]] said that the president believes in religious liberty and "that would include that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-120517/ Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Issued on: December 5, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mike Pence====
On June 15, 2016, Trump announced [[Indiana]] Governor [[Mike Pence]] as his vice presidential running-mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4409358/donald-trump-mike-pence-vice-president-announcement/|title=Donald Trump Introduces Mike Pence as Vice President Pick|date=July 16, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was criticized by LGBT advocates due to Pence being known for committed opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and his support for "religious freedom laws" that allow individuals and companies to claim religious exemptions from providing services to LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4406337/mike-pence-gay-rights-lgbt-religious-freedom/|title=Here's What Mike Pence Said on LGBT Issues Over the Years|last=Drabold|first=Will|website=Time|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pence mate"/&gt;

In addition, Pence, during his Congressional campaign in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000|2000]], stated, on his campaign website, that "Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pence Agenda for the 107th Congress:  A Guide to Renewing the American Dream|url=http://cybertext.net/pence/issues.html|website=Mike Pence for Congress|accessdate=September 4, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010119100800/http://cybertext.net/pence/issues.html|archivedate=January 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted by some to be a statement of support for [[Conversion therapy]], an accusation that was not addressed until after Pence's election as Vice President, when Pence's spokesperson called the accusation a "mischaracterization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Liam|title=Mike Pence and 'Conversion Therapy': A History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/us/politics/mike-pence-and-conversion-therapy-a-history.html|accessdate=September 4, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary [[Hillary Clinton]], who ran against Trump in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] called Pence "the most extreme pick in a generation".&lt;ref name="Pence mate"&gt;{{cite news|author=Burns, Alexander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/politics/mike-pence-donald-trump-vice-president.html|title=How Donald Trump Finally Settled on Mike Pence|work=The New York Times|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, an article published by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' claimed Trump made light of Pence's anti-LGBT attitudes during a meeting with a legal scholar, saying he wants "to hang them all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mayer|first1=Jane|title=The Danger of President Pence|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence|accessdate=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|issue=October 23, 2017|quote=Two sources also recalled Trump needling Pence about his views on abortion and homosexuality. During a meeting with a legal scholar, Trump belittled Pence's determination to overturn Roe v. Wade. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. "You see?" Trump asked Pence. "You've wasted all this time and energy on it, and it's not going to end abortion anyway." When the conversation turned to gay rights, Trump motioned toward Pence and joked, "Don't ask that guy—he wants to hang them all!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's comments attracted much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Eugene|title=Trump's joke about Mike Pence affirms the long-held concerns of many in the LGBT community|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/17/trumps-joke-about-mike-pence-affirms-the-long-held-concerns-of-many-in-the-lgbt-community/|accessdate=October 26, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Travis|title=Trump's joke about Pence must spur action at state level, Mass.

There were also allegations that Pence once published letters that were strongly anti-LGBT for the [[Indiana Policy Review Foundation]] publication ''Indiana Policy Review'', including one in 1993 that urged employers to not hire members of the LGBT community for work, claiming they are "promiscuous", carry "extremely high rates of disease", and "not able bodied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rense|first1=Sarah|title=Here's Why Mike Pence Advised Against Hiring Gay People|url=http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/news/a48305/mike-pence-anti-lgbt-articles/|accessdate=October 26, 2017|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dresden|first1=Hilton|title=Mike Pence Wrote An Article Urging Employers Not to Hire Gay People|url=https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2016/9/01/mike-pence-wrote-article-urging-employers-not-hire-gay-people|accessdate=October 26, 2017|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. political parties==

===Democratic Party===
The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] started to support some LGBT rights in the 1990s. Despite singing the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], [[Bill Clinton]] was the first president who openly supported LGBT rights; he appointed several openly gay government officials during his administration. In [[2012 Democratic National Convention|2012 national platform]], the Democratic Party supported the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and supports "equal responsibility, benefits, and protections" for same-sex couples,&lt;ref name="dem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/about/party_platform|title=The 2008 Democratic National Platform: Renewing America's Promise|accessdate=August 9, 2009|publisher=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723225320/http://www.democrats.org/about/party_platform|archivedate=July 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since President [[Barack Obama]] came out to support same-sex marriage in 2012, the Democratic Party explicitly supports same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/03/democratic-party-platform_n_1853120.html |title=Democratic Party Platform: Pro-Gay Marriage, Immigration Reform, Shots At Romney, Squishy On Guns |work=Huffington Post |date=August 4, 2012 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |last=Stein |first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Democratic Party's [[2016 Democratic National Convention|2016 national platform]], the Democratic Party adopted its most progressive agenda on support LGBT rights, which include: Supports the Supreme Court Marriage Equality decision, Supports comprehensive federal nondiscrimination policies for LGBT Americans in [housing, employment, public accommodations, credit, jury service, education, and federal funding], Supports including LGBT people under sex discrimination laws, Opposes anti-LGBT state laws including anti-transgender legislation, Supports combating youth homelessness, Supporting policies to improve school climates for LGBT students, Supporting LGBT elders, Supporting access to trans healthcare, Ending violence against LGBT people including the crisis of anti-transgender violence, Supporting mental health, and "Insuring fair treatment for LGBT veterans, including by proactively reviewing and upgrading discharge records for veterans who were discharged because of their sexual orientation." 

According to that agenda, "Democrats believe that LGBT rights are human rights and that American foreign policy should advance the ability of all persons to live with dignity, security, and respect, regardless of who they are or who they love."

In the section on HIV/AIDS: &lt;blockquote&gt;Democrats believe an AIDS-free generation is within our grasp. But today far too many Americans living with HIV are without access to quality care and too many new infections occur each year. That is why we will implement the National HIV and AIDS Strategy; increase research funding for the National Institutes of Health; cap pharmaceutical expenses for people living with HIV and AIDS; reform HIV criminalization laws; and expand access for harm reduction programs and HIV prevention medications, particularly for the populations most at risk of infection. Abroad, we will continue our commitment to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and increase global funding for HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment. Democrats will always protect those living with HIV and AIDS from stigma and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110225904/https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf |archivedate=November 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Republican Party===
The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] opposes many LGBT rights. The [[2012 Republican National Convention]] platform opposes any legal recognition of same sex couples, supported a ban on same-sex marriage through a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|federal constitutional amendment]], along with [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutional]] amendments banning same-sex marriage and the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitehouse12.com/republican-party-platform/ |title=GOP Platform " White House 2012 |publisher=Whitehouse12.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Fred Karger]]'s unsuccessful run for the 2012 Republican nomination for President made him America's first openly gay Republican presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/03/23/gay_republican_president|title=Fred Karger, gay Republican, for president|website=Salon.com|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Republican presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]] expressed his support to the LGBTQ community at the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], the Republican Party's 2016 Platform adapted its policies on LGBT issues, which include: Opposes [[Obergefell v. Hodges]], Opposes banning conversion therapy on minors, Opposes transgender rights, Opposes covering LGBT people under discrimination policies ("First Amendment Defense Act"/"Religious Freedom" laws)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf?mid=76323&amp;rid=16150088|format=PDF|title=REPUBLICAN PLATFORM 2016 |website=Prod-static-ngop-phl.s3.amazonaws.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/07/18/gop-delegates-ratify-platform-support-anti-lgbt-language/|title=GOP delegates ratify anti-LGBT platform|date=July 18, 2016|publisher=''The Washington Blade''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertarian Party===
{{Main|Libertarian perspectives on LGBT rights#United States Libertarian Party}}
The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] has endorsed libertarian perspectives on LGBT rights by supporting "religious freedom" and promoting marriage equality since it was created in 1971. The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] also wished to lift the bans on same-sex marriage, but with the ultimate goal of [[marriage privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarians-applaud-steps-toward-marriage-equality|title=Libertarians applaud steps toward marriage equality|date=April 13, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2009|quote=America's third largest party Monday praised officials in Iowa, Vermont and the District of Columbia for taking recent steps toward marriage equality, and urged legislators in all states to scrap government licensing, taxation and regulation of marriage.|publisher=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 [[John Hospers]] of the Libertarian Party became the first openly gay man to run for president of the United States, as well as the Libertarian Party's first presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2011/06/13/john-hospers-rip|title=John Hospers, RIP|date=June 13, 2011|website=Reason.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Party===
{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}
The Green Party has been in favor of sweeping LGBT rights and protections since the party's inaugural platform in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Party on the Issues|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Green_Party.htm#Principles_+_Values|website=OnTheIssues.org|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more informal coalition of State Green Parties that existed in America from 1983 to 2000 also backed LGBT rights.

===Constitution Party===
{{Main|Constitution Party (United States)}}
The [[Constitution Party (United States)]] is strongly opposed to LGBT rights, and supports criminal laws against homosexuality and cross-dressing.
 
The party is very conservative and has ties to [[Christian Reconstructionism]], a far-right, political movement within conservative Christian churches.

===Other political parties===
While many American socialist and [[communism|communist]] political parties initially preferred to ignore the issue, most now support gay rights causes. Socialist groups generally integrate a stronger approach to gender identity issues than mainstream parties.  The [[Socialist Party USA]] nominated an openly gay man, [[David McReynolds]], as its Presidential candidate in 1980.

==Summary table of LGBT rights in the United States==
This is simplified for international comparison with other Wikipedia LGBT rights articles. A green checkmark denotes the right exists, while a red X denotes it doesn't; a check ''and'' an X in the same column means the right varies on a state-by-state basis.

'''Successor to hereditary''' title, office or like, in case of the [[inheritance|heritage]] being indivisible, goes to one person at a time. There are also other sorts of [[order of succession]] than hereditary succession (such as line of non-hereditary succession to democratic state offices).

The hereditary line of succession may be limited to [[heirs of the body]], or may pass also to collateral lines, in case of extinction of heirs of the body, depending on the succession rules. These concepts are in use in English inheritance law.

Main concepts for hereditary succession are usually either ''heir male'' or ''heir general'' &amp;ndash; see further [[primogeniture]] (agnatic, cognatic, and also equal).

Certain types of [[property]] pass to a descendant or relative of the original holder, recipient or [[grantee]] according to a fixed order of [[kinship]]. Upon the death of the grantee, a designated [[inheritance]] such as a [[peerage]], or a [[monarchy]],&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal succession: Succession rules from 'bygone era', says Clegg|date=January 22, 2013|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-21119034}}&lt;/ref&gt; passes automatically to that living, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]], non-[[Adoption|adoptive]] relative of the grantee who is most senior in descent, regardless of the relative age; and thereafter continues to pass to subsequent successors of the grantee, according to the same formula, upon the death of each subsequent heir.

Each person who inherits according to this formula is considered an heir at law of the grantee and the inheritance may not pass to someone who is not a natural, lawful descendant or relative of the grantee.

Collateral [[Kinship|kin]], who share some or all of the grantee's ancestry, but do not directly descend from the grantee, may inherit if there is no limitation to heirs of the body.

There are other kinds of formulae for inheritance, if the heritage can be divided: [[co-parceners|heirs portioners]] and [[partible inheritance]].

"Heir male" is a genealogical term which specifically means "senior male by masculine primogeniture in the legitimate descent of an individual"

The '''London Agreement''', formally the '''Agreement on the application of Article 65 of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents''' and sometimes referred to as the '''London Protocol''', is a [[patent]] [[law]] agreement concluded in [[London]] on 17 October 2000 and aimed at reducing the translation costs of European patents granted under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC).&lt;ref name="epo20070911"&gt;European Patent Office (EPO) web site, [http://www.epo.org/topics/issues/london-agreement.html ''London Agreement to enter into force in first half of 2008''], News, 11 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The London Agreement is an optional agreement between member states of the [[European Patent Organisation]],&lt;ref name="epo20070911"/&gt; and has not altered other language requirements applying to European patent applications prior to grant.

The London Agreement entered into force on 1 May 2008.&lt;ref name="LA key"&gt;{{Cite web

==Background==
Before 1 May 2008, once a European patent was granted or more precisely within three months&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or six months for [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;EPO web site, [http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/iv/ie.htm "National law relating to the EPC (14th edition)", IV. Translation requirements after grant, Ireland], 4. Consulted on 13 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) from the date of grant, the patent had to be translated into an official language of each country in which the patentee wanted patent protection. If the translation of the European patent was not provided to the national [[patent office]] within the prescribed time limit, the patent was "deemed to be void [[ab initio]] in that State."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation still applies in the Contracting States wherein the Agreement has not entered into force.

This situation led to high translation costs for patent holders, reduced the incentives to apply for a European patent and, many argued, the situation was a burden on the competitiveness of the [[European economy]], compared to the situation in the [[United States]] (see also EU's [[Lisbon Strategy]]).

==Content==
The agreement provides that Contracting States that have an official language in common with an official language of the [[European Patent Office]], i.e. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]], no longer require translation of European patents into one of their official languages. Other contracting states have to choose one of the official languages of the EPO as a "prescribed language," in which European patents have to be translated in order to enter into force in their country. They however keep the right to require translation of the [[claim (patent)|claim]]s in one of their official languages.

In addition, a Contracting State to the Agreement also keeps the right to require that, in case of a [[enforcement of European patents|dispute relating to a European patent]], a translation should be provided by the patentee in one of the official languages of the state.

The agreement has not altered other language provisions applying prior to grant of a European patent, such as the requirement that the claims of a European patent application have to be translated "in the two official languages of the European Patent Office other than the language of the proceedings" after receiving the communication under {{EPC Rule|71|3}} indicating that the EPO intends to grant a European patent.

Pursuant to article 9 of the Agreement, the regime applies to European patents in respect of which the mention of grant was published on or after 1 May 2008. The new language regime however already applied for Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom to European patents granted on or after 1 February 2008.&lt;ref name="LA key" /&gt; Germany had some trouble with the implementation of the London Agreement. The original implementation bill was flawed due to miscalculations of the date of entry into force of the new translation requirements for European patents designating Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Axel H Horns, [http://www.ipjur.com/2008/04/london-agreement-and-ipred-1-in-german.php3 ''London Agreement and IPRED-1 in the German Parliament''], BLOG@IP::JUR, 14 April 2008. Consulted on 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A new implementation bill was then published on 11 July 2008.

On 14 April 2010, the [[Court of Appeal of Paris]], France, issued 24 similar court decisions, holding that, since France has ratified the London Agreement, no translation in French needed to be filed at the [[French Patent Office]] (INPI) with respect of European patents maintained as amended after [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition proceedings]], and that this applied also to European patents maintained as amended for which the original mention of grant has been published prior to the entry into force of the London Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj010/10_10/10_5560.pdf Judgments of 14 April 2010 by the Paris Court of Appeal, division 5, 1st chamber], in Official Journal EPO 10/2010, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Teyssedre, [http://europeanpatentcaselaw.blogspot.com/2010/06/inpi-ne-traduisez-plus.html "INPI : ne traduisez plus !"], Le blog du droit européen des brevets, 2 June 2010.

==History==
The Agreement resulted from a process started at the Paris Conference on 24–25 June 1999, an intergovernmental conference of the member states of the European Patent Organisation held in [[Paris]] at the invitation of the [[French government]].&lt;ref name="OJ8–9/1999"&gt; European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj99/8_99/8_5459.pdf ''Intergovernmental conference of the member states of the European Patent Organisation on the reform of the patent system in Europe, Paris, 24 and 25 June 1999''], [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|OJ EPO]] 8–9/1999, pp. 545-553.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference adopted a [[mandate (international law)|mandate]] setting up two working parties with the task of submitting reports to the governments of the contracting states on reducing the cost of European patents and harmonising patent litigation.&lt;ref name="OJ8–9/1999"/&gt; The first working party eventually led to the London Agreement while the second led to the proposed [[European Patent Litigation Agreement]]. More precisely, the first working party was instructed to draft an "''optional protocol to the EPC, under which its signatory states undertake not to require the translation of the description of the European patent, provided that it is available in English... [or alternatively] provided that it is available in one of the official EPO languages as designated by each signatory state''".&lt;ref name="OJ8–9/1999"/&gt; The name "London Protocol" is sometimes used to refer to the London Agreement, because the initial mandate mentioned a Protocol, rather than an Agreement.{{#tag:ref|Similarly, the [[European Patent Litigation Agreement]] (EPLA) was called "European Patent Litigation Protocol" before being renamed "European Patent Litigation Agreement" for reasons of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property]], [http://www.ige.ch/E/jurinfo/j110201.shtm ''European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA)''], 18 November 2002. Retrieved on 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

[[File:French Senate amphitheater 050917 162927.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The approval of the London Agreement by the French Senate (''amphitheater pictured''), on 9 October 2007 was the last major step (not counting the deposit of the ratification instruments) before its entry into force.]]The Agreement was then adopted at the London Conference of 2000,&lt;ref name="epo20070911"/&gt; followed by a seven-year ratification process. On 18 April 2007, at the European Patent Forum in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]] said that she and [[Federal Minister of Justice (Germany)|German Justice Minister]] [[Brigitte Zypries]] would fight to see the London Agreement realised.&lt;ref name="epo 20.04.07"&gt;EPO web site, [http://www.epo.org/focus/news/2007/070419.html ''"Patents are the future"'']. Consulted on 20 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She called the London Agreement "an important step in the right direction".&lt;ref name="epo 20.04.07"/&gt;

This agreement was [[signature|signed]] by 10 countries, namely Denmark, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. To enter into force, the deposit of instruments of [[ratification]] by at least eight countries, including at least France, Germany and the United Kingdom had to take place. Up to now, Monaco, Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Denmark, and France have deposited their instrument of ratification to the London Agreement while Slovenia, Iceland, Latvia and Croatia have deposited their instrument of [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|accession]] (accession is also taken into account for the entry into force of the agreement). Sweden ratified on 29 April 2008.&lt;ref name="EPO Status"&gt;{{Cite web

Since France deposited its instruments of ratification on 29 January 2008, the agreement entered into force on 1 May 2008.&lt;ref name="LA key" /&gt;

The ratification of the London Agreement by France, which for some time was the last missing step for the Agreement to enter into force, followed a number of steps, including the recommendation in May 2006 by the [[French National Assembly]] and the [[French Senate]] to adopt the Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/hearing/preliminary_findings_en.pdf ''Future patent policy in Europe, Public hearing''], Consultation on future patent policy in Europe – preliminary findings, 12 July 2006, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; the approval by the [[French Constitutional Council]],&lt;ref&gt;"''La compatibilité de cet accord avec la Constitution a été confirmée par une décision du Conseil constitutionnel du 28 septembre 2006 (décision n° 2006-541 DC).''" in {{fr icon}} Assemblée Nationale, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/pdf/projets/pl0151.pdf ''Projet de Loi autorisant la ratification de l’accord sur l’application de l’article 65 de la convention sur la délivrance de brevets européens,''], 24 August 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the announcement in August 2007 by the new Prime Minister [[François Fillon]] that the London Agreement would soon be ratified,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "''Dans les prochains jours, nous annoncerons une réforme radicale du crédit impôt recherche pour que 100 % des dépenses de recherche soient prises en compte.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17289">The '''Martinsville Seven''' were a group of seven [[African Americans|African-American]] men from [[Martinsville, Virginia]] who were convicted and executed in 1951 for raping a white woman in 1949. At the time of their arrest, all but one was between the ages of 20 and 23. They were quickly tried in six separate trials (two agreed to be tried together) and each was sentenced to death. It was the largest mass execution for rape that had been reported in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klarman|first1=Michael J.|title=From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199880928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOuTO8_FWr4C&amp;pg=PR74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=74|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Virginia law, only black men were executed for rape convictions. According to historian Eric W. Rise, this case "demonstrated the power of the southern legal system to enforce codes of racial behavior."&lt;ref name=RiseJSH&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric W. |last=Rise |title=Race, Rape, and Radicalism: The Case of the Martinsville  Seven, 1949–1951 |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=58 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=461–490 |jstor=2210164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Congress]] defended the men originally, and later conducted two marches and other attempts to raise awareness and conduct a public campaign on behalf of their agenda, and over the objections of [[NAACP]], who feared further backlash because of the CRC's Communist affiliations, as many thought eventually occurred. [[Martin A. Martin]] and other NAACP attorneys defended the men on appeals, attempting to ensure fair trials, set due process precedents, and gain clemency or sentence reductions. The case attracted national newspaper coverage. The NAACP appeals also noted that since Virginia started use of the electric chair, only black men had been executed for rape in the state for what was a non-lethal crime. Though Governor [[William M. Tuck|William Tuck]] initially agreed to a stay during appellate litigation, by late July 1950, newly elected Governor [[John S. Battle]] refused to commute the men's sentences, saying he was horrified by the rapes. The appellate courts upheld the convictions and sentences, and the US Supreme Court twice refused to hear the cases, but would in 1977 finally adopt those arguments with respect to other cases.

==Events==
The rapes occurred on Saturday, January 8, 1949, after Ruby Stroud Floyd, a 32-year-old white woman, entered a black neighborhood in [[Martinsville, Virginia]] to collect money for clothing she had sold. She previously distributed [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] materials in the neighborhood. Residents warned her not to stay too long, noting the time as late afternoon. She passed four men at the railroad tracks and continued into the neighborhood, where she was later assaulted by some of those four and other men. At 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., after dark, she went to Mary Wade's house for shelter, showing signs of an assault. The Wades called an ambulance for her.

Based on her account, claiming to have been raped by several black men, the police quickly arrested Frank Hairston, Jr. and Booker Millner. Four more suspects were arrested that night, based in part on the first two men's confessions. By the next morning, all the men in custody had signed confessions. The last to be arrested, Joe Hampton, was taken into custody on January 10. All but one man was in his early 20s. After being held by police overnight, the first six all signed confessions, implicating themselves and each other. All admitted to being present at the crime, including Joe Hampton, although not all took part in rape. Only one of the accused had a prior criminal record, and most of the men were employed. When the NAACP appealed their convictions, its defense team noted that the police had questioned the men who had been drinking for some time, and without allowing them to consult with lawyers or their families.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

The officials separated the men and acted to protect them from mob violence by taking them to other jails outside [[Henry County, Virginia|Henry County]]. The preliminary hearing occurred about a month later, and the [[grand jury]] two months after that. A grand jury (which included both black and white members) indicted all the men. Their quick arrest assured the community that stability was being preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/martinsvilleseve00rise/martinsvilleseve00rise_djvu.txt Eric Walter Rise, ''THE MARTINSVILLE SEVEN AND SOUTHERN JUSTICE: RACE, CRIME, AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN VIRGINIA, 1949-1951''], 1992 PhD dissertation, pp. full text available at Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities showed increased professional conduct and procedures since the controversial arrest and execution of [[Odell Waller]] during World War II (he was initially represented at trial by the Trotskyite [[Revolutionary Workers League (Oehlerite)|Revolutionary Workers League]] and ultimately executed).&lt;ref&gt;Eric W. Rise, The Martinsville Seven: Race, Rape and Capital Punishment (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1995) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Seven==
(listed in order of arrest)&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;
* Frank Hairston Jr., age 20, confessed to rape
* Booker T. Millner, age 22, said he was present, but did not take part
Based on their confessions, the police arrested:
* Howard Lee Hairston, age 20, denied having sex with Floyd. He and his older brother (below) were not related to Frank Hairston, Jr.
* James Luther Hairston, age 22
* John Claybon Taylor, age 23
* Francis DeSales Grayson, age 38 and of Richmond, Virginia, denied having sex with Floyd; only defendant without local ties.
The last was arrested January 10:
* Joe Henry Hampton, age 21

==Trial==
The judge appointed seven attorneys for the seven defendants. Since they ranged widely in experience, he asked the more experienced ones to aid the newer attorneys. Efforts by the defense team to change the trial's venue from the Martinsville Circuit Court—on the grounds that sensationalist press about the events made a fair trial impossible—were unsuccessful. There was considerable community sentiment against the men. Racism was less explicit in the trial than in cases known as "legal lynchings" in the South, in which innocent men were convicted (e.g., the [[Scottsboro Boys]], [[Willie McGee (convict)|Willie McGee]]), and the [[Groveland Boys]].

Previous actions by civil rights attorneys had resulted in changes in the Virginia process, improving their procedures. For example, although most African Americans in Virginia had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the early 20th century and were thus disqualified from serving on juries, the grand jury had included black members. In addition, each of the jury pools for the six separate trials contained some African Americans. But, none was selected for any of the seven juries, as the prosecutors rejected all of them on various grounds. The juries were all white and all male.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

Judge Kennon Whittle told the attorneys: "this case must and will be tried in such a way as not to disturb the kindly feeling now, locally, existing between the races. It must be tried as though both parties were members of the same race."&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; The prosecution did not explicitly discuss race; it argued the case based on the "preservation of community stability, not the protection of southern womanly virtues,"&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; as had formerly been common.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

The trials were held back to back, each with a separate jury of twelve white men. The prosecution, led by Irvin W. Cubine, introduced evidence showing that non-consensual sex took place. Some of the defendants acknowledged having sexual intercourse with Floyd, but said that it was consensual, or that she did not resist or say no, either considered necessary as a condition to prove rape. Virginia law authorized capital punishment for accessories, parties to the act of rape who did not take part in the act. On the stand, each of the defendants at least partially rejected his confession. In some cases, they said that the police had written the confessions, that the formal account varied from a handwritten version, and that they had not fully read the police version when signing and did not recognize that their own accounts had been changed.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

Rise says that the white community disdained Ruby Floyd for her missionary work with the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and for her willingness to enter the black part of Martinsville. The prosecution pointed out that Floyd had had gone to an area considered unsafe for white women, ignored warnings of black residents of staying too long there, and not been attentive to her surroundings or the men she passed.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; A relative of the Hairstons has said that their family tradition always said that Floyd had been having an affair with one of the defendants, but this was not explored at trial.&lt;ref name="pamelaH"/&gt;

No trial lasted more than a day, and the longest jury deliberation lasted less than two hours. The shortest was little more than half an hour. Although the defense attorneys pointed out mitigating circumstances, the juries quickly convicted each defendant and sentenced them to execution in the electric chair. The judge presiding was [[Kennon C. Whittle]].&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

==Protests and appeals==
Virginia had historically convicted and executed numerous black men accused of raping white women; for most of its history, only blacks were sentenced to death for rape. Since Virginia started using an electric chair in 1908, all 45 of the men sentenced to death for rape had been black men convicted of raping white women.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Frank Green, "[http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2011/feb/06/martinsville-seven-executions-remain-raw-wound-man-ar-823535/ A Year of History: Martinsville Seven executions remain 'a raw wound' for many]", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1908 to 1951, only Texas, North Carolina and Georgia executed more black men for rape than did Virginia.&lt;ref name="bowers"&gt;William J. Bowers (1984), [https://archive.org/stream/martinsvilleseve00rise/martinsvilleseve00rise_djvu.txt ''Legal Homicide: Death as Punishment in America, 1864-1982,''], Appendix A, Northeastern University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ASWPL Jessie Daniel Ames, ''The Changing Character of Lynching: Review of Lynching, 1931-1941], with a discussion of recent developments in this field,'' Atlanta: Commission on Interracial Cooperation, Inc., 1942, pp. 34-50 (pamphlet), full text available online at Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in New York's ''[[Amsterdam News]]'' read, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we consider the fact that in the entire history of the Old Dominion state, no white man has ever received capital punishment for rape, then of necessity we must conclude that the death penalty for seven men for a singular crime was neither righteous, nor compassionate, nor wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/martinsville_seven/14.html| title=The Martinsville Seven| author=Mark Gado| publisher=TruTV Crime Library| accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case of the Martinsville Seven was taken up by outside groups, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC). [[Martin A. Martin]] of the Richmond law firm Hill, Martin and Robinson, was the lead attorney for the appellate defense team for the NAACP in Virginia, as his firm had considerable experience with civil rights cases.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; The NAACP did not want the CRC to participate in the litigation directly. Martin and the NAACP also agreed to represent the men in an appeal for the Seven with the [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]]. They applied the bulk of the funds raised to the defense of clients.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert King, ''Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America,'' New York: HarperCollins, 2012, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP's interest was in establishing legal precedent "for the benefit of due process and equal protection in general and the Negroes' rights in particular."&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; Their concern was ensuring a fair trial.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

One of the convicted men's parents contacted the CRC directly and asked one of its lawyers to defend their son DeSales Grayson. The CRC focused on producing pamphlets and publicity for outside campaigns to raise awareness about the case, including internationally, and hoped to put pressure on government officials.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles H. |last=Martin |title=The Civil Rights Congress and Southern Black Defendants |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |volume=71 |issue=1 |year=1987 |pages=25–52 |jstor=40581617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC began to organize mass actions in Richmond.

In their appeals, Martin and the NAACP discussed the unfairness of the venue, the pressure on later juries to arrive at the same sentence as the earlier ones, and the historical racial disparities in application of death penalty sentences in the state. They noted the assaults of Floyd had no evidence of homicidal intent. The Court of Appeals upheld the rulings on March 13, 1950, with Chief Justice [[Edward W. Hudgins]] writing: "one can hardly conceive of a more atrocious, a more beastly crime". Together representatives, both black and white, of the CRC and NAACP, as well as other citizens, met with Battle in June 1950 to appeal for a pardon or clemency for the defendants in the case. They argued for lesser sentences, but Battle resisted their pleas.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

The NAACP thought that involvement by the CRC in appeals could endanger the defendants both because of their inflammatory tactics and its communist affiliation. In this period of the second [[Red Scare]], Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] had raised alarms about purported communist influence in government and society. Both African American Newspapers, the ''Richmond Afro-American'' and ''Norfolk Journal and Guide'' concluded the national and international crusades by the CRC hurt the defendants' chances for clemency.{{sfn|Rise|1995|p=151}}

After exhausting the appeals process, with the US Supreme Court twice declining to hear the case, the NAACP and CRC began to appeal to executive offices. Newly elected Virginia Governor [[John S. Battle]] refused their request for clemency. In advance of a large planned CRC demonstration in the state capital, Governor Battle doubled the capital guard and alerted the state militia. On January 30, 1951, 400 protesters arrived in Richmond, appealing to Battle on the issue of racial disparity in sentencing. Governor Battle listened to their claims but was unwilling to bend on the issue of the Seven, saying: "The prisoners have not been convicted because they are Negroes and should not be released because they are Negroes." He was appalled at the nature of the crime.&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt;

The CRC also had organized an international campaign, and Governor Battle was swamped by letters from overseas asking him to commute the sentences of the men. He resented being under so much pressure. One telegram from Moscow was signed by "workers in science, literature, the arts," including composers [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. Another, from China, called the sentence a "barbaric" example of American "fascist hooliganism".&lt;ref name=RiseJSH/&gt; The men were executed in early February.

In 1977, in its ruling in ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'', the US Supreme Court ruled that "it is repugnant to an enlightened society for the state to kill a person for a crime that does not result in death," declining to extend the death penalty to a person guilty of raping an adult woman.

==Execution==
All of the appeals by the NAACP failed. The Seven were executed at the Virginia State Penitentiary in early February 1951. The first four were executed at 15-minute intervals on February 2. The remaining three were executed on February 5, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;King, ''The Devil in the Grove'', pp. 291-292&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the youngest of the seven was executed, he said, "God knows I didn't touch that woman and I'll see ya'll on the other side."&lt;ref name="pamelaH"&gt;Pamela Hairston, "[http://www.mndaily.com/2007/02/19/letters-editor Letters to the editor: An infamous event]", ''Minnesota Daily'', 19 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30426">'''Maternity leave in the United States''' is regulated by [[US labor law]]. There is a right to a temporary and unpaid period of absence from employment granted to expectant or new mothers during the months immediately before and after childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternity leave|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/maternity+leave|publisher=World English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies are generally aimed at supporting the mother's full recovery from childbirth and facilitating a stronger mother-child bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Michael|author2=Kevin Milligan|title=How Does Job-Protected Maternity Leave Affect Mothers' Employment?|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|year=2008|volume=26|issue=4|pages=655–691|doi=10.1086/591955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] (FMLA) requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for most mothers of newborn or newly adopted children.

This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In comparison to other countries, the United States is one of the only countries in the world, and the only [[OECD|OECD member]], that has not passed laws requiring business and corporations to offer paid maternity leave to their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OECD|title=Parental Leave Systems|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Between 1961 and 1965, only 14% of mothers participated in the workforce within 6 months of their child's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=M. |author2=B. Downs |author3=K. Smith|title=Maternity Leave and Employment Patterns: 1961-1995|journal=Current Population Reports|year=2001|volume=70|issue=79|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the enactment of FMLA legislation in 1993, maternity leave coverage was governed by state law, collective bargaining agreements and employer policies.&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=L.|author2=J. Waldfogel|title=Maternity Leave and the Employment of New Mothers in the United States|journal=Journal of Population Economics|year=2004|volume=17|issue=2|pages=331–349|doi=10.1007/s00148-003-0159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of maternity leave related policies emerged in the late 1960s. By 1969, five states had enacted Temporary [[Disability Insurance]] laws protecting employees from income loss in the occurrence of a temporary medical disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=S.|title=Parental Leave and Child Health Across OECD Countries|journal=The Economic Journal|year=2005|volume=115|issue=501|pages=7–28|doi=10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00970.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this legislation, new mothers were granted leaves corresponding to the benefits that other employees received for temporary illness or disability. This state-level trend of maternity leave legislation continued into the 1970s and 1980s where multiple other states passed more explicit recognitions of new mothers' rights to a temporary leave of absence. Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer maternity leave packages to its employees.&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt; Even in the absence of this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through [[collective bargaining]]. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.

Despite some localized employees' access to maternity leave, there was growing pressure for national maternity leave legislation in the early 1990s. Many new mothers continued to be excluded from such maternity leave provisions despite growing national demand. Women now enjoyed greater employment opportunities and changing gender norms that encouraged increased labor involvement. This increased [[female employment]] extended to mothers as well who now were now more likely to engage in the workforce even if they had a young child. The labor participation rate of mothers with children under the age of 1 rose from 31% in 1976 to 54% in 1992.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=J.|title=The Family Gap for Young Women in the United States and Britain: Can Maternity Leave Make a Difference?|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|year=1998|volume=16|issue=3|pages=505–545|doi=10.1086/209897}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of a high labor force participation rate, only an estimated 40% of working women had access to explicit maternity leave protection. This inadequate national coverage provoked intense protest and growing national consensus on the value of maternity leave. Ultimately, the increased salience and galvanized national support prompted the 1993 enactment of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|Family and Medical Leave Act]] mandating maternity leave.

==Current legislation==

===Federal legislation===
The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] (or FMLA), signed into law during President Bill Clinton's first term, mandates a minimum of 12 weeks unpaid leave to mothers for the purpose of attending to a newborn or newly adopted child.&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtin|first=S.|author2=S. Hofferth|title=Parental Leave Statutes and Maternal Return to Work After Childbirth in the United States|journal=Work and Occupations|year=2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–105|doi=10.1177/0730888405281889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act does not attain universal coverage as it includes several limiting stipulations. In order to receive maternity leave, employees must work in a firm of 50 or more employees, maintain employment with the same business for 12 months and have accumulated at least 1,250 working hours over those 12 months. As of 2012, 59% of American employees were eligible under the FMLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/es_20170606_paidfamilyleave.pdf|title=Paid Family and Medical Leave: An issue whose time has come|last=AEI-Brookings Working Group on Paid Family Leave|first=|publisher=Brookings Institute|year=May 2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FMLA is the only law that addresses family leave. Two other Federal laws, the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]'s amendment of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], provide some additional protection for parents on the birth of a child.&lt;ref name="expecting"/&gt;

===State legislation===
Many states have supplemented these federal regulations and provided more extensive maternity leave benefits, including expanding paid or flexible sick time, expanding access for workers in smaller companies or with less time on the job, right to pump that expands on federal law, and pregnancy accommodations.&lt;ref name="expecting"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/expecting-better-2016.pdf|title=Expecting Better: A state-by-state analysis of laws that help expecting and new parents (4th edition)|last=National Partnership for Women and Families|first=|date=August 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, 12 states have enacted no additional laws or programs to support family leave before or after birth.&lt;ref name="expecting"/&gt; Fourteen states, along with the District of Columbia, have addressed eligibility requirements by lowering the firm-size threshold from 50 or more employees down to as low as 10 employees. Seven other states, in addition to the District of Columbia, have adopted more generous maternity leave lengths that allow longer absences for the purpose of child rearing. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation enhancing the benefits of leave programs.

California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island for instance, operate programs that require private-sector employers to pay their employees who utilize maternity leave at partial replacement rates.&lt;ref name="grs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gornick|first=Janet|title=Parental Leave in 21 Countries: Assessing Generosity and Gender Equality|publisher=Center for Economic and Policy Research |author2=Rebecca Ray |author3=John Schmitt|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York passed paid family leave legislation, which includes maternity leave, in 2016 — starting off at 8 weeks and 50% of pay in 2018, and reaching 12 weeks and 67% of pay in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://singlemotherguide.com/grants-for-single-mothers/#FMLA |title=Paid Family Leave ― Grants for Single Moms |publisher=Single Mother Guide|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington state passed a paid family leave bill in 2007, but it lacked a funding mechanism and has not yet gone into effect. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia designate childbirth as a temporary disability thus guaranteeing mothers paid maternity leave through [[Disability Insurance]] (TDI) provisions.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Expecting Better: A State-by-State Analysis of Laws that Help New Parents|publisher=National Partnership for Women and Families|accessdate=8 April 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other federal policies ===
The Department of Defense has regulated the amount of maternity leave a military member can take. Before February 5, 2016 the leave was six weeks long for active duty members or reservists who had previously done twelve months of active duty time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2016/02/09/air-forces-new-12-week-maternity-leave-began-feb-5/80059404/|title=air-forces-new-12-week-maternity-leave-began-feb-5|last=Times|first=Air Force|website=Air Force Times|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On January 28, 2016, the Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter, increased the paid maternity leave to twelve weeks for all branches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/645958/carter-announces-12-weeks-paid-military-maternity-leave-other-benefits|title=Carter Announces 12 Weeks Paid Military Maternity Leave, Other Benefit|work=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional reservists, however, are given an eighty-four-day excusal, not leave.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/425869.pdf|title=Army Directive 2016-09 (Maternity Leave Policy)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Air Force AFI36-3003, it states that the maternity leave starts after being released from the hospital from giving birth, as also defined for other branches. "Shared benefits" can be created if both parents are active Air Force members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi36-3003/afi36-3003.pdf|title=AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 36-3003|last=Deborah|first=Lee|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a sum of up to twelve weeks can be taken by one parent or distributed amongst the two parents. However, two married active duty members cannot create "shared benefits" in the Army, according to the Army Directive 2016-09 (Maternity Leave Policy).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There was a stance by the previous Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, to increase the maternity leave from six to eighteen weeks for the Navy and Marine Corps beginning on July 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=87987|title=SECNAV Announces New Maternity Leave Policy|last=Information|first=This story was written by the Office of the Chief of|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was implemented until January 28, 2016, however, it remained eighteen weeks for those who were pregnant previous to and on March 3, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=93290|title=Navy Updates Maternity Leave Policy|last=Affairs|first=This story was written by Chief of Naval Personnel Public|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a significant leap to go from six to twelve weeks of maternity leave. Other benefits have also been increased to improve the lives of those with newborn or newly adopted children. These benefits include an increase of child care hours to fourteen hours a day, and allowing active duty members more ability to family plan by paying for the sperm and egg freezing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These decisions were made by the previous Defense Secretary "in an effort to support military families, improve retention and strengthen the force of the future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Impacts of United States maternity leave==

===Health===

====Child health and development====

Studies assert that an additional week of maternity leave among industrialized countries reduces [[infant mortality]] rates by 0.5 deaths per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracey|first=P.|author2=C. Winegarden|title=Demographic consequences of maternal-leave pro- grams in industrial countries: evidence from fixed effects models|journal=Southern Economic Journal|year=1995|volume=61|issue=4|pages=1020–1035|doi=10.2307/1060738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burtle|first=A. |author2=S. Bezruchka|title=Population Health and Paid Parental Leave: What the United States Can Learn from Two Decades of Research|journal=Healthcare|year=2016|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a positive correlation between maternal leave and the duration of [[breast-feeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fein|first=S. |author2=B. Roe |author3=M. Teisl |author4=L. Whittington|title='Is There Competition between Breast-feeding and Maternal Employment?|journal=Demography|year=1999|volume=36|issue=2|pages=157–172|doi=10.2307/2648105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who are not engaged in employment may be more able to participate in consistent breast-feeding; babies who are breastfed may be less likely to get a variety of infections and are also at a lower risk for asthma, obesity, and infant death syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/29/health/paid-leave-benefits-to-children-research/index.html|title=Paid leave benefits children and families, studies say - CNN|last=CNN|first=Kelly Wallace and Jen Christensen,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that breast-feeding has the ability to yield substantial health improvements in disease prevention and immune system build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=M.|author2=K.

====Maternal health====
The medical definition of [[postpartum]] is the time frame between childbirth and the return of the mother's reproductive organs to their non pregnant state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Pat|last2=Dowd|first2=Bryan|last3=Gjerdingen|first3=Dwenda|last4=Gross|first4=Cynthia R.|last5=Kenney|first5=Sally|last6=Ukestad|first6=Laurie|last7=McCaffrey|first7=David|last8=Lundberg|first8=Ulf|date=2006-3|title=Postpartum Health of Employed Mothers 5 Weeks After Childbirth |journal=Annals of Family Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=159–167|doi=10.1370/afm.519|pmc=1467019|pmid=16569720}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women that return to work during this postpartum period, the stress of maintaining a balance between their professional and parenting responsibilities has been shown to weaken their immune systems and interact poorly with their psychological state.&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=P.|author2=S. Markowitz|title=Does the Length of Maternity Leave affect Maternal Health?|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of depression==== 
[[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is a condition with both mental and physical side effects and can be very debilitating depending on the severity. The risk factors vary from person to person and women are typically diagnosed with depression more than men. Other than trauma, physical illness, certain personality traits, and previous family history, pregnancy can be a cause of depression in women. Symptoms of this disease include, loss of interest in activities, difficulty focusing, thinking, making decisions, and remembering things, anxiety, irritation, slowed speaking, physical pains, and feelings of sadness and worthlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/basics/definition/con-20029130|website=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any combination of these symptoms makes simple tasks seem daunting and almost impossible. Women who just gave birth are already managing recovering from the severe physical symptoms while taking care of a newborn child and adding symptoms of depression to this mixture can be a huge burden on them. When these new mothers go back to work they have the added stress of worrying about their child and balancing their family and work roles. Mothers who return to work soon after a birth of a child are likely to get depressed than other mothers; therefore, longer paid maternity leave has the potential to help new mothers. Women will have more time to recover from giving birth both mentally and physically, which can help prevent the onset of depression.

===Economic===

====Economic efficiency====
Four states currently offer paid family leave: California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-maternity-leave-in-the-us/|title=10 things you need to know about maternity leave in the US|work=TechRepublic|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Jersey, women who took paid leave in the year after giving birth were 40% less likely to receive public aid or food stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/rutgers-study-finds-paid-family-leave-leads-positive-economic-outcomes/20120119#.WuXi-zOZM0Q|title=Rutgers Study Finds Paid Family Leave Leads to Positive Economic Outcomes {{!}} Rutgers Today|website=news.rutgers.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a California-based study, 87% of employers reported that the paid leave requirement did not increase costs; 9% note that it saved money due to decreased turnover and other costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cepr.net/publications/reports/leaves-that-pay|title=Leaves That Pay: Employer and Worker Experiences With Paid Family Leave in California|last=Milkman|first=Eileen Appelbaum, Ruth|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the overall labor force participation has declined since the year 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plumer|first1=Brad|title=Three Reasons the US Labor Force Keeps Shrinking|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/09/06/the-incredible-shrinking-labor-force-again/|accessdate=4 June 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some economists argue that paid maternity leave in California has increased labor force participation among mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Claire Cain|title=The Economic Benefits of Paid Parental Leave|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-economic-benefits-of-paid-parental-leave.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 June 2017|agency=The New York Times|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who receive paid maternity leave may be more likely to return to employment later, and then work more hours and earn higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-economic-benefits-of-paid-parental-leave.html|title=The Economic Benefits of Paid Parental Leave|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|date=2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less favorable maternity leave policies may inhibit a woman's career trajectory and [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects. The extended period of absence of such policies often reduce a women's economic status and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=F.|title=Management Women and the New Facts of Life|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1989|volume=23|issue=1|pages=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this hiatus, their job skills and experiences may deteriorate thus limiting their potential advancement. {{Cleanup|reason=Needs to be updated - most sources are 1-2 decades old |date=December 2015}}

====Motherhood penalty====
[[File:US Gender pay gap, by age.001.png|thumb|US - women's earnings as a percentage of men's in 2008 by age group]]
Available maternity leave options may also help lower the impact of children on career advancement, or the [[motherhood penalty]]. There currently exists a "family gap" between the pay of mothers and nonmothers. In the United States prior to the passage of the FMLA, mothers typically earned 70% of men's wages while nonmothers earned 90%.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt; These earning disparities partially stemmed from insecure employment return prospects. Women without maternity leave protection were often forced to start over with a new employer following their absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazear|first=E.|title=Agency, Earnings Profiles, Productivity, and Hours Restrictions|journal=American Economic Review|year=1981|pages=606–620}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interrupted their career progression and burdened them with the additional task of seeking new employment. Such factors ultimately impeded equitable access to income and career opportunities. Women as a group notably experience increasing [[income inequality]] as they age illustrating the impact of motherhood on their wage prospects. However, the implementation of FMLA addressed some of these impediments through the introduction of mandatory maternity leave. Mothers now are more likely to return to their previous employer due to this increased legal protection.&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt; The policy minimizes some of the negative externalities of motherhood by maintaining women's employment options even following maternity leave. Many policy experts though suspect that the remaining gender imbalance is largely attributable to the dearth of paid leave options.&lt;ref name="w" /&gt; Women who worked for companies that provided paid maternity leave before they gave birth are more likely to take such leave for up to 12 weeks, and more likely to return to work more quickly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Lawrence M.|last2=Waldfogel|first2=Jane|title=Maternity leave and the employment of new mothers in the United States|journal=Journal of Population Economics|date=1 June 2004|volume=17|issue=2|pages=331–349|doi=10.1007/s00148-003-0159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===

====Access equality====
American family policy perpetuates inequalities as many [[low-income]] women lack access to maternity leave. Under the current FMLA system, approximately 40% of United States workers are ineligible for benefits due to the brevity of their tenure or the smallness of their firm.&lt;ref name="grs" /&gt; These excluded populations are often low-waged and minority women thus furthering their already present disadvantage. Moreover, the unpaid aspect of the current policy limits access to those who are economically well off. The United States Department of Labor reported that over a 22-month period in 1999 and 2000, 3.5 million people needed leave but were unable to take it due to affordability concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Department of Labor|title=Balancing the Needs of Families and Employees: FMLA Survey Report|year=2000|url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/asp/public/fmla/main2000.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of monetary compensation may hinder the ability of women who are not as financially secure as others to balance employment with their family life.

==Paternity leave==

California is the first state to offer paid paternity leave weeks (six weeks, partial payment). New Jersey, Rhode Island, and New York&lt;ref name="paidfamilyleave.ny.gov"&gt;{{cite web |date=July 2018 |url=https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/paid-family-leave-information-employees#eligibility |title=Paid Family leave: Information for employee |publisher=New York |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; since passed laws for paid family leave. In the rest of the US, paternity pay weeks are not offered (therefore neither paternity paid leave weeks), but fathers have access to unpaid paternity leave to care for their newborns (without new income).&lt;ref name="babycenter.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Last updated: November 2015 |url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_paternity-leave-what-are-the-options-for-dads_8258.bc |title=Paternity leave: What are the options for dads? |publisher=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/ilo-bookstore/order-online/books/WCMS_242615/lang--en/index.htm |title=Maternity and paternity at work: Law and practice across the world |publisher=Ilo.org |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, fathers will take sick days or vacation time when they have newborns. There is also a growing number of fathers that go unpaid. Some employers are required by law to allow 12 weeks of unpaid family leave after the birth or adoption of a child. This law is under [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|FMLA]] or Family Medical Leave Act.&lt;ref name="babycenter.com"/&gt; Fathers who have access to paid paternity leave give mothers the opportunity to engage in paid work, with a positive effect on female labor force participation and wages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/asp/policy-development/PaternityBrief.pdf|title=Paternity Leave: Why Paternal Leave for Fathers is so Important for Working Families|last=United States Department of Labor|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military branches also show a minimal paternity leave. Although some branches give more time after the birth to take the leave, all branches give to ten days. This type of leave is only applicable to those who are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryspot.com/resources/paternity-leave-in-the-military|title=Paternity Leave in the Military - MilitarySpot.com|date=2011-02-07|work=MilitarySpot.com|access-date=2017-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer paternity leave increases the father's engagement with a child, which leads to the child's improved cognitive and mental health outcomes and fewer behavior problems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Foreign comparison==
{{see also|Parental leave#Variation in international law}} 
&lt;!--{{Out of date|[[Parental leave]]: "52 weeks. 18 to be taken by the mother, 2 weeks by the father, the rest as they see fit." (in 2014). Assume all of the time is paid (not 100%), at least Iceland has at least 12 months paid and length there is shorter and assume paid time is also not worse in Denmark.}}--&gt;
The United States maternity leave policy is distinct for its relative scarcity of benefits in comparison to other industrialized countries. Thus, the legislation imposes relatively few restrictions on American firms and instead underscores employer discretion in the shaping of maternity leave policy. These firms are thus free to offer maternity leave policies on terms that are more aligned with [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]].&lt;ref name="grs" /&gt; This United States policy differs greatly from most other western countries in terms of maternity leave provision.

These stark maternity leave differentials are demonstrated in both the policy's length and compensation. In terms of the length of protected maternity leave, the United States currently ranks 20th out of the 21 highest-income countries.&lt;ref name="grs" /&gt; The United States is one of three countries, along with [[Oman]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], that do not offer paid maternity leave. Countries that offer paid maternity leave include Mexico (12 weeks), United Kingdom (40 weeks), India (26 weeks), Chile (6 weeks before birth, 12 weeks after)http://www.dt.gob.cl/consultas/1613/w3-article-60107.html, Canada (1 year), and China (14 weeks). Although the United States does not guarantee paid maternity leave, employers may provide paid leave if they choose. There are three states in the United States that do provide paid maternity leave and they are California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="Adam Peck &amp; Bryce Covert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peck|first1=Adam|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|title=U.S. Paid Family Leave Versus The Rest Of The World, In Two Disturbing Charts|url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/07/30/3465922/paid-family-leave/|website=THINKPROGRESS|publisher=CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers usually share baby care with their husbands. Fathers can have paid week leaves if they live in California (partial paid leave). In Slovenia fathers have 12 weeks of 100% paid paternity leave. In Sweden 480 days of 80% paid paternity leave weeks. In Norway 49 weeks of 100% paid paternity leave weeks or 59 weeks of 80% paid paternity leave. Finnish fathers have 11 partial paid leave weeks.&lt;ref name="ilo.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forsakringskassan.se/arbetsgivare/foralder/!ut/p/a1/hc-xDoIwEAbgZ2Fg7R0YTHGDRESjk4PYxZRYClopaSu8vpC4mCjedsn3578DBgWwlveN5K7RLVfTzpYXGuIhTYME6REpbuM8XmdxuMlpNILzCPDHJPgvfwI2R4IsfIOZih2w6k64KYWzsum5EaTShqurMNN9SVsuqARmRCWMMORpxr9q5zq78tHHYRiI1FoqQazw8Vui1tZB8QGhexR4i1S_TzzvBa-U_cY!/dl5/d5/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBLzRKVXBDQSEhL2Vu/?keepNavState=true |title=Individuals - Försäkringskassan |publisher=Forsakringskassan.se |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Media Piracy in Emerging Economies''''' is a report released by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in 2011. It contends that “high prices for media goods, low incomes, and cheap digital technologies are the main ingredients of global media piracy. If piracy is ubiquitous in most parts of the world, it is because these conditions are ubiquitous.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/report-piracy-a-global-pricing-problem-with-only-one-solution.ars Report: Piracy a "global pricing problem" with only one solution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Cory Doctorow]] commented that "This report and its researchers are rare examples of academic rigour in a world of special pleading and cooked industry statistics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/03/why-poor-countries-lead-world-piracy Why poor countries lead the world in piracy | Technology | guardian.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computerworld]]'' UK blogger [[Glyn Moody]] wrote that "Given the scope and rigour of this report, I think it will go down as a decisive moment when the discourse around piracy changed fundamentally, with the content industries being forced, finally, to explain and justify their methodologies, rather than simply stating their claimed results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2011/03/finally-calling-time-on-piracy-fud/index.htm Finally Calling Time on Piracy FUD - Open Enterprise&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104184732/http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2011/03/finally-calling-time-on-piracy-fud/index.htm |date=2011-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuters]]' blogger [[Felix Salmon]] also hailed it as "The best report ever on media piracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/29/the-best-report-ever-on-media-piracy/ The best report ever on media piracy | Felix Salmon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian academic [[Michael Geist]], writing in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', found that "While setting the record straight on piracy myths is valuable, the report's most important contribution comes from chronicling how piracy is primarily a function of [[market failure]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/article/956637--geist-canadian-backed-report-says-music-movie-and-software-piracy-is-a-market-failure-not-a-legal-one Geist: Canadian-backed report says music, movie, and software piracy is a market failure, not a legal one - thestar.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilberto Gil]], former culture minister of Brazil, was quoted saying the study is “required reading for anyone concerned with copyright and enforcement, or with the challenges of cultural globalization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurope.eu/articles/107545.php 'Landmark' media piracy study re-released to public]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[New Europe (newspaper)|New Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Magellan Media's founder Brian O'Leary&lt;!-- not the astronaut--&gt; invited to comment by [[O'Reilly Radar]] blogger Jenn Webb, was only in partial agreement with the report, noting that "Concerns about convenience, availability and usability (the absence of onerous rights restrictions) factor into individual decisions about what and whether to pirate media products. This doesn't refute the Social Science Research Council's claim that higher prices in lower-wealth countries can lead to piracy. It does suggest that it may not be enough to just lower prices. I do agree fully with the SSRC's conclusion that enforcement has limited impact."&lt;ref&gt;[http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/03/piracy-price-manifesto.html Piracy isn't just about price - O'Reilly Radar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]'''s Nate Anderson emphasized that the SSRC "report debunks alleged link between piracy and terrorism" put forward by a 2009 report of the [[RAND Corporation]] and funded by the motion picture business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/even-commercial-pirates-now-have-to-compete-with-free.ars Major report debunks alleged link between piracy and terrorism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''offshore trust''' is a conventional [[Trust law|trust]] that is formed under the [[law]]s of an [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdiction]].

Generally offshore trusts are similar in nature and effect to their onshore counterparts; they involve a [[settlor]] transferring (or 'settling') assets (the 'trust property') on the [[trustee]]s to manage for the benefit of a person, class or persons (the '[[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]]') or, occasionally, an abstract purpose. However, a number of offshore jurisdictions have modified their laws to make their jurisdictions more attractive to settlors forming offshore structures as trusts. [[Liechtenstein]], a civil jurisdiction which is sometimes considered to be offshore, has artificially imported the trust concept from [[common law]] jurisdictions by [[statute]].

== Uses of offshore trusts ==
Official statistics on trusts are difficult to come by as in most offshore jurisdictions (and in most onshore jurisdictions), trusts are not required to be registered, however, it is thought that the most common use of offshore trusts is as part of the tax and financial planning of wealthy individuals and their families. For instance, the founder of [[Wonga.com]], [[Errol Damelin]] holds his shares through Castle Bridge Ventures, a trust based in the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;"Wonga sets £1.2bn target" by Simon Duke in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''Business'' section, 10 November 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While the family behind the [[Nando's]] restaurant chain, the Enthovens, reportedly use trusts in the Channel Islands as part of their financial planning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/10/nandos-using-secretive-tax-haven-trust-avoid-inheritance-tax-bills Nando's using secretive tax haven trust to avoid inheritance tax bills] by David Leigh, James Ball and Leila Haddou, theguardian.com, 10 July 2014. Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Other users of offshore trusts include [[Sir Ken Morrison]], the British supermarket magnate, the [[Lord Rothermere|Rothermere]] family who own the [[Daily Mail]] group and the late [[Bruce Gyngell]] who founded  [[TV-am]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/10/whos-who-britain-legal-offshore-tax-avoidance-james-dyson A who's who of Britain's legal offshore tax avoidance] by David Leigh, [[theguardian.com]], 10 July 2014. Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, offshore trusts have other uses too:
* Offshore trusts are also sometimes formed as [[unit trusts]] to operate as a [[mutual fund]].
* Offshore trusts are often used as part of an [[orphan structure]] in [[capital markets]] or trade finance transactions.
* Pan-national non-governmental bodies are sometimes established as offshore trusts. For example, the [[International Cricket Council]] is formed in the [[British Virgin Islands]].

==Types of offshore trusts==
Below are the most common types of trusts:

A '''Revocable Offshore Trust''' is a trust which can be liquidated or altered by the settlor according to the terms, that are set out in the Trust Deed.

In an '''Irrevocable Offshore Trust''' may not be changed or liquidated by the settlor.

A '''[[Discretionary trust|Discretionary Offshore Trust]]''' enables the trustee to decide on the distribution of profits for different classes of beneficiaries.

In a '''Fixed trust''', the distribution of income to the beneficiaries is fixed and can not be changed by trustee.

A '''Hybrid Trust''' includes elements of discretionary and fixed trust.

==The benefits of an offshore trust&lt;ref&gt;Gorbunov A.R. Offshornyy biznes i sozdanie kompaniy za rubezhom. 2-e izd., pererab. i dop. M.:Ankil: INFRA-M, 1995. 160 s.&lt;/ref&gt;==
* '''Confidentiality and anonymity''': Despite the fact that an offshore trust is officially registered in the government, the parties of the trust, assets, and the conditions of the trust are not recorded in the register .
* '''Tax-exempt status''': Assets that are transferred to an offshore trust (in a tax-exempt offshore zone) are not taxed either when transferred to the trust, or when transferred or redistributed to the beneficiaries.
* '''The ability to transfer assets in a short time and without high costs''': The transfer of property inherited through an offshore trust does not require the approval of a judge or the high cost of a lawyer.
* '''Asset protection''': The Trust protects assets from forced transfer by inheritance, from seizure in divorce and bankruptcy.
* '''Accumulation of capital''': The trust can own commercial enterprises, open bank accounts, participate in international investment projects, and its revenues will accumulate in one of the tax-free offshore zones.
* '''Reliability''': The capital will be safe from a financially, politically and economically unstable world.
* '''Versatility''': In the trust, you can transfer any assets - cash, real estate, business, stocks, intellectual property rights and etc.

== Rule against perpetuities ==
Trusts in general are subject to the [[rule against perpetuities]] which, in practical terms, puts limits on the length of time within which all trust property must be distributed.  Because of the strictures of the rule, a number of trusts have been struck down in wildly hypothetical circumstances because of possible infringement of the rule (e.g., the ''[[fertile octogenarian]]'').

Most offshore jurisdictions which have sophisticated trust laws have modified their laws relating to perpetuity to allow settlor to select lengthy, fixed, perpetuity periods, to avoid the use of [[Royal lives clause|"Royal lives" clauses]].  Many have also adopted "wait and see" laws, which mean that trusts which might potentially infringe the rule against perpetuities are no longer automatically invalid, but instead the trust remains valid unless and until the perpetuity period is breached.

In Jersey, the rule against perpetual trusts has actually been abolished entirely.  This has also been done in a number of U.S. states.

== Management of underlying companies ==
Trusts in general are subject to the rule in ''[[Bartlett v Barclays Bank]]'' which provides (briefly) that where trust property includes the [[Stock|shares]] of a [[Company (law)|company]], then the trustees must take a positive role in the affairs on the company.  The rule has been [[Bartlett v Barclays Bank|criticised]], but remains part of trust law in many common law jurisdictions.

A number of offshore jurisdictions (notably the [[Cayman Islands]], with STAR trusts, and the [[British Virgin Islands]], with VISTA trusts) have created special forms of trust that may be expressly settled without imposing an obligation of the trustees to interfere in management in this way.

Paradoxically, these specialised forms of trusts seem to infrequently be used in relation to their original intended uses.  STAR trusts seem to be used more frequently by [[hedge fund]]s forming [[mutual fund]]s as [[unit trust]]s (where the fund managers wish to eliminate any obligation to attend meetings of the companies in whose securities they invest) and VISTA trusts are frequently used as a part of [[orphan structure]]s in [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issues where the trustees wish to divorce themselves from supervising the issuing vehicle.

Critics in onshore jurisdictions have suggested that these specialised trusts have provisions that so fundamentally undermine the nature of a trust that they should not be recognised in an onshore jurisdiction, but whatever the view of onshore tax authorities and regulators, it seems unlikely that the courts in onshore jurisdictions would be prepared to derogate from the [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition]].

== Asset protection ==
{{Main|Asset-protection trust}}
Certain jurisdictions (notably the [[Cook Islands]], but the [[Bahamas]] also has a species of asset protection trust) have provided special trusts which are styled as [[Asset-protection trusts|asset protection trusts]].  While all trusts have an [[asset protection]] element, some jurisdictions have enacted laws trying to make life difficult for creditors to press claims against the trust (for example, by providing for particularly short limitation periods).  In practice, the effectiveness of such trusts is limited as the [[bankruptcy]] and/or [[divorce]] laws in the settlor's home jurisdiction will usually operate to set aside transfers to the trusts, and most jurisdictions (including offshore jurisdictions) set aside [[fraudulent conveyance|transactions entered into defraud creditors]].

== Powers of investment ==
Most traditional jurisdictions only permit trustees to make very conservative financial [[investments]].  Most offshore jurisdictions give trustees flexibility and permit (or allow the settlor to specify in the [[trust instrument]] that they are permitted) a wider range of investments, including higher risk investments such as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[futures contract]]s and specific investments, such as an investment into a small private company, in any area of the world.

== Purpose trusts ==
Whilst in most common law jurisdictions, trusts must either be formed for the benefit of persons, or charitable purposes, many offshore jurisdictions have also amended their laws to permit trusts to be formed for [[purpose trust|non-charitable purposes]].  Such trusts need to enforce a "protector" to be able to enforce the terms of the trust, but doubt remains as to who should be treated as the beneficial owner of the trust funds for tax purposes prior to its distribution.

No offshore jurisdiction yet appears to have made a serious effort to expand upon the flexibility of [[discretionary trust]]s in relation to certainty of objects, as expounded in ''[[McPhail v Doulton]]''.  This may be because the common law rules are now considered to be sufficiently flexible to make no widening necessary to attract trust business.

==Anachronistic common law rules==
Many offshore jurisdictions have also legislated to abolish certain anachronistic common law rules which sometimes cause difficulty for trust planning.  These include:
* [[Rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth|Rule in ''Howe v Earl of Dartmouth'']]
* [[Rule in Maloney v Alveranga|Rule in ''Maloney v Alveranga'']]
* [[Rule in Re Atkinson|Rule in ''Re Atkinson'']]

The '''Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR)''' is an online project launched by the [[European Commission]] under the [[IDABC]] programme, to support the distribution and re-use of [[software]] developed by or for [[public sector]] administrations across Europe, connecting [[European Union|EU]] services and Member States.

In December 2011, the OSOR.eu and [[Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe|SEMIC.eu]] communities moved to a new collaborative platform - [[Joinup collaboration platform|Joinup]]. The reason for the migration to Joinup was to provide public administrations in Europe with better communication and collaboration tools, to share experiences with interoperability solutions for public administrations, to increase the number of users and to leverage synergies between the OSOR.eu and SEMIC.eu user communities, while optimising the use of public funding.

==About the platform==
The OSOR.eu platform aims to support and encourage the re-use of publicly financed [[Open source software|Open Source Software]] developments (OSS or FLOSS for "Free, Libre &amp; Open Source Software") that are of particular use for public administrations in Europe.
OSOR.eu aims to support the collaborative development of OSS applications and solutions, in particular cross-border collaboration and exchange of knowledge or software.

==Services==
All of OSOR's services are now available on [[Joinup collaboration platform|Joinup.eu]]:

*A central pan-European '''information point''' on OSS including news, events, [[Case study|case studies]] and [[newsletter]]s about on-going initiatives, projects, new applications and developments in European Members States and across the world, as well as advice/guidelines and best practice exchanges concerning the use of OSS.
*A '''repository and registry''' providing visibility to European OSS projects and initiatives in public administrations, allowing users to upload and download, search and retrieve software and documentation. It facilitates mutual access to existing projects through a dedicated [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and therefore creates more opportunities to develop exchanges, re-usability and community building across borders.
*A collaborative cross-border '''development environment''' providing technical, organisational and legal support. It enables collaborative development and sharing/exchange of experience and software by providing facilities for the collaborative creation of content - including a "forge", discussion forums, blogs.

==Bodies behind the project==

The OSOR project is financed by the European Union, managed by the European Commission under the [[Directorate-General for Informatics]] (DIGIT), and supported by the Member States' national, regional and local administrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10403">{{UStaxation}}
For purposes of [[income tax in the United States]], [[U.S. person]]s owning shares of a '''passive foreign investment company''' ('''PFIC''') may choose between (i) current taxation on the income of the PFIC or (ii) deferral of such income subject to a deemed tax and interest regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_P_40_VI.html 26 USC 1291-1298].&lt;/ref&gt;  The provision was enacted as part of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] as a way of placing owners of offshore investment funds on a similar footing to owners of U.S. investment funds ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_M.html regulated investment companies]).&lt;ref&gt;See the Conference Committee Report pages II-640, et seq., on Section 1235 of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The original provisions applied for all foreign corporations meeting either an income or an asset test.  However, 1997 amendments&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c105:1:./temp/~c105CrzhmS:e583208: Section 1121 of  PL 105-34].&lt;/ref&gt; limited the application in the case of U.S. Shareholders of [[controlled foreign corporation]]s.

==Definition==
Any foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation meeting either the income test or the asset test is a PFIC with respect to each shareholder when the test is met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1297- 26 USC 1297].&lt;/ref&gt;  PFIC status applies separately for each U.S. person owning shares, and also separately with respect to shares acquired at different times.  PFIC status does not, itself, have any impact on the foreign corporation or foreign shareholders.

The ''income test'' is met if 75% or more of the foreign corporation's gross income is passive income, defined as [[foreign personal holding company]] income with modifications.

The ''asset test'' is met if 50% or more of the foreign corporation's average assets (as defined in the IR Code) produce, or could produce passive income, or are assets (such as cash and bare land) that produce no income.  The test is applied based on the foreign corporation's adjusted basis, for U.S. tax purposes, of the assets, or at the election of the particular shareholder, fair market values of the assets.

Look-thru of 25% subsidiaries:  Interests in 25% or more owned foreign corporations are treated similarly to partnership interests (i.e., looked through) for the income test and the asset test.

( 2 tests - income test 75%; asset test - 50%)

==Effect of PFIC status==
If a U.S. person receives income from a PFIC or recognizes gain from disposition of shares of a 1291 fund, such person is subject to a tax and interest regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1291- 26 USC 1291].&lt;/ref&gt;  A shareholder may elect out of this regime (see QEF below).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_P_40_VI_50_B.html 26 USC 1293-5].&lt;/ref&gt;  The regime applies only to any distribution or gain in excess of 125% of the average distributions for the prior three years.  This regime is as follows:
First, such income or gain (in excess of the 125%) is allocated pro rata to each day of the person's holding period for the particular shares.
Next, the amounts allocated to prior years after 1986 are excluded from current year taxable income.
Then tax is computed on amounts allocated to each prior year at the maximum rate of tax applicable to the type of taxpayer for such year (prior year tax).
Then interest is computed on such prior year tax as if it were an underpayment of tax (interest charge).
Finally, current year tax is increased by the aggregate of prior year tax amounts and interest charge amounts.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this aggregate amount is considered the amount of tax for the year for purposes of penalty and interest calculations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest charges are computed using compound interest on an April 15 to April 15 basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6622- 26 USC 6622].&lt;/ref&gt;  Given a sufficiently long holding period, the tax and back-interest will exceed 100%.  However, the shareholder may avoid &gt;100% tax by periodically selling and repurchasing his holdings, using the after-tax proceeds to repurchase shares.

Shareholders of a PFIC (including a QEF) are eligible for [[foreign tax credit]] with respect to the current and deemed prior year taxes, including the deemed paid credit for 10% corporate shareholders of the PFIC.

==Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) election==

Each U.S. person owning shares of a PFIC may elect to include their share of the ordinary income and net capital gains of the PFIC(similar to shareholders of a mutual fund), provided that the PFIC issues the necessary PFIC annual information statement. The PFIC annual information statement is a rough equivalent of Form 1099.  This election is effective for the year in which the election is made and all subsequent years.  The tax and interest regime is avoided to the extent this election applies.

This election helps U.S. persons holding shares of a PFIC by treating the income earned through the PFIC similar to other US entities. For example, shareholders of corporations are usually subject to U.S. tax only when the income is distributed.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch01.html#en_US_publink100010035 IRS Publication 550]. However, significant exceptions apply, such as for shareholders of S Corporations, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_S.html 26 USC 1361, et seq].&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, shareholders of a U.S. mutual fund are subject to tax on their pro rata share of ordinary income and capital gains of the mutual fund.

QEF status applies only to the shares of a particular shareholder acquired during a tax year for which the QEF election was in force, assuming that the QEF election remains in place throughout the holding period.  Such status does not apply to other shareholders or to persons acquiring the particular shares.

QEF status fully avoids the tax and interest regime only if it is effective from the beginning of the share's holding period.  If a shareholder elects QEF status for particular shares at a date later than the acquisition date, one of three additional elections may be made to "purge" PFIC status for prior years.  The shareholder may make one of two gain recognition elections (deemed sale and mark to market) or, if the shareholder is a corporation, a deemed dividend election.  In each case, the gain or deemed dividend recognized under the election is subject to the tax and interest regime.

==Mark to market==
A shareholder of a PFIC may also elect each year to recognize gain or loss on the shares as if he, she or it had sold the PFIC shares at fair market value, although gains are taxed as ordinary income. Losses generate ordinary income deductions to the extent they reverse prior gains, on a share-by-share basis, after which they are claimed on US schedule D. Such election is available only for shares the market value of which is readily determinable (e.g., regularly traded shares). Shares subject to this election are not subject to the tax and interest regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1296- 26 USC 1296].&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, this election is independent of prior PFIC elections (i.e. QEF or Sect 1291 election). for example: If stock X was purchased in 2007 for $100, has a FMV on December 31, 2011, of $120, and no PFIC forms were filed until 2011 (when Sect 1296- Mark-to-market- election was made), no PFIC filings would be needed for the prior years as long as distributions were less than 125% and no capital gains occurred. For the current year, 8621 would be filed using Mark to market and the ordinary income would be $20.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.1296-1 3 b.iii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordination with CFC rules==
U.S. Shareholders (generally 10% or more owners) of a [[controlled foreign corporation]] (CFC) are not subject to the tax and interest regime with respect to any share which was not a share of a PFIC at any time before 1997.  Such shareholders are, instead, subject to the CFC rules.&lt;ref&gt;Note that a U.S. person owning shares of a foreign corporation which were held prior to 1997 faces the risk that the CFC was a PFIC before 1997.  See note above.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting and making elections==
Each U.S. person owning shares of a PFIC is required to file IRS [https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html?value=8621&amp;criteria=formNumber&amp;submitSearch=Find Form 8621].  Such form is used to report actual distributions and gain, as well as income and gains under a QEF election.  Such form is also used to make the QEF and purging elections described above.  Failure to file such form in a year in which no income is properly reported does not carry specific penalties, but may render the return incomplete and potentially subject to tolling of the statute of limitations.

A '''poll tax''' is a [[tax]] levied as a fixed sum on every liable individual. Although often associated with states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], poll taxes were also in place in some northern and western states, including [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Vermont]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=State of Maine Special Tax Commission |first= |authorlink = |title =Report of the Special Tax Commission of Maine |publisher =Burleigh &amp; Flynt |volume = |edition = |date =1890 |location =Maine |pages =39–41 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poll taxes had been a major source of government funding among the colonies which formed the United States. Poll taxes made up from one-third to one-half of the tax revenue of colonial Massachusetts. Various privileges of citizenship, including voter registration or issuance of driving licenses and resident hunting and fishing licenses, were conditioned on payment of poll taxes to encourage collection of this tax revenue. Property taxes assumed a larger share of tax revenues as land values rose when population increases encouraged settlement of the American west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bullock |first=Charles J. |year=1916 |title=The Taxation of Property and Income in Massachusetts |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–61 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.2307/1885988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western states found no need for poll tax requirements; but poll taxes and payment incentives remained in eastern states, and some links to voter registration were modified following the [[American Civil War]] until court action following ratification of the [[24th Amendment]] in 1964.

==Voter registration==
Payment of a poll tax was a prerequisite to the registration for voting in a number of [[U.S. state|states]] until 1966. The tax emerged in some states of the United States in the late 19th century as part of the [[Jim Crow laws]]. After the right to vote was extended to all races by the enactment of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], a number of states enacted poll tax laws as a device for restricting voting rights. The laws often included a [[grandfather clause]], which allowed any adult male whose father or grandfather had voted in a specific year prior to the abolition of slavery to vote without paying the tax. These laws, along with unfairly implemented [[literacy tests]] and extra-legal intimidation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieved the desired effect of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[African-American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] voters, as well as [[poor white]]s.

Proof of payment of a poll tax was a prerequisite to voter registration in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia (1877), North and South Carolina, Virginia (until 1882 and again from 1902 with its new constitution),&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21601.htm|title=Virginia's Constitutional Convention of 1901–1902|accessdate=2006-09-14|publisher=Virginia Historical Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002030244/http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21601.htm|archivedate=2 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dabney" &gt;{{cite book |last=Dabney|first=Virginius|authorlink=Virginius Dabney|title=Virginia, The New Dominion|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1971|pages=436–437|isbn=0-8139-1015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas (1902).&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html "Historical Barriers to Voting"], in ''Texas Politics'', University of Texas, accessed 4 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas poll tax "required otherwise eligible voters to pay between $1.50 and $1.75 to register to vote – a lot of money at the time, and a big barrier to the working classes and poor."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt; Georgia created a cumulative poll tax requirement in 1877: men of any race 21 to 60 years of age had to pay a sum of money for every year from the time they had turned 21, or from the time that the law took effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=1 "Atlanta in the Civil Rights Movement", Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll tax requirements applied to whites as well as blacks, and also adversely affected poor citizens. The laws that allowed the poll tax did not specify a certain group of people.&lt;ref name=jstor3069935&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkerson-Freeman |first1=Sarah |title=The Second Battle for Woman Suffrage: Alabama White Women, the Poll Tax, and V. O. Key's Master Narrative of Southern Politics |journal=The Journal of Southern History |volume=68 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=333–74 |jstor=3069935 |doi=10.2307/3069935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that anyone, including white women, could also be discriminated against when they went to vote. One example is in Alabama where white women were discriminated against and then organized to secure their right to vote. One group of women that did this was Women's Joint Legislative Council of Alabama (WJLC).&lt;ref name=jstor3069935/&gt; African American women also organized in groups against being denied voting rights. One African American woman sued the county with the help of the NAACP. She sued for her right to vote as she was stopped from even registering to vote. As a result of her suing the county the mailman did not deliver her mail for quite some time.&lt;ref name="Jones-Branch, Cherisse 2006. pp. 204-224"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones-Branch |first1=Cherisse |date=July 2006 |title='To Speak When and Where I Can': African American Women's Political Activism in South Carolina in the 1940s and 1950s |journal=The South Carolina Historical Magazine |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=204–24 |jstor=27570823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with complex record-keeping requirements.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book

The poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks, who did not then have suffrage.&lt;ref name=Pildes&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pildes |first1=Richard H. |title=Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon |journal=Constitutional Commentary |volume=17 |year=2000 |ssrn=224731 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.224731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial challenge==
In 1937, in ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]],'' 302 U.S. 277 (1937), the [[United States Supreme Court]] found that a prerequisite that poll taxes be paid for registration to vote was constitutional. The case involved the Georgia poll tax of $1. Georgia abolished its poll tax in 1945.&lt;ref name="Novotny2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|title=This Georgia Rising: Education, Civil Rights, and the Politics of Change in Georgia in The 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Li_lnmeAG0C&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=9780881460889|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida repealed its poll tax in 1937.&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;{{cite book

The 24th Amendment, ratified in 1964, abolished the use of the poll tax (or any other tax) as a pre-condition for voting in federal elections,&lt;ref name="Jillson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jillson|first=Cal|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=6 January 2013|date=2011-02-22|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415890601|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made no mention of poll taxes in state elections.

In the 1966 case of ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]],'' the Supreme Court reversed its decision in ''Breedlove v. Suttles'' to also include state elections as violating the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] to the United States Constitution.

The ''Harper'' ruling was one of several that relied on the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment rather than the more direct provision of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]]. In a two-month period in the spring of 1966, Federal courts declared unconstitutional poll tax laws in the last four states that still had them, starting with [[Texas]] on 9 February. Decisions followed for [[Alabama]] (3 March) and [[Virginia]] (25 March). [[Mississippi]]'s $2.00 poll tax (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1966|r=2}}}} in 2013) was the last to fall, declared unconstitutional on 8 April 1966, by a federal panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Harry |editor1-last=Hansen |year=1966 |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts: 1966 |publisher=New York World-Telegram |oclc=277006640 |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia attempted to partially abolish its poll tax by requiring a residence certification, but the Supreme Court rejected the arrangement in 1965 in ''[[Harman v. Forssenius]]''  380 US 528|1965

'''Revised Statutes''' is a term used in some common law jurisdictions for a collection of statutes that have been revised to incorporate amendments, repeals and consolidations.  It is not a change to the law, but designed to make the body of statutes more accessible.

Statute revisions have occurred in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United States]].  In federal states, statute revisions can occur at both the federal level, and the state or provincial level.

'''Rick Falkvinge''' (born '''Dick Greger Augustsson''' on 21 January 1972) is a Swedish [[information technology]] [[entrepreneur]] and founder of the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]].&lt;ref name=ne&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Rickard (Rick) Falkvinge | encyclopedia=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] | language=Swedish | url=http://www.ne.se/rickard-rick-falkvinge | accessdate=30 January 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a political evangelist with the party, spreading the ideas across the world.&lt;ref name=stepdown-2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkvinge|first=Rick|title=After five years, I'm stepping down as party leader|url=https://falkvinge.net/2011/01/01/after-five-years-im-stepping-down-as-party-leader/|work=Falkvinge on Infopolicy|accessdate=Jan 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Youth and early career ==

Falkvinge grew up in Ruddalen, [[Gothenburg]], and studied Natural Sciences at [[Göteborgs Högre Samskola]]. During his high school years, he was active in ''Moderat Skolungdom'' and ''Moderata Ungdomsförbundet'', the youth wings of the [[Moderate Party (Sweden)|Moderaterna]] party in Sweden. His passion for technology was visible at an early age, and he would spend time as a toddler just pressing doorbell buttons in electronics stores.&lt;ref name=fokus-2009&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fokus.se/2009/06/hjarnan-bakom-piraterna/ |title=Fokus » Hjärnan bakom piraterna |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |last=Lönegård |first=Claes |date=June 5, 2009 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=piraterna&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rydell |first1=Anders |last2=Sundberg |first2=Sam |title=Piraterna: De svenska fildelarna som plundrade Hollywood |date=February 2009 |url=http://www.ordfront.se/Bocker/Nyabocker/Piraterna.aspx |language=Swedish |isbn=978-91-7037-320-6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119004506/http://ordfront.se/Bocker/Nyabocker/Piraterna.aspx |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first computer was a [[Commodore VIC-20]], where he wasn't content just pressing its buttons, but also opened it up and took it apart, to study its inner workings. He learned how to disable the system calls, and learned all relevant memory positions. His interest for computers as a technological phenomenon was as large as his fascination for the possibility of using computers as tools. He has likened this to [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts and their interest for the technology and its applications alike.&lt;ref name=piraterna /&gt;

His VIC-20 would soon be replaced by a [[Commodore 64]], the most sold computer model ever. He started swapping files early, and continued the [[mixtape]] tradition with his friends, only using disks instead. He started attending [[copyparty|copyparties]], where people brought their computer and a box of disks, and copied files between one another: images, games, texts, programs.&lt;ref name=piraterna /&gt;

Falkvinge created his first company, Infoteknik (literally ''Infotechnology''), in 1988 at the age of 16.&lt;ref name="fokus-2009"/&gt; The inefficiency in administrative business tasks irritated him, and he wanted to digitize the world.&lt;ref name=piraterna /&gt;

In 1994 to 1998, he was active as an [[entrepreneur]] with five employees&lt;ref name=fokus-2009 /&gt; in [[software development]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Kalmar]] and [[Strömsund]].

Having grown tired of snide remarks about his first name Dick, and above all what he calls the [[moralism]] among systems developers who would make it impossible for him to even use his real name online, he changed his first name in 2004 from Dick to Rickard, with just Rick for short. As he changed his first name, he also changed his last name from Augustsson to the current Falkvinge (literally ''Falconwing''). He wanted a unique last name describing his character. He has always been fascinated by birds, and thinks that large raptors symbolize pride, freedom, and vision.&lt;ref name=SvD-April-27-2010&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/idagsidan/samhalle/rekordmanga-vill-byta-namn_4619733.svd |title=Rekordmånga vill byta namn, Trender i tiden|accessdate=April 27, 2010 |last=Lagerblad |first=Anna |date=April 27, 2010 |newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Pirate Party ==

{{main|Pirate Party (Sweden)}}

In the Fall of 2005, Rick Falkvinge started to consider creating a political party focused on the issues of [[file sharing]], [[copyright]], and [[patents]]. The dominating Swedish organization in the copyright debate at this time was the [[Piratbyrån|Pirate Bureau]], which was not affiliated with any party. On 16 December 2005, Falkvinge registered the [[domain name|domain]] name ''piratpartiet.se'' (literally ''The Pirate Party''), and on 1 January 2006, the party's web site was launched through a message on a [[Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]] hub, signaling the start of the petition to register a new political party in Sweden.&lt;ref name=ppse-history&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirate Party History |url=http://www.piratpartiet.se/historia |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011235423/http://www.piratpartiet.se/historia |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the party, the site got three million hits in the first two days,&lt;ref name=ppse-history /&gt; and in the morning of 2 January, the newspaper [[Dagens Industri]] published a notice about the initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mattias |first=Henningsson |title=Piratparti siktar på riksdagen |url=http://di.se/Default.aspx?pid=76266__ArticlePageProvider |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |newspaper=Dagens Industri |date=January 2, 2006 |language=Swedish }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a longer article in the tabloid [[Aftonbladet]] after lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carron|first=Mia|title=Pirater bildar parti|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article342138.ab|accessdate=June 12, 2010|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=January 2, 2006|first2=Caroline|last2=Olsson|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falkvinge took out a large bank loan, quit his job at Cypak, and started working with building the Pirate Party full-time.&lt;ref name=piraterna /&gt;

=== Raid against The Pirate Bay ===

{{main|The Pirate Bay raid}}

Following the raid on [[The Pirate Bay]] on 31 May 2006, Falkvinge mobilized every part of the Pirate Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|pages=115–116|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the protests that followed on June 3, he held his first widely translated and acclaimed speech, "Nothing new under the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|page=125|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henning|last=Bartels|title=Die Piratenpartei|year=2009|pages=32–36|publisher=Contumax-Verlag|language=German|isbn=3-86199-001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkvinge|first=Rick|title=Det finns inget nytt under solen|url=https://forum.piratpartiet.se/showthread.php?t=2828&amp;page=1|publisher=Pirate Party forums|accessdate=30 May 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week that followed the raid, Falkvinge was on the TV news daily, and Pirate Party membership tripled from 2,200 to 6,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|pages=147–148|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General elections in 2006 ===

{{main|Swedish general election, 2006}}

In the general elections in 2006, the Pirate Party achieved 0.63%. Falkvinge was noticeably downcast when the exit polls arrived during the election night party, but promised the gathered people that this would not be the end of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|pages=143–153|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One number that gave a bit of hope was that the mock-up school elections gave the Pirate Party 4.5%, showing that the party had a potential future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|page=153|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic hardship ===

On 29 December 2008, Falkvinge published a letter on his blog, stating that he was no longer able to pay his rent as the bank loan he had used to cover his work for the Pirate Party had run out, and that he had run out of additional credit. At the time, the Pirate Party did not have a strong enough economy to hire someone, and therefore, he asked the members of the party to donate money to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkvinge|first=Rick|title=En ovanlig begäran|url=https://falkvinge.net/2008/12/29/en-ovanlig-begaran/|work=falkvinge.net|accessdate=December 29, 2008|date=December 29, 2008|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the Pirate Party while living off of donations and charity from supporters for 18 months,&lt;ref name=lever-pa-att-tigga-2009&gt;{{cite news|last=Sjölund|first=Jill|title=Lever på att tigga|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/euvalet/article11855131.ab|newspaper=Aftonbladet|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he was hired by the European Parliament following entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerpner|first=Joachim|title=Nu anställer han sig själv|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article5432946.ab|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=26 June 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Success in European Elections ===

{{main|European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)}}

The success in the European Elections in 2009, where the Pirate Party achieved 7.13% under his leadership, catapulted Falkvinge and the top candidate [[Christian Engström]] onto every newspaper front page in the country, as well as making the top news on CNN, headlines on BBC, Reuters and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rydell|first1=Anders|last2=Sundberg|first2=Sam|title=Piraterna - historien on The Pirate Bay, Piratpartiet och Piratbyrån (Pocket)|year=2009|publisher=Ordfront Pocket|page=246|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media described the election night party as ecstatic&lt;ref name=pirat-party-2009&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerpner|first=Joachim|title=Pirat-party|url=http://aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article5333796.ab|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=8 June 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Pirate Party became the largest party by far for voters under 30, with 25% of those votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ett svenskare Europaval|url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressRelease____296193.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=Statistiska Centralbyrån|date=22 June 2010|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231010949/http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressRelease____296193.aspx|archivedate=31 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falkvinge called this success a re-ignition for the civil liberties fight in Europe and the world.&lt;ref name=pirat-party-2009 /&gt;

Not long after the European Elections, media predicted that the Pirate Party was also on its way into Swedish Parliament, as they got 3.9% support in a poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mellin|first=Lena|title=Piraterna på väg att segla in i riksdagen|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/lenamellin/article11886686.ab|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=23 June 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold for entry is 4.0%. This support did not materialize in the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]].

=== Controversies ===

During the election campaign of 2009, Falkvinge announced privately on Facebook that as he was touring the country, he was looking for women to sleep with while on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name=lever-pa-att-tigga-2009 /&gt; This was picked up by tabloids and blogs and caused a minor controversy.&lt;ref name=lever-pa-att-tigga-2009 /&gt;

In the launch of the party's election manifesto in 2010, Falkvinge caused a controversy by stating that freedom of speech and freedom of the press should take precedence over the current ban on possession of drawings potentially depicting child pornography, and that the party wanted to repeal current legislation on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johansson|first=Birgitta|title=Piratpartiet vill tillåta innehav av barnporr|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=3899644|accessdate=August 5, 2010|newspaper=Sveriges Radio|date=August 5, 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a Swedish court case where a [[manga]] researcher and translator was indicted for possession of a handful drawings as part of a very large manga collection. The [[Swedish Union of Journalists]] openly and immediately proclaimed their support for this stance, and the irrationality of a law which persecuted individuals of a crime with no victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindblom Hulthén |first=Agnetha |title=Barnporrlagen är censur |url=http://journalisten.se/nyheter/lindblom-hulthen-barnporrlagen-ar-censur |work=Journalisten |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |language=Swedish |date=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211043440/http://www.journalisten.se/artikel/24124/journalistfoerbundets-ordfoerande-barnporrlagen-aer-censur |archivedate=December 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the stance created internal controversy in the Pirate Party and Falkvinge initially backed away from his position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johansson|first=Birgitta|title=Falkvinge: "Konstaterat att vi hade fel"|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=3900433|accessdate=May 12, 2011|newspaper=Sveriges Radio|date=August 6, 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; before reiterating it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkvinge|first=Rickard|title=Three Reasons Possession Of Child Porn Must Be Re-Legalized In The Coming Decade|url=https://falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/three-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-legalized-in-the-coming-decade/|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stepping down as party leader ===

On 1 January 2011, five years after the party's foundation, Falkvinge announced that he was stepping down as party leader,&lt;ref name=stepdown-2011 /&gt; and that deputy party leader [[Anna Troberg]] would step into the role. This announcement was done during a live broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirate Party 5-year anniversary broadcast|url=http://bambuser.com/channel/Piratpartiet/broadcast/1297679|publisher=Bambuser|accessdate=30 May 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005191926/http://bambuser.com/channel/Piratpartiet/broadcast/1297679 |archivedate=5 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current career ===

Falkvinge works as a political evangelist in the Pirate Party and pirate movement at large, traveling to speak about the ideas and concepts.&lt;ref name=stepdown-2011 /&gt;

In May 2011, he started exploring [[bitcoin]] and its effects on society's economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkvinge|first=Rick|title=The Information Policy Case For Flat Tax, Basic Income|url=https://falkvinge.net/2011/05/19/the-information-policy-case-for-flat-tax-and-basic-income/|publisher=Falkvinge on Infopolicy|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was quoted by the Swedish Public Service Television ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]) as a reference in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bie|first=Nanok|title=Ny piratvaluta kan hota finanssystemen|url=http://svt.se/2.22584/1.2439316/ny_piratvaluta_kan_hota_finanssystemen|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=SVT|date=28 May 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530155031/http://svt.se/2.22584/1.2439316/ny_piratvaluta_kan_hota_finanssystemen|archivedate=30 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, it was announced that Falkvinge had accepted a full-time role as head of privacy for [[Private Internet Access]], a US-based personal [[VPN]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Internet Access and Digital Rights Activism Post|url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/21061/private-internet-access-and-digital-rights-activism-post|website=Private Internet Access|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick is heavily involved with [[Bitcoin Cash]], a Hardfork of Bitcoin as of Aug 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falkvinge|first1=Rick|title=Official Statement from the CEO of Bitcoin Cash|url=https://falkvinge.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/letter-from-the-ceo.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership style ==

Peter Santesson, Ph.D. in Political Sciences, has analyzed Falkvinge's leadership style and found it unique in Swedish politics. Falkvinge is never late to admit a mistake, and openly displays his weaknesses, acting to diminish his own authority. Among other things, Santesson refers to the episode where Falkvinge said he was flat broke and asked for donations, something that no other politician has attempted and much less succeeded with. Santesson argues that this personality, where Falkvinge takes responsibility for mistakes and admits them immediately without reservation, makes Falkvinge appear even more charismatic. Santesson compares it to techniques used in [[Pickup artist|pick-up artistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santesson|first=Peter|title=Falkvinge som påfågel|journal=Neo|date=July 2009|issue=#4, 2009|page=67|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Rick Falkvinge wrote a book called ''Swarmwise: The Tactical Manual to Changing the World'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://falkvinge.net/2013/02/14/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-one/ Swarmwise - The Tactical Manual To Changing The World. Chapter One. - Falkvinge on Infopolicy]. Falkvinge.net (2013-02-14). Retrieved on 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he describes a new kind of organization that he built in the Swedish Pirate Party, and the role of leadership in this organization.

== Awards and recognition ==

In 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]]'' shortlisted Falkvinge as one of the world's most influential people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rick Falkvinge: 2012 "TIME 100" Nominees|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2107952_2107953_2110143,00.html|accessdate=1 Jan 2013|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed Falkvinge as one of the world's Top 20 Internet Freedom Fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guardian's Open 20|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/20/twenty-fighters-open-internet|accessdate=1 Jan 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George served from 1993–1998 as a presidential appointee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], and from 2002–2009 as a member of [[the President's Council on Bioethics]].&lt;ref name="witherspoonbio"/&gt; George was appointed to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, and in the following year was elected Chairman of the Commission. He served until hitting the statutory term limit in 2016.&lt;ref name="witherspoonbio"/&gt;

==Political activity==
George twice served as Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Youth Conference, and attended the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] as an alternate delegate. He moved to the right in the 1980s, largely due to his views on [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; and left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as a result of what he saw as its increasingly strong commitment to legal abortion and its public funding, and his growing skepticism about the effectiveness of large scale government-run social welfare projects in Appalachia and other low income rural and urban areas.  George founded the [[American Principles Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanprinciplesproject.org/ |title=American Principles Project |publisher=Americanprinciplesproject.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to create a grass-roots movement around his ideas.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; He is a past chairman of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], an advocacy group opposed to [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; and co-founder of the Renewal Forum, an organization fighting the sexual trafficking and commercial exploitation of women and children.

George drafted the ''[[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]]'', a manifesto signed by Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical leaders that "promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion, embryo-destructive research or same-sex marriage."&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; He has also joined with Muslim scholar [[Hamza Yusuf|Shaykh Hamza Yusuf]] in urging hotel chains and other businesses to refrain from offering or promoting pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/07/5815/|title=Pornography, Respect, and Responsibility: A Letter to the Hotel Industry|last=George|first=Robert P.|date=July 9, 2012|website=Public Discourse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked closely with his former student Rabbi [[Meir Soloveichik]] and with Rabbi Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] of Great Britain to combat anti-Semitism in Europe. Along with other public intellectuals, George played a key role in creating the "[[Theoconservatism|theoconservative]]" movement and integrating it into mainstream Republicanism.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, Andrew. ''The Conservative Soul: How We Lost It, How to Get It Back''. New York: HarperCollins, 2006; {{ISBN|9780060188771}}.{{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of George's work on religious liberty has centered on the idea that religion is a "distinct human good," which he asserts allows people to "live authentically by ordering one's life in line with one's best judgments of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporarythinkers.org/robert-george/|title=A Guide to the Work of Robert George|website=Robert P. George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George was threatened with death by pro-choice extremist [[Theodore Shulman]], who also targeted [[Priests for Life]] director Rev. [[Frank Pavone]], saying that they would be killed if the accused killer of Dr. [[George Tiller]] (a Wichita abortion-provider) was acquitted. For his crimes, Shulman was sentenced by Federal Judge [[Paul A. Crotty]] to 41 months' imprisonment, 3 years' [[United States federal probation and supervised release#Supervised release|supervised release]], and assessed a $100 special fee.&lt;ref name = nydn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/abortion-extremist-faces-4-year-jail-term-article-1.1076120 |title=Abortion extremist faces 4-year jail term |last=Gearty |first= Robert |date=May 10, 2012 |publisher=''New York Daily News'' |access-date=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George endorsed Texas Senator [[Ted Cruz]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican presidential primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://religionnews.com/2016/03/19/conservative-catholics-endorse-ted-cruz-as-trump-alternative/ |title=Conservative Catholics endorse Ted Cruz as Trump alternative |last=Gibson |first=David |date=March 19, 2016 |publisher=''Religion News'' |access-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words, he "fiercely opposed" the candidacy of [[Donald Trump]], saying that he was "a person of poor character." In July 2017, after Trump had become president, George praised his nomination of [[Neil Gorsuch]] to the Supreme Court. However, he characterized his attempts to restrict immigration to the United States from certain countries as "unnecessary and therefore unjust." He went on to say, "One thing you have to say for President Trump is that he has been fortunate in his enemies. Although he gives them plenty to legitimately criticize him about, they always go overboard and thus discredit themselves with the very people who elected Mr. Trump and may well re-elect him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/robert-george-on-us-society-our-divisions-are-very-deep |title=Robert George on US Society:  'Our Divisions Are Very Deep' |last=Bunson |first=Matthew E. |date=July 19, 2017 |publisher=''National Catholic Register'' |access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
On December 8, 2008, George was awarded the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[George W. Bush]] in a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; His many other awards include the Honorific Medal for the Defense of Human Rights of the Republic of Poland, the [[Canterbury Medal]] of the [[Becket Fund for Religious Liberty]], the Philip Merrill Award of the [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]], the Irving Kristol Award of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the Sidney Hook Award of the [[National Association of Scholars]], the Paul Bator Award of the [[Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies|Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy]], and Princeton University's President's Award for Distinguished Teaching. He holds nineteen honorary degrees, including a Doctor Honoris Causa awarded by the Universitat [[Abat Oliba CEU University]] in Barcelona, Spain in 2017. Also in 2017, [[Baylor University]] launched the "Robert P. George Initiative in Faith, Ethics, and Public Policy," as part of its Baylor in Washington, D.C. program.

==Reception==
George has been called the "most influential conservative Christian thinker" in the United States by David Kirkpatrick of the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/magazine/20george-t.html | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=The Conservative–Christian Big Thinker | date=20 December 2009|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick goes on to state:

{{quote|George's admirers say he is revitalizing a strain of Catholic natural-law thinking that goes back to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His scholarship has earned him accolades from religious and secular institutions alike. In one notable week two years ago, he received invitations to deliver prestigious lectures at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Harvard Law School.}}

Supreme Court Justice and former Harvard Law School Dean [[Elena Kagan]] has praised George as "one of the nation's most respected legal theorists," saying that the respect he had gained was due to "his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge," and "a deeply principled conviction, a profound and enduring integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/fplayers/I2009/urlOfficeOpenPlayer.cfm?fn=9093039100519114801 |title=US Senate Url Video Player |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In announcing his election as Chairman of the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]] in 2013, outgoing Chairwoman [[Katrina Swett|Katrina Lantos Swett]], a Democrat appointed by Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], praised George as "a true human rights champion whose compassion for victims of oppression and wisdom about international religious freedom shine through all we have accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert P.

George's critics, including many Catholic scholars, have argued that he has neglected critical aspects of the Christian message, including "the corruption of human reason through original sin, the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption," focusing instead on "mechanics" of morality, and – through his political associations and activism – turned the church "into a tool of Republican Party."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Musical activity==
George is a finger style guitarist and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] banjo player. His guitar playing is in the style of [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Jerry Reed]]. His banjo playing mixes the styles of [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Don Reno]], and [[Bela Fleck]]. As a teenager, he performed with folk groups and bluegrass bands in coffee houses, rod and gun clubs, and at state and county fairs in West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia.  At Swarthmore he led "Robby George and Friends," a country and bluegrass band. He has performed with folk singer Ed Trickett, country music pioneer Stan Hitchcock, and the New Jersey-based bluegrass band "Blue Heart."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueheartband.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528103822/http://www.blueheartband.com/|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Same-sex unions}}
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that legalized same-sex marriage in the [[U.S. state|states]] and [[LGBT rights in American Samoa|most]] [[Territories of the United States|territories]] did not legalize same-sex marriage on Indian lands. In the United States, [[United States Congress|Congress]] (not the federal courts) has legal authority over Indian country. Thus, unless Congress passes a law regarding same-sex marriage for Indian tribes, federally recognized American Indian tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julian Brave Noisecat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/02/navajo-marriage-equality_n_7709016.html |title=Fight For Marriage Equality Not Over On Navajo Nation |publisher=''Huffington Post'' |date=July 2, 2015 |accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the individual laws of the various [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|United States federally recognized Native American tribes]] set the limits on same-sex marriage under their jurisdictions.

Most, but not all, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] jurisdictions have no special regulation for marriages between people of the same sex or gender. Many Native American belief systems include the [[two-spirit]] descriptor for gender variant individuals and accept two-spirited individuals as valid members of their tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/11/two-spirit-people-north-america |title=The 'two-spirit' people of indigenous North Americans |publisher=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage is possible in at least 40 Native American tribes, beginning with the [[Coquille Indian Tribe]] (Oregon) in 2009. Marriages performed in these Native American tribes were first recognized by the Federal Government in 2013 after section 3 of the ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA) was declared unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlr.law.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/04/46.3.3.pdf TRIBAL LAWS &amp; SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: THEORY, PROCESS, AND CONTENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nations that provide legal recognition==
In some instances, tribal law has been changed to specifically address same-sex marriage. In other cases, tribal law specifies that state law and state jurisdiction govern marriage relations for the tribal jurisdiction.

===Ak-Chin Indian Community===
Until October 25, 2017, the Ak-Chin Law and Order Code specifically banned same-sex marriages and did not recognize those performed off the reservation.&lt;ref name="Ak-Chin"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/30/ak-chin-woman-sues-tribe-to-recognize-same-sex-mar/ |title=Ak-Chin woman sues tribe to recognize same-sex marriage |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, a member of the [[Ak-Chin Indian Community]] filed a lawsuit in the Ak-Chin Indian Community Court, alleging violations of equal protection, the ''Indian Civil Rights Act'' and due process, after the tribe refused to recognize her same-sex marriage&lt;ref name="Ak-Chin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/cleo-pablo-notice-of-claim.pdf |format=PDF |title=Law of Sonia Martinez : Ak-Chin Indian Community |website=Turtletalk.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2017, the court ruled that the law banning same-sex marriage was in violation of the tribe's Constitution and the ''Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968''. The tribe's chairman announced that the Government will not appeal the ruling. The ruling only applies to the Ak-Chin Indian Community, but may set a precedent for similar future challenges by more tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/10/25/court-orders-ak-chin-tribe-recognize-marriages-same-sex-couples/798905001/|title=Court orders Ak-Chin tribe to recognize marriages of same-sex couples|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|first=Alia|last=Beard Rau|date=October 25, 2017|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nations that might have recognition==
The federally recognized Native American tribes in this section have neutrally worded marriage statutes which do not appear to have been applied to same-sex couples, nor have steps been taken to officially recognize same-sex couples, but they are not precluded from recognition. In some cases, valid marriages performed in other jurisdictions are recognized. In some cases their legislation about recognition of out-of-jurisdiction marriages is neutrally worded and could leave the possibilities open to such a recognition. In parallel, the wording of their marriage conditions within jurisdiction is frequently not explicitly excluding same-sex marriages but a few elements of it contains reference to heterosexual marriage such as "husband and wife". In other cases, the wording may also forbid performance explicitly, but not exclude recognition. Some tribes recognize "domestic partnerships" of same-sex couples for limited benefits.

[[File:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Lindley]], the last English Serjeant-at-Law]]
A '''Serjeant-at-Law''' ('''SL'''), commonly known simply as a '''Serjeant''', was a member of an order of [[barrister]]s at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English bar]]. The position of Serjeant-at-Law (''servientes ad legem''), or Sergeant-Counter, was centuries old; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the [[Norman Conquest]]. The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England, having been brought into existence as a body by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. The order rose during the 16th century as a small, elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts. With the creation of [[Queen's Counsel]] (or "Queen's Counsel Extraordinary") during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the order gradually began to decline, with each monarch opting to create more King's or Queen's Counsel. The Serjeants' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and, with the [[Judicature Act 1873]] coming into force in 1875, it was felt that there was no need to have such figures, and no more were created. The last Irish Serjeant-at-Law was [[Serjeant Sullivan]] (d. 1959).  The last English Serjeant-at-Law was [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Lindley]] (d. 1921).

The Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and [[Exchequer of Pleas]]) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above [[Knights Bachelor]] and [[Companion of the Bath|Companions of the Bath]]. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|Writ of Summons]] under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the [[coif]], a white [[lawn (fabric)|lawn]] or silk [[Headgear|skullcap]], afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace at the top of the [[Wig (hair)|wig]].

==History==
===Early history===
The history of Serjeants-at-Law goes back to within a century of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]; Alexander Pulling argues that Serjeants-at-Law existed "before any large portion of our law was formed", and Edward Warren agrees, supporting him with a Norman writ from approximately 1300 which identifies Serjeants-at-Law as directly descending from Norman ''conteurs''; indeed, they were sometimes known as Serjeant-Conteurs.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.918&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Order initially used [[St Paul's Cathedral]] as their meeting place, standing near the "[[parvis]]" where they would give counsel to those who sought advice. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] makes reference to the Serjeants in the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', [[General Prologue]], writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A serjeant of the law, ware and wise,&lt;br&gt;
That often hadde ben at the parvis,&lt;br&gt;
Ther was also, full rich of excellence.&lt;br&gt;
Discreet he was and of great reverence,&lt;br&gt;
He sened swiche; his wordes were so wise,&lt;br&gt;
Justice he was ful often in assise,&lt;br&gt;
By patent, and by pleine commissiun;&lt;br&gt;
For his science, and for his high renoun,&lt;br&gt;
Of fees and robes had he many on.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Order certainly existed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] from 1154–1189, who created a dozen Serjeants and thus moved the order's existence "out of the realm of conjecture" and into recorded fact. As such it is the oldest royally created order; the next is the [[Order of the Garter]], created in 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.919&lt;/ref&gt; Serjeants at Law existed in Ireland from at least 1302, and were appointed by [[letters patent]] in a similar way to English Serjeants.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry de Bracton]] claimed that, for the trial of [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] in 1239 the king was assisted by "all the serjeants of the bench", although it is not known who they were.&lt;ref&gt;Kynell (2000) p.93&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1270s there were approximately 20 recorded Serjeants; by 1290, 36.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1984) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first regulation of Serjeants, with a statutory power from 1275 to suspend from practise any Serjeant who misbehaved (enacted as chapter 29 of the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1984) p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusive jurisdiction Serjeants-at-Law held over the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] slowly came about during the 1320s, squeezing the size of the bar until only a consistent group reappeared. From this period, Serjeants also began to be called in regular groups, rather than individually on whatever date was felt appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1984) p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise===
During the 16th century the Serjeants-at-Law were a small, though highly respected and powerful, elite. There were never more than ten alive, and on several occasions the number dwindled to one; [[William Blendlowes]] bragged that he had been "the only Serjeant-at-Law in England" in 1559.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003) p.421&lt;/ref&gt; Over these 100 years, only 89 Serjeants were created. At the time they were the only clearly distinguishable branch of the legal profession, and it is thought that their work may have actually created [[barrister]]s as a separate group; although Serjeants were the only lawyers who normally argued in court, they occasionally allowed other lawyers to help them in special cases. These lawyers became known as outer or "utter" barristers (because they were confined to the outer bar of the court); if they were allowed to act they had "passed the bar" towards becoming a Serjeant-at-Law.&lt;ref&gt;Kynell (2000) p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite holding a monopoly on cases in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], Serjeants also took most of the business in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]]. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, there is evidence of Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003) p.422&lt;/ref&gt; This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the [[Exchequer of Pleas]], a court of equity.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003) p.423&lt;/ref&gt; This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, and at the same time the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003) p.425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and abolition===
The decline of the Serjeants-at-Law started in 1596, when [[Francis Bacon]] persuaded [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to appoint him "Queen's Counsel Extraordinary" (QC), a new creation which gave him precedence over the Serjeants. This was not a formal creation, in that he was not granted a patent of appointment, but in 1604 [[James I of England|James I]] saw fit to finally award this. The creation of Queen's (or King's) Counsel was initially small; James I created at least one other, and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] four. Following the [[English Restoration]] this increased, with a few appointed each year. The largest change came about with [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who appointed an average of nine a year, and following him approximately 12 were created a year, with an average of 245 at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Every new Queen's Counsel created reduced the Serjeants in importance, since even the most junior QC took precedence over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]] issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] to every [[barrister]], Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The [[Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846]], from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers to practice in the Court of Common Pleas.&lt;ref&gt;Haydn (1851) p.246&lt;/ref&gt; The next and final blow was the [[Judicature Act 1873]], which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act and the rise of the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent Irish rank of [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant-at-law]] survived until  1919. [[A. M. Sullivan (lawyer)|Alexander Sullivan]], the last Irish serjeant, spent the second half of his career at the English Bar, and as a matter of courtesy was  always addressed as Serjeant.

==Organisation==
===Serjeant's Inn===
{{main|Serjeant's Inn}}
[[File:Old Serjeant's Inn plaque London.jpg|thumb|A plaque marks the site of Old [[Serjeant's Inn]] in [[Chancery Lane]].]]
Serjeant's Inn was an [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] restricted to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 for the one in Fleet Street,&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; which was pulled down during the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902) p.168&lt;/ref&gt; and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.934&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1894) p.310&lt;/ref&gt; There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a [[gentlemen's club]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inn on Fleet Street existed from at least 1443, when it was rented from the Dean of York. By the 16th century it had become the main Inn, before being burnt down during the [[Great Fire of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt by 1670, but the end finally came in 1733. The Fleet Street Inn had fallen into a "ruinous state", and the Serjeants had been unable to obtain a renewal of their lease. They abandoned the property, and it returned to the Dean.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

The property on Chancery Lane consisted of a Hall, dining room, a library, kitchens and offices for the Serjeants-at-Law. This Inn was originally known as "Skarle's Inn" from about 1390, named after [[John Scarle]], who became [[Master of the Rolls]] in 1394. By 1404 it was known as "Farringdon's Inn", but although the Serjeants were in full possession by 1416 it was not until 1484 that the property became known as Serjeant's Inn.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Newly promoted Serjeants had to pay [[Pound sterling|£]]350 in the 19th century, while those promoted solely to take up judicial office had to pay £500.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1894) p.304&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall was a large room hung with portraits of various famous judges and Serjeants-at-Law, with three windows on one side each containing the coat of arms of a distinguished judge. Around the room were the coats of arms of various Serjeants, which were given to their descendants when the Inn was finally sold.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1894) p.308&lt;/ref&gt; When the Fleet Street Inn was abandoned, this location became the sole residence of the Serjeants.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.125&lt;/ref&gt; With the demise of the order after the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]], there was no way to support the Inn, and it was sold in 1877 for £57,100. The remaining Serjeants were accepted into their former [[Inns of Court]], where judicial Serjeants were made [[Bencher]]s and normal Serjeants barristers.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call to the Coif===
The process of being called to the order of Serjeants-at-Law stayed fairly constant. The traditional method was that the Serjeants would discuss among themselves prospective candidates, and then make recommendations to the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]]. He would pass these names on to the [[Lord Chancellor]], who would appoint the new Serjeants. This was intended to provide a way to select possible judges in a period where political favouritism was rampant – since only Serjeants could become judges, making sure that Serjeants were not political appointees was seen to provide for a neutral judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Serjeants were traditionally appointed by a writ directly from the King. The writ was issued under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] and required "the elected and qualified apprentices of the law to take the state and degree of a Serjeant-at-Law".&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The newly created Serjeants would then assemble in one of the [[Inns of Court]], where they would hear a speech from the [[Lord Chancellor]] or [[Lord Chief Justice]] and be given a purse of gold. The Coif was then placed on the Serjeant's head. The Serjeants were required to swear an oath, which was that they would:
&lt;blockquote&gt;serve the King's people as one of the Serjeants-at-law, and you shall truly counsel them that you be retained with after your cunning; and you shall not defer or delay their causes willingly, for covetness of money, or other thing that may turn you to profit; and you shall give due attendance accordingly. So help you God.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p. 925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new Serjeants would give a feast to celebrate, and gave out rings to their close friends and family to mark the occasion. The King, the [[Lord Chancellor]] and other figures also received rings.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The major courts would be suspended for the day, and the other Serjeants, judges, leaders of the [[Inns of Court]] and occasionally the King would attend.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serjeant's Inn]] and the [[Inns of Court]] were not big enough for such an occasion, and [[Ely Place]] or [[Lambeth Palace]] would instead be used.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The feasts gradually declined in importance, and by the 17th century they were small enough to be held in the Inns. The last recorded feast was in 1736 in [[Middle Temple]], when fourteen new Serjeants were raised to the Coif.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robes===
[[File:Coiffe (Bundhaube).jpg|frame|left|An example of a coif]]
The traditional clothing of a Serjeant-at-Law consisted of a [[coif]], a robe and a furred cloak.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The robe and cloak were later adapted into the robe worn by judges.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The cut and colour of this robe varied – records from the [[King's Privy Wardrobe]] show judges being instructed to wear robes of scarlet, green, purple and [[miniver]], and Serjeants being ordered to wear the same.&lt;ref name="Pulling 1884 p. 218"&gt;Pulling (1884) p.218&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555 new Serjeants were required to have robes of scarlet, brown, blue, mustard and [[murrey]].&lt;ref name="Pulling 1884 p. 218"/&gt; By the time the order came to an end the formal robes were red,&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; but Mr. Serjeant Robinson recalled that, towards the end days of the order, black silk gowns were the everyday court garb and the red gown was worn only on certain formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt; Robinson: "Bench and Bar" (1889, Hurst &amp; Blacket, London) at p.295 &lt;/ref&gt; The cape was originally a cloak worn separately from the robe, but gradually made its way into the uniform as a whole. [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]] described the cape as the "main ornament of the order",&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished only from the cape worn by judges because it was furred with lambskin rather than miniver.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; The capes were not worn into court by the advocates, only by the serjeants.&lt;ref name=p3&gt;Pulling (1884) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The coif was the main symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most recognisable name (the Order of the Coif) comes from.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt; The coif was white and made of either silk or [[Lawn cloth|lawn]]. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, not even in the presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a [[black cap]] intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt; When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Anchor|King's Serjeants}} King's or Queen's Serjeants ===
&lt;!-- King's Serjeants redirects here --&gt;
A King's or Queen's Serjeant was a Serjeant-at-Law appointed to serve [[the Crown]] as a legal adviser to the monarch and their government in the same way as the [[Attorney-General for England and Wales]]. The King's Serjeant (who had the postnominal KS, or QS during the reign of a female monarch) would represent the Crown in court, acting as prosecutor in criminal cases and representative in civil ones, and would have higher powers and ranking in the lower courts than the Attorney- or [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.40&lt;/ref&gt; King's Serjeants also worked as legal advisers in the [[House of Lords]], and were not allowed to act in cases against the Crown or do anything that would harm it; in 1540 Serjeant Browne was heavily punished for creating a tax avoidance scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2003) p.424&lt;/ref&gt; The King's Serjeants would wear a black Coif with a narrow strip of white, unlike the all-white Coif of a normal Serjeant.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.920&lt;/ref&gt; The King's Serjeants were required to swear a second oath to serve "The King and his people", rather than "The King's people" as a Serjeant-at-Law would swear.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.926&lt;/ref&gt; The King's favoured Serjeant would become the King's Premier Serjeant, while the oldest one was known as the King's Ancient Serjeant.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precedence, status and rights of audience===
For almost all of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given [[rights of audience]] in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.179&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century they were also first in the order of precedence in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and [[Court of Chancery]],&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.180&lt;/ref&gt; which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.232&lt;/ref&gt; It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.924&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (1945) p.923&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of the common law courts; this rule came into being in the 14th century for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, and was extended to the [[Exchequer of Pleas]] in the 16th century; it did not apply to the [[Court of Chancery]], a court of [[equity (law)|equity]], or the Ecclesiastical Courts.&lt;ref&gt;Megarry (1972) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The Serjeants-at-Law also had social privileges; they ranked above [[Knights Bachelor]] and [[Companion of the Bath|Companions of the Bath]], and their wives had the right to be addressed as "Lady —", in the same way as the wives of knights or [[baronet]]s. A Serjeant made a King's Counsel or judge would still retain these social privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; As the cream of the legal profession, Serjeants earned higher fees than normal barristers.&lt;ref&gt;Kynell (2000) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[order of precedence]] King's Serjeants came before all other barristers, even the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]], until the introduction of [[King's Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulling (1884) p.182&lt;/ref&gt; This state of affairs came to an end as a result of two changes – firstly, during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]], when a royal patent gave the Attorney General precedence over all King's Serjeants "except the two ancientiest",&lt;ref name=p1&gt;Pulling (1884) p.183&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly in 1814 when the Attorney General of the time was a barrister and the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] (politically junior to the Attorney General) a King's Serjeant. To reflect the political reality, the Attorney General was made superior to any King's Serjeant, and this remained until the order of Serjeants-at-Law finally died out.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

==In literature==
The main character in [[C.J. Sansom]]'s '[[Shardlake]]' novels, hunchback lawyer Matthew [[Shardlake]], is a Serjeant-at-Law during the reign of [[King Henry VIII of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">"'''A Standard State Zoning Enabling Act'''" ('''SZEA''') was a [[model law]] for U.S. states to [[enabling act|enable]] [[zoning]] regulations in their jurisdictions. It was drafted by a committee of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] and first issued in 1922. This act was one of the foundational developments in [[land use planning]] in the United States.

==Background==
{{Further | Zoning in the United States#Origins and history}}

The zoning advisory committee that wrote the standard act was formed in the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] in September 1921.{{sfn|SSZEA|1926|p=iii}} The [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] was [[Herbert Hoover]], who was later elected US President.

==Summary==
The SZEA begins with several explanatory notes.{{sfn|SSZEA|1926|p=1–3}} The act itself is nine sections with annotations mostly describing the committee's choice of words.{{sfn|SSZEA|1926|p=4–13}}

The SZEA was first issued in August 1922, was reissued in revised form in January 1923, and was first printed in May 1924. More than 55,000 copies of the first printed edition were sold. A second printed edition was published in 1926.{{sfn|SSZEA|1926|p=3}}

==Legacy==
The 1926 revised second printing noted that 19 states had passed enabling acts modeled on the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act.{{sfn|SSZEA|1926|p=iii}}

The [[American Planning Association]] wrote that the SZEA and the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1927 "laid the basic foundation for land development controls in the U.S."{{sfn|Meck|2002|p=[https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/print/pdf/chapter8.pdf 8-5]}}

{{more footnotes|date=March 2016}}
In [[finance]], a '''straddle''' strategy refers to two transactions that share the same security, with positions that offset one another. One holds [[Long (finance)|long]] risk, the other [[Short (finance)|short]]. As a result, it involves the purchase or sale of particular [[option (finance)|option]] [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] that allow the holder to profit based on how much the price of the [[underlying]] security moves, regardless of the ''direction'' of price movement.

A straddle involves buying a call and put with same strike price and expiration date. If the stock price is close to the strike price at expiration of the options, the straddle leads to a loss. However, if there is a sufficiently large move in either direction, a significant profit will result. A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price but does not know in which direction the move will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Suresh A.|date=2015-12-28|title=ANALYSIS OF OPTION COMBINATION STRATEGIES|url=http://inflibnet.ac.in/ojs/index.php/MI/article/view/3554|journal=Management Insight|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|issn=0973-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''purchase'' of particular option derivatives is known as a '''long straddle''', while the ''sale'' of the option derivatives is known as a '''short straddle'''.

==Long straddle==
[[Image:Longstraddle.png|thumb|An option payoff diagram for a long straddle position]]
A '''long straddle''' involves "going long," in other words, purchasing both a [[call option]] and a [[put option]] on some [[stock]], [[interest rate]], [[index (economics)|index]] or other [[underlying]]. The two options are bought at the same [[strike price]] and expire at the same time. The owner of a long straddle makes a profit if the underlying price moves a long way from the strike price, either above or below. Thus, an investor may take a long straddle position if he thinks the market is highly [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]], but does not know in which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, since the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Options and Futures |last=Barrie |first=Scott |year=2001 |publisher=Alpha Books |isbn=0-02-864138-8 |pages=120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, company XYZ is set to release its quarterly financial results in two weeks. A trader believes that the release of these results will cause a large movement in the price of XYZ's stock, but does not know whether the price will go up or down. He can enter into a long straddle, where he gets a profit no matter which way the price of XYZ stock moves, if the price changes enough either way. If the price goes up enough, he uses the [[call option]] and ignores the [[put option]]. If the price goes down, he uses the [[put option]] and ignores the [[call option]]. If the price does not change enough, he loses money, up to the total amount paid for the two options. The risk is limited by the total premium paid for the options, as opposed to the short straddle where the risk is virtually unlimited.

If the stock is sufficiently volatile and option duration is long, the trader could profit from both options. This would require the stock to move both below the put option's strike price and above the call option's strike price at different times before the option expiration date.

===Example: Long straddle P/L graph===
This is an at-the-money (ATM) Straddle with 1 year to expiry:
[[File:Long Straddle Option Strategy Example.png|thumb|Example of long straddle option strategy]]

After 50 days, the P/L graph of the straddle will look as follows (blue line):
[[File:Straddle Option Strategy Profit-Loss Graph.png|thumb|Example straddle option strategy profit-loss graph]]

The P/L blue graph is ''negative'' at prices from approximately 84 to 107 dollars (these are the break-even points), which means that in order for the strategy to be profitable after 50 days, the stock price should be either higher than 107 dollars or lower than 84 dollars.

As time goes by, due to time decay, the straddle P/L graph goes down (and becomes more and more unprofitable), until it reaches the orange line (which is the P/L of the straddle at expiry). Also, the distance between the break-even points increases.

==Short straddle==
[[Image:Shortstraddle.png|thumb|]]
[[Image:Short straddle.JPG|thumb|]]
A '''short straddle''' is a non-directional [[options strategy|options trading strategy]] that involves simultaneously selling a put and a call of the same underlying security, strike price and expiration date. The profit is limited to the premium received from the sale of put and call. The risk is virtually unlimited as large moves of the underlying security's price either up or down will cause losses proportional to the magnitude of the price move. A maximum profit upon expiration is achieved if the underlying security trades exactly at the strike price of the straddle. In that case both puts and calls comprising the straddle expire worthless allowing straddle owner to keep full credit received as their profit. This strategy is called "nondirectional" because the short straddle profits when the underlying security changes little in price before the expiration of the straddle. The short straddle can also be classified as a credit spread because the sale of the short straddle results in a credit of the premiums of the put and call.

A risk for holder of a short straddle position is unlimited due to the sale of the call and the put options which expose the investor to unlimited losses (on the call) or losses limited to the strike price (on the put), whereas maximum profit is limited to the premium gained by the initial sale of the options.

==Tax straddle==
A '''tax straddle''' is straddling applied specifically to taxes, typically used in [[Futures contract|futures]] and options to create a [[tax shelter]].&lt;ref name="irs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Passthrough-Entity-Straddle-Tax-Shelter|title=Passthrough Entity Straddle Tax Shelter|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= IRS.gov|accessdate=Jan 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an investor with a [[capital gain]] manipulates investments to create an artificial loss from an unrelated transaction to offset their gain in a current year, and postpone the gain till the following tax year. One position accumulates an unrealized gain, the other a loss. Then the position with the loss is closed prior to the completion of the tax year, countering the gain.  When the new year for tax begins, a replacement position is created to offset the risk from the retained position. Through repeated straddling, gains can be postponed indefinitely over many years.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=Nov 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991''' ('''TVPA'''; {{USStatute|102|256|106|73|1992|03|12|h.r.|2092}}) is a statute that allows for the filing of civil suits in the [[United States]] against individuals who, acting in an official capacity for any foreign nation, committed [[torture]] and/or [[extrajudicial killing]].  The statute requires a plaintiff to show exhaustion of local remedies in the location of the crime, to the extent that such remedies are "adequate and available." Plaintiffs may be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens.

Although the Act was not passed until early 1992, it was introduced the previous year, and the official name of the Act is the "Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991."

==Legal issues==
In 1992, Sister [[Dianna Ortiz]] was the first to file a case under the act, in a civil action against former general and Defense Minister [[Héctor Gramajo]] of [[Guatemala]], contending that, by his command authority, he was responsible for her abduction, rape, and torture by military forces in Guatemala in November 1989. A federal court in Massachusetts ruled in her favor, awarding her $5 million in damages in 1995.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/justice/law_background_torture.html |title=Civil Remedies for Gross Human Rights Violations |last=Ratner |first=Michael |work=Justice and the Generals: US Law |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2007-07-09 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121081355/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/justice/law_background_torture.html |archivedate=January 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TVPA has been used by victims of [[terrorism]] to sue foreign states that have been designated by the U.S. as [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsors of terrorism]], such as Iraq (which has since been removed from the list) and Iran. In May 2000, Miami based attorney Andrew C. Hall&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81011&lt;/ref&gt; and clients David Daliberti, Bill Barloon, Chad Hall, Kenneth Beaty and their wives were awarded a collective sum of almost $19 million for the pains the men suffered in captivity. see ''Daliberti v. Republic of Iraq,'' 97 F.Supp.2d 38 (D.D.C. 2000);&lt;ref&gt;http://uniset.ca/other/cs5/97FSupp2d38.html&lt;/ref&gt; and also ''Weinstein v. Islamic Republic of Iran,'' 184 F.Supp.2d 13 (D.D.C. 2002).  The [[Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act]] (FSIA), {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1602|1611}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97 US Code], Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits foreign states from being sued in U.S. courts for most non-commercial issues.

The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1605}}(a)(7), created an exception to the FSIA, allowing U.S. nationals to sue foreign states if the state has been designated as a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] and if the plaintiff's injury has been caused by the state's support of a terrorist organization.  Following the passage of the AEDPA, numerous suits have been filed against state sponsors of terrorism, particularly [[Iran]]. Because some courts have held that the AEDPA does not create a cause of action against foreign states, plaintiffs have used the TVPA and the AEDPA in concert, first using the AEDPA to provide an exception to a foreign state's sovereign immunity, and then using the TVPA to provide a cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;Debra M. Strauss, ''Enlisting the U.S. Courts in a New Front: Dismantling the International Business Holdings of Terrorist Groups Through Federal Statutory and Common-Law Suits'', 38 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 679, 710 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The TVPA has also been used by victims of torture by agents of the United States. In ''[[Meshal v. Higgenbotham]]'', a native-born American citizen alleges U.S. officials repeatedly threatened him with torture, forced disappearance, and other serious harm.

On April 18, 2012, in ''Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority'', the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the TVPA applies exclusively to natural persons and does not impose liability against any organizational entity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-88.pdf Asid Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, et al.], No. 11-88&lt;/ref&gt;
The court's decision was based on the statute's use of the word "individual", as distinguished from "person" (the latter of which is usually defined in U.S. law and statutes as meaning an individual '''or''' an organization).  The court examined the word both in context of its ordinary meaning and through the legislative history of the TVPA.  The court noted that the original language of the TVPA bill had used the word "person" and that during a House committee markup, one of the bill's sponsors proposed an amendment "to make it clear we are applying it to individuals and not to corporations."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">The '''Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Between Argentina and the United Kingdom''' was an 1825 treaty between the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] (predecessor of modern [[Argentina]]) and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (predecessor of modern [[United Kingdom]]). With this treaty, the United Kingdom accepted the 1816 [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]]. As the United Kingdom was the most powerful [[world power]] of the time, and the [[United States]] had announced the [[Monroe Doctrine]], this treaty limited the chances of Spain to reconquer its former colony.

The treaty also allowed [[British subject]]s to keep their religion, and to build their own churches and cemeteries. This was an unprecedented step in the history of the [[freedom of religion]] in Argentina, as it was the first time that a religion other than the [[Catholic Church]] was legally allowed in the country. The treaty set as well an agreement to stop the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

In the context of the dispute over the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}), Lowell S. Gustafson argues that by signing the Treaty without making any reservation about Argentina's settlement on the islands by 1825, the United Kingdom weakened its claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowell S. Gustafson|title=The Sovereignty Dispute Over the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip-9_W7efbAC&amp;pg=PA22|date=7 April 1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536472-9|page=22|quote="Britain recognized the new government in 1825 without making any reservations about Argentina's attempts to exercise its sovereignty over the Malvinas. By this failure to protest Jewitt's or Vernet's acts of possession in the name of the new republic, the 2 February 1825 Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation weakened England's claim."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1803">A '''vocational expert''' is an authority in the areas of [[vocational rehabilitation]], vocational and earning capacity, lost earnings, cost of replacement labor and lost ability/time in performing household services. They perform evaluations for purposes of civil litigation, as an aspect of economic damages.

Vocational experts identify what the person could have earned prior to the incident, compared to what they are likely to earn following the incident. Economic experts calculate the value of those earnings over time, so the difference, if any, between the two income streams is clearly understood. Those who act as vocational/economic experts blend the two disciplines, and offer testimony in both arenas.

A vocational "expert" is designated by an attorney as an expert who testifies in court, whereas a vocational "consultant" does not testify.  Qualifications to testify in court as an [[expert witness|expert]] in the field of vocational rehabilitation are fairly strict and related to State certification and licensure. Typically, a [[graduate degree]] in counseling or psychology plus certification/licensure will suffice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.socialsecurity.gov/appeals/ve.html#&amp;a0=1 "Becoming a Vocational Expert"] SocialSecurity.gov, Retrieved on 26 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the [[rules of evidence]] in the jurisdiction presiding over the civil case prevail.

'''''Yount v. City of Sacramento'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=43 Cal.4th 885 (2008)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11579630359806439435&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|website=California supreme Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the [[California Supreme Court]], which significantly expanded the rights of a convicted arrestee subjected to [[excessive force]] during arrest. The case was brought by Brian T. Dunn of [[The Cochran Firm]] in California, on behalf of Steven Yount&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Yount - Man Who Pleaded 'No Contest'|url=http://www.cochranfirm.com/news/yount-permitted-to-sue.html|website=Los Angeles Daily Journal|publisher=Los Angeles Daily Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Yount was shot by a [[Sacramento]] police officer after being handcuffed during a [[DUI]] arrest.

==Background==
During the early morning hours of March 10, 2001, Steven Yount, the plaintiff in the Yount case, left his home, got into his car and drove to a [[7-Eleven]] store in Sacramento to purchase alcohol. Yount had already consumed beer and liquor that morning and was very drunk. A security guard in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven called police after he observed the visibly-intoxicated Yount attempting to get back into his vehicle. Sacramento Police Department Officer Samuel Davis arrived at the 7-Eleven, approached Yount's car, and asked him to step out of the vehicle.

He complied with Davis's request to get out of the car but refused to get inside the patrol vehicle. After some effort, Davis was able to secure Yount in the backseat of his patrol vehicle. In the backseat of the patrol vehicle, Yount shouted obscenities and racial slurs at Davis and kicked and banged his head against the side and window of the patrol vehicle.

With the assistance of two security guards in the area, Davis was able to pull  Yount out of the patrol vehicle, handcuff him, and place him back inside the patrol vehicle. After he was placed back inside the patrol vehicle, he continued to shout and kick and bang his head against the doors of the vehicle. Sacramento Police Department Officers Debra Hatfield, Daniel Swafford, and Thomas Schrum responded to the 7-Eleven to assist Davis.

Schrum opened the door of Davis's patrol vehicle to ask Yount for identification. When Schrum opened the door of the patrol vehicle, Yount popped out of the vehicle, attempted to move right in Schrum's face, and continued to yell and curse at the officers. Schrum forced  Yount back into the patrol vehicle. Yount continued yelling obscenities at the officers and banging on the patrol vehicle while kicking his legs at Schrum. Swafford tased Yount.

After Swafford deployed the Taser, Yount became more violent and continued to yell obscenities and racial slurs at the officers. Yount also kicked out the window of Davis's patrol vehicle. The officers decided to restrain Yount's legs before they placed him into a different patrol vehicle. When they attempted to pull Yount out of Davis's patrol vehicle, Yount refused to co-operate and resisted the officers' efforts to remove him from the vehicle.

The officers eventually managed to pull Yount out of the patrol vehicle. After the officers pulled him out of the patrol vehicle, Davis stumbled and fell to the ground. Yount kicked him and spat at him. Davis got on top of Yount, who was continuing to struggle and shout, and the officers were able to secure Yount's legs with ankle restraints. He continued to resist the officers by kicking and spitting at them. Schrum pulled out what he thought was a Taser and fired it at the back of Yount's thigh. Then, Schrum realized that he had mistakenly grabbed his firearm, instead of his Taser. Yount sustained a gunshot wound to his left buttock.

==Civil rights case==
After the incident, Yount was charged with resisting arrest in violation of [[California Penal Code]], section 148, and driving under the influence. He pleaded [[no contest]] to and was convicted of both offenses. After the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, Brian T. Dunn, an attorney at The Cochran Firm, specializing in civil rights cases, filed a civil action on Yount's behalf against Schrum and the City of Sacramento in the [[Sacramento County Superior Court]], alleging a claim for violation of [[civil rights]] under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the [[United States Code]], among others. The complaint alleged that Schrum had shot him without justification and violated his [[constitutional rights]].

The defendants argued that the 42 U.S.C. 1983 claim was a collateral attack on the conviction for resisting arrest and so was barred by ''Heck v. Humphrey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=512 U.S. 477, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html|website=Supreme Court of the United States|publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 512 U.S. 477, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994). That was a US Supreme Court decision that held that a plaintiff is barred from prosecuting a 42 U.S.C. 1983 action if the successful resolution of the action would necessarily imply the invalidity of a criminal conviction of the plaintiff.

The issue was whether a finding in favor off Yount on his 42 U.S.C. 1983 claim would "necessarily imply the invalidity" of his criminal conviction for resisting arrest. Submitted to the California Supreme Court for decision. The appeal was briefed and argued by Dunn.

==Decision==
The California Supreme Court held that the civil claims were barred to the extent that they alleged that Schrum was not entitled to use any force during the incident, as the use of resistance justified the use of reasonable force in response to his actions. The Court further held, however, that the civil claims were not barred, as to the use of deadly force, as it was not reasonable under the circumstances. The conviction for resisting arrest did not, by itself, provide a justification for the use of deadly force.

In holding that success on the claim of excessive deadly force would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction for resisting arrest, the California Supreme Court analyzed the relationship between his acts of resistance and Schrum’s misconduct. The Court began its analysis by noting that Officer Schrum was justified in using "reasonable force" against Mr. Yount, who was kicking, spitting, and refusing to co-operate with the officers in the moments prior to the shooting. Consequently, to the extent that his claims alleged that he was not resisting or obstructing the officers and that the officers were not justified in using any level of force against him, they would be inconsistent with his conviction for resisting and so were barred by ''Heck''.

The California Supreme Court also noted, however, that he had alleged that the use of deadly force was excessive under the circumstances and not justified by his acts of resistance during the incident. The Court held that to the extent that his claims were based on Schrum's unjustifiable use of deadly force, the claims were not barred under ''Heck'' because the evidence did not support the use of deadly force against Yount. His criminal conviction for resisting arrest, standing alone, did not establish a justification for Schrum's use of deadly force against him. Accordingly,  Yount's claim that the use of deadly force was not a reasonable response to his acts of resistance did not call the validity of his conviction for resisting arrest into question.
