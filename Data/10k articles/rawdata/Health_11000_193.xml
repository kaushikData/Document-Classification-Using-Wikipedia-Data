      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7891">'''Acute medicine''' is that part of [[internal medicine]] concerned with the immediate and early specialist management of adult patients with a wide range of medical conditions who present in hospital as [[Medical emergency|emergencies]].&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt; It developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 2000s as a dedicated field of medicine, together with the establishment of '''acute medical units''' in numerous hospitals.&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt; Acute medicine is distinct from the broader field of [[emergency medicine]], which is concerned with the management of all people attending the [[emergency department]], not just those with internal medicine diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt; The emergence of acute medicine has both similarities with and differences from [[hospital medicine]] in North America, reflecting [[health system]] differences.&lt;ref name="pmid22331278"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wachter RM|author2=Bell D |title=Renaissance of hospital generalists |journal=BMJ |volume=344 |pages=e652 |date=2012 |pmid=22331278 |doi=10.1136/bmj.e652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The field developed in the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] published a joint report in 1998 emphasising the importance of appropriate care for people with acute medical problems.&lt;ref name=Dowdle&gt;{{cite journal |author =Dowdle JR |title=Acute medicine: past, present, and future |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=652–3 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15496684 |pmc=1726512 |doi=10.1136/emj.2003.012211 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/21/6/652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal College of Physicians | title=Acute Medical Admissions and the Future of General Medicine | publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Working party | location=Edinburgh and Glasgow | date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reports led to the development of acute medicine as a dedicated specialty, and in 2003 it was recognised by the Specialist Training Authority as a subspecialty of General Internal Medicine.&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt;

Around the same time, it was recognised that care for acutely admitted patients should ideally be concentrated in "medical assessment units" (MAUs), later named "acute medical units" (AMUs). A physician experienced in the management of acute medical problems could assess and treat these patients in the most appropriate fashion for the first 48 hours of their admission, aiming either for an early discharge with appropriate outpatient follow-up or transfer to a specialist ward.&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt; Severely ill patients who need close observation but do not require [[intensive care]] may be treated in a dedicated area such as a physician-run [[high dependency unit]].&lt;ref name=AMC2007/&gt;

In 2007, some questioned whether the specialty would have a long-term future, if at some point UK government ED targets ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Stein A, Henley J |date=May 2007 | title=Acute medicine: do we need 'medical traffic wardens' to make us interested in general medical patients?  | journal=QJM | volume=100 | issue=7 | pages=463–464 | doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcm037 | pmid=17491101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear seems unwarranted in retrospect, as a clear clinical need for the specialty exists.&lt;ref name="pmid22331278"/&gt;

A further development has been the increase of ''ambulatory care''. Where patients were previously admitted to hospital, it may now be possible for them to attend a clinic or an assessment area a number of times while their progress is monitored.&lt;ref name=Dowdle/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMC2007&gt;{{cite book |author =Royal College of Physicians |title=Acute Medical Care |publisher=Royal College of Physicians of London |location=London |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-86016-321-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now a very common approach to suspected [[deep vein thrombosis]],&lt;ref name="pmid15686510"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Winter M, Keeling D, Sharpen F, Cohen H, Vallance P |title=Procedures for the outpatient management of patients with deep venous thrombosis |journal=Clin Lab Haematol |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=61–6 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15686510 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2257.2004.00660.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2257.2004.00660.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement]] has identified a number of other conditions that can be managed in an ambulatory emergency care setting.&lt;ref name=NHSIII&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institute.nhs.uk/ambulatory_emergency_care/public_view_of_ambulatory_emergency_care/ambulatory_emergency_care_homepage.html |title=Ambulatory emergency care homepage | publisher=NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement  |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute Medicine became a specialty in a similar way to cardiology and respiratory medicine, with its own [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] (CCT) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/specialty/acute-medicine |title=Acute medicine | publisher=Royal College of Physicians |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JRCPTB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrcptb.org.uk/trainingandcert/ST3-SpR/Pages/acute-medicine.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026084507/http://www.jrcptb.org.uk/trainingandcert/ST3-SpR/Pages/acute-medicine.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-26 |title=Acute Internal Medicine (AIM) and sub-specialty of Acute Medicine |format= |publisher=Joint Royal Colleges Postgraduate Training Board |accessdate=2013-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of acute medical units has been shown to decrease the risk of dying in hospital, length of stay in hospital, and the rate of patients for admission blocking the emergency department, all while not increasing the rate of readmissions after discharge and improving patient and staff satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Scott I, Vaughan L, Bell D |title=Effectiveness of acute medical units in hospitals: a systematic review |journal=Int J Qual Health Care |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=397–407 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19903756 |doi=10.1093/intqhc/mzp045 | url=http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/397.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
{{Update|date=July 2017}}
In the United Kingdom, the Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) is the national representative body for staff caring for medical patients in the acute hospital setting. Formed in 2000, SAM was established at a time when the concepts of acute medicine and the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) were in their infancy. Large numbers of specialist acute physicians have been appointed to drive forward changes in the management of patients on the AMU, and several hundred specialist registrars are now training on the newly approved Curriculum in Acute Internal Medicine. SAM has played a pivotal role in many of these developments and is represented on many national committees enabling a strong voice for acute physicians within the Royal Colleges and other key organisations. It organises two annual conferences (Spring and Autumn) and publishes the quarterly journal ''Acute Medicine''.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the Netherlands, the Dutch Acute Medicine (DAM) society was formed in 2012 and held its first Congress on 28 September 2012 in the [[VU University Medical Center]] in Amsterdam. The newly developed curriculum will ensure 12 training posts throughout the Netherlands leading to a workforce of  at least 100 "acute &amp; internal medicine specialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchacutemedicine.nl/ |title=Dutch Acute Medicine|accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Africa/Harvard School of Public Health Partnership for Cohort Research and Training''' (Africa/HSPH PaCT) launched in 2008, is a collaborative research project led by Principal Investigators, Dr. Hans-Olov Adami and Dr. Michelle D. Holmes. Together with research scientists, Dr. Shona Dalal and Dr. Todd G. Reid, this team represents the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Coordinating Site of the Partnership with colleagues from five institutions in [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]]. The Africa/HSPH PaCT project plans on investigating the association of lifestyle factors and chronic disease risk in sub- Saharan Africa, through a large epidemiological cohort study that will include approximately 500,000 participants.&lt;ref name="sick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/sick-to-death/ |title=Sick to death &amp;#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2"/&gt; Africa/HSPH PaCT is the first and largest cohort study conducted in sub-saharan Africa to employ mobile phone technology to follow participants and collect data. Africa/HSPH PaCT will also provide the infrastructure for capacity-building and for training a new generation of health professionals.

==Addressing the Chronic Disease Tsunami==
In [[New York City]] of the 1980s, patients began presenting to doctors with mysterious symptoms. Dr. Michelle D. Holmes, Co-Principal Investigator of Africa/HSPH PaCT, was among those witnessing the explosion of the [[AIDS pandemic]]. Today, a new pandemic of heart disease, mental illness, cancer, and diabetes threatens Africa&lt;ref name="Holmes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000244 |title=Holmes et al.

Cohort studies ask thousands about their diet, exercise, smoking, and other habits, to guide prevention policies. Africa is the last place on earth to have such studies; Africa/HSPH PaCT stands ready to fill the gap.&lt;ref name="Holmes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/11/the-rise-of-chronic-disease/ |title=The rise of chronic disease &amp;#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Sites==
The Principal Investigators and host institutions for the African sites are: Dr. Jimmy Volmink who is the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at [[Stellenbosch University]] in South Africa; Dr. [[Clement Adebamowo]] at the [[Institute of Human Virology]] in Nigeria; Dr. David Guwattude at [[Makerere University]] in Kampala and Dr. Francis Bajunirwe at [[Mbarara University of Science and Technology|Mbarara University]] in Mbarara, Uganda; and Dr. Marina Njelekela at [[Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences|Muhimbili University]], in Tanzania. Cohorts in South Africa and Tanzania will consist of school teachers, and health professionals will be recruited in Nigeria. Complimenting these groups will be participants from peri-urban and rural locations in Uganda, in order to capture a wide variety of lifestyles and populations.

==Study Aims==
Africa/HSPH PaCT will investigate chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), namely cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), mental illness, breast and cervical cancers, which are on the rise in African countries.&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihupe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="disease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fighting"/&gt; This research will provide a sound scientific basis for prevention of NCDs in Africa&lt;ref name="Holmes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Dalal2"/&gt;

'''Africa/HSPH PaCT will seek to:'''&lt;br&gt;
- Better quantify the magnitude of NCDs&lt;br /&gt;
- Discover risk factors for NCDs in Africa and how they interact with the African genome&lt;br /&gt;
- Train a new generation of public health researchers and practitioners&lt;br /&gt;
- Pave the way for innovative methods of data collection employing the latest technology and techniques in computational social science&lt;br /&gt;
- Spur a wave of social entrepreneurism geared toward chronic disease management and public health prevention

==Pilot studies and Data Collection==
Pilot studies, that capture the demographics, lifestyle factors, and chronic disease incidence have been started in all five African sites. This preliminary information collected from the pilot phase will guide and inform the next and larger phase of the initiative. A total of approximately 1500 participants have been enrolled in all five sites and followed for 6 months. In the Tanzania and South Africa sites, data was collected through a questionnaire. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Kampala, Mbarara, and Nigeria. Blood samples were also collected in Mbarara and South Africa. A food-frequency questionnaire and follow-up questionnaires to measure incident NCDs were used to collect information in all five sites. Data from the pilot is currently being analyzed for publication&lt;ref name="sick" /&gt;

==Plan for Enrollment and Scale-up==
At enrollment time, a uniform food frequency questionnaire that accommodates the wide range of dietary patterns across sub-Saharan Africa will be administered. Prof. [[Walter Willett]], Chair of the Nutrition Department at [[Harvard School of Public Health|HSPH]] and Principal Investigator of the [[Nurses' Health Study]], played a crucial role in developing this questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Holmes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nhs"&gt;Goodwin, Jenifer.Blood Type May Be Associated With Stroke Risk: Study. US News. November 16, 2011. Retrieved Nov 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The baseline measurement covers a large range of lifestyle factors including, but not limited to, measures of stress, socioeconomic circumstances, education, reproductive factors (among women), physical activity, smoking and alcohol use, healthcare utilization, and anthropometric measures. Approximately 500,000 study participants from the five African sites will be enrolled over a five-year period and the timeline as follows:&lt;ref name="sick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes1" /&gt;

'''Year 1 :''' Hiring and training of personnel, development of questionnaire (including translation to and back-translation from the relevant languages), establishment of IT infrastructure, preparation of the biobank with blood samples, and definition of source population&lt;br /&gt;'''Years 2 &amp; 3 :''' Enrollment of 20,000 cohort participants per site, for a total of 100,000&lt;br /&gt;'''Year 4 &amp; 5 : ''' Follow-up, ascertainment and validation of outcomes, optimization of procedures for retention and compliance, and analyses of cross-sectional data. Cleaning databases, analyzing data, and preparing manuscripts based on the follow-up data

==Mobile Phones==
A major part of Africa/HSPH PaCT’s innovation is research on cell phone use in scientific studies in Africa. Mobile phones offer entirely new opportunities for cost-effective, large-scale longitudinal studies. Africa/HSPH PaCT is the first study to rely strongly on mobile phones for enrollment, retention, and follow-up and will work in close collaboration with the [[Human dynamics|Human Dynamics]] Group of the [[Alex Pentland|Pentland Lab]] ([[MIT Media Lab|MediaLab]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]) who are leaders in the field of mobile phone data analytics and computational social science.&lt;ref name="sick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novelties"&gt;Eisenberg, Anne.

==Plans for Expansion==
The Africa/HSPH PaCT group is currently exploring collaborations with other research groups that are also in the beginning stages of creating large-scale cohort studies.  In October 2010, the first-ever World Cohort Integration Workshop, hosted by Dr. Hans-Olov Adami was held in Hydra, Greece. This gathering brought together researchers from Mexico (EsMaestra, Mexican Teachers’ Cohort), India (Barshi Cohort), Sweden (LifeGene Sweden), Iceland (University of Iceland), and the United States and four countries in Africa (Africa/HSPH PaCT). The main purpose of this workshop was to share best practices as well as lessons learned and also to pave the way for sharing data, resources, and ideas in the long-term among cohort studies. Combined data from these groups will represent over two million study participants.&lt;ref name="hydra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epitome/november-2010/hydra-meeting.html |title=World Cohort Integration Workshop - November 19, 2010 -November 2010 - EPItome - Harvard School of Public Health |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa/HSPH PaCT is also exploring how best to pair up this large and unique cohort study with partners to create a cadre of social entrepreneurs to help spawn public health innovations in sub- Saharan Africa. Africa/HSPH PaCT currently supports one such social entrepreneurial venture, the ImpacTree project, that is an innovative public social platform for individuals to make their own impact on important issues in the developing world&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;White, Herbert.

'''Aleh Negev''' ({{lang-he-n|עָלֶה נֶגֶב}}) is a rehabilitation village for disabled children and adults in southern [[Israel]]. Located near [[Ofakim]] and covering {{convert|25|acre}}, it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Merhavim Regional Council]].

==History== 
The 25-acre village is a multifaceted facility designed specifically for people over the age of 21 who are physically or mentally impaired, and for children seeking care in Southern Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnf.org/work-we-do/blueprint-negev/aleh-negev.html Jewish National Fund: Aleh Negev]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleh Negev is home to 220 residents and provides services to 12,000 out-patients. The village provides residential, educational, medical and employment services, and opportunities for social interaction. It was founded by the Aleh organization. The village is also called '''Nahalat Eran''' after Eran Almog, the severely autistic son of [[Aluf|Major General]] [[Doron Almog]]. Eran Almog lived in the village until his death from [[Castleman's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3362750,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was built by the ''Aleh'' organization, which was founded by [[Doron Almog]]. Ground was broken by [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]] on 12 June 2003.

'''Askjelldalsvatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Vaksdal]] in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Hordaland/Vaksdal/Askjelldalsvatnet,_vetle/|title=Askjelldalsvatnet|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lake lies at an elevation of {{convert|805|m}} in the [[Vikafjell]] mountains between the valleys of [[Modalen]] and [[Eksingedalen]].  The {{convert|2.84|km2|adj=on}} lake has a [[dam]] at the southern end of the lake.  The dam is used to regulate the water level so that the water can be used for [[hydro-electric]] power at a nearby power plant.  The lake [[Skjerjavatnet]] lies about {{convert|1|km}} to the west.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1245">The '''Board for Licensing Matters and Foreign Medical Practitioners''' ({{lang-no|Utvalget for lisenssaker og utenlandsmedisinere}}) was a public body in [[Norway]], formed in the 1960s and tasked with matters relating to recognition of medical education from outside Norway and licensing of foreign medical practitioners. As a result of the [[EEA Agreement]], its scope was narrowed to matters relating to medical practitioners from outside the [[European Economic Area]] in the 1990s, thus excluding most of western Europe and the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|new EU members]] from 2004. The body was dissolved in December 2007 and its responsibilities transferred to the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]]. The board was appointed by the [[University of Oslo]], which had been delegated the responsibility for foreign medical practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;''Godkjenning som lege i Norge; om vilkårene for norsk godkjenning av leger utdannet i andre land'', Oslo, [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maren Skaset, ''I gode og onde dager; de norske legene og staten 1945–2000'', Unipub, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]] a '''Busch fracture'''&lt;ref name="BastianiApley2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wazKBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT883|title=Orthofix External Fixation in Trauma and Orthopaedics|author1=Giovanni De Bastiani|author2=Alan G.

Goldberg|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-0691-3|pages=883–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a type of fracture of the base of the distal phalanx of the fingers, produced by the removal of the bone insertion (avulsion) of the extensor tendon. Without the apropiate treatment, the finger becomes a [[hammer finger]]. It would correspond to the group B of the Albertoni classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=5771784 | pmid=29367899 | doi=10.1016/j.rboe.2017.12.001 | volume=53 | title=Evaluation of interobserver agreement in Albertoni's classification for mallet finger | year=2018 | journal=Rev Bras Ortop | pages=2–9 | author=Almeida VAS, Fernandes CH, Santos Jbgd Schwarz-Fernandes FA, Faloppa F, Albertoni WM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common in motorcycle riders and soccer joggers, caused by a hyperflection when the tendon is exercising the maximum tension (the closed hand tightening the clutch lever or the brake lever ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tim B Hunter |author2=Leonard F Peltier |author3=Pamela J Lund |year=2000 |title=Musculoskeletal Eponyms: Who Are Those Guys? |journal=RadioGraphics

The Busch fracture is named after Friedrich Busch (1844-1916), who described this type of fracture in the 1860s. Busch's work was drawn on by [[Albert Hoffa]] in 1904, resulting in it sometimes being called a "Busch-Hoffa fracture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4499274|title=Hoffa fracture of medial unicondylar and bilateral in a man: a rare case|author1=Samba Koné|author2=Abdoulaye Bana|author3=Stanislas André Touré|journal=The Pan African Medical Journal|year=2015|volume=20 |page=382|access-date=|pmid=26185572|doi=10.11604/pamj.2015.20.382.6092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of this injury can be described as an avulsion of the tendon fixed to the distal falange.&lt;ref name="BeatyKasser2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVIdXV_F8M4C&amp;pg=PA233|title=Rockwood and Wilkins' Fractures in Children|author1=James H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">A '''catchwater''' device is a large-scale man-made device for catching [[surface runoff]] from hills and the sky from precipitation by channeling it to reservoirs for commercial and domestic use later. Freshwater is a scarce natural resource due to pollution, droughts, and overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clean Water Crisis, Water Crisis Facts, Water Crisis Resources - National Geographic|url = http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/freshwater-crisis/|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catchwater is a sustainable mechanism to increase freshwater in areas facing droughts or polluted waterways.

== Types ==

=== Catchwater drains ===
{{main|Catchwater drain}}
[[File:Skellingthorpe Catchwater Drain.jpg|thumb|A Catchwater drain that decreases the velocity of storm-water runoff to reduce and prevent erosion and other environmental  concerns.]]Catchwater drains may take the form of [[concrete]] [[canal]]s, such as in [[Hong Kong]], where there are many.  Alternatively, they may take the form of a large concrete sheet, smothering a hill, and preventing rainfall from entering the [[rock (geology)|rock]] [[stratum|strata]], with a smaller channeling system for transport of the water to the [[storage tank]] - this latter system is in operation in [[Gibraltar]]. In Hong Kong there are approximately 120&amp;nbsp;km of concrete channels, used as gutters built along hillsides in order to direct freshwater runoff into reservoirs for local water consumption. These catchwaters can overflow, causing dangerous hazards, erosive streams and blockages.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earthship drains ===
An earthship drain is water that is collected from [[impervious surface]]s that are channeled into cisterns. A [[cistern]] is a well located underground. The water within these underground wells is heated by the sun.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Earthship {{!}} Catchwater from the Sky|url = http://earthship.com/Systems/water|website = Earthship Biotecture|accessdate = 2015-10-22|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water that is stored is used in domestic ways for washing dishes and bathing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once water is used it is cycled and filtered in a module to be reused again
[[File:Rain barrel.jpg|thumb|Rain barrels are man-made barrels that collect and store rainfall for commercial and recreational usage such as water a garden or washing a car. They can be made out of metal, plastic, or wood. They are connected to a buildings rain spout.]]

=== Rain barrels ===
{{main|Rainwater tank}}
[[Rainwater tank]]s, also known as [[rain barrel]]s in North America, are used to collect runoff coming from precipitation to prevent contamination from entering waterways. The only use of water  from rain barrels is used for commercial use such as gardening and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Buying Guide - Rain Barrel Usage Tips - National Geographic's Green Guide|url = http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/green-guide/buying-guides/rain-barrel/usage-tips/|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rain barrels are large containers that are connected to buildings through a gutter system which catches runoff from roofs. Many households use rain barrels as a substitute for a to reduce the amount of water they waste for recreational activities.

=== Rain gardens ===
{{main|Rain garden}}
[[File:Rain garden (2014).JPG|left|thumb|A rain garden is another man-made device by digging a hole in an area and creating a garden with a variety of vegetation. The vegetation helps catch storm-water runoff then filters the water to reduce the pollutants before the water reenters the hydrology cycle.]]A [[Rain garden]] is a depression in the ground covered by vegetation that helps filter and restore freshwater back into the water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Healthy Landscapes: Rain Gardens|url = http://www.uri.edu/ce/healthylandscapes/raingarden.htm|website = www.uri.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-23|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023132556/http://www.uri.edu/ce/healthylandscapes/raingarden.htm|archivedate = 2015-10-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rain gardens are used to decrease the speed of water by capturing the water, so it does not become surface runoff through infiltrating the soil.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Sustainability  ===

Some drains are able to self-maintain through geomorphological equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = TEXTBOOK OF DRAINAGE ENGINEERING|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-dwKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT151&amp;lpg=PT151&amp;dq=catchwater+drains+sustainability&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2ioIFKqkyG&amp;sig=Gr2o3UragGLe5QzmS6wzWNk_UH8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrvIKex8fJAhXF5iYKHRQADi8Q6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=catchwater%2520drains%2520sustainability&amp;f=false|publisher = oxford book company|date = 2014-06-30|isbn = 9789350302057|first = ASHOK KUMAR|last = GUPTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catchwater drains are predominately used for agriculture. Agriculture uses the water to in catchwater drains for irrigation and the use for controlling flooding or other functions to direct large amounts of water away from crops during wet seasons. Catchwater drains also allow communities to wore down the water tables when they need to an allow the retentive of the water table to be restore after times of heavy use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Environmental safety  ===
Catchwater drains need a lot of landscaping and management.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rain gardens|url = http://www.susdrain.org/delivering-suds/using-suds/suds-components/infiltration/rain-gardens.html|website = www.susdrain.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rain gardens are not suitable for steep slopes unlike other types of catchwater drain &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Gardens can get congested and become impervious if land around the garden is not managed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Due to the expense of these systems, they are generally only to be found where there is an extreme shortage of [[freshwater]], because of geographical or political issues.

'''Combe Incorporated''', based in [[White Plains, New York]], is an American privately owned personal-care company founded in 1949 by [[Ivan Combe]].  Combe products are sold in 64 countries on six continents.  [[Ivan Combe]] primarily promotes the brand names instead of the company name. Combe owns the brands [[Just for Men]], [[Sea-Bond]], [[Vagisil]], and [[Grecian Formula]].&lt;ref name="FundingUniverse"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/combe-inc-history/ |title=History of Combe Inc. |work=FundingUniverse |year=2014 |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combe was the originator of the [[Clearasil]] brand but sold the rights to it in 1961 to [[Vicks|Richardson-Vicks]].

In October 2002, Combe acquired J.B. Williams, thereby adding such longtime names as [[Brylcreem]], [[Aqua Velva]] and [[Cepacol]] to its brand stable.

In January 2011, Combe sold its cough remedy and skin care business to [[Reckitt Benckiser]], and its foot care business (including [[Odor-Eaters]]) to [[Blistex]].

The '''Core Cities Health Improvement Collaborative''' is a network established to improve public health in England’s eight biggest regional cities: [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Publications/Core%20Cities%20Health%20Improvement%20Collaborative.html Core Cities Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024052111/http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Publications/Core%20Cities%20Health%20Improvement%20Collaborative.html |date=2010-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Built upon the existing English [[Core Cities Group]] of local authorities, which was established in 1995 to boost the regional economic performance of England’s eight biggest cities outside London, the Health Improvement Collaborative has been established to apply the same spirit of collaboration to tackle health inequalities in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;
Established in 2008 by the chief executives of the 10 [[Primary Care Trusts|NHS primary care trust]] in those eight cities (Birmingham is represented by three trusts), the aim of the collaborative is to engage all parties involved in tackling health inequalities and improving public health. &lt;br /&gt;
Part-funded by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], the group will spend its first two years focusing on tackling six major health inequalities: &lt;br /&gt;
• Alcohol harm&lt;br /&gt;
• All age, all cause early mortality &lt;br /&gt;
• Obesity &lt;br /&gt;
• Mental health and well-being&lt;br /&gt;
• Smoking&lt;br /&gt;
• Teenage pregnancy&lt;br /&gt;
In each case, the primary aim of the Core Cities Health Improvement Collaborative is to promote closer collaboration between the cities and their other stakeholders – such as local authorities, other public sector agencies, voluntary sector organisations and user groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/best-practice/health-improvement-collaboration-top-tips/5009255.article HSJ Resource Centre article on collaboration (Subscribers only)]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Six learning events are being organised to act as a catalyst for further collaborative working on each topic, while a powerful online knowledge management system ensures all stakeholders can quickly and easily identify and share their experience and materials with each other.&lt;br /&gt;
To assist with this process, a consortium of private sector partners has been appointed to facilitate the programme. Managed by Finnamore, the consortium also includes partners from Dr Foster Intelligence, VISTA and SOLACE Enterprises.

'''Echogenic intracardiac focus''' ('''EIF''') is a small bright spot seen in the baby’s heart on an [[ultrasound]] exam.  This is thought to represent mineralization, or small deposits of calcium, in the muscle of the heart. EIFs are found in about 3–5% of normal pregnancies and cause no health problems.

EIFs themselves have no impact on health or heart function. Often the EIF is gone by the third trimester. If there are no problems or [[chromosome]] abnormalities, EIFs are considered normal changes, or variants.

==Association with birth defects==
Researchers have noted an association between an EIF and a chromosome problem in the baby.&lt;ref name="pmid9527573"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bromley B, Lieberman E, Shipp TD, Richardson M, Benacerraf BR |title=Significance of an echogenic intracardiac focus in fetuses at high and low risk for aneuploidy |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=127–31 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9527573 |doi= |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9527573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of chromosome problems that are occasionally seen include trisomy 13 ([[Patau syndrome]]) or trisomy 21 ([[Down syndrome]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9527573"/&gt; In the case of an isolated EIF, and no other ultrasound findings, some studies show that the risk for a chromosome abnormality is approximately two times a woman’s background risk.  Other studies report up to a 1% risk for [[Down syndrome]] when an EIF is seen on a second trimester fetal ultrasound exam.

==A clue to chromosome problems==
An EIF is one clue which can contribute to the chances of a chromosome problem existing. Generally the risks are low if there are no other risk factors. Many babies with chromosome problems do not show any signs on ultrasound. Other factors are discussed in counseling include:
* Mother's age at the expected date of delivery
* The results of the Expanded AFP blood [[triple test]]
* Evidence of other "fetal findings" seen at on the ultrasound that suggest a chromosome problem.

==Options==
The best available evidence suggests that an isolated echogenic intracardiac focus in the fetus of an otherwise low risk woman does not confer an increased risk of fetal aneuploidy. Although some studies have reported that the number or location of echogenic foci affects the risk of fetal aneuploidy (higher risk with biventricular or right ventricular involvement), the general consensus is that these factors have not been proven to matter. When an echogenic intracardiac focus is identified in an otherwise normal second trimester fetus, a normal cell-free DNA test can be very reassuring and obviate the need for invasive testing.

[[Amniocentesis]] is a test to check a baby's chromosomes. A small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains some fetal cells, is removed and tested. Amniocentesis is very accurate; however, there is a [[Amniocentesis#Risks and drawbacks|risk of miscarriage]] which occur in 0.5-1% of women who have amniocentesis&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Amniocentesis/#what-are-the-risks-of-amniocentesis&lt;/ref&gt;. Results take about two weeks.  A normal amniocentesis result means the EIF is not significant and there would be no other concerns about it. That is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy (during the second trimester).

==Summary==
An EIF in the fetal heart may indicate an increased chance of the baby having a chromosome problem. It does not affect the development of the baby or the function of the heart. If the baby has normal chromosomes, there would be no associated problems to be concerned about. No special treatment or tests are needed at delivery.

It is important to remember that with an isolated EIF, chances are strongly in favor of a normal pregnancy outcome, but the patient is entitled to further counseling and testing options.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1700">The '''Ericsson Method''' is a child [[fertilisation|conception]] idea that is reputed to help determine a [[Infant|baby]]'s sex, developed and patented by Dr. [[Ronald Ericsson]].  The method has been in use since the mid-1970s.  Dr. Ericsson maintains that the method is up to 85 percent effective, but some experts question the effectiveness of the method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Experiments with the Ericsson method have determined that the method does not create X- or Y-enriched sperm samples.  Nevertheless, one study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=A.|last2=Ericsson|first2=S.|last3=Osborne|first3=J.|last4=Zack|first4=R.|last5=Drouin|first5=M.|last6=Stephens|first6=S.|title=Female sex selection using clomiphene citrate and albumin separation of human sperm|journal=Hum Reprod|date=1 May 2002|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1254–1256|doi=10.1093/humrep/17.5.1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that, with parents seeking girls, a 71% success rate can be obtained.

The Ericsson method is based on the belief that X-sperm swim slower than Y-sperm.  Sperm are placed atop a "column" of increasingly thicker layers of albumin, and allowed to swim down into the solution. After a certain time period has elapsed, the sperm can be separated into the faster and slower swimmers.  If the couple desires a male baby the faster swimmers are [[artificially inseminated]], and if the couple desires a female baby the same procedure is enacted with the slower swimmers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

This method differs from the [[Shettles method]], which does not utilize [[artificial insemination]].

{{Cite check|date=August 2011}}
Some people abstain from consuming various foods and beverages in conformity with various religious, cultural, legal or other societal prohibitions. Many of these prohibitions constitute [[taboo]]s. Many food taboos and other prohibitions forbid the meat of a particular animal, including mammals, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, which may relate to a [[disgust]] response being more often associated with meats than plant-based foods.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rozin, "Social and Moral Aspects of Food and Eating", In: Rock, I. (ed.), ''The Legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in Cognition and Social Psychology'', New York: Psychology Press. Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prohibitions are specific to a particular part or excretion of an animal, while others forgo the consumption of plants or fungi.

Food prohibitions can be defined as rules, [[Religious law|codified by religion]] or otherwise, about which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to be [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] or prepared. The origins of these prohibitions are varied. In some cases, they are thought to be a result of health considerations or other practical reasons;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin, ''Good to Eat'', {{ISBN|0-04-306002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, they relate to human [[symbolic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary, Purity and Danger, {{ISBN|0-415-28995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some foods may be prohibited during certain religious periods (''e.g.'', [[Lent]]), at certain stages of life (''e.g.'', [[pregnancy]]), or to certain classes of people (''e.g.'', [[priest]]s), even though the food is otherwise permitted. On a comparative basis food taboos seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group may be perfectly acceptable to another. Whether scientifically correct or not, often food taboos are meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community, a food taboo can also lead to the monopolization of a food item by those exempted. A food taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging".&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Rochow | first= Victor Benno | title=Food taboos: their origins and purposes| journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=2009|volume=5:18 | pages=1–10|doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Various religions forbid the consumption of certain types of food. For example, [[Judaism]] prescribes a strict set of rules, called ''[[Kashrut]]'', regarding what may and may not be eaten, and notably forbidding the mixing of meat with dairy products. [[Islamic dietary laws|Islam has similar laws]], dividing foods into ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden) and ''[[halal]]'' (permitted). [[Jainism|Jains]] often follow religious directives to observe [[vegetarianism]]. [[Hindus]] do not eat beef, and some [[Hindu]]s apply the concept of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) to their diet and consider vegetarianism as ideal, and practice forms of vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Institutions and ideologies: a SOAS South Asia reader - 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the process of preparation rather than the food itself comes under scrutiny. For instance, in early medieval Christianity, certain uncooked foods were of dubious status: a [[penitential]] ascribed to [[Bede]] outlined a (mild) penance for those who ate uncooked foods, and [[Saint Boniface]] wrote to [[Pope Zachary]] (in a letter preserved in the [[Codex Vindobonensis 751#The Boniface correspondence|Boniface correspondence]], no. 87) asking him how long [[bacon]] would have to be cured to be proper for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filotas|first=Bernadette|title=Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures|series=Studies and Texts|volume=151|year=2005|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto|isbn=0-88844-151-7|page=349|quote=Failing patristic authority, the pope was somewhat at a loss for an answer, finally deciding that it could be eaten smoked or roasted over the fire (presumably at any time) but, if eaten raw, only after Easter (that is, after curing for a minimum of three months, if the hogs had been slaughtered at the beginning of winter).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kapu]] system was used in [[Hawaii]] until 1819.

Aside from formal rules, there are cultural taboos against the consumption of some animals. Within a given society, some meats will be considered to be not for consumption that are outside the range of the generally accepted definition of a foodstuff. Novel meats, ''i.e.'' animal-derived food products not familiar to an individual or to a culture, generally provoke a [[disgust]] reaction, which may be expressed as a cultural taboo.&lt;ref&gt;Potts HWW (1999), "Human food rejections." PhD thesis, University of London&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although [[dog meat]] is eaten, in certain circumstances, in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is considered inappropriate as a food in Western countries. Likewise, [[horse meat]] is rarely eaten in the [[English-speaking world]], although it is part of the national cuisine of countries as widespread as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].

Sometimes food prohibitions enter national or local law, as with the ban on cattle [[Slaughterhouse|abattoirs]] in most of [[India]], and [[Horse slaughter#United States|horse slaughter]] in the [[United States]]. Even after reversion to Chinese rule, [[Hong Kong]] has not lifted its ban on supplying meat from dogs and cats, imposed during [[British Hong Kong|British colonial rule]].

[[Environmentalism]], [[ethical consumerism]] and other [[Activism|activist]] movements are giving rise to new prohibitions and eating guidelines. A fairly recent addition to cultural food prohibitions is the meat and eggs of [[endangered species]] or animals that are otherwise protected by law or international treaty. Examples of such protected species include some species of whales, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[bird migration|migratory birds]]. Similarly, [[sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification]] discourage the consumption of certain seafoods due to [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable fishing]]. [[Organic certification]] prohibits certain [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemical inputs during food production, or [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[irradiation]], and the use of [[sewage sludge]]. The [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] movement and certification discourage the consumption of food and other goods produced in exploitative working conditions. Other [[social movement]]s generating taboos include [[Local food|Local Food]] and ''[[The 100-Mile Diet]]'', both of which encourage abstinence from non-locally produced food, and [[veganism]], in which adherents endeavour not to use or consume animal products of any kind.

==Prohibited foods==

===Amphibians===
[[File:Bag of frogs legs.jpg|thumb|A bag of frog legs from Vietnam.]]
[[File:Use of eggs, meet, vine is prohibited. Jaisalmeer. 93.jpg|thumb|"Use of eggs, meet, vine is prohibited." [[Jaisalmer]], [[Rajasthan]], India. 1993]]
[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the consumption of [[amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s. The restriction is described in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 11:29-30 and 42-43. Derivative chemical products from amphibians, as well as with other proscribed animals, must be avoided.&lt;ref name=jewish&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/overview-of-jewish-dietary-laws-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cultures, foods such as [[frog legs]] are treasured as delicacies, and the animals may be raised commercially in some circumstances.&lt;ref name=frogs/&gt; However, environmental concerns over the [[Endangered species|endangerment]] of frogs, even possibly pushing them into [[extinction]], due to [[overconsumption]] has prompted legal action in nations such as [[France]] to limit their use in food. The [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|French Ministry of Agriculture]] began taking measures to protect native frog species in 1976, and efforts have continued since. Mass commercial harvesting of the animals was banned in 1980, though international imports as well as private, individual hunting and cooking remains legal in many areas.&lt;ref name=frogs&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/07/frogs-legs-extinction&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bats===
In Judaism, the [[Deuteronomic Code]] and [[Priestly Code]] explicitly prohibit the bat.&lt;ref name=WhatsKosher&gt;[http://www.akhlah.com/jewish-traditions/kosher/kosher-food/ Kosher Food], The Jewish Children's Learning Network, accessed 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Bat meat is haraam (prohibited) in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-web.com/halal-haram/list-of-permitted-and-prohibited-animals/|title=List of Permitted (Halal) And Prohibited (Haram) Animals &amp; Birds|publisher=islamic-web.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-laws-ayatullah-ali-al-husayni-al-sistani/rules-things-allowed-eat-and-drink|title=Rules of Things Allowed to Eat and Drink|at=Issue 2633|publisher=al-islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tusi|first=Muhammad ibn Hasan|title=Concise Description of Islamic Law and Legal Opinions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FO6CBMZU5xgC|year=2008|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=978-1-904063-29-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FO6CBMZU5xgC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;dq=bats 394]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bears===
Bears are not considered [[kosher animals]] in Judaism. Observant [[Jews]] therefore abstain from eating bear meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluethread.com/kashrut/bearnot.html&lt;!--|date=2006-10-04--&gt;|title=Bear meat is not kosher!|website=Bluethread.com|accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[Predation|predatory]] [[terrestrial animal]]s are forbidden in Islam.

===Birds===
The [[Torah]] ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 11:13&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;) explicitly states that the [[eagle]], [[vulture]], and [[osprey]] are not to be eaten. A bird now commonly raised for meat in some areas, the [[ostrich]], is explicitly banned as food in some interpretations of Leviticus 11:16.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis have frequently inferred that the singling out of [[birds of prey]] as well as natural [[scavenger]]s in tradition for prohibition creates a distinction with other avian species; thus, eating [[chickens]], [[ducks]], [[geese]], and [[turkeys]] is allowed.&lt;ref name=jewish/&gt;

In contrast Islamic dietary rules cite the ostrich is permissible to consume, while birds of prey (defined specifically as those who hunt with [[claws]] and [[talons]]) are forbidden.

Scavengers and carrion-eaters such as vultures and [[crow]]s are avoided as food in many cultures because they are perceived as carriers of disease and unclean, and associated with death. An exception is the [[rook (bird)|rook]], which was a recognised country dish, and which has in more recent times been served in a [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish]] restaurant in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/features/display.var.2509759.0.would_you_eat_rook_if_it_was_on_the_menu.php|title=Would you eat rook if it was on the menu|last=Bach|first=Daniel|date=2009-05-22|work=The online Evening Times|publisher=Newsquest (Herald &amp; Times) Limited|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western culture]]s today, most people regard [[songbird]]s as backyard wildlife rather than as food.

A [[balut (food)|balut]] is a developing bird embryo (usually a duck or chicken) that is boiled and eaten from the shell.  Part of the Quran includes understanding and respecting the law that any animal products should not be eaten if the animal has not been slaughtered properly, making the animal or animal-product "maytah".  Because balut is an egg containing a partly-developed embryo, Muslims believe this makes it "haram", or "forbidden".

===Camels===
[[File:07. Camel Profile, near Silverton, NSW, 07.07.2007.jpg|thumb|Dromedary camel]]
The eating of [[camel]]s is strictly prohibited by the Torah in {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|14:7}} and {{bibleref2|Leviticus|11:4}}. The Torah considers the camel unclean because even though it chews the cud, or [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]]—the way bovines, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and giraffes (all of which are [[Kashrut|kosher]]) do—it does not meet the [[cloven hoof]] criterion. Like these animals, camels (and llamas) are [[ruminant]]s with a multi-chambered stomach. Camels are [[Artiodactyla|even-toed ungulates]], with feet split in two. However, a camel's feet form soft pads rather than hard hooves.

In Islam, the eating of camel is allowed, and is indeed traditional in the Islamic heartland in [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] more generally.

===Cats===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
{{Main|Cat meat}}
There is a strong taboo against eating cats in many Western parts of the world, including most of the Americas and Europe.  Cat meat is forbidden by Jewish and Islamic law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/021-smt.php#021.4752|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as both religions forbid the eating of carnivores. Cat meat is eaten as part of uncommon cuisines of China, Vietnam and Switzerland. Cats are commonly regarded as [[pet]]s in Western countries, or as working animals, kept to control vermin, not as a food animal, and consumption of cats is thus seen as a barbaric act by a large part of the population in those countries. Cat meat was eaten, for example, during the famine in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1996, a place that served cat meat was supposedly discovered by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] press in a [[villa miseria|shanty town]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], but in fact the meal had been set up by media from [[Buenos Aires]].

In 2008, it was reported that cats were a staple part of the local diet in [[Guangdong|Guangdong, China]], with many cats being shipped down from the north and one [[Guangzhou]]-based business receiving up to 10,000 cats per day from different parts of China.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Demick, [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/23/world/fg-cats23 Chinese seek to pull cats from the menu], December 23, 2008, Los Angeles Times (page A-5).&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters in other parts of China have urged the Guangdong provincial government to crack down on cat traders and restaurants that serve cat meat, although no law says it is illegal to eat cats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats Protesters urge China province to stop eating cats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100202/http://gmanews.tv/story/140111/Protesters-urge-China-province-to-stop-eating-cats |date=2009-03-04 }}, 18 December 2008, GMA News.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "roof-hare" (roof-rabbit, [[German language|German]] ''Dachhase'') applies to cat meat presented as that of a hare, another small mammal used as a source of meat. Subtracting the skin, feet, head and tail, hare and cat carcasses appear similar. The only way to distinguish them is by looking at the ''processus hamatus'' of the feline [[scapula]], which should have a ''processus suprahamatus''.{{clarify | date = September 2015 | reason = either a language other than English or technical jargon, needs explanation}} ''Dar gato por liebre'' ("to pass off a cat as a hare") is an expression common to many [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], equivalent to "to pull the wool over someone's eyes" derived from this basic scam. There is an equivalent [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] expression ''Comprar gato por lebre'', meaning "to buy a cat as a hare". The expression ''[[churrasco]] de gato'' ("cat barbecue") is largely used in Brazil with a humorous note, especially for roadside stands that offer grilled meat on a stick (often coated with [[farofa]]), due to their poor hygiene and that the source of the meat is mostly unknown. Also, in the [[Philippines]], there is an urban legend and a joke that some vendors use cat meat to make ''[[siopao]]'' (steamed bun), leading some Filipinos to name their pet cats "Siopao". Meanwhile, "kitten cakes" and "buy three [[shawarma]] - assemble a kitten" are common [[Russian language|Russian]] urban [[Russian humour|jokes]] about the suspect origin of food from [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors']] stalls. In English, the common expression refers to what the victim of the trick thinks is happening: "[[Pig in a poke|Buy a pig in a poke.]]"

The inhabitants of [[Vicenza]] in northern [[Italy]] are reputed to eat cats, although the practice has been out of use for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/archive/index.php/t-1002163.html|title=[Ricetta] Gatto alla Vicentina [Archivio]  - Hardware Upgrade Forum|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, a popular Italian gastronome was criticized and suspended from a show for talking about the former practice of eating cat [[stew]] in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;

During the so-called "Bad Times" of hunger in Europe during and after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] "roof-rabbit" was a common food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messybeast.com/eat-cats.htm|title=CATS - FRIEND OR FOOD (1)  WHAT THE WEST SEES, WHAT THE WEST IGNORES|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who thought that they were eating [[Australian rabbit]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/estu/wwi/memoir/Crusaders/Sommers.htm|title=Cecil Sommers.

Some restaurants in the [[Hai Phong]] and [[Hạ Long Bay]] area in north Vietnam advertise cat meat hot pot as "little tiger", and cats in cages can be seen inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/04/news/mn-35903 |title=Vietnamese Learn Why Cats Should Not Be Kept Away |author=David Lamb |date=April 4, 1998 |publisher=Los Angeles Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cattle===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
{{Main|Cattle in religion and mythology}}

Cattle hold a traditional place as objects of reverence in countries such as [[India]]. Many Hindus, particularly [[Brahmin]]s, are vegetarian and strictly abstaining from eating meat. Many of those who do eat meat abstain from the consumption of [[beef]], especially in the north and west India, as the cow holds a sacred place in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Sharpes2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

In contrast to cow slaughter, consumption of [[dairy products]] such as milk, yogurt, and particularly [[ghee]] (a form of [[butter]]) is highly common in India. Cow-derived products play a significant role in [[Hinduism]] with milk particularly being highly revered, often being used in holy ceremonies.&lt;ref name=milk&gt;https://www.tweentribune.com/article/junior/milk-something-special-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cattle|Bullocks]] were the primary source of agricultural power and transportation in the early days, and as India adopted an agricultural lifestyle, the cow proved to be a very useful animal: this respect stemming out of necessity led to abstaining from killing cows for food; for example, if a famine-stricken village kills and eats its bullocks, they will not be available to pull the plough and the cart when next planting season comes. However, this hypothesis has found little data to support it. Areas suffering from famine may resort to consuming cattle in efforts to survive till the next season.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

By Indian law, the slaughter of female cattle (i.e. cows) is banned in almost all [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] except [[Kerala]], [[West Bengal]] and the [[Seven Sister States|seven north eastern states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2945020.stm India targets cow slaughter] by Jyotsna Singh, BBC correspondent in Delhi - Monday, 11 August 2003, 15:52 GMT&lt;/ref&gt; A person involved in either cow slaughter or its illegal transportation could be jailed in many states.&lt;ref name="MP goes tough on cow slaughter"&gt;{{cite news|title=MP goes tough on cow slaughter|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-04/india/30588595_1_animal-preservation-act-jail-term-cow-slaughter-prohibition|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jan 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaughter of cows is an extremely provocative issue for many Hindus.

Many [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] do not eat beef, because of the cow that saved [[Zoroaster]]'s life from murderers when Zoroaster was a baby. Actual [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] texts state that Zoroastrians should be fully vegetarian.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Some ethnic Chinese may also refrain from eating cow meat, because many of them feel that it is wrong to eat an animal that was so useful in agriculture. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhists]] discourage the consumption of beef, although it is not considered taboo. A similar taboo can be seen among [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sinhalese Buddhists]], who consider it to be ungrateful to kill the animal whose milk and labour provides livelihoods to many [[Sinhalese people]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

While both beef and dairy consumption is permitted in Judaism, the mixing of dairy products with any sort of meat is completely forbidden.&lt;ref name=jewish/&gt;

Almost all types of non-[[Fish|piscine]] [[seafood]], such as [[shellfish]], [[lobster]], [[shrimp]] or [[crayfish]], are forbidden by Judaism because such animals live in water but do not have both [[Pterygiophore|fins]] and [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:10-12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, all seafood is permissible in the 3  ''[[madh'hab]]'' of [[Sunni Islam]] except Hanafi school of thought. The [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]] school of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], which is followed by most [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], prohibits non-piscine (lacking scales) seafood (with the exception of shrimp).

===Dairy products===
Milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products are not consumed by vegans due to their animal origin. The consumption of dairy products together with meat is also prohibited as non-kosher in the Jewish faith, based on [[Deuteronomy]] 14:21: "You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."

===Dogs===

Generally in all [[Western world|Western countries]] eating dog meat is considered taboo, though that taboo has been broken under threat of starvation in the past.

In 1937, a meat inspection law targeted against [[trichinella]] was introduced for pigs, dogs, [[boar]]s, foxes, [[badger]]s, and other carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischbeschaugesetz (Meat Inspection Law), § 1a, [http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19370007&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000453&amp;x=16&amp;y=9 RGBl.

According to the ancient [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]] (cf. [[Manusmṛti]] and medicinal texts like [[Sushruta Samhita]]), ''dog's meat'' was regarded as the most unclean (and rather poisonous) food possible. Dog's meat is also regarded as unclean under Jewish and Islamic dietary laws;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|21|4752|s=ns}}, "Ibn 'Abbas reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) prohibited the eating of all fanged beasts of prey, and all the birds having talons."&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, both of those religious traditions also discourage its consumption.

In [[Irish mythology]], legend recounts how [[Cú Chulainn]], the great hero of [[Ulster Cycle|Ulster]], was presented with a [[Morton's fork]], forcing him to either break his ''[[geis]]'' (taboo) about eating dog meat (his name means [[Culann]]'s Hound) or break his taboo about declining hospitality; Cú Chulainn chose to eat the meat, leading ultimately to his death.

In [[Mexico]] during the [[pre-Columbian era]] a hairless dog named [[Mexican Hairless Dog|xoloitzcuintle]] was commonly eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cortés | first = Hernan | others=[[Anthony Pagden]] (trans.)| title = Letters from Mexico | isbn = 0-300-03799-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After colonization, this custom stopped.  Lewis &amp; Clark plus the men in his expedition were recorded in Lewis's journals of having eaten and enjoyed dog meat which was common practice in Indians of the American Plains.

In [[East Asia]], most countries excluding [[Vietnam]], [[North Korea|North]] [[Dog meat consumption in South Korea|and South Korea]] rarely consume dog meat either because of Islamic or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] values or animal rights as in the Philippines. [[Manchu]]s have a prohibition against the eating of dog meat, which is sometimes consumed by the Manchus' neighboring [[Northeast Asia|Northeastern Asian]] peoples. The Manchus also avoid the wearing of hats made of dog's fur. In addition to Manchus, [[Mongols in China|Chinese Mongol]], [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Chinese Muslims|Muslims]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Yao people|Yao]] and [[Yi people|Yi]] have a taboo against dog meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=而是以实际中国少数民族风情录|publisher=中国画报出版社|year=2004|author=春歌}} cited in {{cite web|first=Haiwang|last=Yuan|title=Chinese Ethnicities and Their Culture: An Overview|year=2008|series=DPLS Faculty Publications|work=Paper 23|url=http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlps_fac_pub/23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indonesia]], due to its majority Islamic population, consuming dog meat is prohibited, with exception of Christian [[Batak]] and [[Minahasan]] ethnic groups that traditionally consumed dog meat.

===Eggs===
{{main|Egg as food}}
[[Jainism|Jains]] abstain from eating eggs. [[Veganism|Vegans]] also abstain from eggs, due to their animal origin. Many [[Hindu]] vegetarians also refrain from eating eggs.

An egg that naturally contains a spot of blood may not be eaten under Jewish and Islamic tradition, but eggs without any blood are commonly consumed (and are not considered to be meat, so may be eaten with dairy).&lt;ref name=jewish/&gt;

===Elephants===
[[Buddhist]] monks are forbidden from eating elephant meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf ...The Mah›vagga (Mv.VI.23.9-15) forbids ten kinds of flesh: that of human beings, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephant meat is also not considered Kosher by [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] because elephants do not have [[cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and they are not [[ruminants]].

===Fish===
{{quote|Speak not to me with a mouth that eats fish|Somali nomad taunt&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat not this flesh: food avoidances from prehistory to the present'', (University of Wisconsin Press: 1994), p.253&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the [[Somali people]], most [[Demographics of Somalia|clans]] have a taboo against the consumption of fish, and do not intermarry with the few occupational clans that do eat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick J. |last=Simoons |title=Northwest Ethiopia: peoples and economy? |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1960 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simoons"&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat not this flesh: food avoidances from prehistory to the present'', 1994, p. 261-265, {{ISBN|0-299-14254-X}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=JwGZTQunH00C&amp;pg=PA262 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are taboos on eating fish among many upland [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] and [[Farmer|agriculturalists]] (and even some coastal peoples) inhabiting parts of southeastern [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], and northern [[Tanzania]]. This is sometimes referred to as the "Cushitic fish-taboo", as Cushitic speakers are believed to have been responsible for the introduction of fish avoidance to [[East Africa]], though not all Cushitic groups avoid fish. The zone of the fish taboo roughly coincides with the area where [[Cushitic languages]] are spoken, and as a general rule, speakers of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Semitic languages]] do not have this taboo, and indeed many are watermen.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. E. G. |last=Sutton |title=The Aquatic Civilization of Middle Africa |journal=[[Journal of African History]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |year=1974 |page=542 |jstor=180989 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] groups in East Africa that do practice fish avoidance also reside in areas where [[Kingdom of Kush|Cushites]] appear to have lived in earlier times. Within East Africa, the fish taboo is found no further than Tanzania. This is attributed to the local presence of the [[tsetse fly]] and in areas beyond, which likely acted as a barrier to further southern migrations by [[Nomadic pastoralism|wandering pastoralists]], the principal fish-avoiders. [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]'s Bantus were therefore spared subjugation by pastoral groups, and they consequently nearly all consume fish.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

There is also another center of fish avoidance in [[Southern Africa]], among mainly [[Bantu languages|Bantu speakers]]. It is not clear whether this disinclination developed independently or whether it was introduced. It is certain, however, that no avoidance of fish occurs among southern Africa's earliest inhabitants, the [[Khoisan]]. Nevertheless, since the Bantu of southern Africa also share various cultural traits with the pastoralists further north in East Africa, it is believed that, at an unknown date, the taboo against the consumption of fish was similarly introduced from East Africa by cattle-herding peoples who somehow managed to get their livestock past the aforementioned tsetse fly endemic regions.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

Certain species of fish are also forbidden in Judaism such as the freshwater [[eel]] ([[Anguillidae]]) and all species of [[catfish]]. Although they live in water, they appear to have no scales (except under a microscope) (see Leviticus 11:10-13&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:10-13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Sunni Muslim laws are more flexible in this. Catfish and shark are generally seen as halal as they are special types of fish. Eel is generally considered permissible in the four Sunni ''madh'hab.'' The Ja'fari jurisprudence followed by most Shia Muslims forbid all species of fish that does not have scales, it also forbid all shell fish species except prawns.&lt;ref&gt;

Many tribes of the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Navajo people|Navaho]], [[Apache]], and [[Zuni people|Zuñi]], have a taboo against fish and other water-related animals, including [[waterfowl]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Matthews, "Ichthyophobia" ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''11''':41 (April–June, 1898), pp. 105-112 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/533215 at JSTOR]{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norse settlements in Greenland|Norse settlers in Greenland]] (10th–15th centuries AD) developed a taboo against fish consumption, as recounted in [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''. This is unusual, as [[Norsemen]] did not generally have a taboo against fish, Diamond noting that "Fish bones account for much less than 0.1% of animal bones recovered at Greenland Norse archeological sites, compared to between 50 and 95% at most contemporary [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]], and [[Shetland]] sites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2004/12/norse_fish_upda.html |title=Matthew Yglesias: Norse Fish Update |publisher=Yglesias.typepad.com |accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2017}}

===Animal Fetuses===
Many countries observe this as a delicacy but it is a taboo in most countries. Considered as corpses, fetuses of goats and sheep are a delicacy in parts of India, China and Vietnam. Known as "[[kutti pi]]"&lt;ref name=NatGeoTab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0419_040419_TVfoodtaboo_2.html|title=National Geographic Taboo Foods: It's All a Matter of Taste|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=July 5, 2016|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (fetus bag), this is prepared to become a soup or a spicy curry. With only the intestines removed, the fetus is slow cooked for a few minutes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Fungi and plants===
Vedic [[Brahmins]], Gaudiya [[Vaishnavas]], [[tantriks]] and some [[Buddhist]] priests abstain from [[Fungus|fungi]] and all vegetables of the [[onion]] family ([[Alliaceae]]). They believe that these excite damaging passions.&lt;ref name=krishnaprohibited&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.salagram.net/Onions-Garlic-in-relation2Vaishnavism.html#prohibited |title=Onions and Garlic in relation to the practices of Vaishnavism |publisher=New Zealand Hare Krishna Spiritual Resource Network |accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Indian traditions, plants of the onion family, and effectively all overwintering plants are considered taboo. This is possibly due to the influence of Jain traditions. In Jain traditions, bad karma is generated with all forms of killing, including that of plants. Hierarchy of living creatures is based on the number of senses they possess. In this hierarchy, overwintering plants such as onions are ranked higher than other food crops such as wheat and rice. The ability of onions to observe the changing of the seasons and bloom in spring is believed to be an additional 'sense' absent in lower plants. The amount of bad karma generated depends on the number of senses the creature possesses. Therefore, it is thought best to avoid eating onions. Fungi are eschewed as they grow at night.

In [[Iceland]], rural parts of Sweden and Western Finland, although not taboo, [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]] were not widely eaten before the Second World War. They were viewed as a food for [[cow]]s and were also associated with the stigma of being a wartime and [[famine food|poverty food]]. This is a marked contrast to the ancient Romans, who considered the mushroom a [[delicacy]] of the highest order and held it in high regard as food fit for [[emperor]]s.

===Guinea pig and related rodents===
[[File:Peru Guinea Pig.jpg|thumb|Roast guinea pig (''Cavia porcellus'') in Peru]]
[[Guinea pig]]s, or ''cuy'', are commonly eaten in Peru, in the southwestern cities and villages of [[Colombia]], and among some populations in the highlands of [[Ecuador]], mostly in the [[Andes]] highlands.&lt;ref name=morales&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morales | first = Edmundo | title = The Guinea Pig : Healing, Food, and Ritual in the Andes | publisher = University of Arizona Press |year=1995 | isbn = 0-8165-1558-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuyes can be found on the menu of restaurants in [[Lima]] and other cities in Peru, as well as in [[Pasto]], Colombia.

Horse meat is part of the cuisine of countries as widespread as Italy, with an average of 900 grams consumed per person annually; [[Belgium]], France, [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]], where horse meat is common in supermarkets; [[Germany]] with only 50 grams consumed per person on average annually. It is still sold in some specialized butcher shops in eastern [[Austria]], and also eaten in [[Polynesia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Serbia]],&lt;ref name="konjsko meso"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.konjsko-meso.rs/onama.html |title=A Proof|website=Konjsko-meso.rs |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Slovenia/Mestna_Obcina_Ljubljana/Ljubljana-688015/Restaurants-Ljubljana-Hot_Horse-BR-1.html|title=Hot Horse, Ljubljana|work=VirtualTourist.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, but is taboo in some religions and many countries. It is forbidden by [[613 Mitzvot|Jewish law]], because the horse is not a ruminant, nor does it have cloven hooves. Similarly to dogs, eating horses was a taboo for the [[Castro culture]] in Northwestern [[Portugal]], and it is still a counter-cultural practice in the region.&lt;ref name="subtus133"&gt;Flores Gomes, José Manuel &amp; Carneiro, Deolinda: ''Subtus Montis Terroso''. Câmara Municipal da Póvoa de Varzim (2005), "Economia e ergologia", pp.133-187&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse meat is forbidden by some sects of [[Christianity]]. In 732, [[Pope Gregory III]] instructed Saint Boniface to suppress the [[Paganism|pagan]] practice of eating horses, calling it a "filthy and abominable custom".&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Hillgarth, ''Christianity and paganism, 350-750: the conversion of Western Europe'', p. 174. {{ISBN|0-8122-1213-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmnHvAZJtYsC&amp;pg=PA174 cited page]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christianisation of Iceland]] in 1000 AD was achieved only when the Church promised that [[Icelanders]] could continue to eat horsemeat; once the Church had consolidated its power, the allowance was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, ''The North Atlantic Saga: Being the Norse Voyages of Discovery and Settlement to Iceland, Greenland, and North America'', Oxford University Press, 1986, pp. 149-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Horsemeat is still popular in Iceland and is sold and consumed in the same way as beef, [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and pork.

In [[Islam]], opinions vary as to the permissibility of horse meat. Some cite a [[hadith]] forbidding it to Muslims, but others doubt its validity and authority. Wild horses are generally seen as halal while domesticated horses and asses are viewed as forbidden. Various Muslim cultures have differed in the attitude in eating the meat. Historically, Turks and Persians have eaten the meat, while in North Africa this is rare.

Horse meat consumption is modestly counter-cultural in the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Canada, horse meat is legal. Most Canadian horse meat is exported to [[Continental Europe]] or Japan.

Of all the taboo meat, human flesh ranks as the most heavily proscribed. In recent times humans have consumed the flesh of fellow humans in rituals and out of insanity, hatred, or overriding hunger – never as a common part of their diet, but it is thought that the practice was once widespread among all humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-TVHr_XtDJcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=paleolithic+cannibalism|title= Once were Cannibals |work=Evolution: A Scientific American Reader|author=Tim D white |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-74269-4 |author2=American, Scientific |date=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of human flesh is forbidden by Hinduism.&lt;ref name="DyalCarpenter1996"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Donald H.

Catholics, Lutherans, and Orthodox Christians do not view themselves as engaging in cannibalism when taking [[Eucharist|communion]], although the bread and wine are believed to become "of the same substance" as the [[Blessed Sacrament|body and blood of Christ]] before being consumed, they remain bread and wine in all ways to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;

* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603196/transubstantiation transubstantiation], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics refer to this as [[transubstantiation]]; the Orthodox believe the change occurs, but hesitate to attempt a description of the mechanism, believing it to be a [[sacred mystery]].

Cannibalism used to be required in certain tribes; the [[Fore people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] were particularly well-studied in their eating of the dead, because it led to [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], a disease believed to be transmitted by [[prion]]s. In the book ''Daily life in China, on the eve of the Mongol invasion, 1250-1276'' [[Jacques Gernet]] refers to restaurants that specialized in human flesh. From the context, it does not appear that this was a freak event associated with famine.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Insects===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
{{See also|Entomophagy|Category:Insects as food}}
In Judaism and within other groups following the Hebrew Torah certain [[locust]]s are allowed as food (Leviticus 11:22 and Matthew 3:4). Except for certain locusts and related species, [[insect]]s are not considered [[Kosher foods]]; dietary laws also require that practitioners check food carefully for insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosherquest.org/book.php?id=INSECTS_IN_FOOD.htm |title=Is it Kosher? - KosherQuest |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065113/http://www.kosherquest.org/book.php?id=INSECTS_IN_FOOD.htm |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam locusts are considered lawful food along with fish that do not require ritual slaughtering.

[[Honey]] is concentrated [[nectar]] and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] which has been [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] by [[bee]]s. It is considered kosher even though [[honey bee]]s are not, an apparent exception to the normal rule that products of an unclean animal are also unclean. This topic is covered in the [[Talmud]] and is explained to be permissible on the grounds that the bee does not originally make the honey, the flower does, while the bees store and dehydrate the liquid into honey. This is different to [[royal jelly]], which is produced by bees directly and is considered non-Kosher.

Some vegans also avoid honey as they would any other [[animal product]].

[[File:Ikizukuri.jpg|thumb|[[Ikizukuri]], live fish served as sashimi.]]

===Kangaroo===
[[Kangaroo meat]] is banned in the U.S. state of [[California]]. The ban was first imposed in 1971; a moratorium was put in place in 2007, allowing the importation of the meat, but the ban was re-enacted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/14/california-set-to-ban-kangaroo-imports-despite-lobbying-efforts-by-australia California set to ban kangaroo imports despite lobbying efforts by Australia], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettuce===
Lettuce is taboo to the [[Yazidis]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-who-are-the-yazidis-30280 |title=Explainer: who are the Yazidis? |author=Christine Allison |date=8 August 2014 |work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living animals===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
Islamic, Judaic law (including [[Seven Laws of Noah|Noahide Law]]), and some laws of some Christians forbid any portion that is cut from a live animal ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; as interpreted in the Talmud, [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 59a&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_59.html|title=Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin 59|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Judaism restricts this prohibition to land animals and birds; fish do not require [[Shechita|kosher slaughter]], but must first be killed before being eaten. &lt;!--The qualification that this is an interpretation of the Talmud is necessary, because the Genesis text says only "But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it." This seems to means the same as Leviticus 7:26 "You are not to eat any blood", Deuteronomy 12:23 "Only be sure not to eat the blood", Deuteronomy 12:16 "Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water." etc., namely a prohibition to consume blood (cf. kosher methods of slaughter and meat preparation). http://bible.cc/genesis/9-4.htm.--&gt;

Examples of the eating of animals that are still alive include [[eating live seafood]], such as "raw [[oyster]] on the half shell" and [[ikizukuri]] (live fish). [[Sashimi]] using live animals has been banned in some countries. Practices such as ''Ikizukuri'' are prohibited in Judaism under the law forbidding [[Tza'ar ba'alei chayim|unnecessary pain to animals]].

Another example occurs in [[Shanghai]], China, and surrounding areas, where live shrimp is a common dish served both in homes and restaurants. The shrimp are usually served in a bowl of alcohol, which makes the shrimp [[drunken shrimp|sluggish and complacent]].

Related may be the revulsion in Western cultures around eating fertilized partly developed eggs ([[balut (food)|balut]]) consumed in parts of Southeast Asia.

=== Monkey ===
{{See also|Monkey brains|Carne de chango}}
Monkey brains is a dish consisting of, at least partially, the [[brain]] of some species of [[monkey]] or [[ape]]. In [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] popular culture, its consumption is repeatedly portrayed and debated, often in the context of portraying exotic cultures as exceptionally cruel, callous, and/or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taboo Table Offerings: The Intricacies of Intercultural Menu Planning |url=http://www.etiquetteinternational.com/Articles/TableOfferings.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305000453/http://www.etiquetteinternational.com/Articles/TableOfferings.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monkeys are revered animals in India, largely because of the monkey god [[Hanuman]]. Most vegetarian Hindus do not eat any kind of meat, including monkeys. Meat eating Indians also do not kill or eat monkeys. Killing and eating monkeys (or other animals which are considered wild) is a taboo and illegal in India.

===Offal===
[[File:MarketScene.jpg|thumb|Heads, [[Brain (as food)|brains]], trotters and tripe on sale in an Istanbul market.]]
[[File:Khash 1.jpg|thumb|[[Kale Pache]], a traditional soup made with lamb's head (including brain, eyes and tongues) and hooves in [[Iran]].]]
[[Offal]] is the internal organs of butchered animals, and may refer to parts of the carcass such as the head and feet ("trotters") in addition to organ meats such as [[sweetbread]]s and [[kidney]]. Offal is a traditional part of many [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine]]s, including such dishes as the [[steak and kidney pie]] in the United Kingdom or [[Callos|''callos a la madrileña'']] in Spain. [[Haggis]] has been [[Scotland]]'s [[national dish]] since the time of [[Robert Burns]]. In northeast Brazil, there is a similar dish to haggis called "''buchada''", made with goats' stomach.&lt;ref&gt;
* Fried lamb kidneys or lamb's liver are popular breakfast foods in Ireland, mentioned in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]], and are usually eaten as part of a [[Mixed grill|mixed fry or "grill"]] on weekends.
* In France and Spain, eating [[calf's brains]] is common. In [[Western Norway]], lamb head, known as ''[[smalahove]]'', is a considered a delicacy and traditionally consumed before [[Christmas]]. A similar dish of lamb's head, ''[[svið]]'', is today commonly eaten in [[Iceland]], although it was originally only consumed during the lean times of late winter/early spring in Iceland, known as ''[[Þorrablót]]''. [[Magaj]], an offal dish containing cow, goat or sheep brain is considered to be a delicacy in South Asia, while [[Paya (Food)|Paya]], a traditional breakfast dish of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India made with cow, goat or lamb hooves is also popular.{{Cite book |title=Goat meat cookery |publisher=Senac |year=2005 |isbn=978-85-7458-201-6 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4DhWUEcYrdkC&amp;pg=PA129 129], [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DhWUEcYrdkC&amp;pg=PA137 books.google.com] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DhWUEcYrdkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for heart, [[Beef tongue|tongue (beef)]], [[liver]] (chicken, beef, or pork), and intestines used as natural [[sausage]] [[Casing (sausage)|casings]], organ meats consumed in the U.S. tend to be regional or ethnic specialities; for example, [[tripe]] as ''[[Menudo (soup)|menudo]]'' or ''[[sopa de mondongo|mondongo]]'' among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos and Hispanos]], [[chitterlings]] in the [[Southern United States]], [[scrapple]] on the Eastern Seaboard, [[fried-brain sandwich]]es in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and beef [[testicle]]s called [[Rocky Mountain oysters]] or "prairie oysters" in the west. In Argentina and other Spanish language countries bull's testicles are served as ''huevos de toro'' or 'bull's eggs'.

In some regions, such as the [[European Union]], [[Brain (food)|brains]] and other organs which can transmit [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] ("mad cow disease") and similar diseases have now been banned from the [[food chain]] as [[specified risk material]]s.

Although eating the stomach of a goat, cow, sheep, or buffalo might be taboo,{{where |date=April 2018}} ancient [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] techniques utilize stomachs (which contain [[rennet]]) for turning [[milk]] into [[cheese]], a potentially taboo process. Newer techniques for making cheese include a chemical process with artificial rennet. This means that the ''process'' by which cheese is made (and not the cheese itself) is a factor in determining whether it is forbidden or allowed by strict vegetarians.

===Pigs/pork===
{{Main|Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork}}
[[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) data reports [[pork]] as the most widely eaten meat in the world. Consumption of pigs is forbidden in Islam, Judaism and certain [[Christian denomination]]s, such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. This prohibition is set out in the holy texts of the religions concerned, e.g. [[Qur'an]] 16:115,&lt;ref name="cite quran|16|115|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|16|115|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leviticus 11:7-8&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:7-8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Deuteronomy 14:8.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pigs were also taboo in at least three other cultures of the ancient Middle East: the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns.&lt;ref name="Abominable Pig" /&gt;  In some instances, the taboo extended beyond eating pork, and it was also taboo to touch or even look at pigs.&lt;ref name="Abominable Pig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden Bough"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frazer |first=James George |title=[[The Golden Bough]] |authorlink=James George Frazer |edition=A new abridgement from the second and third editions |year=1994 |publisher=OUP |pages=486–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original reason for this taboo is debated. [[Maimonides]] seems to have thought the uncleanness of pigs was self-evident, but mentions with particular aversion their propensity to eat feces.&lt;ref name="Abominable Pig" /&gt;  In the 19th century some people attributed the pig taboo in the [[Middle East]] to the danger of the parasite [[trichinosis|trichina]], but this explanation is now out of favour.&lt;ref name="Abominable Pig" /&gt; [[James George Frazer]] suggested that in ancient Israel, Egypt and Syria, the pig was originally a sacred animal, which for that reason could not be eaten or touched; the taboo survived to a time when the pig was no longer regarded as sacred, and was therefore explained by reference to its being unclean.&lt;ref name="Golden Bough" /&gt;

More recently, [[Marvin Harris]] posited that pigs are not suited for being kept in the Middle East on an ecological and socio-economical level; for example, pigs are not suited to living in arid climates and thus require more water than other animals to keep them cool, and instead of grazing they compete with humans for foods such as grains. As such, raising pigs was seen as a wasteful and decadent practice.&lt;ref name="Abominable Pig"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Martin |editor=Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik |year=1997 |title=The Abominable Pig |work=Food and Culture |pages=67–79 |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another explanation offered for the taboo is that pigs are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], not discerning between meat or vegetation in their natural dietary habits. The willingness to consume meat sets them apart from most other domesticated animals which are commonly eaten (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) who would naturally eat only plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soler |first=Jean |editor=Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik |year=1997 |title=The Semiotics of Food in the Bible |work=Food and Culture |pages=55–66 |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Douglas]] has suggested that the reason for the taboo against the pig in Judaism is three-fold: (i) it trangresses the category of ungulates, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, (ii) it eats carrion and (iii) it was eaten by non-Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=Mary |editor=Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik |year=1997 |title=Deciphering a Meal |work=Food and Culture |pages=36–54 |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poppy seed===
{{main|Poppy seed}}
[[Poppy seed]]s are used as condiments in many cultures. In [[Singapore]], poppy seeds are classified as "prohibited goods" by the [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] (CNB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I would like to know if I am allowed to bring poppy seeds into Singapore for my baking business|url=http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/CNB/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx#FAQ_4013|website=Ifaq.gov.sg|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbit===
[[File:Rabbit edit.jpg|thumb|[[Cottontail rabbit]]]]
The book of Leviticus in the [[Bible]] classifies the [[rabbit]] as [[unclean animals|unclean]] because it does not have a split hoof, even though it does chew and reingest partially digested material (equivalent to "chewing the cud" among ruminants).&lt;ref&gt;

===Rats and mice===
{{further|Rat#As food|Mouse#As food}}
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
In most Western cultures, [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]] are considered either unclean [[vermin]] or pets and thus unfit for human consumption, traditionally being seen as carriers of [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. However, rats are commonly eaten in rural Thailand and Vietnam and other parts of [[Indochina]]. [[Cane rat]]s (''[[Greater Cane Rat|Thryonomys swinderianus]]'' and ''[[Lesser Cane Rat|Thryonomys gregorianus]]'') and some species of [[Apodemus|field mice]] are a rich source of protein in Africa. [[Bamboo rat]]s are also commonly eaten in the poorer parts of Southeast Asia.

In [[Ghana]], ''Thryonomys swinderianus'' locally referred to as "Akrantie", "Grasscutter" and (incorrectly) as "[[Aethomys|Bush rat]]" is a common food item. The proper common name for this rodent is "Greater Cane Rat", though actually it is not a rat at all and is a close relative of [[porcupine]]s and guinea pigs that inhabit [[Africa]], south of the [[Sahara|Saharan Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/21847/all |title=Thryonomys swinderianus |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the U.S. barred the import of this and other rodents from Africa because of an outbreak of at least nine human cases of [[monkeypox]], an illness never before been seen in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=37659 |title=US Bars Imports of "Akrantie" |date=12 June 2003 |publisher=ghanaweb.com |accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, rats and mice have also been eaten in the West during times of shortage or emergency, such as during the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] and the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|Siege of Paris]]. [[Dormouse|Dormice]] were also domesticated and raised for food in [[Ancient Rome]] and by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]; to this day the [[edible dormouse]] (''Glis glis'') is considered a rare delicacy in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split-%C5%BEupanija/tabid/76/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/282603/Default.aspx|title=Bizarre Foods promoting Dalmatia (in Croatian)|author=Siniša Jović in Split|date=19 April 2015|work=slobodnadalmacija.hr|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Asian countries, mice are eaten, and go by the name of [[vole]]. In France, rats bred in the wine stores of [[Gironde]] were cooked with the fire of broken wine barrels and eaten, dubbed as ''cooper's entrecôte''. In some communities the [[muskrat]] (which is not a rat at all) is hunted for its meat (and fur) in e.g. some parts of [[Flanders]] where it is served as ''waterkonijn'' (water rabbit). See also under "[[Taboo food and drink#Fish|Fish]]" for consumption of [[beaver]] tails. [[Coypu|Nutria]], another large rodent, has been hunted or raised for food in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0619/p20s01-sten.html |title=Backstory: Accidental tourist on the run |date=2006-06-19 |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rats were also traditionally consumed by certain communities in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/xyz/1/307881.html |title= The rat-eaters of Bihar |date=15 October 1992 |publisher=India Today |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/outcasts-india-who-are-rat-eaters-musahar-1447936|title= The Rat Eaters of Musahar: The Outcasts of India |date=9 May 2015|publisher=International Business Times |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of any sort of rodent, or material originating from rodents, is forbidden in Judaism.&lt;ref name=jewish/&gt;

===Reptiles===
Islam strictly forbids the consumption of [[reptile]]s, such as [[crocodile]]s and [[snake]]s. Eating reptiles is also forbidden in Judaism.&lt;ref name=jewish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/307920/jewish/Kosher-Foods.htm|title=What Foods are Kosher?|publisher=Oxford Chabad Society|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, foods such as [[alligator]] are treasured as delicacies, and the animals are [[Crocodile farm|raised commercially]].

===Snails===
As they are [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[snails]] are not [[kosher]]. Snails are not allowed to be eaten in Islam because it is not [[Halal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Vegetables===
In certain versions of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]] are restricted according to Shastras. Many Hindus discourage eating onion and garlic along with non-vegetarian food during festivals or [[Hindu calendar|Hindu holy months]] of Shrawan, puratassi and Kartik. However, shunning onion and garlic is not very popular among Hindus as compared to avoiding non-vegetarian foods, so many people do not follow this custom.

[[Jain vegetarianism|Jains]] not only abstain from consumption of meat, but also do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] (such as carrots, potatoes, radish, turnips, etc) as doing so kills the plant and they believe in [[ahimsa]].

Chinese [[Buddhist cuisine]] traditionally prohibits [[garlic]], ''[[Allium chinense]]'', [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], and ''[[Allium victorialis]]'' (victory onion or mountain leek), while [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] Brahmins forbid "strong flavored" foods. This encompasses garlic, onion, and spices such as [[black pepper]] and [[chili pepper]], believing that pungent flavors on the tongue inflame the baser emotions.

In [[Yazidi]]sm, the eating of [[lettuce]] and [[Phaseolus lunatus|butter beans]] is taboo. The Muslim religious teacher and scholar, Falah Hassan Juma, links the sect's belief of evil found in lettuce to its long history of persecution by Muslims and Christians. Historical theory claims one ruthless potentate who controlled the city of [[Mosul]] in the 13th century ordered an early Yazidi saint executed. The enthusiastic crowd then pelted the corpse with heads of lettuce.

The [[Pythagoreanism|followers of Pythagoras]] were vegetarians, and "Pythagorean" at one time came to mean "vegetarian". However, [[Pythagorean diet|their creed]] prohibited the eating of beans. The reason is unclear: perhaps the [[flatulence]] they cause, perhaps as protection from potential [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|favism]], but most likely for [[Magic and religion|magico-religious]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;

Vegetables like [[broccoli]] and [[cauliflower]], while not taboo, may be avoided by observant Jews and other religions due to the possibility of insects or worms hiding within the numerous crevices. Likewise, fruits such as [[blackberry|blackberries]] and [[raspberry|raspberries]] are recommended by kashrut agencies to be avoided as they cannot be cleaned thoroughly enough without destroying the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kof-k.org/BugBrochure_SPREADSKofK.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930073742/http://www.kof-k.org/BugBrochure_SPREADSKofK.pdf|date=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian dish]] [[mulukhiyah]], a soup whose primary ingredient is [[jute]] leaves (which leaves did not have any other culinary purpose), was banned by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] sometime during his reign (996-1021 CE). The ban applied specifically to mulukhiyah, and also to other foodstuffs said to be eaten by Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Himmich|first=Ben Salem |title=The theocrat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27I3l-dCjZEC|year=2005|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-424-897-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=27I3l–dCjZEC&amp;pg=PA21 21]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ban was eventually lifted after the end of his reign, the [[Druze]], who hold Al-Hakim in high regard and give him quasi-divine authority, continue to respect the ban, and do not eat ''mulukhiyah'' of any kind to this day.

===Whales===
{{Main|Whale meat}}
[[File:Whale blubber.jpg|thumb|Inuit [[Muktuk]] or raw [[whale blubber]]]]
Sunni Islam permits Muslims to consume the flesh of whales that have died of natural causes as there is a famous Sunni hadith which cites Muhammad's approval of such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|21|4756|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whale meat is forbidden (haram) in Shia Islam as whales do not have scales. In much of the world whale meat is not eaten due to the endangerment of whales but it is not traditionally forbidden.

==Prohibited drinks==

===Alcohol===
{{See also|Christianity and alcohol|Islam and alcohol}}
Some religions – including Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gudorf|first=Christine E.|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: Everyday Decisions for Our Everyday Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoR-AwAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-2621-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CoR-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 35]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam, Jainism, [[Rastafari movement]], [[Bahá'í Faith]], and various branches of Christianity such as the [[Baptists]], the [[Church of God In Christ]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter-day Saints]], Seventh-day Adventists and the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] – forbid or discourage the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

The Hebrew Bible describes a [[Nazirite]] vow ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:1-21&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|6:1-21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that includes [[abstinence]] from alcohol, specifically [[wine]] and probably [[Barley wine|barley beer]] (according to the [[Septuagint]] translation and the [[Bauer lexicon]]: ''σικερα'', from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] shikaru, for ''barley beer)''. The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translation is: "wine and any other intoxicant". Other versions such as the NIV prohibit both alcohol and all alcohol derived products such as wine vinegar. There is no general taboo against alcohol in Judaism.

There are also cultural taboos against the consumption of alcohol, reflected for example in the [[Teetotalism]] or [[Temperance movement]]. There is also something of a cultural taboo in several countries, against the consumption of alcohol by women during pregnancy for health reasons, as seen, for example, which in the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]] by [[International Labour Conference|ILO]].

===Blood===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Blood]] and [[Blood as food]]--&gt;
{{See also|Blood as food}}
[[File:Dinuguan.jpg|thumb|A bowl of ''[[dinuguan]]'', a Filipino stew with pork blood]]
Some religions prohibit drinking or eating blood or food made from blood. In Islam the consumption of blood is prohibited ([[haram|''Haraam'']]). ''[[Halal]]'' animals should be properly slaughtered to drain out the blood. Unlike in other traditions, this is not because blood is revered or holy, but simply because blood is considered [[ritually unclean]] or ''[[Najis]]'', with certain narratives prescribing [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (in the case of no availability of water) if contact is made with it. In Judaism all mammal and bird meat (not fish) is [[Salting (food)|salted]] to remove the blood. Jews follow the teaching in Leviticus,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10-14|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; that since "the life of the animal is in the blood", no person may eat (or drink) the blood. [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] and [[Jehovah's Witness]]es prohibit eating or drinking any blood.&lt;ref&gt;Bible verses considered relevant to blood transfusions include {{bibleverse||Acts|15:20|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:29|9}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:25|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bible, blood is only to be used for special or sacred purposes in connection with worship ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapters 12, 24, 29, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:29 and [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|12|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|24|9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|29|9}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:28|9}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:22}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]], Christians, both former Jews (the [[Jewish Christians]]), and new [[Gentile]] converts, were in dispute as to which particular features of [[Mosaic law (disambiguation)|Mosaic law]] were to be retained and upheld by them. The [[Apostolic Decree]] suggested that, among other things, it was necessary to abstain from consuming blood:

{{quote|For it seemed good to the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]], and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;

That ye abstain from meats offered to [[idolatry|idols]], and from blood, and from things strangled, and from [[fornication]]: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well, Fare ye well.|{{bibleverse||Acts|15:28-29|KJV}}}}

===Coffee and tea===
"[[Word of Wisdom#Hot drinks|Hot drinks]]" are taboo for members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref name="MormonDrink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89/1-9#1|title=Doctrine and Covenants 89 Verse 9|accessdate=2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is misleading as the ban is applied exclusively to [[coffee]] and [[tea]] (i.e. not [[Hot chocolate|hot cocoa]] or [[herbal tea]]s). The [[Word of Wisdom]], a code of health used by church members, outlines prohibited and allowed substances. While not banned, some [[Mormon]]s avoid [[caffeine]] in general, including [[cola]] drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.about.com/library/weekly/aa121202a.htm|title=Christianity - Latter-day Saints: Cola Drinks and Caffeine|publisher=about.com|accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-news--getting-it-right-august-29 |title=Mormonism in the News: Getting It Right &amp;#124; August 29 |website=Mormonnewsroom.org |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ldsliving.com/story/70005-did-the-lds-church-officially-ok-caffeine |title=Did the LDS Church officially 'OK' caffeine? |website=LDSLiving.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54797595-78/church-drinks-caffeine-lds.html.csp |title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive |publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] also generally avoid caffeinated drinks.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There is a widely reported story, possibly apocryphal, that some Catholics urged [[Pope Clement VII]] (1478 – 1534) to ban coffee, calling it "devil's beverage". After tasting the beverage, the Pope is said to have remarked that the drink was "... so delicious that it would be a sin to let only misbelievers drink it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Winston W Borden | title=Ruminations|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeQX1yVnWeMC|year=2007|publisher=Ruminations.

===Human breast milk===
While [[human breast milk]] is universally accepted for [[Breastfeeding|infant nutrition]], some cultures see the consumption of breast milk after weaning as taboo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2010/03/09/moos.breast.milk.cheese.cnn?hpt=C2 Jeanne Moos ''Chest Cheese''], CNN Video on breast milk cheese&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Froin's syndrome''' – coexistence of [[xanthochromia]], high protein level and marked [[coagulation]] of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). It is caused by meningeal irritation (e.g. during [[meningitis|spinal meningitis]]) and CSF flow blockage by [[spinal tumor|tumour mass]] or [[abscess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Govindarajan|first=R|author2=Khan, T|title=Froin's syndrome: an uncommon mimicker of Guillain–Barre syndrome.|journal=European Spine Journal|date=August 2012|volume=21|issue=8|pages=1674–5|pmid=22447409|doi=10.1007/s00586-012-2277-0|pmc=3535231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stagnation of the CSF within the [[thecal sac]] facilitates [[exudation]] from the tumour itself and activation of [[coagulation factor]]s. A clinical test formerly used for evaluation of [[spinal stenosis]] is [[Queckenstedt's maneuver]]. Nowadays, a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] is used for identification of CSF flow obstruction. It often shows the prolongation of [[Spin–lattice relaxation|T1]] and [[Spin–spin relaxation|T2 signal]] in CSF [[caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] to a level of block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirza|first=S|author2=Adams, WM|author3=Corkhill, RA|title=Froin's syndrome revisited, 100 years on.

In the United States, a '''health maintenance organization''' ('''HMO''') is a medical insurance group that provides health services for a fixed annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2000/us_elections/glossary/g-i/652064.stm|title=BBC News - G-I - Health Maintenance Organization / HMO|author=|date=|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an organization that provides or arranges [[managed care]] for [[health insurance]], [[self-funded health care]] benefit plans, individuals, and other entities, acting as a liaison with [[health care provider]]s (hospitals, doctors, etc.) on a prepaid basis. The [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified HMO options if the employer offers traditional healthcare options.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L. Dorsey, "The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973(P.L. 93-222)and Prepaid Group Practice Plan," Medical Care, Vol. 13, No. 1, (Jan., 1975), pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional [[indemnity]] insurance, an HMO covers care rendered by those doctors and other professionals who have agreed by contract to treat patients in accordance with the HMO's guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of customers. HMOs cover emergency care regardless of the health care provider's contracted status.

== Operation ==
HMOs often require members to select a [[primary care physician]] (PCP), a doctor who acts as a "[[gatekeeper]]" to direct access to medical services but this is not always the case. PCPs are usually [[internist]]s, [[pediatrician]]s, [[family doctor]]s, [[geriatrician]]s, or [[general practitioner]]s (GPs). Except in medical emergency situations, patients need a referral from the PCP in order to see a specialist or other doctor, and the gatekeeper cannot authorize that referral unless the HMO guidelines deem it necessary. Some HMOs pay gatekeeper PCPs set fees for each defined medical procedure they provide to insured patients ([[fee-for-service]]) and then [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitate]] specialists (that is, pay a set fee for each insured person's care, irrespective of which medical procedures the specialists performs to achieve that care), while others use the reverse arrangement. 

"Open access" and "POS" (point of service) products are a combination of an HMO and traditional indemnity plan.  The member(s) are not required to use a gatekeeper or obtain a referral before seeing a specialist. In that case, the traditional benefits are applicable.  If the member uses a gatekeeper, the HMO benefits are applied. However, the beneficiary cost sharing (e.g., co-payment or coinsurance) may be higher for specialist care.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Kongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 40 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
HMOs also manage care through utilization review. That means they monitor doctors to see if they are performing more services for their patients than other doctors, or fewer. HMOs often provide [[preventive care]] for a lower [[copayment]] or for free, in order to keep members from developing a preventable condition that would require a great deal of medical services. When HMOs were coming into existence, indemnity plans often did not cover preventive services, such as [[immunizations]], [[Well-baby visit|well-baby checkups]], [[mammograms]], or physicals. It is this inclusion of services intended to maintain a member's health that gave the HMO its name. Some services, such as [[outpatient]] mental health care, are limited, and more costly forms of care, diagnosis, or treatment may not be covered. Experimental treatments and elective services that are not medically necessary (such as elective [[plastic surgery]]) are almost never covered.

Other choices for managing care are [[Case management (USA health system)|case management]], in which patients with catastrophic cases are identified, or [[Disease management (health)|disease management]], in which patients with certain chronic diseases like [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], or some forms of [[cancer]] are identified. In either case, the HMO takes a greater level of involvement in the patient's care, assigning a case manager to the patient or a group of patients to ensure that no two providers provide overlapping care, and to ensure that the patient is receiving appropriate treatment, so that the condition does not worsen beyond what can be helped.

== Cost containment ==
Although businesses pursued the HMO model for its alleged cost containment benefits, some research indicates that private HMO plans don't achieve any significant cost savings over non-HMO plans. Although out-of-pocket costs are reduced for consumers, controlling for other factors, the plans don't affect total expenditures and payments by insurers. A possible reason for this failure is that consumers might increase utilization in response to less cost sharing under HMOs.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeun Shin,  Sangho Moon, "Do HMO Plans Reduce Expenditure in the Private Sector?", Economic Inquiry, Jan 2007.  [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5814/is_1_45/ai_n29387922/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some&lt;ref&gt;"Claim That HMO's Save Money Is Little More Than "Folklore," Health Affairs Study Finds," 2000. Physicians for a National Health Program. http://www.pnhp.org/news/2000/march/claim_that_hmos_sav.php&lt;/ref&gt; have asserted that HMOs (especially those run [[for profit]]) actually increase [[Overhead (business)|administrative costs]] and tend to [[wikt:cherry-pick|cherry-pick]] healthier patients.

== History ==
Though some forms of group "managed care" did exist prior to the 1970s, in the USA they came about chiefly through the influence of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and his friend [[Edgar Kaiser, Sr|Edgar Kaiser]]. In discussion in the White House on February 17, 1971, Nixon expressed his support for the essential philosophy of the HMO, which John Ehrlichman explained thus: "All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nixon|first1=Richard|title=Transcript of taped conversation between President Richard Nixon and John D. Ehrlichman (1971) that led to the HMO act of 1973:|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_taped_conversation_between_President_Richard_Nixon_and_John_D._Ehrlichman_(1971)_that_led_to_the_HMO_act_of_1973:|website=Wikisource|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaiser Permanente disputes Ehrlichman's "secondhand, inarticulate paraphrase", and presents a record of the briefs received by Ehrlichman and the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/kaiser-permanentes-prominent-role-in-american-health-care-reform/|title=Kaiser Permanente's Prominent Role in American Health Care Reform - Kaiser Permanente Share|website=share.kaiserpermanente.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075749/https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/kaiser-permanentes-prominent-role-in-american-health-care-reform/#|archive-date=2017-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest form of HMOs can be seen in a number of ''prepaid health plans''. In 1910, the Western Clinic in [[Tacoma, Washington]] offered lumber mill owners and their employees certain medical services from its providers for a premium of $0.50 per member per month. This is considered by some to be the first example of an HMO. However, [[Ross-Loos Medical Group]], established in 1929, is considered to be the first HMO in the United States; it was headquartered in [[Los Angeles]] and initially provided services for [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] (DWP) and [[Los Angeles County]] employees.200 DWP employees enrolled at a cost of $1.50 each per month. Within a year, the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] signed up, then the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], then the Southern California Telephone Company (now [[AT&amp;T Inc.]]), and more. By 1951, enrollment stood at 35,000 and included teachers, county and city employees. In 1982 through the merger of the [[Insurance Company of North America]] (INA) founded in 1792 and Connecticut General (CG) founded in 1865 came together to become [[CIGNA]]. Also in 1929 Dr. [[Michael Shadid]] created a health plan in [[Elk City, Oklahoma]] in which farmers bought shares for $50 to raise the money to build a hospital. The medical community did not like this arrangement and threatened to suspend Shadid's licence. The Farmer's Union took control of the hospital and the health plan in 1934. Also in 1929, Baylor Hospital provided approximately 1,500 teachers with prepaid care. This was the origin of [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]]. Around 1939, state medical societies created [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Shield]] plans to cover physician services, as Blue Cross covered only hospital services. 
These prepaid plans burgeoned during the [[Great Depression]] as a method for providers to ensure constant and steady revenue.

In 1970, the number of HMOs declined to fewer than 40. [[Paul M. Ellwood, Jr.]], often called the "father" of the HMO, began having discussions with what is today the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] that led to the enactment of the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]]. This act had three main provisions:
* Grants and loans were provided to plan, start, or expand an HMO
* Certain state-imposed restrictions on HMOs were removed if the HMOs were federally certified
* Employers with 25 or more employees were required to offer federally certified HMO options alongside indemnity upon request

This last provision, called the dual choice provision, was the most important, as it gave HMOs access to the critical employer-based market that had often been blocked in the past. The federal government was slow to issue regulations and certify plans until 1977, when HMOs began to grow rapidly. The dual choice provision expired in 1995.

In 1971, [[Gordon K. MacLeod]] MD developed and became the director of the United States' first federal Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) program. He was recruited by [[Elliot Richardson]], the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

== Types ==
HMOs operate in a variety of forms. Most HMOs today do not fit neatly into one form; they can have multiple divisions, each operating under a different model, or blend two or more models together.
In the '''staff model''', physicians are salaried and have offices in HMO buildings. In this case, physicians are direct employees of the HMOs. This model is an example of a closed-panel HMO, meaning that contracted physicians may only see HMO patients.  
Previously this type of HMO was common, although currently it is nearly inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/9907/9907.staffmodel.html|title=Staff-Model HMOs: Don't Blink or You'll Miss Them!|author=|date=1 July 1999|website=managedcaremag.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the '''group model''', the HMO does not employ the physicians directly, but contracts with a multi-specialty physician group practice. Individual physicians are employed by the group practice, rather than by the HMO. The group practice may be established by the HMO and only serve HMO members ("captive group model").  [[Kaiser Permanente]] is an example of a captive group model HMO rather than a staff model HMO, as is commonly believed.  An HMO may also contract with an existing, independent group practice ("independent group model"), which will generally continue to treat non-HMO patients.  Group model HMOs are also considered closed-panel, because doctors must be part of the group practice to participate in the HMO - the HMO panel is closed to other physicians in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Kongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," 4th edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}, pages 35–26&lt;/ref&gt;

If not already part of a '''[[group medical practice]]''', physicians may contract with an '''[[independent practice association]]''' (IPA), which in turn contracts with the HMO. This model is an example of an open-panel HMO, where a physician may maintain their own office and may see non-HMO members.

In the '''network model''', an HMO will contract with any combination of groups, IPAs (Independent Practice Associations), and individual physicians. Since 1990, most HMOs run by managed care organizations with other lines of business (such as [[Preferred provider organization|PPO]], [[Point of service plan|POS]] and indemnity) use the network model.

== Regulation ==

HMOs in the USA are regulated at both the state and federal levels. They are licensed by the states, under a license that is known as a certificate of authority (COA) rather than under an insurance license.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Kongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 1322 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; State and federal regulators also issue ''mandates'', requirements for health maintenance organizations to provide particular products. In 1972 the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul F. O'Rourke|O'Rourke, Paul F.]] (1974). ''Organizational aspects of prepaid health plans-HMO's''. California.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal responsibilities ==
HMOs often have a negative public image due to their restrictive appearance. HMOs have been the target of lawsuits claiming that the restrictions of the HMO prevented necessary care. Whether an HMO can be held responsible for a physician's [[negligence]] partially depends on the HMO's screening process.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} If an HMO only contracts with providers meeting certain quality criteria and advertises this to its members, a court may be more likely to find that the HMO is responsible, just as hospitals can be liable for negligence in selecting physicians. However, an HMO is often insulated from malpractice lawsuits. The [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) can be held to preempt negligence claims as well. In this case, the deciding factor is whether the harm results from the plan's administration or the provider's actions. ERISA does not preempt or insulate HMOs from breach of contract or state law claims asserted by an independent, third-party provider of medical services.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court, N.D. Texas, Dallas Division. BAYLOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER v. ARKANSAS BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD. No. Civ.A. 3:03-CV-2084-.Jan. 9, 2004.MEMORANDUM ORDER&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intermetamorphosis''' is a [[delusional misidentification syndrome]], related to [[agnosia]]. The main symptoms consist of patients believing that they can see others change into someone else in both external appearance and internal personality.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, David. "Oxford Hand Book Of Psychiatry" Oxford Press. 2005. p238.&lt;/ref&gt; The disorder is usually [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] with [[neurological disorder]]s or [[mental disorder]]s.

An example from medical literature is a man who was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. After some time he mistook his wife for his deceased mother and later for his sister. As an explanation, he stated that he had never been married or that his wife had left him. Later he mistook his son for his brother and his daughter for another sister. Visual agnosia or [[prosopagnosia]] were not diagnosed, as the misidentification also took place during phone calls. On several occasions he mistook the hospital for the church he used to go to.

The disorder was first described in 1932 by P. Courbon and J. Tusques (''Illusions d'intermétamorphose et de la charme''), in the Journal: Annales Medico-Psychologiques issue 14, page 401-406.

==Early life and education==
Broughton was raised in a small village 15 miles south of London. His parents were organizers of their community's film society, and he "grew up as a [[Cinema Paradiso]] projector boy".&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; He later spent six influential years in the UK's [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]], where he became an expert on [[explosives]] and [[hand grenades]]. He claimed the experience increased his interest in the military aspects of culture and graphic imagery used to justify war.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt;

After a short period pursuing a career in journalism,&lt;ref name="waysofdoing"/&gt; Broughton began studying psychology at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="tc"/&gt; While there he earned both his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degrees.&lt;ref name="waysofdoing"/&gt; After graduating from Cambridge he moved from England to the United States,&lt;ref name="waysofdoing"/&gt; where he earned his PhD at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="tc"/&gt; While at Harvard he partly focused his studies on the world-views and [[moral development]] of [[adolescents]].&lt;ref name="english"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waysofdoing"/&gt; His unpublished [[doctoral dissertation]] was titled ''The Development of Natural Epistemology in Adolescence and Early Adulthood.''

==Teachers College, Columbia University==
Broughton became an Associate Professor of Psychology and Education&lt;ref name="tc" /&gt; at the [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1976 and continues to hold the position.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt; When Teachers College underwent departmental reorganisation in the mid 1990s, Broughton retained his title but moved to the Department of Arts and Humanities,&lt;ref name="waysofdoing" /&gt; where he expanded classroom techniques to include the use of music, advertising, magazines, video games, television, and the internet.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt; His classes often cover [[cultural studies]], media and [[visual culture]], [[youth culture]], popular culture, [[gender]], and violence.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt; In October 1999 Broughton co-ordinated a conference at Teachers College titled "Children, Culture and Violence". The conference brought together experts on [[school violence]],&lt;ref name="violencecolu"&gt;{{cite news

==Mission and aims==
The primary [[Mission statement|mission]] of Journey consists of the following:

*The prevention of drug experimentation among young people.
*The prevention of HIV vulnerable behavior among young people.
*Raising public awareness on drug addiction, HIV, and related issues.
* To assist substance users with the process of "recovery" and avoiding relapse.

The main goals of Journey are:

*Provision of supportive aftercare service for [[Recovery approach#Recovery from substance dependence|recovering]] drug users.
*Prevention of substance abuse and HIV.
*Intervention.
*Creating awareness of drugs, drug addiction, [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD), HIV, and drug-related issues.
*Facilitating the provision of peer-to-peer support for young people to refrain from substance abuse and experimentation with drugs.
*Dissemination of information on infectious [[blood-borne disease]]s.
*Support for a "harm reduction" approach to substance use and STD-prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and Goals|url=http://journey.org.mv/mission_and_goals.html|work=Journey NGO|publisher=Journey NGO|author=Journey NGO|year=2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journey was established by recovering addicts who had gone through all the suffering and misery of ceasing drug use. In addition, the NGO is managed and run by recovering drug users. Journey believes its staff members are extremely helpful as they can feel and understand the experiences of their addicted brothers and sisters. This is the main reason why Journey took the initiative to help and assist others through their recoveries from drug dependency.

==HIV and Drug Prevention Campaigns==
Journey has started three HIV and drug prevention campaigns to prevent youth from experimenting with drugs and engaging in risky activities which can lead to HIV. 
* "Wake up".&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;Maldives launches its first national campaign on drug prevention.  The campaign, entitled “Wake Up”, was launched by the National Narcotics Bureau, the non-governmental organization Journey, and UNICEF.  The aim of this campaign is to prevent drug abuse and promote recovery among addicts throughout the Maldives.

{{Political anthropology|Studies}}

'''''Kapu''''' is the ancient [[Hawaii]]an [[code of conduct]] of laws and regulations. The ''kapu'' system was universal in lifestyle, gender roles, politics and religion. An offense that was ''kapu'' was often a capital offense, but also often denoted a threat to spiritual power, or theft of ''[[mana]]''. ''Kapus'' were strictly enforced. Breaking one, even unintentionally, often meant immediate death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islands.com/article.jsp?ID=47759&amp;typeID=122&amp;categoryID=0 Hawaii: Sacred Hawaii] December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ko{{okina}}o kapu''. The concept is related to [[taboo]] and the ''[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or ''tabu'' found in other [[Polynesia]]n cultures. The [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word ''kapu'' is usually translated to English as "forbidden", though it also carries the meanings of "keep out", "no trespassing", "sacred", "consecrated", or "holy".

The opposite of kapu is ''noa'', meaning "common" or "free".

==Kapuhili==
The ''Kapuhili'' were restrictions placed upon contact with chiefs (kings), but these also apply to all people of known spiritual power. ''Kapu Kū mamao'' means prohibited from a place of the chief, while ''Kapu noho'' was to assemble before the chief. It was ''kapu'' when entering a chief's personal area to come in contact with his hair or fingernail clippings, to look directly at him, and to be in sight of him with a head higher than his. Wearing red and yellow feathers (a sign of royalty) was ''kapu'', unless an individual was of the highest rank.  Places that are ''kapu'' are often symbolized by ''Pahu Kapu'', two crossed staffs, each with a white ball atop.

=={{okina}}Ai Kapu==
The ''{{okina}}Ai kapu'' was the ''kapu'' system governing contact between men and women. Many ''ali{{okina}}i'' obtained their power through this system, and then would give thanks to the god of politics [[Kū]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiialive.org/realms.php?sub=Wao+Lani&amp;treasure=340&amp;offset=0, Realms: Wao Lani - Ku Hawai'i Alive website] Retrieved on 09 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''{{okina}}Ai'' means "to eat" and ''Kapu'' means sacred. Therefore, it is translated to "sacred eating". It first came about because [[Wākea]] wanted to  marry his daughter, ''Ho{{okina}}ohōkūlani''. To do this, his ''kupuna'' advised him to establish the ''{{okina}}Ai kapu'' which allowed him time away from his wife to be alone with his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Losche, Tracie. ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific. 2nd ed.'' (Hawaii: Copely Custom Textbooks, 2008), 60-64&lt;/ref&gt;  In this particular practice, men and women could not eat meals together. Furthermore, certain foods such as [[pork]] (the body form of the god [[Lono]]), most types (67 of the 70 varieties) of [[banana]]s (body form of the god [[Kanaloa]]), and [[coconut]]s (body form of the god [[Kū]]) were considered ''kapu'' to women. In fact, women could not even make coconut rope. [[Taro]] (body form of the god [[Kāne]]) was kapu for women to cook and prepare. Some large fish were also kapu for women to eat. Isabella Abbott, a leading [[ethnobotanist]] of Hawaii theorizes that because of the limited "noa" (free) diet for Hawaiian women, seaweeds were relied upon more heavily for Hawaiians than other Pacific islands.&lt;ref name="Oral Traditions Interview with Isabella Abbott"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral History Project - Dr. Isabella Abbott|url=http://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/kalalaola/documentaries|work=An Oral History Project - Dr. Isabella Abbott|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kapu'' system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King [[Kamehameha II]], acting with his mother Queen [[Keōpūolani]] and his father's other queen [[Kaʻahumanu]], abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. Abolishing the ''{{okina}}ai kapu'' assured political power to the line of Kamehameha rulers as monarchs because it limited the power of the rulers below them. Originally, it was from this political system that the rulers throughout the island would gain rank, power, and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Kāwika Tengan, Ty P. ''Native Men Remade: Gender and Nation in Contemporary Hawai'i'' (North Carolina: Duke University Press, 2008),  36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
The ambiguities in the Polynesian concept (from the English point of view) are reflected in the different senses of the word in different national Englishes: in modern usage in Hawaii, "KAPU" is often substituted for the phrase "No Trespassing" on private property signage. Although kapu can be taken to mean "keep out", kapu has a larger meaning to most residents of Hawaii. By contrast, in [[New Zealand]], the comparable word "tapu" is almost always applied in English as meaning "sacred".

==Terms==
Some terms using Kapu:
*{{okina}}aha kapu: the [[sennit]] cord put across the portal of a house to signify a ban on entering the house.
*{{okina}}ai kapu: the protocol regarding food.
*Hei kapu: The place where priests await messages from the gods.

The organization started as the Japanese Benevolent Society in 1892 and was incorporated in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/12/07/news/story4.html|title=How Kuakini became an ‘American general hospital’: World War II forced a change in its focus away from reflecting Japanese culture|last=Altonn|first=Helen|date=December 7, 2001|website=archives.starbulletin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Japanese Charity Hospital opened in 1900 and expanded in 1902. A larger facility was built in 1917 at the present site with donations from [[Emperor Taishō]] of Japan. In 1934 [[Emperor Hirohito]] of Japan donated funds for more expansion. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the US military occupied the hospital during [[World War II]] and renamed it Kuakini Medical Center, after the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= General Information: History |work= Kuakini Health System web site |url= http://www.kuakini.org/Kuakini/GeneralInfo/gen_History.asp |accessdate= November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The street was in turn named for [[John Adams Kuakini]] (1791–1844) who was acting [[Governor of Oahu]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1042464|title=Place names of Hawaii|last=Pukui|first=Mary Kawena|last2=Elbert|first2=Samuel H.|last3=Mookini|first3=Esther T.|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|year=1974|isbn=082480208X|edition=Rev. and enl. ed|location=Honolulu|pages=|oclc=1042464|author-link=Mary Kawena Pukui|author-link2=Samuel Hoyt Elbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and difficulties ==
Margaret Kennix dealt with issues regarding her authority to practice medicine in London. She particularly dealt with the Royal College of Physicians that had a strong presence in the city of London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Royal College of Physicians was one of the main governing bodies of medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; King Henry VII established it as a Royal Charter in 1918.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/about-rcp/our-history|title=Our history|date=2015-10-08|work=RCP London|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college attempted to put a complete stop to Margaret's medical practice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Margaret Kennix turned to the royal family for help after the College had consistently attempted to shut down her practice entirely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Margaret knew that having someone in the royal family vouching for her was very beneficial.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Queen Elizabeth I informed the College in 1581 of her support for Margaret Kennix.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sir Francis Walsingham informed the College of Queen Elizabeth's support for Margaret, and he listed two separate reasons as to why she should be allowed to practice medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first reason was, "God has given her a special knowledge to the benefit of the poorer sort".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also informed the college that her family, "wholly depend on the exercise of her skill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was due to Margaret's husband not being able to work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The College responded to this act of support with a resounding and stout answer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The writer for the College said that Margaret Kennix was an, "outlandish, ignorant, sorry woman".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The College also suggested that allowing Margaret Kennix to practice medicine would set a harmful standard and would be breaking the "Holsome Lawes" that prevent medical practices foreign to the College.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The College believed her "weakness and insufficiency" were enough to warrant such a response.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The final decision of the College is unknown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Megavitamin therapy''' is the use of large doses of [[vitamin]]s, often many times greater than the [[recommended dietary allowance]] (RDA) in the attempt to prevent or treat [[disease]]s. Megavitamin therapy is typically used in [[alternative medicine]] by practitioners who call their approach [[orthomolecular medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zell M, Grundmann O |title=An orthomolecular approach to the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders |journal=Adv Mind Body Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=14–28 |date=2012 |pmid=23341413 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamins are useful in preventing and treating illnesses specifically associated with dietary vitamin shortfalls, but the conclusions of medical research are that the broad claims of disease treatment by advocates of megavitamin therapy are unsubstantiated by the available evidence.&lt;ref name="isbn1-55009-213-8"&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Aaronson S, etal |title=Cancer medicine 6 (Frei, Emil; Kufe, Donald W.; Holland, James F., eds)|publisher=BC Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |year=2003|pages=76|isbn=1-55009-213-8 |chapter= Cancer medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=References1990&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nutrition Committee |author2=Canadian Paediatric Society | date=1990| title = Megavitamin and megamineral therapy in childhood.

== Multivitamin vs megavitamin ==
Megavitamin therapy must be distinguished from the usual 'vitamin supplementation' approach of traditional multivitamin pills. Megavitamin doses are far higher than the levels of vitamins ordinarily available through western diets. A study of 161,000 individuals (post-menopausal women) provided, in the words of the authors, "convincing evidence that multivitamin use has little or no influence on the risk of common cancers, cardiovascular disease, or total mortality in postmenopausal women".&lt;ref name="WHI"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Neuhouser ML, Wassertheil-Smoller S, Thomson C, etal |title=Multivitamin use and risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease in the Women's Health Initiative cohorts |journal=Arch.

==History==
In the 1930s and 1940s, some scientific and clinical evidence suggested that there might be beneficial uses of vitamins C, E, and niacin in large doses. Beginning in the 1930s, the Shutes in Canada developed a megadose vitamin E therapy for cardiovascular and circulatory complaints, naming it the "Shute protocol".&lt;ref name="pmid18911314"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogelsang A, Shute E, Shute W |title=Some medical uses of vitamin E |journal=Med World (New York) |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=83–89 |date=1948 |pmid=18911314 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tentative experiments in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jungeblut |first=CW |year=1937 |title=Vitamin C Therapy and Prophylaxis in Experimental Poliomyelitis |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=65 |pages=127–146 |url=http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/65/1/127 |doi=10.1084/jem.65.1.127 |pmid=19870585 |issue=1 |pmc=2133474}}&lt;/ref&gt; with larger doses of vitamin C led to Frederick Klenner's development of [[Vitamin C megadosage|megadose]] intravenous vitamin C treatments for polio and other viruses in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="pmid18147027"&gt;{{cite web|author=Klenner, Fred R. |title=The treatment of poliomyelitis and other virus diseases with vitamin C |journal=Southern Medicine &amp; Surgery |volume=111 |issue=7 |pages=209–214 |date=1949 |pmid=18147027 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Kaufman published articles in the 1940s that detailed his treatment of arthritis with frequent, high doses of niacinamide.&lt;ref name="pmid13060032"&gt;{{cite journal |author=KAUFMAN W |title=Niacinamide therapy for joint mobility; therapeutic reversal of a common clinical manifestation of the normal aging process |journal=Conn State Med J |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=584–9 |date=July 1953 |pmid=13060032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Altschul and [[Abram Hoffer]] applied large doses of the immediate release form of [[niacin]] (Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to treat [[hypercholesterolemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altschul R, Hoffer A, Stephen JD |title=Influence of nicotinic acid on serum cholesterol in man |journal=Arch.

Williams]] introduced concepts for individualized megavitamins and nutrients.&lt;ref name="isbn0-87983-893-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Roger Lawrence |title=Biochemical Individuality |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-87983-893-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Megavitamin therapies were also publicly advocated by [[Linus Pauling]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-399-50764-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stone, Irwin |title=The healing factor: "vitamin C" against disease |publisher=Perigee Books |location=New York |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-399-50764-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage as therapy==
Although megavitamin therapies still largely remain outside of the structure of [[evidence-based medicine]], they are increasingly used by patients, with or without the approval of their treating physicians, often after recommendations by practitioners of orthomolecular and [[naturopathic medicine]].&lt;ref name="pmid10893280"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson MA, Sanders T, Palmer JL, Greisinger A, Singletary SE |title=Complementary/alternative medicine use in a comprehensive cancer center and the implications for oncology |journal=J.

===Vitamin C===
{{Main|Vitamin C megadosage}}
The US [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] for [[vitamin C]] for adult women is 76 mg/day and for adult men 90 mg/day. Although [[Linus Pauling]] was known for highly respectable research in chemistry and biochemistry, he was also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron E, Pauling L | title = Supplemental ascorbate in the supportive treatment of cancer: Prolongation of survival times in terminal human cancer | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 3685–9 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 1068480 | pmc = 431183 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.73.10.3685| bibcode = 1976PNAS...73.3685C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000&amp;nbsp;mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. A meta-analysis concluded that supplementary [[vitamin C]] significantly lowered serum [[uric acid]], considered a risk factor for [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Juraschek SP, Miller ER, Gelber AC |title=Effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on serum uric acid: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken) |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=1295–306 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21671418 |pmc=3169708 |doi=10.1002/acr.20519 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One population study reported an inverse correlation between dietary vitamin C and risk of gout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=Hyon K. |author2=Xiang Gao |author3=Gary Curhan |date=2009|title=Vitamin C Intake and the Risk of Gout in Men – A Prospective Study|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume= 169 |issue= 5|pages=502–507|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/169/5/502 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2008.606|pmid=19273781|pmc=2767211}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of clinical trials in the treatment of colds with small and large doses of Vitamin C has established that there is no evidence that it decreases the incidence of common colds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemilä|first=Harri|last2=Chalker|first2=Elizabeth|date=2013-01-31|year=|title=Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=1|pages=CD000980|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23440782|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 33 years of research, it is still not established whether vitamin C can be used as a treatment for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cabanillas | first1 = F | title = Vitamin C and cancer: what can we conclude--1,609 patients and 33 years later? | journal = Puerto Rico health sciences journal |volume = 29 |issue = 3 |pages = 215–217 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20799507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamin E===
The US [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] for [[vitamin E]] for adult women and men is 15 mg/day. The US Food and Nutrition Board set a [[Tolerable upper intake levels|Tolerable upper intake level (UL)]] at 1,000&amp;nbsp;mg (1,500 IU) per day derived from animal models that demonstrated bleeding at high doses.&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids | chapter = Vitamin E | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2000 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 186–283 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/9810/chapter/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the popularity for vitamin E as a dietary supplement&amp;ndash;popular doses 400, 800 and 1000 IU/day&amp;ndash;peaked around 2000. Declines in usage were attributed to publications of studies that showed either no benefits or negative consequences from vitamin E supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim HJ, Giovannucci E, Rosner B, Willett WC, Cho E |title=Longitudinal and secular trends in dietary supplement use: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 1986-2006 |journal=J Acad Nutr Diet |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=436–443 |date=2014 |pmid=24119503 |pmc=3944223 |doi=10.1016/j.jand.2013.07.039 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One meta-analysis showed no association between vitamin E supplementation and cardiovascular events (nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction) or cardiovascular mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman |first1=RS|last2=Hollar |first2=D|last3=Hebert|first3=PR|last4=Lamas|first4=GA| last5=Hennekens|first5=CH|title=Randomized trials of vitamin E in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease|journal= Archives of Internal Medicine|date=2004|pmid=15277288| doi=10.1001/archinte.164.14.1552|volume=164|issue=14|pages=1552–1556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meta-analysis concluded that high-dosage vitamin E increased all-cause mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller ER, Pastor-Barriuso R, Dalal D, Riemersma RA, Appel LJ, Guallar E |title=Meta-analysis: high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality |journal=Ann.

===Niacin===
The US [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] for [[niacin]] for adult women is 14 mg/day and for adult men 16 mg/day. Niacin is available as a prescription product, either immediate release (500 mg tablets; prescribed up to 3,000 mg/day) or extended release (500 and 1,000 mg tablets; prescribed up to 2,000 mg/day). In the US, niacin is also available as a [[dietary supplement]] at 500 to 1,000 mg/tablet. Niacin has sometimes been used in combination with other [[lipid-lowering medication]]s.&lt;ref name=TabletLabel&gt;[https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ce739d68-d89c-437c-90fb-3c0c45140f22 Niacin tablet label] Updated March 14, 2013. Page accessed Feb 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic reviews found no effect of niacin on [[cardiovascular disease]] or death, in spite of raising [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) cholesterol.

'''Michael Antonio Arroyo Mina''' ({{IPA-es|mitʃaˈel aˈroyo}}; born 23 April 1987) was an Ecuadorian [[soccer|footballer]] who plays for [[Barcelona SC]] of the [[Ecuadorian Serie A]], and the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuadorian national team]] as an [[attacking midfielder]].

==Club career==

===Emelec===
Michael Arroyo started his career in the youth ranks of [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]]. He was seen as a very talented player for his age, and played 73 times for Emelec. However, in September 2007, he tested positive for [[marijuana]] shortly after a league match with [[Deportivo Cuenca]], and was banned for two years from football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2007-09-27 |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=606660.html#arroyo+banned+after+testing+positive | title=Arroyo banned after testing positive | publisher=FIFA.com | accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportivo Quito===

====2009====
He moved to the nation's capital in January 2009 to play for [[Sociedad Deportivo Quito|Deportivo Quito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=0&amp;categserie=1&amp;nivel=0&amp;subnive0&amp;id=13757&amp;tabla=N |title=Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol, el portal de fútbol ecuatoriano |publisher=Ecuafutbol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505144843/http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=0&amp;categserie=1&amp;nivel=0&amp;subnive0&amp;id=13757&amp;tabla=N |archivedate=2012-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut three months later in a game against [[Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Portoviejo|Liga de Portoviejo]], scoring a brace in a 2–0 home win. Arroyo scored his next goal with Deportivo on 20 May in a 2–0 home win over [[Deportivo Cuenca]]. Next he scored against Manta. His fourth goal of the season came against Tecnico Universitario. A week later he scored in a 2–0 away win against Olmedo. On 26 July, Arroyo scored the winning goal against his old club, [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]]. He scored against Macara on 18 October, in a 1–0 win. He won the 2009 Ecuadorian Serie A league against Deportivo Cuenca in a 3–2 comeback, scoring two goals, one which was the winning goal at the 87th minute, thus winning his first career title. Arroyo scored 10 goals in 17 league games played.

====2010====
Arroyo began his 2010 season in a 1–1 away draw against Emelec. He scored his first goal on 28 March in a 1–1 away win against Universidad Catolica. On 5 April, he scored his second, in a 2–0 home win over Macara. His third goal came against Olmedo, in a 2–0 away win on 17 April. On 25 May, Michael scored his fourth and final goal of the season with Deportivo Quito, winning 2–1 away against Macara. After impressive displays in the Serie A, he signed for [[San Luis F.C.|San Luis]] in [[Mexico]].

===San Luis===

====2010–2012====
On 28 May, Arroyo was transferred to [[San Luis Fútbol Club|San Luis]] of the [[Primera División de México]] after impressing them with his ability on the ball and powerful long-shot goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=1&amp;categserie=1&amp;nivel=0&amp;subnivel=0&amp;id=16899 |title=Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol, el portal de fútbol ecuatoriano |publisher=Ecuafutbol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut came on 24 July, in a 1–1 draw against [[CF Monterrey|Monterrey]]. He scored goals against [[Tecos UAG]], [[Querétaro FC|Querétaro]], [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]], and [[Club Toluca|Toluca]] in the Apertura tournament. In the next season he would go on to score goals against [[CD Guadalajara|Guadalajara]], [[Monarcas Morelia]], [[Club Atlas|Atlas]] and [[CF Pachuca|Pachuca]]. In his [[Copa Libertadores]] participation with the Mexican club in [[2011 Copa Libertadores|2011]], he scored two goals against a Peruvian club, the first one a volley goal from 25 yards; he also assisted the first goal in a 3–1 home victory for San Luis.

===Atlante===

====2012====
[[File:Michael Arroyo.jpg|thumb|upright|Arroyo playing for Atlante.]]
On 30 November 2011, Arroyo was transferred to [[Atlante FC|Atlante]]. He scored a free-kick goal against his old club San Luis, which he chose not to celebrate. He also scored three more goals that season against Guadalajara, UAG and [[Jaguares de Chiapas]]. His last game with Atlante was a 0–3 loss against Monterrey. In the summer of 2012, he was loaned out to [[Barcelona SC]] in Ecuador, even though he had played for city rivals Emelec for many years.

===Barcelona SC (loan)===

====2012====
His debut came in a 2–1 win over his youth career club, Emelec, winning Ecuador's Clasico. Arroyo's first goal for Barcelona came on 19 September, in a 4–3 win over Chilean side [[Cobreloa]], scoring two long range goals. His first two league goals for Barcelona came on 30 September, against Jose Teran, in a 2–2 draw. On 4 November, Arroyo scored a goal from the penalty spot in a 5–0 home win against Emelec. On 28 November, Arroyo became 2012 Serie A champion with Barcelona SC, after nearly fourteen years since Barcelona last won the league title.

====2013====
For the 2013 Ecuadorian Serie A season, Arroyo was handed the jersey number 7. His first match of the season came on 26 January, in a 1–1 away draw against [[Deportivo Quevedo]]. On 16 February, Arroyo was given a red card for punching an opponent in the face. On 27 February, he scored his first goal the season, from the penalty spot, already losing to [[Club Atletico Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] 2–0, to make it 2–1. Nearly a month later he scored his first league goal of the season in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo Cuenca. On 21 April, Arroyo was given two immediate yellow cards by the referee. He was later also given a three-match ban and missed the matches against Emelec, [[Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito|LDU Quito]], and Deportivo Cuenca. On his return, Arroyo scored a free-kick goal with Barcelona defeating Universidad Catolica 6–2.

On 13 July, he scored the lone goal in a 3–1 loss to Universidad Catolica. A week later he scored in the 3–3 draw against Deportivo Cuenca. On 21 July, Arroyo scored a double to tie against LDU Quito. On 15 September, Arroyo scored against Deportivo Quito, winning 2–1. Four days later Arroyo scored against Independiente del Valle, drawing 1–1. On 22 September, Michael scored the second in the 2–1 home win over Deportivo Quito.

===Return to Atlante===
In 2014, Arroyo returned to Atlante. On 10 March, Arroyo scored four goals against Querétaro, winning the match 4–2. He finished the Clausura tournament scoring eight goals in sixteen matches played.

===Club América===

On 15 July 2014, it was announced that Arroyo would be joining league giants [[Club America|América]] on loan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecuagol.com/ecuagol/index.php?n=54409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/2131817/el-ecuatoriano-michael-arroyo-seria-anunciado-como-refuerzo-del-america&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://laaficion.milenio.com/america/Arroyo_America-Atlante_America-Aguilas_fichaje-contratacion_America_0_332967009.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/2014/07/10/nota/3214936/michael-arroyo-jugara-america-anuncia-medio-internacional&lt;/ref&gt; Arroyo scored his first Liga MX goal of the season on October 2, defeating Veracruz 2–0. On December 14, for the final championship title against [[Tigres UANL]], Arroyo scored the first goal of the second–leg final match, defeating Tigres 3–0, and won the [[2014–15 Liga MX season#Torneo Apertura|Apertura 2014]] championship title, Arroyo's first title in Mexico. He was also voted as the Final Match MVP by Liga MX officials. Arroyo has had a roller coaster of sorts with Club America.

He's been a fan favorite&lt;ref&gt;http://americamonumental.com/aguilas/michael-arroyo-hace-meritos-para-ser-titular-clasico-nacional-copa-mx&lt;/ref&gt; due to his flashy skills and [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] free kicks,&lt;ref&gt;http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2016/10/16/actualidad/1476591252_927437.html&lt;/ref&gt; however due to his tactical indiscipline he has been unable to make himself an undisputed starter throughout the [[Antonio Mohamed|Turco]] era, [[Gustavo Matosas|Matosas]] era, [[Ignacio Ambriz|Nacho]] era or the [[Ricardo LaVolpe|Lavolpe]] era.&lt;ref&gt;http://espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/2801608/michael-arroyo-dice-que-yo-lo-salo-ricardo-la-volpe&lt;/ref&gt; Arroyo was not on the transfer list following the [[2016 FIFA Club World Cup]] however he's been having to fight for a match day spot due to the 10 foreigner/8 national rule [[Liga MX]] has implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/2952688/michael-arroyo-sacrificado-por-regla-10/8-dominguez-debuta&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grêmio===
A surprise move to the Brazilian club [[Grêmio]] signing a 3-year contract that's expires in 2019.

==International career==
Arroyo played for the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador U-20]] side in the South American Youth Championship 2007. He scored a goal in Ecuador's 3–1 win against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]]. On May 8, 2010 Arroyo received his first call up to the national team and started and played 90 minutes against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], being named man of the match before being subbed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=1&amp;categserie=7&amp;nivel=0&amp;subnivel=0&amp;id=16788&amp;tabla=N |title=Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol, el portal de fútbol ecuatoriano |publisher=Ecuafutbol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510140253/http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=1&amp;categserie=7&amp;nivel=0&amp;subnivel=0&amp;id=16788&amp;tabla=N |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=289185&amp;league=FIFA.FRIENDLY&amp;cc=5901 |title=Match: Mexico v Ecuador – International Friendly – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He scored his first goal for the major Ecuador national football team on May 28, 2011 against Mexico. The match finished 1–1. Arroyo scored an impressive long-range shot against [[England national football team|England]] coming in as a 2nd half substitute for [[Jefferson Montero]]. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Switzerland at 3:12 of added time he had an open shot on goal to seal a win for Ecuador and chose to stop and control the ball giving defenders time to close and block his shot.  On the immediate counterattack Switzerland scored a goal sealing a win and 3 points. He did not play the next World Cup game for Ecuador.

'''Mikel Ruffinelli''' (born 1972) is an American woman who currently holds the record of widest hip in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffo|first=Megan|title=Mikel Ruffinelli Sets World Record For Largest Hips|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/mikel-ruffinelli-worlds-largest-hips_n_2526338.html|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the World Record Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest hips: Mikel Ruffinelli sets world record (VIDEO)|url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/human/largest_hips_Mikel_Ruffinelli_breaks_Guinness_world_record_213209.html|work=World Record Academy|accessdate=31 March 2013|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her weight is more than {{convert|420|lb|kg}} and her hips measures an unusual {{convert|8|ft|m}} in circumference, although her waist is only {{convert|3|ft|4|in|cm}}. She is 5 feet 4 inches tall.

==Early life, marriage and pregnancy==

Mikel was a normal-sized young woman and in her early 20s weighed an above average {{convert|13|st|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4753600/woman-who-measures-over-8ft-around-middle.html|title=World's biggest hips: woman who measures over 8ft around middle |work= The Sun|author=Harry Haydon|date=20 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
But at 22, she put on {{convert|4|st|lb}} after having first child Andrew. After daughters Destynee, Autumn, and Justyce followed, her weight and hips ballooned further.

She eats an average 5,000 calories a day.

Possibly this extraordinary fat tissue accumulation turns out to be an advanced stage of a medical condition called [[lipedema]].

The '''Millan Committee''' was established in 1999 by the [[Scottish Parliament]] to review the law on mental health in Scotland. [[Bruce Millan]] was the chair of the committee. It reported in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for mental health law repeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1135627.stm|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=25 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its report was the basis of the [[Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003]].

The '''mosquito laser''' is a device invented by [[astrophysicist]] [[Lowell Wood]] to kill large numbers of [[mosquitoes]] to reduce [[malaria]] infection rates.{{sfn|Guth|2009|p=??}} Although originally introduced in the early 1980s, the idea was not substantially researched until decades later. In 2007, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] requested [[Intellectual Ventures LLC]] to find a way to fight and eventually end malaria. Intellectual Ventures resurrected the idea of using lasers to kill mosquitoes and now has a working prototype.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; The idea has been criticized because most areas where malaria is prevalent do not have reliable electrical power.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;(Azuike, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project development==

===Initial vision===
At a brainstorming session in 2007, to think of solutions for malaria, Wood, one of the architects of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), also known as “Star Wars,” suggested designing a system to kill mosquitoes with lasers. Soon after, the idea was followed up by many scientists at Intellectual Ventures and mosquitoes were being shot down within a year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;(Guth, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original idea incorporates laser technology that stems from the SDI, scaled down to insects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;(Allen-Mills, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the malaria-carrying parasite is gone from most developed nations, it is getting worse in undeveloped countries, and it is also becoming more resistant to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;(Finkel, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than continue with drugs or other pesticides, the mosquito laser takes a more direct approach by instantly killing mosquitoes or burning off their wings and rendering them harmless. One of the design goals was to minimize collateral damage to other species and the environment.

The laser, humorously referred to by some as a WMD (Weapon of Mosquito Destruction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123680870885500701|title=Rocket Scientists Shoot Down Mosquitoes With Lasers|first=Robert A.|last=Guth|date=15 March 2009|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; works effectively at a range of 100 feet (approx. 30 meters).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Although the team at Intellectual Ventures is confident in the effectiveness of the laser, they do not expect it to eliminate malaria altogether. They believe several technologies must be combined for maximum eradication and minimal cost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;(Johanson, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists involved===
The team includes several scientists that previously worked at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. Wood worked with [[Edward Teller]], the father of the hydrogen bomb, and architect of the SDI anti-missile laser program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Currently there are several scientists involved with the project, including scientist [[Jordin Kare]], PhD, and principal investigator [[Eric Johanson]]. These scientists’ knowledge spans several fields; the scientists include engineers, an insect physiologist, an optical specialist, a computational modeling scientist, and an epidemiologist.&lt;ref&gt;(Intellectual Ventures Team, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementations===
Several concepts were explored, considering cost and efficiency. Devised implementations included a hand-held model, flying drones, and the current prototype, the Photonic Fence. As of early 2008, Intellectual Venture's prototype consisted of a hand-held laser, capable of shooting down mosquitoes in limited numbers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The Intellectual Ventures scientists once suggested attaching a mosquito laser system to a small flying drone so that it could patrol the air.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The current prototype idea being pursued is a perimeter based implementation known as the Photonic Fence.

===New collaboration===
On March 3, 2015, Lighting Science Group and Global Good announced a research agreement to collaborate.  The joint development effort will focus on field-ready prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellectualventureslab.com/invent/new-collaborator-for-photonic-fence-research|title=New Collaborator for Photonic Fence Research - Intellectual Ventures Laboratory|website=www.intellectualventureslab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current prototype==

===Photonic fence===

The device works by using infra-red [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) lamps on a fence post to create a field of light. This field of light reflects from [[retroreflective]] material on another fence post, much like that used on roads and highway signs, and bounces back to its source.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;(Intellectual Ventures, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This field of light is monitored by [[charge-coupled devices]] (CCDs) similar to the ones used in consumer digital cameras.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;(Lee, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras are situated on both fence posts and detect shadows in the light between the posts. Once an insect is detected, a non-lethal laser is fired at it. This non-lethal laser is used to determine the size of the insect, and the frequency at which its wings are beating.

The information gathered by the non-lethal laser can be used to determine the type of insect, and even its gender because wing beat patterns are unique to each species and gender. This is important in preventing malaria because only female mosquitoes bite humans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; Also, only mosquitoes of the genus [[Anopheles]] carry the malaria-causing parasite of the genus plasmodium.&lt;ref&gt;(MicrobiologyBytes, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; All of these determining calculations are done using a custom image processing board&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; using software written specifically for this application. Once the software confirms that the insect is of the targeted species and gender, a safety check makes sure that nothing is in the way of the laser and the mosquito. Once this safety check is completed, the lethal laser is given permission to shoot.

The lethal laser could be one of several low-power consumer lasers, but [[blue laser]]s, similar to the ones found in Blu-ray players, are thought to have great potential. Blue lasers are preferable as higher powered ones, they are more available than red, and cheaper - due to them being used in the Blu-ray industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The lethal laser is fired at the mosquito and is able to kill it mid-flight, either by overheating it or, possibly, by damaging its DNA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; In a video published by Intellectual Ventures, the mosquito's wings appear to wither, shrivel up and the body drops to the floor, often motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYXPqrXZ1eU|title=Mosquito killed by a Laser|first=|last=Natchers|date=12 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordin Kare]] has published instructions on how to build a [[do it yourself|DIY]] photonic fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/backyard-star-wars/0|title=Backyard Star Wars|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Johanson published information about the history of the device and how the system works in Make Magazine Issue 23.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
The Photonic Fence is thought to be best deployed surrounding buildings, such as hospitals and schools, or even whole villages, in an effort to reduce the spread of malaria. According to [[Nathan Myhrvold]], co-founder of Intellectual Ventures, the Photonic Fence can kill up to 50 to 100 mosquitoes a second, at a maximum range of approx. 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;(Jeremy, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
The Photonic Fence can be manufactured from parts used in current generation consumer technology and is projected to be relatively low cost. Myhrvold believes it can be made for around $50 per unit; however, Intellectual Ventures does not intend to manufacture the units, but rather to come up with a final design.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;(Lorie, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype of the fence was built with parts bought on eBay.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; All three stages of the photonic fence can be made from this consumer technology. When the device is looking for mosquitoes that pass its field of vision, it uses basic [[infra-red]] LEDs, and light sensors from modern digital cameras.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; To target and kill the mosquitoes it uses similar laser technology found in optical devices such as DVD, or Blu-ray disc drives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

===Environmental and ecological concerns===
The collateral damage to the non-malaria-carrying insect population from the Photonic Fence is thought to be low. Since the system can rapidly determine its target by wing beat frequency, it can be set to target only the female mosquitoes, who are the carriers of malaria in certain species of mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Furthermore, this distinction allows it to avoid species of insects which don't spread disease, such as bees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The risk for collateral damage is minimized because the prototype checks the target and the kill-laser is barely strong enough to destroy mosquito tissue. The laser, as a replacement for pesticides, does not cause widespread environmental damage that pesticides do.

===Expert criticism===
Although there has been positive public reaction, experts have expressed doubts as to the effectiveness of the Photonic Fence in the field. According to [[Bart Knols]], a mosquito and malaria expert, the system would not work because of high cost and troubles with electrical power in Africa (though there are reported plans to bundle it with a solar energy collector and battery&lt;ref&gt;Energy Matters: [http://www.energymatters.com.au/renewable-news/solar-mosquito-laser-em4717 The Solar Powered Laser Mosquito Zapper]&lt;/ref&gt;). The Photonic Fence has only been used in a lab setting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

'''Pagpag''' is a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term for [[leftover]] food from restaurants (usually from [[fast-food]] restaurants) scavenged from [[garbage]] sites and dumps.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|title='Garbage chicken' a grim staple for Manila's poor|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/asia/philippines-pagpag-slums/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2908202/Image-Asia-Eating-pagpag-celebration-popes-visit.html|title=Image of Asia: Eating pagpag in celebration of pope's visit|author=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=13 January 2015|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagpag food can also be expired frozen meat, fish, or vegetables discarded by supermarkets and scavenged in garbage trucks where those expired foods are collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/Sarbey%20hinggil%20sa%20Kahirapan_FINAL.pdf|title=Sarbey hinggil sa Sosyo-ekonomikong Kalagayan at Pamumuhay ng mga Kababaihan sa Ilang Piling Maralitang Komunidad sa Bansa|language=Tagalog|website=[[Philippine Commission on Women]]|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word in the Tagalog language literally means "to shake off the dust or dirt", and refers to the act of shaking the dirt off of the edible portion of the leftovers. Pagpag can be either eaten immediately after it was found in the trash or cooked in variety of ways after collecting it.

The act of eating pagpag arose from the practical challenges of hunger that resulted from extreme [[poverty in the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="rodriguez_blog"/&gt; Selling pagpag has been a profitable business in areas where poor people live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/metro/2015/06/17/Selling-pagpag-has-become-a-thriving-business.html|title=Pagpag: A thriving business|last=Cruz|first=Gen|newspaper=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=22 June 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagpag is also called '''batchoy''',&lt;ref name="rcam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcam.org/news/157-archdiocese-of-manila-achieves-zero-waste-management-prevents-pagpag-eating-by-waste-pickers|title=Archdiocese of Manila achieves Zero Waste Management; prevents 'PAGPAG' eating by waste pickers by Romulo S. Arsenio, Ph.D.|website=[[Archdiocese of Manila]]|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived from the [[batchoy|Filipino dish with the same name]].  Technically, batchoy is soup-based though the term batchoy that is used to refer to leftover food from trash may be a meal cooked differently like fried pagpag batchoy.&lt;ref name="isko" /&gt;  Persons who scavenge leftover food from garbage are called ''mambabatchoy''.&lt;ref name="iwitness" /&gt;

==Preparation==

After dirt and inedible substances are removed, pagpag can be eaten on site where it is found. It can also be processed further, most commonly by [[frying]] it in hot oil depending on the condition of the food.&lt;ref name="probe" /&gt; Filipino politician and former actor [[Isko Moreno]] used to scavenge leftover food and calling it pagpag [[batchoy|batsoy]] after frying it.&lt;ref name="isko"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journal.com.ph/editorial/opinion/isko-moreno-proud-to-be-a-domagoso|title=Isko Moreno: Proud to be a ‘Domagoso’|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=13 June 2016|last=Tugado|first=Angelo|newspaper=[[People's Journal|Journal Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small [[cottage industries]] have arisen around pagpag with [[poverty|impoverished people]] making a living scavenging, collecting, processing, and selling the processed pagpag to other financially challenged people.&lt;ref name="rodriguez_blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/53080-leftover-meal-hunger|title=Meal of the day: 'Pagpag'|last=Rodriguez|first=Fritzie |date=15 March 2014|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=[[Rappler]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cook in a restaurant in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], [[Manila]] prepares pagpag in traditional [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino cooking]], such as pagpag à la [[kaldereta]] or [[adobo]], with the mixture of the leftover chicken from [[Jollibee]] and [[KFC]] as the main ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/89595-happyland-pagpag-meal|title=Happyland meal: Kaldereta a la pagpag|last=Moya|first=George|date=11 April 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016|newspaper=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==

Health risks include ingestion of poisons, toxins, and food-borne illnesses. The [[National Anti-Poverty Commission (Philippines)|National Anti-Poverty Commission]] warns&lt;ref name=Reuters_article_2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/30/us-philippines-food-scavengers-idUSSP32323420080430|title=Filipino poor scavenge for recycled food to survive|author=Michaela Cabrera|date=30 April 2008|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; against eating pagpag because of the threat of malnutrition and diseases such as [[Hepatitis A]], [[typhoid]], [[diarrhea]], and [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="probe" /&gt;  Despite these, a vendor of pagpag claims that no one has died eating the pagpag he sells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/471054/newstv/reeltime/kalderetang-pagpag-tampok-sa-reel-time|title=Kalderetang pagpag, tampok sa 'Reel Time'|date=16 April 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=[[GMA News]]|language=Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, there are persons who do not get sick out of eating pagpag due to overproduction of [[antibody|antibodies]] in their [[immune system]], &lt;ref name="probe" /&gt; although there have been children who became ill from consuming pagpag.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;

==Solutions on stopping the spread of pagpag food==

Hunger has been linked to the spread of pagpag food and the food crisis in 2008 was said to be the cause in the rise of poverty in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="alleyes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/05/01/12/pagpag-all-eyes-poverty-ph|title=Pagpag: All eyes on poverty in PH|last=Pedrasa|first=Ira|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Statistics Authority|National Statistical Coordination Board]] recommended the administration of [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] to reduce poverty.&lt;ref name="alleyes" /&gt; [[Department of Social Welfare and Development (Philippines)|Department of Social Welfare and Development]] Secretary [[Dinky Soliman]] said that the government has been addressing the issue and helping the poor through feeding programs and conditional cash transfers.&lt;ref name="alleyes" /&gt; In 2015, a survey conducted by the [[Social Weather Stations]] revealed that incidence of hunger in the Philippines was reduced but the [[Trade Union Congress of the Philippines]]-Nagkaisa attributed the decrease of hunger to the rapid spreading of pagpag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/news/-main-stories/top-stories/177113/-pagpag-caused-surveyed-hunger-to-drop-.html|title=‘Pagpag’ caused surveyed hunger to drop?|date=13 May 2015|last1=Barcelo|first1=Vito|last2=Araneta|first2=Sandy|accessdate=13 June 2016|newspaper=[[The Manila Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zero waste]] management is seen as a viable solution in stopping the proliferation of pagpag food.&lt;ref name="rcam" /&gt;

==Media coverage==

Extreme hunger in the Philippines that features pagpag has been covered in various television documentaries. In 2003, the episode entitled "''Basurero''" (garbage collector) of the documentary show ''[[I-Witness]]'' of [[GMA Network]] tells a story of poor people collecting leftovers from the trash of fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name="iwitness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/231166/jay-taruc-son-also-rises|title=Jay Taruc: The son also rises|date=11 December 2003|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=The Philippine Star|last=Francisco|first=Butch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the said episode, those people who scavenged for food in trash are called ''magbabatchoy'', which was derived from the word [[batchoy]], a popular Filipino dish. As shown in [[ABS-CBN]] in 2006, ''[[Probe (Philippine TV series)|Probe]]'', another documentary show, features pagpag and mentions health risks of eating pagpag.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/trans/tagalog/new_articles/pagkaing_pagpag_itinanghal_ng_pr.htm|language=Tagalog|title=Pagkaing Pagpag|date=March 9, 2006|accessdate=10 June 2016|website=[[Northern Illinois University]] Center for Southeast Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[CNN]] reported about pagpag in 2012,&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; the reality about problems of hunger in the Philippines was brought to the world's attention.&lt;ref name="alleyes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/05/01/12/pagpag-all-eyes-poverty-ph|title=Pagpag: All eyes on poverty in PH|last=Pedrasa|first=Ira|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also featured an article about residents of [[Payatas]] preparing pagpag in celebration of [[Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt; In February 2018, [[BBC News]] published a 3-minute long mini-documentary showing how pagpag is made, whereby the team followed a bag of meat from the rubbish dump to the dinner table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7gDBVmgIRA |title=Would you eat recycled landfill meat? - BBC News |publisher=YouTube |date=February 26, 2018 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the word==

In common use, [[wikt:pagpag|pagpag]] means the act of shaking off dust or dirt. Pagpag is also a Filipino term for a superstition saying one can never go directly to one's home after attending a funeral unless they have done the pagpag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://preen.inquirer.net/16952/14-of-the-dumbest-superstitions-from-the-philippines|title=14 of the Dumbest Superstitions from the Philippines|last=Manlangit|first=Shinji|date=30 October 2015|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is observed to avoid the following of the dead's soul to the home of the visitor of the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[BusinessWorld]]|url=http://ns5.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Weekender&amp;title=A-horror-treat&amp;id=81266|title=A horror treat|last=Garcia|first=Joseph|date=26 December 2013|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/46787-pagpag-stylish-superstition|title=‘Pagpag:' Stylish superstition|last=Marasigan|first=Zig |date=28 December 2013|accessdate=10 June 2016|newspaper=[[Rappler]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical glaze may contain 20–51% shellac in solution in [[ethyl alcohol]] (grain alcohol) that has not been denatured ([[denatured alcohol]] is poisonous), &lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt; waxes, and titanium dioxide as an opacifying agent. Confectioner’s glaze used for candy contains roughly 35% shellac, while the remaining components are volatile organic compounds that evaporate after the glaze is applied.&lt;ref name=Yacoubou2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yacoubou|first1=Jeanne|title=Q &amp; A on Shellac|url=http://www.vrg.org/blog/2010/11/30/q-a-on-shellac/|website=Vegetarian Resource Group|accessdate=3 July 2014|date=30 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical glaze is used by the drug and [[nutritional supplement]] industry as a coating material for tablets and capsules. It serves to improve the product's appearance, extend [[shelf life]] and protect it from moisture, as well as provide a solid finishing film for pre-print coatings. It also serves to mask unpleasant odors and aid in the swallowing of the tablet.

The shellac coating is insoluble in stomach acid and may make the tablet difficult for the body to break down or assimilate. For this reason, it can also be used as an ingredient in time-released, sustained or delayed-action pills. The product is listed on the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s (FDA) inactive ingredient list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Inactive Ingredients Database|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm113978.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shellac is labeled as GRAS ([[generally recognized as safe]]) by the US FDA and is used as glaze for several types of foods, including some fruit, coffee beans, chewing gum, and candy. Examples of candies containing shellac include [[candy corn]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] [[Whoppers]] and [[Milk Duds]], [[Nestlé]]'s [[Raisinets]] and [[Chocolate-coated peanut|Goobers]], [[Tootsie Roll Industries]]'s [[Junior Mints]] and [[Sugar Babies (candy)|Sugar Babies]], [[Jelly Belly]]'s [[jelly bean]]s and Mint Cremes, [[Russell Stover Candies|Russell Stover]]'s [[jelly beans]], and several candies by [[Godiva Chocolatier]] and [[Gertrude Hawk]]. [[M&amp;M's]] do not contain shellac.&lt;ref name=Yacoubou2010 /&gt;

A competing non-animal-based product is [[zein]], a corn protein.&lt;ref name="Credible"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Klahorst | first = Suanne J. | title = Credible Edible Films |date=September 1999 | journal = Food Product Design | url = http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/466/466_0999ap.html | accessdate = 2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is preferred by some vegans&lt;ref name=Flinn2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flinn|first1=Angel|title=Shellac &amp; Food Glaze|url=http://gentleworld.org/shellac-food-glaze/|website=Gentle World|accessdate=3 July 2014|date=15 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because shellac production can kill many insects.&lt;ref name=Yacoubou2010 /&gt;

==Life==
Christison was born in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Christison, Sir Robert|volume=6|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Prof [[Alexander Christison]] [[FRSE]] (1753–1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-december-1885/18/a-scotch-physicians-autobiography-the-late-sir-rob |title=A Scotch Physician’s Autobiography |journal=[[The Spectator]] |date=19 December 1885 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a twin, his elder brother (by a few minutes) being later Rev. Alexander Christison (1797–1874).&lt;ref&gt;Men of the Time Alaric A Watts&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] before studying Medicine at [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating in 1819.

He then spent a short time in [[London]], studying under [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] and Sir [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]], and in [[Paris]], where he learnt [[analytical chemistry]] from [[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]] and [[toxicology]] from [[Mathieu Orfila]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1822 he returned to Edinburgh as professor of medical [[jurisprudence]], and set to work to organise the study of his subject on a sound basis. On [[poison]]s in particular he speedily became a high authority; his well-known treatise on them was published in 1829, and in the course of his inquiries he did not hesitate to try such daring experiments on himself as taking large doses of [[Calabar bean]] ([[Physostigmine]]). In 1827, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], a position he held until 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=A. Logan|title=Story of a Great Hospital: The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh 1729–1929|date=1937|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attainments in [[medical jurisprudence]] and toxicology procured him the appointment, in 1829, of medical officer to [[the crown]] in [[Scotland]], and from that time until 1866 he was called as a witness in many celebrated criminal cases.

In 1832, Christison gave up the chair of medical jurisprudence and accepted that of medicine and therapeutics, which he held until 1877; at the same time he became professor of clinical medicine, and continued in that capacity until 1855. At this time his address is listed as 3 Great Stuart Street on the Moray Estate, a very large Georgian townhouse in the west end of [[Edinburgh]], a highly desirable area.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83400027&amp;mode=transcription|title=(72) - Scottish Post Office Directories &amp;gt; Towns &amp;gt; Edinburgh &amp;gt; 1805-1834 - Post Office annual directory &amp;gt; 1832-1833 - Scottish Directories|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chairman of a Committee of the General Medical Council he was responsible for the compilation of the first ''[[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia of Great Britain and Ireland]]''. In 1842 he published his ''Dispensatory'', a commentary on the Pharmacopoeia. By his laboratory research, by his writings, by his collections of botanical specimens, Professor Christison became recognised as a world authority on therapeutics, on the manufacture of drugs, and on their presentation to patients.

His fame as a toxicologist and medical jurist, together with his work on the [[pathology]] of the [[kidney]]s and on [[fever]]s, secured him a large private practice, and he succeeded to a fair share of the honors that commonly attend the successful physician, being appointed physician to [[Queen Victoria]] in 1848 and receiving a [[baronet]]cy in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23798 |date=21 November 1871 |page=4795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books which he published were a treatise on ''Granular Degeneration of the Kidneys'' (1839), and a ''Commentary on the Pharmacopoeias of Great Britain'' (1842).

Christison was a strong opposer of women in the field of medicine, a view in Edinburgh eventually undermined by his colleague, [[Patrick Heron Watson]]'s admission of women students to his extra mural surgery classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1033587 | pmid=5325874 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=An Edinburgh surgeon of the Crimean war--Patrick Heron Watson (1832–1907) | year=1966 | journal=Med Hist | pages=166–76 | last1 = Watson | first1 = WB | doi=10.1017/s0025727300010954}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further (still controversial) proposal was his creation of a system of [[Lethal injection]] (through the discovery of [[Physostigmine]] in 1846) for human execution, in place of hanging. For various reasons, although this seems to pre-date its introduction into American use by 40 years, the method never appealed to British sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/notable_fellow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Christison served as Vice President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 1845–1868 and was its President from 1868 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Robert Christison, who retained remarkable physical vigour and activity until extreme old age, died at Edinburgh on 27 January 1882. He is buried in [[New Calton Cemetery]] in a family plot created by his father, Alexander Christison (who is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and only memorialised here), on one of the south-facing terraces.

==Opposition to Women Doctors==
Sir Robert Christison was unequivocally opposed to the notion of women studying medicine and qualifying as doctors and led the campaign against [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] and the [[Edinburgh Seven]]. He was an influential figure both within the University and in the wider civic life of Edinburgh; his opinion was held in high regard.

When the Senatus met on 9 April 1870 to discuss the issue of [[Edith Pechey|Edith Pechey's]] right to a Hope Scholarship having come top of the class in the Chemistry exam, he made his opinions very clear.

He shared the view of many of his contemporaries that Nature intended women to be mothers and housekeepers, and lacked the intellectual ability and stamina of men. Consequently, if women were to enter any learned profession in significant numbers they would lower its standards.

His influence was largely responsible for the eventual decision taken by the University not to allow the women to graduate.

[[James Stansfeld]], who had been very closely associated with the London campaign (following the failure of the Edinburgh campaign) wrote, in his brief history of the events, in 1877:

″Dr Sophia Jex-Blake has made the greatest of all contributions to the end attained. I do not say that she has been the ultimate cause of success. The ultimate cause has been simply this, that the time was at hand. It is one of the lessons of the history of progress that when the time for reform has come you cannot resist it, though if you make the attempt, what you may do is to widen its character or precipitate its advent. Opponents, when the time has come, are not merely dragged at the chariot wheels of progress - they help to turn them. The strongest forces, whichever way it seems to work, does most to aid. The forces of greatest concentration here have been, in my view, on the one hand the Edinburgh University led by Sir Robert Christison, on the other the women claimants led by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake.″
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Shirley|title=Sophia Jex-Blake : a woman pioneer in nineteenth-century medical reform|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0-415-08753-7|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Christison's wife was Henrietta Sophia Brown (1799–1843).

Their children included Sir Alexander Christison, baronet and Dr David Christison MD LLD (1830-1912).

'''Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)-Pesticides''' is a U.S. state-based [[Clinical surveillance|surveillance]] program that monitors [[pesticide]]-related illness and injury.  It is administered by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), twelve [[State health agency|state health agencies]] participate.  NIOSH provides technical support to all participating states.  It also provides funding to some states, in conjunction with the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (US EPA).

Pesticide-related illness is a significant occupational health issue, but it is believed to be underreported.  Because of this, NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program to track pesticide poisonings.  Because workers in many industries are at risk for pesticide exposure, and public concern exists regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides, government and regulatory authorities experience pressure to monitor health effects associated with them.  SENSOR-Pesticides state partners collect case data from several different sources using a standard case definition and set of variables.  This information is then forwarded to the program headquarters at NIOSH where it is compiled and put into a national database.

Researchers and government officials from the SENSOR-Pesticides program have published research articles that highlight findings from the data and their implications for environmental and occupational pesticide issues.  These issues include eradication of invasive species, [[pesticide poisoning]] in schools, [[birth defect]]s, and residential use of [[fogger|total release foggers]], or "bug bombs," which are devices that release an insecticide mist.

==Background==
Although it is a significant occupational health issue, work-related pesticide poisoning is believed to be [[Reporting bias|underreported]].&lt;ref name=sensortexas/&gt;  Before the SENSOR program began, state programs that collected reports of [[occupational disease]]s did not usually conduct interventions.&lt;ref name=concept/&gt;  While over 25 states required reporting of pesticide-related illness, most of them could not compile useful information on incidence or prevalence.&lt;ref name=sensortexas/&gt;  In response to these challenges, NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program as a model to track certain occupational conditions, including pesticides.&lt;ref name=sensortexas/&gt;&lt;ref name=concept/&gt;&lt;ref name=sensorcdph/&gt;

[[File:Epagraph-pesticideuse.PNG|400px|right|alt=Bar graph showing herbicide, insecticide, fungicide, fumigant, and other pesticide usage in the U.S. Each bar is broken into agriculture, industry, and home &amp; garden segments.|thumb|Pesticide usage in the U.S., 2007.]]
Pesticide poisoning is an important occupational health issue because pesticides are used in a large number of industries, which puts many different categories of workers at risk.  From 1995 to 2001, use in agriculture accounted for at least 70% of conventional pesticide use in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=EPA0001/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA9899/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA9697/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA9495/&gt; and the [[US Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] estimates that the agricultural sector has had a similar market share of pesticides since 1979.&lt;ref name=EPA9495/&gt; Pesticides are particularly useful in agriculture because they increase [[crop yields]] and reduce the need for manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 16499408 | year = 2005 | author1 = Litchfield | first1 = M.

NOTE: Please do not change "disinsection" to "disinfection."  It is NOT a typo!  "Disinsection is a technical term for the sterilization of aircraft between international flights for customs purposes.  It is wikilinked for a reason!  Thank you!
--&gt;
Workers in other industries are at risk for exposure as well.&lt;ref name=agpaper/&gt;&lt;ref name=sensor9899/&gt;  For example, commercial availability of pesticides in stores puts retail workers at risk for exposure and illness when they handle pesticide products.&lt;ref name=retail/&gt; The ubiquity of pesticides puts emergency responders such as fire-fighters and police officers at risk, because they are often the first responders to emergency events and may be unaware of the presence of a poisoning hazard.&lt;ref name=emergency/&gt;  The process of [[aircraft disinsection]], in which pesticides are used on inbound international flights for insect and disease control, can also make flight attendants sick.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;&lt;ref name=flight_attendants/&gt;

The widespread use of pesticides, their release into the environment, and the potential for adverse public health effects due to exposure may raise public concern.&lt;ref name=sensor9899/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;  Some feel that regulatory authorities have an ethical obligation to track the health effects of such chemicals.

==History==
[[File:SENSOR-Pesticides state participation 2013 map thumbnail.png|right|alt=U.S. map with SENSOR-Pesticides states highlighted. California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and Washington State are blue; Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas are red.|thumb|Map of SENSOR-Pesticides program participation by State - as of 2013 {{legend|blue| States receiving federal funding for participation}}{{legend|red|Unfunded program partners}}]]
Beginning in 1987, NIOSH supported the implementation of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) program in ten state health departments.  The objectives of the program were to help state health departments develop and refine reporting systems for certain occupational disorders so that they could conduct and evaluate [[health intervention|interventions]] and prevention efforts.  The disorders covered by SENSOR included [[silicosis]], [[occupational asthma]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[pesticide poisoning]].  While each participating state health department had previously done surveillance or interventions for some of these occupational illnesses, SENSOR helped the states to develop and refine their reporting systems and programs.&lt;ref name=1992rpt/&gt;

The original SENSOR-Pesticides model was based on physician reporting. Each state contacted a select group of sentinel health care professionals on a regular basis to collect information.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;  However, this system was labor-intensive and did not yield many cases.&lt;ref name=sensortexas/&gt;  Because different states used different methods for collecting information, their data could not be compiled or compared to analyze for trends.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;  In response, NIOSH, along with other federal agencies (US EPA, National Center for Environmental Health), non-federal agencies (CSTE, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics), and state health departments, developed a standard [[case definition]] and a set of standardized variables.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;  As of 2013, SENSOR-Pesticides had 12 participating states contributing occupational pesticide-related injury and illness data:  [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] received federal funding to support surveillance activities, while [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], and [[Texas]] were unfunded SENSOR-Pesticides program partners.&lt;ref name=clusterimpact&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Calvert | first1 = G. M.| author2 = Higgins | first2 = S. A.| title = Using surveillance data to promote occupational health and safety policies and practice at the state level: A case study| journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine| pages = 188–193| year = 2009 | pmid = 19479875| doi = 10.1002/ajim.20707| volume = 53| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case definition==
A case of pesticide-related illness or injury is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms that are temporally related to a pesticide exposure.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;  Cases are classified as occupational if exposure occurs at work, unless the case was a suicide or an attempted suicide.

Cases are reportable when:
*there is documentation of new adverse health effects temporally related to a documented pesticide exposure AND
*there is consistent evidence of a causal relationship between the pesticide and the health effects based on the known toxicology of the pesticide OR
*there is not enough information to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the health effects.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;
State public health officials rate each case as definite, probable, possible or suspicious.  Illness severity is assigned as low, moderate, severe, or fatal.&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;

==Data collection==
All states in the program require physicians to report pesticide-related injuries and illnesses; however, most states collect the majority of their data from [[Workers' compensation|workers’ compensation]] claims, [[American Association of Poison Control Centers|poison control centers]], and state agencies with jurisdiction over pesticide use, such as state [[Department of agriculture|departments of agriculture]].&lt;ref name=bookch/&gt;&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;  When they receive a report, health department officials review the information to determine whether it was pesticide related.  If it was, they request medical records and try to interview the patient (or a proxy) and anyone else involved in the incident (e.g. supervisors, applicators, and witnesses).  The data is compiled each year and put into a [[national database]].

In addition to identifying, classifying, and tabulating pesticide poisoning cases, the states periodically investigate pesticide-related events and develop interventions aimed at particular industries or pesticide hazards.&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;

==Impact==
Federal and state-level scientists and researchers with SENSOR-Pesticides have published articles on pesticide exposure events and trends using program data.  These articles include MMWR publications&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/pesticides/mmwr.html List of SENSOR-Pesticides MMWR articles].&lt;/ref&gt; and articles in peer-reviewed journals on exposures such as acute pesticide-related illness in youth,&lt;ref name=youth1/&gt;&lt;ref name=youth2/&gt; agricultural workers,&lt;ref name=agpaper/&gt; retail workers,&lt;ref name=retail/&gt; migrant farm workers,&lt;ref name=migrant/&gt; and flight attendants.&lt;ref name=flight_attendants/&gt;  Several articles have attracted media attention and motivated legislative or other governmental action.

===Florida Medfly Eradication Program===
[[File:Male medfly close up insect.jpg|right|alt=Black and orange fly with red eyes sitting on a leaf.|thumb|200px|''Ceratitis capitata'', the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly)]]
In response to a [[Ceratitis capitata|Mediterranean fruit fly]] (also known as “Medfly”) outbreak, officials from the [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] sprayed pesticides (primarily [[malathion]]) and bait over five counties during the spring and summer of 1998.&lt;ref name=MalathionMMWR&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 10577491 | year = 1999 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Surveillance for acute pesticide-related illness during the Medfly eradication program--Florida, 1998 | volume = 48 | issue = 44 | pages = 1015–1018, 1027 | journal = MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists from the [[University of Florida]]’s [[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]] stated that malathion was being sprayed in a manner that did not pose a significant risk to public health.&lt;ref name=ufmalathion/&gt;  During the eradication effort, the [[Florida Department of Health]] investigated 230 cases of illness that were attributed to the pesticide.&lt;ref name=MalathionMMWR/&gt;  Officials from the Florida Department of Health and the SENSOR-Pesticides program published an article in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] (MMWR) that described these case reports and recommended alternative methods for Medfly control, including exclusion activities at [[port of entry|ports of entry]] to prevent importation, more rapid detection through increased sentinel [[insect trap|trapping]] densities, and the release of [[sterile insect technique|sterile male flies]] to interrupt the reproductive cycle.&lt;ref name=MalathionMMWR/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) incorporated these suggestions into their 2001 [[Environmental Impact Statement]] on the Fruit Fly Cooperative Control Program.&lt;ref name=usdaeis/&gt;  These impact statements guide the USDA's development of insect control strategies and decisions.

===Pesticides in schools===
Researchers  from the SENSOR-Pesticides program published an article in 2005 in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) on pesticide poisoning in schools. The article, which included data collected by SENSOR, described illnesses in students and school employees associated with pesticide exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Alarcon | first1 = W.| last2 = Calvert | first2 = G.| last3 = Blondell | first3 = J.| last4 = Mehler | first4 = L.| last5 = Sievert | first5 = J.| last6 = Propeck | first6 = M.| last7 = Tibbetts | first7 = D.| last8 = Becker | first8 = A.| last9 = Lackovic | first9 = M.| last10 = Soileau | first10 = S.

The article generated media coverage and drew attention to pesticide safety in schools and to safer alternatives to pesticides through [[integrated pest management]] (IPM).&lt;ref name=school1/&gt;&lt;ref name=school2/&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMAcrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=school3/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;  "[T]he study does provide evidence that using pesticides at schools is not innocuous and that there are better ways to use pesticides," said study co-author Dr. Geoffrey Calvert.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;  Officials in organizations supporting the pesticide industry, such as CropLife America and RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, a trade association representing pesticide manufacturers and suppliers), reacted strongly to the report, calling it “alarmist” and “incomplete” in its health reporting.&lt;ref name=JAMAcrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; CropLife America president Jay Vroom claimed that the report was “written without context about the proper use of pesticides in schools and [did] not mention the positive public health protections they provide"&lt;ref name=JAMAcrit/&gt; and stated that pesticide use in schools is "well regulated" and can be managed so that the risk is low.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;  RISE president Allen James faulted the article for relying on unverified reports and said that evidence suggested that such incidents were extremely rare.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;  The increased awareness of pesticide use in schools influenced parents and other stakeholders in numerous states to call for the adoption of integrated pest management programs.&lt;ref name=ipm/&gt;  According to the [[National Pest Management Association]], three more states passed IPM rules or laws between October 2005 and October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;G. Harrington, committee head for the National Pest Management Association. (10 October 2008). Personal communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth defects in Florida and North Carolina===
In February 2005, three infants were born with [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] to migrant farmworkers within eight weeks of each other in [[Collier County, Florida]].&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;&lt;ref name=cluster/&gt;  Because one of the mothers had worked in North Carolina and the other two worked in Florida, neither state's health department attributed the cluster to pesticide exposure at first.  However, when they presented their findings at the annual SENSOR-Pesticides workshop in 2006, they realized that all three mothers worked for the same tomato grower during the period of [[organogenesis]] while pregnant, and that they may have been exposed to pesticides.  The state health departments reported the cluster to their respective state agricultural departments.&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt; The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services inspected the grower's farms in Florida and fined the company $111,200 for violations they discovered; the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducted a similar inspection of farms in North Carolina and fined the company $184,500.&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmn/&gt;  After the investigation, North Carolina Governor [[Mike Easley]] assembled the “Governor’s Task Force on Preventing Agricultural Pesticide Exposure.”  It presented its findings in April 2008,&lt;ref name=taskforce/&gt; which caused the state legislature to pass anti-retaliation and recordkeeping laws, training mandates to protect the health of agricultural workers, and funding for improved surveillance.&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;  In Florida, the state legislature added ten new pesticide inspectors to the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]].&lt;ref name=clusterimpact/&gt;&lt;ref name=palmbeach/&gt;

===Total release foggers===
[[Fogger|Total release foggers]] (TRFs), or "bug bombs," release a fog of insecticide to kill bugs in a room and coat surfaces with a chemical so the insects do not return.  It is estimated that 50 million TRFs are used in the US annually.&lt;ref name=bradbury_letter/&gt;  SENSOR-Pesticides federal and state staff, along with officials from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), published an article in the CDC MMWR that called attention to injuries and illnesses resulting from use of total release foggers.&lt;ref name=mmwr&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 18923383 | year = 2008 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Illnesses and injuries related to total release foggers--eight states, 2001-2006 | volume = 57 | issue = 41 | pages = 1125–1129 | journal = MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report| url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5741a3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] (DEC) published a press release in response, stating that the state would restrict their use.&lt;ref name=nydec/&gt;  DEC Commissioner [[Alexander Pete Grannis|Pete Granis]] announced that the department would move to classify foggers as a [[Restricted use pesticide|restricted-use product]] in New York State, meaning that only certified pesticide applicators would be able to obtain them.  In March 2010, US EPA announced required label changes on indoor TRF products that reflect the label change recommendations made in the MMWR article.&lt;ref name=epa_letter/&gt;

'''SLITRK1''' ("SLIT and NTRK-like family, member 1")  is a human [[gene]] that codes for a transmembrane and signalling protein that is part of the SLITRK gene family, which is responsible for [[synapse]] regulation and presynaptic differentiation in the brain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beaubien F, Raja R, Kennedy TE, Fournier AE, Cloutier JF | title = Slitrk1 is localized to excitatory synapses and promotes their development | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 27343 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27273464 | pmc = 4895136 | doi = 10.1038/srep27343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Um JW, Kim KH, Park BS, Choi Y, Kim D, Kim CY, Kim SJ, Kim M, Ko JS, Lee SG, Choii G, Nam J, Heo WD, Kim E, Lee JO, Ko J, Kim HM | title = Structural basis for LAR-RPTP/Slitrk complex-mediated synaptic adhesion | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 5423 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25394468 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms6423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chattopadhyay K, Chatterjee K | title = The genetic factors influencing the development of trichotillomania | journal = Journal of Genetics | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 259–62 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22942103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expression of the gene has been linked to early formation of excitatory synapses through binding with receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP (LAR-RPTP).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Various studies over the years have linked mutations in the gene to conditions on the OCD spectrum, [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[trichotillomania]], however the mutations in the genome itself vary greatly between individuals, with most mutations observed being hard to find in repeat studies.

== Gene ==
The gene for SLITRK1 is located on chromosome 13q31.1. The gene is expressed only in the brain of humans. The mRNA can differ from alternative splicing, and contains domains for the extracellular matrix as well as for the LRRs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mice contain an ortholog of the gene called Slitrk1.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/114798|title=SLITRK1 SLIT and NTRK like family member 1 [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein structure ==
SLITRK1 contains 2 horseshoe shaped leucine rich repeat domains ([[Leucine-rich repeat|LRRs]]) in its extracellular domain which are vital to its function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The LRRs have 6 modules each and are connected by a 70-90 amino acid loops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; LRR1 is a more conserved sequence and is present as a dimer while LRR2 is a monomer and has a more variable sequence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The conserved sequence of LRR1 contains critical binding pockets and specific charged residues that are important for it to carry out its function of binding to LAR-RPTPs on the N-terminus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both LRR sequences are randomly positioned on the protein and contain variable linker regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The protein also contains a short intracellular domain, but lacks a tyrosine phosphorylation motif which is present in other SLITRK genes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karagiannidis I, Rizzo R, Tarnok Z, Wolanczyk T, Hebebrand J, Nöthen MM, Lehmkuhl G, Farkas L, Nagy P, Barta C, Szymanska U, Panteloglou G, Miranda DM, Feng Y, Sandor P, Barr C, Paschou P | title = Replication of association between a SLITRK1 haplotype and Tourette Syndrome in a large sample of families | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 665–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22083730 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2011.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
SLITKR1 is highly expressed in the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It plays a critical part in regulating synapse formation between hippocampal neurons and in differentiation of synapses, helping in neuronal outgrowth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozomaro U, Cai G, Kajiwara Y, Yoon S, Makarov V, Delorme R, Betancur C, Ruhrmann S, Falkai P, Grabe HJ, Maier W, Wagner M, Lennertz L, Moessner R, Murphy DL, Buxbaum JD, Züchner S, Grice DE | title = Characterization of SLITRK1 variation in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e70376 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23990902 | pmc = 3749144 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0070376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expressed during embryonic stages and postnatally but expression decreases over time and is localized to the postsynaptic membrane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Overexpression of SLITKR1 promotes postsynaptic differentiation for excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but because of the localization only excitatory synapses are affected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inhibition of SLITKR1 only reduces differentiation of excitatory synapses because of this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Interaction with LAR-RPTP ===
Since they lack tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, SLITKR1 binds to LAR-RPTP through its LRR1 region in order to differentiate synapses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The LRR2 domain's function is not clearly understood yet but it is hypothesised that it is for dimerization to the cell surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

LAR-RPTP binds to the LRR1 region through its PTPδ Ig region, with 3 separate binding sites in a 1:1 binding ratio.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ig1 binds through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, Ig2 binds through ionic and hydrogen bonds, and Ig2 binds through hydrogen bonding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The unique properties on the concave surface are what determine which LAR-RPTP binds to it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the proper LAR-RPTP is not bound to the LRR1 then synapse formation cannot occur, but bonding can still occur. Once they are bound properly, the complex is sufficient for synapse differentiation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Point mutations in the LRR1 region impaired differentiation as well but not binding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Tourette syndrome ===
The SLITRK1 gene "is not a major risk gene for the majority of individuals" with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS), according to a 2009 review,&lt;ref name=Rourke&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Psychosom Res |date= 2009  |volume= 67 |issue= 6 |pages= 533–45 |doi= 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.06.006 |title= The genetics of Tourette syndrome: a review|vauthors= O'Rourke JA, Scharf JM, Yu D, Pauls DL |pmc= 2778609}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its study can help contribute to our understanding of TS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grados MA, Walkup JT | title = A new gene for Tourette's syndrome: a window into causal mechanisms? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 291–3 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16678301 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abelson JF, Kwan KY, O'Roak BJ, Baek DY, Stillman AA, Morgan TM, Mathews CA, Pauls DL, Rasin MR, Gunel M, Davis NR, Ercan-Sencicek AG, Guez DH, Spertus JA, Leckman JF, Dure LS, Kurlan R, Singer HS, Gilbert DL, Farhi A, Louvi A, Lifton RP, Sestan N, State MW | title = Sequence variants in SLITRK1 are associated with Tourette's syndrome | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5746 | pages = 317–20 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16224024 | doi = 10.1126/science.1116502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare variants in SLITRK1 may lead to TS, and mutations in non-coding regions of SLITRK1 may also play a part, but further research needs to be done before any conclusions can be drawn.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2005, medical researchers observed a ''de novo'' translocation on 13q in a patient with TS which broke the patient's chromosome near the SLITRK1 genome.  In screening of additional patients, the authors observed a [[frameshift mutation]] in SLITRK1 in a patient with TS and the same rare non-coding variant (called var321 and varCDfs) in two patients with TS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These variants were not found in several thousand controls supporting an association of the variants with TS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A subsequent examination of the region of the SLITRK1 gene found the mutation in none of 82 patients with Tourette syndrome.  The authors concluded that tests to detect variant(s) in the gene probably would have little diagnostic utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deng H, Le WD, Xie WJ, Jankovic J | title = Examination of the SLITRK1 gene in Caucasian patients with Tourette syndrome | journal = Acta Neurologica Scandinavica | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 400–2 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17083340 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2006.00706.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment in the effects of a microdeletion in chromosome 13q31.1 was done in a fetus, the mother had passed the microdeletion to the child and both did not have tourettes or any other OCD symptoms, showing that it may not be a direct cause of tourettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jia Y, Zhao H, Shi D, Peng W, Xie L, Wang W, Jiang F, Zhang H, Wang X | title = Genetic effects of a 13q31.1 microdeletion detected by noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) | journal = International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 7003–11 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25400788 | pmc = 4230093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further attempts to replicate the study were done in multiple studies. In a Japanese study, [[next-gen sequencing]] was used to screen 92 TS patients and 361 healthy controls, none of TS patients were found to have mutations at either variant or any new mutations in the gene.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inai A, Tochigi M, Kuwabara H, Nishimura F, Kato K, Eriguchi Y, Shimada T, Furukawa M, Kawamura Y, Sasaki T, Kakiuchi C, Kasai K, Kano Y | title = Analysis of SLITRK1 in Japanese patients with Tourette syndrome using a next-generation sequencer | journal = Psychiatric Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 256–8 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26317387 | doi = 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a European study it was found that the 2 original variations were not found in any of the 222 trios that were studied. However, tests were also done on [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] in the groups and 3 were found to have variations. Two of the three variations were found to be associated with the formation of Tourette syndrome.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In a different study of 381 Caucasians with some form of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] with 356 non-OCD control patients, 3 genetic changes were found after genetic screening. Of the 3, 2 were identified only once each and the third was found in 4 OCD patients but also in a non-OCD patient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The non-OCD patient did have compulsive nail biting, but these studies show that a genetic link between SLITRK1 and patients with TS may exist &lt;!--missing a word--&gt; they are more complex in nature than previously understood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Trichotillomania ===
The SLITRK1 gene has also been implicated in a small percentage of cases of [[trichotillomania]], an impulse disorder in which individuals compulsively pull their own hair.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chamberlain SR, Menzies L, Sahakian BJ, Fineberg NA | title = Lifting the veil on trichotillomania | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 4 | pages = 568–74 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17403968 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.164.4.568 | author3-link = Barbara Sahakian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuchner S, Cuccaro ML, Tran-Viet KN, Cope H, Krishnan RR, Pericak-Vance MA, Wright HH, Ashley-Koch A | title = SLITRK1 mutations in trichotillomania | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 887–9 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17003809 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001865 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the previously mentioned studies the mother of the child who had a ''de novo'' translocation on 13q had trichotillomania; this would suggest that there could be a genetic link between SLITRK1 and trichotillomania as well.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A study was done in which 44 families with individuals who had trichotillomania had their SLITRK1 gene sequenced. Two new non-synonymous mutations were discovered about 9 base pairs apart from each other, in an area separate from the one where the Tourette mutations were found.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These results were compared to a control and none had the mutation, suggesting that these mutations, while rare, were associated with trichotillomania.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24745">{{sexual orientation}}
'''Sociosexual orientation''', or '''sociosexuality''', is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a more ''restricted'' sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more ''unrestricted'' sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gangestad | first2 = S.W. | year = 1991 | title = Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 870–883 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.6.870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{Main|Sociosexual Orientation Inventory}}
The revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) was designed to measure sociosexuality, with high SOI scores corresponding to an unrestricted orientation and low SOI scores denoting a more restricted orientation. The SOI-R also allows for the separate assessment of three facets of sociosexuality: behavior, attitude and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penke | first1 = L. | last2 = Asendorpf | first2 = J. B. | year = 2008 | title = Beyond global sociosexual orientations: A more differentiated look at sociosexuality and its effects on courtship and romantic relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 5| pages = 1113–1135 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.5.1113 | pmid=18954197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences and sexual orientation==
Men tend to have higher SOI scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D. P. | year = 2005 | title = Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 247–311 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000051 | pmid=16201459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D.

W. | last2 = Simpson | first2 = J. A. | year = 2000 | title = The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 573–587 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x0000337x | pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] women are significantly less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both [[lesbian]] and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women. Bisexual women are also the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by lesbians and then, heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt; [[Homosexuality|Gay]] and bisexual men are similar to heterosexual men in sociosexual attitudes, in that they express relatively unrestricted attitudes relative to women. However, gay men are the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by bisexual men and then, heterosexual men. This may be because gay men have more potential mating partners who prefer short-term, casual sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt;

Unrestricted sociosexuality is associated with early life experiences with sex, more frequent [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and a greater number of lifetime sex partners.  Unrestricted men tend to have greater [[rape myth]] acceptance, past sexual aggression and more conservative attitudes about women than restricted men. Unrestricted women tend to have more sexual fantasies involving having power or control over another person and lower levels of sexual conservatism than restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yost | first1 = M.

High [[self-monitoring]] is also associated with unrestricted sociosexuality, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakaguchi | first1 = K. | last2 = Sakai | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ueda | first3 = K. | last4 = Hasegawa | first4 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Robust association between sociosexuality and self-monitoring in heterosexual and non-heterosexual Japanese | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 815–825 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with an intrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as an end) tend to be sociosexually restricted, while those with an [[extrinsic religious orientation]] (i.e., religion as a mean to achieve non-religious goals) tend to be unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowatt | first1 = W.C. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = D.P. | year = 2003 | title = Associations between religious orientation and varieties of sexual experience | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 455–465 | doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mating tendencies==

===Motives===
Unrestricted women are more motivated to engage in casual sex than restricted women as they perceive more benefits associated with short-term mating. These include sexual benefits (e.g., experiencing the novelty of a new partner), resource benefits (e.g., receiving expensive gifts) and the improvement of their seduction skills. Sociosexuality is not associated with short-term benefits for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greiling | first1 = H. | last2 = Buss | first2 = D. M. | year = 2000 | title = Women's sexual strategies: The hidden dimension of extra-pair mating | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 929–963 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewing attractive female models, unrestricted men are more interested in the models’ [[physical attractiveness]], while restricted men show more interest in the social traits presumably possessed by attractive females. Unrestricted women report more interest in attractive male models’ popularity and are less interested in their willingness to commit, compared to restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Townsend | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Wasserman | first2 = T. | year = 1998 | title = Sexual attractiveness: Sex differences in assessment and criteria | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 171–191 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mate preferences===
Men and women with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation view short-term mates with greater sexual experience as more desirable, whereas restricted women perceive partners’ sexual inexperience as desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiederman | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Dubois | first2 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = Evolution and sex differences in preferences for short-term mates: Results from a [[policy capturing]] study | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 153–170 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprecher | first1 = S. | last2 = Regan | first2 = P.

A. | last2 = Gangestad | first2 = S. W. | year = 1992 | title = Sociosexuality and romantic partner choice | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 31–51 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00264.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of sexual attractiveness is more variable in unrestricted men than in restricted males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=J.

Individuals are able to accurately assess the sociosexual orientation of computer-generated and real faces, with unrestricted sociosexuality being associated with greater attractiveness in female faces and greater masculinity in male faces. Women tend to prefer male faces associated with restricted sociosexuality, while men prefer unrestricted female faces, both for short-term and long-term partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boothroyd | first1 = L.

===Relationship interactions===
Unrestricted women report engaging in more social interactions with men on a daily basis than restricted women. However, unrestricted individuals rate their interactions with their best friends (non-romantic) as lower in quality (i.e., as less pleasant and satisfying) than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hebl | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Kashy | first2 = D. A. | year = 1995 | title = Sociosexuality and everyday social interaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 371–383 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to view cheating or [[infidelity]] as acceptable under certain conditions (e.g., when involved in a bad relationship), and report engaging in more cheating than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Cauffman | first2 = E. | year = 1999 | title = Your cheatin' heart: Attitudes, behaviors, and correlates of sexual betrayal in late adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–252 | doi=10.1207/s15327795jra0903_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity is mediated by commitment, meaning unrestricted individuals may cheat because they are less committed to their partner than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattingly | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Clark | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Weidler | first3 = D. J. | last4 = Bullock | first4 = M. | last5 = Hackathorn | first5 = J. | last6 = Blankmeyer | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Sociosexual orientation, commitment, and infidelity: A mediation analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 151 | issue = 3| pages = 222–226 | doi=10.1080/00224540903536162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormones==
Individuals who are partnered typically have lower [[testosterone]] levels than individuals who are single. However, this was found to apply solely to individuals possessing a restricted sociosexual orientation. Partnered, unrestricted men and women’s testosterone levels are more similar to the levels of single men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edelsteinlab.psych.lsa.umich.edu/pubs/Edelstein%20et%20al%202011%20HB.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Edelstein|first1=R.S.|last2=Chopik|first2=W.J.|last3=Kean|first3=E.L.|year=2011|title=Sociosexuality moderates the association between testosterone and relationship status in men and women|work=Hormones and Behavior|volume=60 |pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
In regions that suffer from a high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s, both men and women report lower levels of sociosexuality, as the costs of an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaller | first1 = M. | last2 = Murray | first2 = D. R. | year = 2008 | title = Pathogens, personality and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 212–221 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 | pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Possessing an unrestricted sociosexual orientation seems to increase the likelihood of having a son by 12-19% in American samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S. | last2 = Apari | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Sociosexually unrestricted parents have more sons: A further application of the generalized Trivers-Willard hypothesis (gTWH) | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 320–330 | doi=10.1080/03014460902766918}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by the generalized [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis|Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], which states that parents who possess any heritable trait that increases males’ reproductive success above females’  will have more sons, and will have more daughters if they possess traits that increase females’ reproductive success above males’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S | year = 2005 | title = Big and tall parents have more sons: Further generalizations of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 235 | issue = 4| pages = 583–590 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since unrestricted sociosexuality increases the reproductive fitness of sons more than daughters (as males have the potential to have more offspring through casual sex), unrestricted parents have a higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more sons).

==Relevant theories==

===Parental investment theory===
According to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation).&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Eds.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871-1971. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; In a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. Thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. Men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. Thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.

===Sex ratio theory===
[[Operational sex ratio]] is the number of sexually competing males versus the number of sexually competing females in the local mating pool.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"/&gt; High sex ratios indicate that there are more men than women available, while low sex ratios imply more women than men are sexually available. High sex ratios (more men) are associated with lower SOI scores (more restricted sociosexual orientation), as men must satisfy women’s preference for long-term [[Monogamy|monogamous]] relationships if they are to effectively compete for the limited number of women. Low sex ratios (more women) are correlated with more unrestricted sociosexuality, as men can afford to demand more casual sex if they are relatively scarce and in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = F. A. | year = 1991 | title = Secular trends in human sex ratios: Their influence on individual and family behavior | url = | journal = Human Nature | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 271–291 | doi=10.1007/bf02692189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic pluralism theory===
{{Main|Strategic pluralism}}Strategic pluralism suggests that women evolved to evaluate men on two dimensions: their potential to be a good provider for offspring and their degree of genetic quality. The local environment should have influenced which mate characteristics were preferred by women. In demanding environments where biparental care was critical to infant survival, women should have valued good parenting qualities more, leading men to adopt a more restricted sociosexual orientation and invest more in their offspring to help ensure their children survive. In disease-prevalent environments, good genes that would help offspring resist [[pathogen]]s should have been prioritized by women, leading healthy men to be more sociosexually unrestricted in order to pass on their genes to many offspring.&lt;ref name="Gangestad" /&gt;

===Social structural theory===
According to social structural theory, the division of labor and social expectations lead to gender differences in sociosexuality. In cultures with more traditional gender roles (where women have less freedom than men), gender differences in sociosexual orientation are larger. In these societies, where women have less access to power and money than men, it is expected that women should be more sexually restricted and only have sexual relations with men in the context of a committed relationship, whereas men may be sexually unrestricted if they wish. In more egalitarian societies, where men and women have equal access to power and money, the gender difference in sociosexuality is less pronounced, as individuals may take on the social role of the other gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A. H. | year = 2002 | title = A cross-cultural analysis of the behavior of men and women: Implications for the origins of sex differences | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 5| pages = 699–727 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.699 | pmid=12206191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wasserturm Degerloch (2009, Gesehen vom Stuttgarter Fernsehturm).jpg|thumb]]
The '''Water Tower Stuttgart Degerloch''' is a bricked water tower in [[Stuttgart]]-Degerloch, [[Germany]]. It was built in 1911/1912 and is 28 metres high. The water tower in Stuttgart Degerloch has a diameter of 10.9 metres, a height of 28 metres and a container volume of 400 m³. During World War II the water tower provided a marking point by the allied planes for the bombing of the heavy anti aircraft flak battery in Degerloch. This scenario prompted the authorities to blast three metres from the top of the water tower to bring its height even with the height level of the trees nearby thus  blending the towers appearance in with the forest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Tacpac''' (Touch and Communication Pac) is a sensory communication resource using touch and music to align the [[sense]]s and develop [[communication skills]]. It helps those who have any kind of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]] or communication difficulties. It can also help those who have [[tactile defensiveness]], profound and multiple [[Learning impairment|learning difficulties]], [[autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[dementia]].

Tacpac uses specially composed music that matches the texture of the object for each activity so that those who are receiving Tacpac have an aligned experience. Over time, users can employ this to help them communicate. 

Tacpac comes in the form of a subscription which is accessed both on the website and also on the app for phones and tablets. The resources include the full music tracks, instruction videos for each activity, and downloadable/printable records that keep sheets and instruction sheets. The app enables users to play full music tracks without an [[internet connection]].

Through repetition of activities in the Tacpac repertoire, a receiver learns to show responses that can be understood: e.g., those manifesting like/dislike; want/rejection; and know/nescient. Users can begin to move in response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], anticipate activities, and relate to the helper. These primal responses that comprise pre-intentional and [[Affect (psychology)|affectiv]]e communication can be crucial steps toward more clearly defined intentional communication and even [[language acquisition]].

As one researcher writes{{ref|pease}}: "One of the most effective ways of establishing contact with [[Deafblindness|deafblind]] children and so encouraging a communicative response is to share activities with a high levels of [[physical contact]] and pleasant sensations. These include [...] Tacpac, a package where taped music is linked to a range of [[tactile sense|tactile sensations]]."

The number of research projects around Tacpac is growing{{ref|panter}}{{ref|serpa}}{{ref|spevi}}. It has found support from the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] in the UK, and has growing followers amongst multi-sensory impairment networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">The '''Tanner scale''' (also known as the '''Tanner stages''') is a scale of [[Child development|physical development in children]], [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitals]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] hair. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082|Tanner's stages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5440182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent or pediatric).

; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9–11)
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11–12.5)
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5–14)

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I
: no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13–15)
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+)

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]]) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: adult–like hair quality, extending across [[mons pubis|pubis]] but sparing medial thighs (13–15)
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+)

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the [[pornography]] industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.&lt;ref name="pmid9882230"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|author2=Tanner, JM |title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theca folliculi''' comprise a layer of the [[ovarian follicle]]s. They appear as the follicles become [[secondary follicle]]s.

The theca are divided into two layers, the '''[[theca interna]]''' and the '''[[theca externa]]'''.

Theca cells are a group of endocrine cells in the ovary made up of connective tissue surrounding the follicle that has many diverse functions during folliculogenesis.&lt;ref name=pmid20628033&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=J. M. |last2=McNeilly |first2=A. S. |title=Theca: the forgotten cell of the ovarian follicle |journal=Reproduction |volume=140 |issue=4 |pages=489–504 |year=2010 |pmid=20628033 |doi=10.1530/REP-10-0094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These roles include synthesizing [[androgens]], providing signal transduction between [[granulosa cells]] and [[oocytes]] during development by the establishment of a vascular system, providing nutrients, and providing structure and support to the follicle as it matures.&lt;ref name=pmid20628033/&gt; The theca cells are responsible for the production of [[androstenedione]], and indirectly the production of 17β [[estradiol]], also called E2, by supplying the neighboring [[granulosa cells]] with [[androstenedione]] that with the help of the enzyme [[aromatase]] can be used as a substrate for this type of [[estradiol]]. FSH induces the granulosa cells to make aromatase that converts the androgens made by the theca interna into estradiol.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

Theca cells with granulosa cells help form the [[corpus luteum]]. Theca cells are only correlated with developing ovarian follicles.&lt;ref name=pmid15833266&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Magoffin |first1=Denis A. |title=Ovarian theca cell |journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1344–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15833266 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2005.01.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the leading cause of endocrine-based infertility, as either hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the theca cells can lead to fertility problems; hyperactivity of theca cells causes hyperandrogenism, and hypoactivity leads to a lack of estrogen.&lt;ref name=pmid15833266/&gt; Granulosa cell tumors, while rare (less than 5% of ovarian cancers), involve both the granulosa cells and the theca cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kottarathil |first1=Vijaykumar Dehannathparambil |last2=Antony |first2=Michelle Aline |last3=Nair |first3=Indu R. |last4=Pavithran |first4=Keechilat |title=Recent Advances in Granulosa Cell Tumor Ovary: A Review |journal=Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |year=2013 |pmid=24426698 |pmc=3578540 |doi=10.1007/s13193-012-0201-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WebMD''' is an [[United States|American]] corporation known primarily as an [[Online and offline|online]] [[Publishing|publisher]] of news and information pertaining to human [[health]] and [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What We Do For Our Users|url = http://www.webmd.com/about-webmd-policies/about-what-we-do-for-our-users|website = WebMD|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes information pertaining to drugs. It is one of the top healthcare websites by unique visitors.

It was founded in 1996 by internet entrepreneur [[Jeff Arnold (Internet entrepreneur)|Jeff Arnold]]. In early 1999 it was part of a three way merger with Sapient Health Network (SHN) and Direct Medical Knowledge (DMK). SHN began in Portland, OR in 1996 by Jim Kean, Bill Kelly, and Kris Nybakken, who worked together at a CD-ROM publishing firm, Creative Multimedia. Later in 1999, WebMD merged with [[Healtheon]], founded by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications]]&amp;nbsp;founder [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Traffic==
During 2015, WebMD’s network of websites reached more [[unique visitor]]s each month than any other leading private or government healthcare website, making it the leading health publisher in the United States.&lt;ref name="comScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Ranks-the-Top-50-US-Digital-Media-Properties-for-December-2015/|title=comScore Ranks the Top 50 U.S. Digital Media Properties for December 2015|author=|date=|website=comscore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth quarter of 2016, WebMD recorded an average of 179.5 million unique users per month, and 3.63 billion page views per quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/WBMD/4075514959x0x929898/89CBE95F-8CF1-4234-B809-D93060391CE5/WBMD_Q4_16_TRANSCRIPT.pdf|title = Transcript of Q4 2016 WebMD Earnings Conference Call|publisher = Investor.shareholder.com|date = February 16, 2017|accessdate = March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
WebMD is best known as a health information services [[website]], which publishes content regarding health and health care topics, including a symptom checklist, pharmacy information, drugs information, and blogs of physicians with specific topics, and provides a place to store personal medical information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[URAC]], the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, has accredited WebMD’s operations continuously since 2001 regarding everything from proper disclosures and health content to security and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urac.org/directory/CompanyView.aspx?cid=C8700007DBE&amp;aid=3367&amp;Type=Accreditnet|title=WebMD Health Services Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company reported $705 million in revenue for the year 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017, private equity company [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (K.K.R.)]] agreed to purchase WebMD Health Corporation for approximately $2.8 billion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/business/dealbook/kkr-webmd-natures-bounty.html|title=K.K.R. to Buy WebMD and Take Majority Stake in Nature’s Bounty|last=Bray|first=Chad|date=2017-07-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-20|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Company ==
WebMD is financed by advertising, third-party contributions, and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the sponsors have influence over the content on WebMD.[http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/702211.html "Web sites for medical information,"] ''News and Observer,'' September 13, 2007 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203184228/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/702211.html|date=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that WebMD, "has struggled with a fall in advertising revenue with pharmaceutical companies slashing marketing budgets as several blockbuster drugs go off patent." In response, WebMD began investing in changes to its site which the company hopes will entice users who use its site seeking specific information, to linger on the site reviewing other material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WebMD CEO Redmond leaving; company reports narrower loss|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-07/lifestyle/sns-rt-us-webmd-resultsbre94610c-20130507_1_affordable-care-act-health-plan-revenue|newspaper=y 7, 2013|first1=Pallavi|last1=Ail|first2=Adithya|last2=Venkatesan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WebMD offers services to physicians and private clients. For example, they publish ''WebMD the Magazine'', a patient-directed publication distributed bimonthly to 85 percent of physician waiting rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writenews.com/2005/042205_webmd_magazine.htm "WebMD Corporation Launches Print Magazine,"] ''The Write News'', April 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Medscape is a professional portal for physicians featuring the most recent news and peer-review articles as well as training materials, a drug database, and clinical information on 30 medical specialty areas and more than 30 physician discussion boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/public/about|title=About Medscape|author=|date=|website=www.medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; WebMD Health Services provides private health management programs and benefit decision-support portals to employers and health plans.

The WebMD Health Network operates WebMD Health and other health-related sites including: [[Medscape]], [[MedicineNet]], [[eMedicine]], eMedicineHealth, RxList, theheart.org, Medscape Education, and other-owned WebMD sites. These sites provide similar services to those of WebMD; MedicineNet is an online media publishing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12510|title=About Us - MedicineNet.com|author=|date=|website=medicinenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medscape offers up-to-date information for physicians and other healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/pages/public/about/about|title=Medscape - About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; RxList offers detailed information about pharmaceutical information on generic and name-brand drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=64467|title=About Us - RxList.com|author=|date=|website=rxlist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; eMedicineHealth is a consumer site offering similar information to that of WebMD.

'''Zichron Menachem''' is the [[Israel]]i association for the support of children with [[cancer]] and their families.  It offers immediate, practical and long-term solutions to the wide range of problems that must be overcome from the moment that a child has been diagnosed with [[cancer]]. It also provides support to children who have a parent living with cancer.  The organization is headquartered in [[Jerusalem]] and operates in all major Israeli hospitals with [[pediatric]] [[oncology]]/[[hematology]] wards.

== History ==
Zichron Menachem was established in 1990 in memory of Menachem Ehrental, an Israeli boy who battled cancer for over 14 years - from age 18 months until his young death. Drawing on their vast experience as parents of a cancer-stricken child, Menachem's parents, together with family and friends, founded Zichron Menachem as a [[nonprofit]] organization aimed at easing the suffering of young cancer patients and their families. 

By 2006 Zichron Menachem has helped thousands of children and families. It has an extensive network of hundreds of professionally trained volunteers in every part of [[Israel]].

== Programs ==
All Zichron Menachem programs, activities and facilities are offered free-of-charge to children stricken with cancer, and their families, regardless of their [[religion]], ethnic origin or socio-economic status. 

Its programs include:
* [[Support group]]s for parents, [[Jewish bereavement|bereaved]] parents and children
* Big brothers and sisters
* Permanent hospital staffing
* Three annual adventure camps
* Weekly parties
* Fun days
* Reservoir of [[Blood bank|blood products]]
* Guesthouse
* [[Baldness|Hair wigs]] for cancer patients, made from hair donated by volunteers
* Lending library
* Psycho-social and professional support
* Advocacy

== Day center ==
The Zichron Menachem Day Center in [[Jerusalem]] is an educational, recreational and rehabilitation center dedicated for the exclusive use of children with cancer and their families. Many of these children have suppressed immune systems due to chemotherapy, and in order to protect their already fragile health, they cannot always attend school and social events. The center offers these children a clean environment where they continue their studies, undergo specific therapies and enjoy a wide range of fun and entertaining activities. Music, computers, art, rocketry, sports, photography and journalism are but a few of the many extracurricular activities offered to the children. The Day Center offers these same activities to the sick child’s brothers and sisters during the afternoon and early evening hours.
