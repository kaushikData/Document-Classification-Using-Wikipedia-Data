'''''Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America''''' is a 1989 book by [[David Hackett Fischer]] that details the folkways of four groups of people who moved from distinct regions of [[Great Britain]] ([[Albion]]) to the [[United States]]. The argument is that the culture of each of the groups persisted, to provide the basis for the modern United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer explains "the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly [[democracy|democratic]] in its politics, [[capitalism|capitalist]] in its economy, [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in its laws and [[individualism|individualist]] in its society and [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] in its culture."&lt;ref&gt;Hackett Fischer, David. ''Albion's Seed'' Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer describes ''Albion's Seed'' as a modified Teutonic germ theory within the framework of the [[Frontier Thesis]] and the migration model.

==Four folkways==
The four migrations are discussed in the four main chapters of the book:
* '''[[East Anglia]] and the [[Netherlands]] to [[Massachusetts]]'''
:''The [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|Exodus]] of the English Puritans'' ([[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] and [[Puritans#New England Puritans|Puritans]] influenced the [[Northeastern United States]]' corporate and educational culture)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 13–206&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The [[Southern England|South of England]] to [[Virginia]]'''
: ''The [[Cavalier]]s and [[Indentured servant|Indentured Servants]]'' ([[Gentry]] influenced the [[Southern United States]]' plantation culture)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'' pp. 207–418&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[North Midlands]] to the [[Delaware Valley]]'''
:''The Friends' Migration'' ([[Quakers]] influenced the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Middle Atlantic]] and [[Midwestern United States]]' industrial culture)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 419–604&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Northern England|Borderlands]] to the [[Appalachia|Backcountry]]'''
:''The Flight from [[North Britain]]'' ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] and [[Anglo-Scottish border|border]] [[English people|English]] influenced the [[Western United States]]' ranch culture and the [[Southern United States]]' common agrarian culture)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 605–782&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer includes satellite peoples such as [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[French people|French]], [[Germans]], [[Italians]] and a treatise on [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]] in [[South Carolina]]. Fischer covers voting patterns and dialects of speech in four regions that span from their Atlantic colonial base to the Pacific.

Fischer remarks on his own connective feelings between the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and [[Southern England]] in ''Albion's Seed'' but attempts to flesh that out in ''Bound Away: Virginia and the Westward Movement'', a corollary of his work in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Fischer states that the book's purpose is to examine the complex cultural processes at work within the four folkways during the time period. ''Albion's Seed'' argues, "The legacy of four British folkways in early America remains the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society in the United States."

The term "[[mores|folkways]]" was originally conceived of by [[William Graham Sumner]], a 19th-century American sociologist. Sumner's treatise ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals'' posits:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The folkways are habits of the individual and customs of the society which arise from efforts to satisfy needs; they are intertwined with goblinism and demonism and primitive notions of luck (sec. 6), and so they win traditional authority. Then they become regulative for succeeding generations and take on the character of a social force. They arise no one knows whence or how. They grow as if by the play of internal life energy. They can be modified, but only to a limited extent, by the purposeful efforts of men. In time they lose power, decline, and die, or are transformed. While they are in vigor they very largely control individual and social undertakings, and they produce and nourish ideas of world philosophy and life policy. Yet they are not organic or material. They belong to a superorganic system of relations, conventions, and institutional arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, William Graham ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. Project Gutenberg E-Book. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24253/24253-h/24253-h.htm Last accessed: March 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Key characteristics===
Fischer describes his modified application of the folkways concept as "the normative structure of values, customs and meanings that exist in any culture," which rise from social and intellectual origins. More specifically, Fischer's definition of folkways are that they "are often highly persistent, but they are never static. Even where they have acquired the status of a tradition they are not necessarily very old. Folkways are constantly in the process of creation, even in our own time."

Each of the four distinct folkways is comparatively described and defined in the following terms:
* Speech Ways: "Conventional patterns of written and spoken language; pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax and grammar."
* Building Ways: "Prevailing forms of vernacular architecture and high architecture, which tend to be related to one another."
* Family Ways: "The structure and function of the household and family, both in ideal and actuality."
* Marriage Ways: "Ideas of the marriage-bond, and cultural processes of courtship, marriage and divorce."
* Gender Ways: "Customs that regulate social relations between men and women."
* Sex Ways: "Conventional sexual attitudes and acts, and the treatment of sexual deviance."
* Child-Rearing Ways: "Ideas of child nature and customs of child nurture."
* Naming Ways: "Onomastic customs including favoured forenames and the descent of names within the family."
* Age Ways: "Attitudes towards age, experiences of aging and age relationships."
* Death Ways: "Attitudes towards death, mortality rituals, mortuary customs and mourning practices."
* Religious Ways: "Patterns of religious worship, theology, ecclesiology and church architecture."
* Magic Ways: "Normative beliefs and practices concerning the supernatural."
* Learning Ways: "Attitudes toward literacy and learning, and conventional patterns of education."
* Food Ways: "Patterns of diet, nutrition, cooking, eating, feasting and fasting."
* Dress Ways: "Customs of dress, demeanor, and personal adornment."
* Sport Ways: "Attitudes toward recreation and leisure; folk games and forms of organized sport."
* Work Ways: "Work ethics and work experiences; attitudes toward work and the nature of work."
* Time Ways: "Attitudes toward the use of time, customary methods of time keeping, and the conventional rhythms of life."
* Wealth Ways: "Attitudes towards wealth and patterns of its distribution."
* Rank Ways: "The rules by which rank is assigned, the roles which rank entails, and the relations between different ranks."
* Social Ways: "Conventional patterns of migration, settlement, association and affiliation."
* Order Ways: "Ideas of order, ordering institutions, forms of disorder, and treatment of the disorderly."
* Power Ways: "Attitudes toward authority and power; patterns of political participation."
* Freedom Ways: "Prevailing ideas of liberty and restraint, and libertarian customs and institutions."

Additionally he was also the creator of [[Visible Speech]] which was used to help the deaf learn to talk, and was the father of [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref name ="NYT-1905" /&gt;

== Biography ==

Alexander Melville Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], and studied under and became the principal assistant of his father, Alexander Bell (1790–1865),&lt;ref name=Aoverview&gt;[https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/alexander-melville-bell_29208569 Ancestry.com Historical Person Overview: Alexander Melville Bell]. Retrieved May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; an authority on [[phonetics]] and speech disorders. From 1843 to 1865 he lectured on speech [[elocution]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and from 1865 to 1870 at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Bell, Alexander Melville|volume=3|page=684}} This in turn cites John Hitz, ''Alexander Melville Bell'' (Washington, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt; Melville married Eliza Grace Symonds (d. Georgetown, Washington, D.C., 5 January 1897),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; the only daughter of a British [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]].

In 1868, and again in 1870 and 1871, Melville lectured at the [[Lowell Institute]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts after having moved to Canada. In 1870 he became a lecturer on [[philology]] at [[Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario]]; and in 1881 he moved to Washington, D.C. at the suggestion of his son Graham, where he devoted himself to the education of the deaf by the use of Visible Speech in which the alphabetical characters of his linguistic invention were representative graphic diagrams for the various positions and motions of the lips, tongue, mouth, etc., as well as other methods of [[orthoepy]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Prior to departing Scotland for Canada Melville Bell had published at least 17 works on proper speech, vocal physiology, stenography and other works. Besides instructing at Queens College he also lectured in Boston, Montreal, Toronto, London, and other universities including a series of 12 lectures at Boston's [[Lowell Institute]].&lt;ref name ="Whitaker"&gt;Whitaker, A.J. ''[http://www.telephonetribute.com/pdf/bell_memorial_booklet.pdf "Bell Telephone Memorial"]'', City of Brantford/Hurley Printing, Brantford, Ontario, 1944. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall (later King George V and Queen Mary) called on Brantford for a visit, Melville was asked to greet the dignitaries at the public event. He became a Fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland, the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], as well as obtaining memberships in other societies.&lt;ref name ="Whitaker" /&gt;

Alexander Melville Bell was married twice, first to Eliza Grace Symonds in 1844 with whom he had three children, and then to Harriet G. Shibley.&lt;ref name ="Whitaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aoverview /&gt;

== Visible Speech ==

In 1864 Melville published his first works on [[Visible Speech]], to help the deaf both learn and improve upon their aural speech (since the profoundly deaf could themselves not hear their own aural pronunciations).&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.192&lt;/ref&gt; To promote the language, Bell created two written short forms using his system of 29 modifiers and tones, 52 [[consonant]]s, 36 [[vowel]]s and a dozen [[diphthong]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.193&lt;/ref&gt; [[International English|World English]], which was similar to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and also Line Writing, used as a shorthand form for [[stenographer]]s.&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville's works on Visible Speech became highly notable, and were described by [[Édouard Séguin]] as being "...a greater invention than the telephone of his son, [[Alexander Graham Bell]]".&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"/&gt; Melville saw numerous applications for his invention, including its worldwide use as a [[universal language]]. However, although heavily promoted at the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf]] in Milan, Italy in 1880, after a period of a dozen years or so in which it was applied to the education of the deaf, Visible Speech was found to be more cumbersome, and thus a hindrance, to the teaching of speech to the deaf compared to other methods,&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.195–203&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually faded from use.

== Other contributions to the education of the deaf ==

In 1887, his son, Alexander Graham Bell, sold off the intellectual assets owned by the [[Volta Laboratory]] Association. Graham used the considerable profits from the sale of his shares to found the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Bureau]] as an instrument "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990"&gt;Bruce 1990, pp.412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Graham's scientific and statistical research work on deafness became so large that within the period of a few years his documentation engulfed an entire room of the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] in Melville's backyard carriage house. Due to the limited space available at the carriage house, and with the assistance of Melville who contributed US$15,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1887|r=-4}}}} in today's dollars),{{Inflation-fn|US}} Graham had his new Volta Bureau building constructed close by in 1893.

'''Augustin Cochin''' (22 December 1876 – 8 July 1916) was a [[France|French]] historian of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacombe, Bernard (1929). "Augustin Cochin, Historien de la Révolution," ''Le Correspondant'', No. 101, pp. 822–826.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his work was posthumously published in an incomplete state after he was killed in action in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Chassagne, Frédéric (1980). ''La Pensée d'Augustin Cochin''. Mémoire, Université Panthéon-Assas.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career overview==
Born in [[Paris]], Cochin was the son of [[Denys Cochin]], a Parisian deputy in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] with ties to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and the grandson of [[Augustin Cochin (politician)|Augustin Cochin]], a French politician and writer.&lt;ref&gt;Goyau, Georges (1926). "Une Belle Vie d'Historien. Augustin Cochin," ''Revue des Deux Mondes'', No. 522, pp. 621–653.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing helped him to remain detached from the French Revolution and study it historically in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Furet|Furet, François]] (1981). "Augustin Cochin: The Theory of Jacobinism," in ''Interpreting the French Revolution'', Chap. III. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochin studied the Revolution from a [[sociological]] perspective, cultivated from his interest in the work of [[Émile Durkheim]],&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy (2011). "History, Revolution and Terror," in ''Revolution and the Republic'', Chap. VI, Oxford University Press, pp. 295–297.&lt;/ref&gt; and he sought to look at the revolution from a social perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Gillouin, René (1929). "Augustin Cochin et l'Interprétation "Sociale" de la Révolution de 1789," in ''Le Destin de l'Occident''. Paris: Éditions Prométhée.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furet (1981), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Furet]] believed that Cochin's work worked towards an analysis of two objectives: “a sociology of the production and role of democratic ideology, and a sociology of political manipulation and machines.”&lt;ref&gt;Furet (1981), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Cochin's work deals with the revolution itself from a conceptual basis.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, F. Roger (2008). [http://www.toqonline.com/archives/v8n2/TOQv8n2Devlin.pdf "From Salon to Guillotine,"] ''The Occidental Quarterly'', Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 63–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochin was drafted into service in World War I in 1914, and he was wounded four times in service before being killed on 8 July 1916 at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]], [[Somme (department)|Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;Furet (1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

His sometime collaborator, [[Charles Charpentier]], worked with Cochin's family towards posthumous publication of his works.

{{Campaignbox Texas-Indian Wars}}

The '''Battle of North Fork''' or the '''Battle of the North Fork of the Red River''' occurred on September 28, 1872, near [[McClellan Creek]] in [[Gray County, Texas]], [[United States]].  A [[monument]] on that spot marks the site of the battle between the [[Comanche|Comanche Indians]] under Kai-Wotche and Mow-way and a detachment of [[cavalry]] and scouts under U.S. Army Colonel  [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]]. There was an accusation that the battle was really an attempt "to make a massacre," as during the height of battle some noncombatants were wounded while mixed in with warriors.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfn02|title=Battle of the North Fork|accessdate=2007-07-15 |last=Hosmer |first=Brian C. |work=Handbook of Texas Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This battle is primarily remembered as the place where the army for the first time struck at the Comanches in the heart of the [[Llano Estacado]] in the western [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] of [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Comlord"/&gt;

==Prelude to the Red River War==
{{main|Texas-Indian Wars}}

This battle was a precursor to the [[Red River War]] of 1873–4. In early 1872, the new Military Commander of the District of Texas decided it was time to strike at the Comanches in the heart of their homeland on the [[Comancheria]], much as the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] had done 14 years before at the [[Battle of Little Robe Creek]].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; The [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] administration's "Quaker Peace Policy" was still in effect, which placed the appointment of Indian agents in the hands of [[Protestant]] religious organizations ([[Quakers]] were the first to participate, thus the name of the policy), not political patrons. In addition, Indians were to be moved to reservations peacefully or forcefully, and U.S. troops were not to engage in combat against them. Under the policy, federal troops at [[Fort Sill]] could not be deployed against the Comanche. Troops from the Texas District, however, could be.&lt;ref name=Combar&gt;The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier&lt;/cite&gt;. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign in the Staked Plains==
[[File:RSMackenzie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Col. Mackenzie who led the cavalry at the Battle of the North Fork]]
Mackenzie marched out of Fort Concho in early July 1872, to begin his campaign.  He reestablished [[Camp Supply]] on Duck Creek, on the edge of the Llano Estacado where he established his command.  From there, McKenzie dispatched several scouting parties, one of which discovered a well-traveled path with hoof prints of a large herd of cattle stretching west. This find caught Mackenzie's attention, and on July 28, 1872, he marched 272&amp;nbsp;troopers, 12&amp;nbsp;officers, and 20&amp;nbsp;Tonkawa scouts into the heart of the Comancheria.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co., p. 376-377&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 1872, the detachment obtained supplies and rested at Fort Sumner, New Mexico.  They then marched north to Fort Bascom, New Mexico, arriving August 16, 1872.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Ortiz, who accompanied Mackenzie, led the command to the east, skirting [[Palo Duro Canyon]].  Mackenzie split off smaller detachments to search possible locations of the Indian camps but with no success. They returned to Camp Supply on August 31, 1872.  The expedition had marched close to {{convert|700|mi|km|0}} over a five-week period, and discovered two new routes through the Staked Plains.  These routes were reported to be shorter and had better water access than the [[Goodnight–Loving Trail]] that was being used to drive cattle to markets in Kansas.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Mackenzie rested his men until September 21, when he marched his troops north to search the last potential campsite of the Comanche, on the north fork of the Red River. On September 28, a scouting patrol under Lt. Boehm and Captain Wirt Davis,&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co., p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a large Kotsoteka Comanche village. The cavalry moved within a half mile of the village before they were seen by the Indians. From there, they charged the village, capturing it after a half-hour battle. Mackenzie lost three men and three were wounded. The Comanche lost an estimated fifty or more, including Chief Kai-Wotche and his wife, who were both killed.  Mow-way (Shaking Hand) escaped.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

==The Battle of North Fork==

The army had caught the village completely unaware, and captive Clinton Smith in later years would accuse Mackenzie and the army of a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C.L., 1927, ''The Boy Captives'', San Saba: San Saba Printing &amp; Office Supply, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Mackenzie reported officially twenty-three Comanches killed, although there may have been more.  The warriors, who sustained heavy casualties, threw some of their dead into a ten-foot-deep pool to keep them away from the Tonkawas' knives and cooking pots; the Tonkawas were reputedly cannibals.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

As justification for the attack, the army claimed it found overwhelming proof of the band's raids on white settlements in the wreckage of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co., p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;   For instance, a survivor of the wagon train massacred at Howard's Wells the previous spring recognized forty-three of its mules.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Almost 800–3000 horses were rounded up by the troops while the lodges, along with the stores of meat, equipment, and clothing, save for a few choice robes, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co., p. 378-379, 382&lt;/ref&gt;  About 130 Comanches, mostly women and children, were taken prisoner, but six of these were too badly wounded to be moved long distances.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

After dark, Mackenzie's command moved to the hills several miles away from the burned village and camped. Fearing that the captured pony herd would stampede the cavalry horses, Mackenzie had them corralled. That night and the next, however, the Comanches succeeded in recovering most of their horses, plus those of the Tonkawa scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co., p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;   The Comanche prisoners were kept under guard as the command rejoined its supply train and retraced its route back south to the main supply base on Duck Creek, where the Indians were transferred to Fort Concho, where they were kept prisoner through the winter.  MacKenzie used the captives as a bargaining tool to force the off-reservation Indians back to the reservation, and to force them to free white captives.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
MacKenzie's stratagem worked, for shortly after the battle, Mow-way and Parra-o-coom (Bull Bear) moved their bands to the vicinity of the Wichita Agency. The Nokoni chief Horseback, who himself counted family members among the Indian prisoners, took the initiative in persuading the Comanches to trade stolen livestock and white captives, including Clinton Smith, in exchange for their own women and children.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Corporal [[William O'Neill (Medal of Honor)|William O'Neill]], Blacksmith James Pratt, Farrier David Larkin, Privates Edward Branagan and William Rankin, Corporal [[Henry McMasters]], Sergeant [[William Wilson (soldier)|William Wilson]], Sergeant [[William Foster (Medal of Honor)|William Foster]], and First Sergeant [[William McNamara (soldier)|William McNamara]] were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

==The Red River Campaign==
This marked the first time the United States had successfully attacked the Comanches in the heart of the Comancheria, and showed that the Llano Estacado were no longer a safe haven.  Further, this battle emphasized that if the army wished to force the wild Comanches onto reservations, the way to do it was destroy their villages and leave them unable to survive off-reservation.  MacKenzie's tactics were such a success that [[William T. Sherman]] empowered him to use them further during the [[Red River War]] of 1874.  His attack on the village at the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]], and his destruction of the Comanche horse herd at [[Briscoe County|Tule Canyon]], both in 1874, mirrored this battle in strategy and effect.&lt;ref name=Comlord&gt;The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains&lt;/cite&gt;.

'''Catherine Obianuju Acholonu''' (26 October 1951 – 18 March 2014) was a Nigerian writer, researcher and former lecturer on African Cultural and Gender Studies. She served as the former Senior Special Adviser (SSA) to President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] on Arts and Culture, and foundation member of the ''[[Association of Nigerian Authors]]'' (ANA).

== Biography ==
Catherine Acholonu was born in [[Orlu, Nigeria|Orlu]] to the family of Chief Lazarus Olumba. She attended secondary schools in Orlu before becoming the first African woman to gain a master's degree (1977) and a PhD (1987) from the [[Heinrich Heine University of Düsseldorf|University of Düsseldorf]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Hahn, 'Acholonu, Catherine', ''Who's Who in Contemporary Women's Writing'', ed. Jane Eldredge Miller, Routledge, 2001, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She taught at [[Alvan Ikoku College of Education]], [[Owerri]], commencing 1978.

Acholonu was the author of over 16 books, many of which are used in secondary schools and universities in [[Nigeria]], and in African Studies Departments in USA and Europe. Her works and projects enjoyed the collaboration and the support of [[United States Information Service]] (USIS), the [[British Council]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and in 1989 she was invited to tour educational institutions in USA, lecturing on her works under the United States International Visitor's Program. In 1990 Catherine Acholonu was honoured with the [[Fulbright Scholar]] in Residency award by the US government, during which she lectured at four colleges of the Westchester Consortium for International studies, NY, USA.

Part of her work took her into the wider sphere of [[sustainable development]]. In 1986 she was the only Nigerian, and one of two Africans to participate in the United Nations Expert Group Meeting on "Women, Population and Sustainable Development: the Road to Rio, Cairo and Beijing”, which was organised jointly by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), the Division for the Advancement of Women, and the Division for Sustainable Development. This took place in the [[Dominican Republic]], and focused on the mainstreaming of gender into the Plans of Action of the UN world conferences of Rio, Beijing and Cairo.

From 1999 to 2002, she was the Special Adviser on Arts and Culture to the President of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], a post she resigned from to seek election, along with a number of other writers who felt their inclusion in Nigerian politics would for the good. However, she lost the contest for the Orlu senatorial district seat of [[Imo State]], and drew attention to irregularities and rigging.

She was recently appointed African Renaissance Ambassador by the [[African Renaissance Conference]] with headquarters in the [[Benin|Republic of Benin]], and Nigeria's sole representative at the global ''Forum of Arts and Culture for the Implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification'' (UNFAC). Prof Acholonu holds several awards from home and abroad. She was listed in the ''International Who's Who of World Leadership'', USA; the ''African Women Writers' Who's Who''; the ''Top 500 Women in Nigeria''; ''Who's Who in Nigeria''; and the ''International Authors and Writers Who's Who'', published in Cambridge, UK.

Acholonu was the Director of the Catherine Acholonu Research Center, Abuja (CARC), which she co-founded with [[Ambassador (Dr.) Ajay Prabhakar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carcafriculture.org/ajay.htm | title=Co-founder of CARC | accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center, based in [[Abuja]], is pioneering research into Africa's pre-history, stone inscriptions, cave art, and linguistic analyses of ancient symbols and communication mediums from the continent. She argues that Nigerian rock-art inscriptions, known as Ikom Monoliths, prove that "Sub-Saharan African Blacks possessed an organized system of writing before 2000 B.C." and that she and her assistants are able to translate these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carcafriculture.org/catherine.htm Catherine Acholonu Research Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book, ''They Lived Before Adam: Prehistoric Origins of the Igbo The Never-Been-Ruled,'' she says that Igbo oral tradition is consistent with scientific research into the origins of humanity. Speaking at the [[Harlem Book Fair]], Acholonu summarised the content of her argument as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our research includes the origin and meanings of symbols used in every religion and sacred literature all over the world. In these, we found that the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Kabbalah]]s of the Hebrews and the Chinese, the Hindu [[Vedas]] and [[Ramayana]], and the recently discovered Egyptian Christian Bible called the [[Nag Hammadi]] are of immense importance in revealing lost knowledge. Wherever we looked we found evidence confirming the claims by geneticists who have been conducting [[mitochondrial DNA]] research in four leading universities here in the USA that all mankind came from sub-Saharan Africa, that Eve and Adam were black Africans...Igbo oral traditions confirm the findings of geneticists, that by 208000BC – 208000 BC – human evolution was interrupted and Adam, a hybrid, was created through the process of genetic engineering. However, our findings reveal that the creation of Adam was a downward climb on the evolutionary ladder, because he lost his divine essence, he became divided, no longer whole, or wholesome. All over Africa and in ancient Egyptian reports, oral and written traditions maintain that ''[[homo erectus]]'' people were heavenly beings, and possessed mystical powers such as telepathy, levitation, bi-location, that their words could move rocks and mountains and change the course of rivers. Adam lost all that when his right brain was shut down by those who made him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2009/07/18/harlem-book-fair-catherine-acholonu.html "Adam and Eve: African?"], ''The Daily Beast'', 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Acholonu died on 18 March 2014 at the age of 62 from a year-long [[renal failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://allafrica.com/stories/201403190350.html| title =Nigeria: Celebrated Scholar, Acholonu Dies At 63|publisher =allAfrica.com|date=19 March 2014| accessdate =19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">'''Cecilia Cleve''', née '''Dahlin''' (died 8 February 1819), was Swedish pioneer librarian. She can be regarded as the first librarian of her sex in Sweden. 

Cecilia Cleve was the sister of the fashionable furniture maker and designer [[Nils Dahlin]]. She married Freidrich August Cleve from Magdeburg in Germany, who was active as a printer and in 1787 opened what is sometime referred to as the first [[lending library]] in Stockholm. When she became a widow in 1796, Cecilia Cleve renounced the guild printer privilege she was entitled to after her late spouse, but kept his right to keep a public lending library, and managed it until her death. She did this despite having a widow pension which were sufficient to support herself, and her foster children. She introduced the innovation to catalog the books in alphabetic order, which was at the time an innovation, quarterly subscriptions and advertises in the country papers. She managed the library with success and it reportedly contained 8.000 volumes. By 1800, five other lending libraries had bee founded in Stockholm, but she remained the only female librarian until [[Eva Unander]] opened hers at Södermalmstorg in 1816.

'''''Civil Defence Information Bulletin''''' were a series of seven [[public information films]] dealing with [[Civil defense|civil defence]] measures individuals and families could take in the event of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on Great Britain. They were produced for the [[Home Office]] and the [[Scottish Home and Health Department]] by RHR Productions [[United Kingdom]] in 1964. The writer was [[Nicolas Alwyn]] and the producer [[Ronald H. Riley]]. The films are in black and white.

In the event of an international crisis, these films were to be broadcast by all television networks in the U.K., in much the same manner as the ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' films were to be broadcast in the 1980s. It refers to Civil Defence Handbook No. 10, entitled ''Advising the Householder on Protection against Nuclear Attack.''

==The films==
Topics included in the films include:

* The effects of [[nuclear weapon]]s: heat, shock wave, and [[fallout]]
* Measures to mitigate the effects of the initial heat and blast
* Preparing a [[Fallout shelter|fallout room]]
* Supplies to stock and how to arrange them
* Attack warning signals: Red, attack imminent; Grey, fallout expected within the hour; Black, fallout expected immediately; all-clear
* Immediate steps to protect oneself during the initial heat and blast, with actions similar to the U.S. Civil Defence film ''[[Duck and Cover]]''
* Steps to take immediately after a blast but before fallout arrives
* Steps to take after fallout clears
* How to prepare for evacuation

'''''Note''': the grey warning was discontinued after 1968.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44067">'''Critical race theory''' ('''CRT'''){{sfn|Delgado Bernal|2002}} is a theoretical framework in the [[social science]]s that uses [[critical theory]] to examine society and culture as they relate to  [[Race (human categorization)|categorizations of race]], [[law]], and [[power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Yosso|2005}}&lt;ref name="habermas.org"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.habermas.org/critraceth01bk.htm | author=Lewis R. Gordon | title=A Short History of the 'Critical' in Critical Race Theory | journal=American Philosophy Association Newsletter | volume=98 | issue=2 | date=Spring 1999 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301005859/http://www.habermas.org/critraceth01bk.htm | archivedate=March 1, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a theoretical movement within American law schools in the mid- to late 1980s as a reworking of [[critical legal studies]] on race issues{{sfn|Cole|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Race Theory thus represents an attempt to inhabit and expand the space between two very different intellectual and ideological formations…" Civil Rights reform and Critical Legal Studies. "Introduction". In {{harvnb|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is loosely unified by two common themes:  First, CRT proposes that [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacy]] and racial power are maintained over time, and in particular, that the law may play a role in this process.  Second, CRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction". In {{harvnb|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars important to the theory include [[Derrick Bell]],  [[Patricia Williams]], [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]], and [[Mari Matsuda]]. By 2002, over 20 American law schools and at least three law schools in other countries offered critical race theory courses or classes which covered the issue centrally.{{sfn|Harris|2002}} Critical race theory is taught and innovated in the fields of education, [[political science]], [[women's studies]], [[ethnic studies]], communication, and [[American studies]].{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|2012|pp=6–7}}

Critics of CRT, including [[Richard Posner]] and [[Alex Kozinski]], take issue with its foundations in [[postmodernism]] and reliance on moral relativism, social constructionism, and other tenets contrary to [[Classical liberalism|classical liberalism]].

==Definition==
According to the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|UCLA School of Public Affairs]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;CRT recognizes that racism is engrained in the fabric and system of the American society. The individual racist need not exist to note that institutional racism is pervasive in the dominant culture. This is the analytical lens that CRT uses in examining existing power structures. CRT identifies that these power structures are based on white privilege and white supremacy, which perpetuates the marginalization of people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacrs.wordpress.com/what-is-critical-race-theory/ |title=What Is Critical Race Theory? |accessdate=11 March 2012 |publisher=[[UCLA School of Public Affairs]]|date=2009-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legal scholar Roy L. Brooks has defined CRT as "a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view", and says

&lt;blockquote&gt;it focuses on the various ways in which the received tradition in law adversely affects people of color not as individuals but as a group. Thus, CRT attempts to analyze law and legal traditions through the history, contemporary experiences, and racial sensibilities of racial minorities in this country. The question always lurking in the background of CRT is this: What would the legal landscape look like today if people of color were the decision-makers?{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=85}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
Kimberlé Crenshaw, Neil T. Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas argue that two events were vital to the emergence of CRT: the 1981 Alternative Course on race at Harvard Law School, taught with Derrick Bell, and the 1987 Critical Legal Studies Conference on silence and race.{{sfn|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995|pp=xix-xxvii}}

==Key elements==
Critical race theory draws on the priorities and perspectives of both [[critical legal studies]] and conventional civil rights scholarship, while sharply contesting both of these fields. [[Angela P. Harris]] describes CRT as sharing "a commitment to a vision of liberation from racism through right reason" with the civil rights tradition.{{sfn|Harris|1994|pp=741–743}} It [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] some premises and arguments of [[legal theory]] and simultaneously holds that legally constructed rights are incredibly important.{{sfnm |1a1=Crenshaw |1a2=Gotanda |1a3=Peller |1a4=Thomas |1y=1995 |1p=xxiv |1ps=: "To the emerging race crits, rights discourse held a social and transformative value in the context of racial subordination that transcended the narrower question of whether reliance on rights alone could bring about any determinate results" |2a1=Harris |2y=1994}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} In Angela P. Harris' view, as described by [[Derrick Bell]], critical race theory is committed to "radical critique of the law (which is normatively deconstructionist) and ... radical emancipation by the law (which is normatively reconstructionist)."{{sfn|Bell|1995|p=899}}

CRT's theoretical elements are provided by a variety of sources.

[[Richard Delgado]] and Jean Stefancic have documented the following major themes as characteristic of work in critical race theory:
* A critique of [[liberalism]]: CRT scholars favor a more aggressive approach to social transformation as opposed to liberalism's more cautious approach, favor a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]-conscious approach to transformation rather than liberalism's embrace of [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]], and favor an approach that relies more on political organizing, in contrast to liberalism's reliance on rights-based remedies.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}}
* [[Storytelling]]/counterstorytelling and "naming one's own reality"—using narrative to illuminate and explore experiences of racial oppression.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}} Bryan Brayboy has emphasized the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] importance of storytelling in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] communities as superseding that of theory, and has proposed a Tribal Critical Race Theory (TribCrit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brayboy|first=Bryan McKinley Jones|date=2005-12|title=Toward a Tribal Critical Race Theory in Education|journal=The Urban Review|language=en|volume=37|issue=5|pages=425–446|doi=10.1007/s11256-005-0018-y|issn=0042-0972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] interpretations of American [[civil rights]] [[law]] and progress—criticizing civil rights scholarship and anti-discrimination law.  An example is ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Derrick Bell, one of CRT's founders, argued that civil rights advances for blacks coincided with the self-interest of white elitists.  Mary Dudziak performed extensive archival research in the US Department of State and US Department of Justice, as well as the correspondence by US ambassadors abroad.

Cheryl I. Harris and [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]]  add the theoretical element of whiteness as property.  They describe whiteness as the ultimate property which whites alone can possess.  It is valuable and is property. The 'property functions of whiteness'—rights to disposition, rights to use and enjoyment, reputation and status property, and the absolute right to exclude—make the American dream a more likely and attainable reality for whites as citizens. For a CRT critic, the white skin color that some Americans possess is like owning a piece of property.  It grants privileges to the owner that a renter (or a person of color) would not be afforded.{{sfnm |1a1=Harris |1y=1993 |2a1=Ladson-Billings |2y=1999 |2p=15}}

Karen Pyke documents the theoretical element of [[internalized racism]] or internalized racial [[oppression]]. The victims of racism begin to believe the ideology that they are inferior and white people and white culture are superior.  The internalizing of racism is not due to any weakness, ignorance, inferiority, psychological defect, gullibility, or other shortcomings of the oppressed. Instead, it is how authority and [[power (social and political)|power]] in all aspects of society contributes to feelings of inequality.{{sfn|Pyke|2010|p=552}}

Camara Phyllis Jones defines [[institutionalized racism]] as the structures, policies, practices, and norms resulting in differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race. Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized and often manifests as inherited disadvantage. It is structural, having been absorbed into our institutions of custom, practice and law, so there need not be an identifiable offender. Indeed, institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need.  Institutionalized racism manifests itself both in material conditions and in access to power. With regard to material conditions, examples include differential access to quality education, sound housing, gainful employment, appropriate medical facilities and a clean environment.{{sfn|Jones|2002|pp=9–10}}

As a movement that draws heavily from [[critical theory]], critical race theory shares many intellectual commitments with critical legal studies, critical theory, [[feminist legal theory|feminist jurisprudence]] and [[postcolonial theory]]. Though some authors like Tommy J. Curry have pointed out that such epistemic convergences with critical legal studies, critical theory, etc. are emphasized because of the idealist turn in critical race theory which is interested in discourse (how we speak about race) and the theories of white Continental philosophers, over and against the structural and institutional accounts of [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacy]] which were at the heart of the realist analysis of racism introduced in Derrick Bell's early works{{sfn|Curry|2012}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} articulated through Black thinkers like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], Paul Robeson, and Judge Robert L. Carter.{{sfn|Curry|2009}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}
Will Oremus wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''that CRT was radical "in the sense that it questions fundamental assumptions.... And unlike some strands of academic and legal thought, critical race theory has an open and activist agenda, with an emphasis on storytelling and personal experience. It's about righting wrongs, not just questing after knowledge" and that CRT is not "radical today in the sense of being outside the mainstream: Critical race theory is widely taught and studied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/derrick_bell_controversy_what_s_critical_race_theory_and_is_it_radical_.html|title=Did Obama Hug a Radical?|first=Will |last=Oremus |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 9, 2012 |access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent developments in critical race theory include work relying on updated [[social psychology]] research on unconscious bias to justify [[affirmative action]] and work relying on law and economics methodology to examine [[structural inequality]] and [[employment discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]].{{sfnm |1a1=Carbado |1a2=Gulati |1y=2003 |2a1=Kang |2a2=Banaji |2y=2006}}

== Latino critical race theory ==
The framework of Latino critical race theory (LatCRT) suggests that the social construction of race is central to how people of color are constrained in society.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} [[Tara J. Yosso]] discusses constraint of people of color can be defined in ''Critical Race Counterstories along the Chicana/Chicano Educational Pipeline''.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}} These tenets are what make LatCrt different because it looks at the differences between Chicano/a students. These tenets are: The ''inter''centricity of race and racism; the challenge of dominant Ideology; the commitment to [[social justice]]; the centrality of experience knowledge; and the interdisciplinary perspective.{{sfn|Yosso|2006|p=7}}

Race scholars developed the LatCRT as a critical response to the "problem of the color line" first explained by W. E. B. Du Bois.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} CRT focused on the Black–White paradigm, but LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos. These groups include Latinos/as, Asians, LGBTQ,{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.

LatCRTs main focus is to advocate for social justice for people who live in [[social exclusion|marginalized communities]],{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} specifically Chicana/Chicano individuals. These marginalized communities are guided by structural arrangements that disadvantage people of color. Social institutions function as dispossessions, disenfranchisement, and discrimination over minority groups, but the LatCRT seeks to give voice to those who are victimized.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} In order to give voice to those that are disenfranchised, LatCRT has created two common themes.

First, CRT proposes that white supremacy and racial power are maintained over time and that the law plays a central role in this process. Different racial groups lack the voice to speak in this civil society.  For this reason, the CRT has introduced a new critical form of expressions, called the "voice of color".{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} The "voice of color" is narratives and storytelling monologues used as devices for conveying personal racial experiences. The "voices of color" are also used to counter [[metanarrative]]s that continue to maintain [[racial inequality]]. Thus, the experiences of the oppressed are important aspects for developing a LatCRT analytical approach. Not since the rise of slavery have we seen an institution that so fundamentally shapes the life opportunities of those who bear the label of criminal.

Second, LatCRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law enforcement and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination.{{sfn|Yosso|2005}} The CRT finds the experiential knowledge of people of color and draws explicitly from these lived experiences as data.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}} The CRT presents research findings through storytelling, chronicles, scenarios, narratives, and parables.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}}

== Applications ==
Scholars in critical race theory have focused with some particularity on the issues of hate crime and hate speech.  In response to the [[US Supreme Court]]'s opinion in the [[hate speech]] case of ''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'' (1992), in which the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance as applied to a teenager who had burned a cross, [[Mari Matsuda]] and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had paid insufficient attention to the history of racist speech and the actual injury produced by such speech.&lt;ref&gt;Mari J. Matsuda &amp; Charles R. Lawrence, Epilogue: Burning Crosses and the R.A.V.Case, in Matsuda ''et al.'', Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech and the First Amendment (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical race theorists have also paid particular attention to the issue of affirmative action.  Many{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2018}} scholars have argued in favor of affirmative action on the argument that so-called merit standards for hiring and educational admissions are not race-neutral for a variety of reasons, and that such standards are part of the rhetoric of neutrality through which whites justify their disproportionate share of resources and social benefits.{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1y=1995 |2a1=Kennedy |2y=1990 |3a1=Williams |3y=1991}}

== Critique ==
Some legal scholars have criticized CRT on a number of grounds, such as CRT scholars' reliance on narrative and storytelling, or CRT's critique of objectivity. Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the United States [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]]  has "label[ed] critical race theorists and postmodernists the 'lunatic core' of 'radical legal egalitarianism.'"&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Posner |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Posner |date=October 13, 1997 |title=The Skin Trade |url=http://www.dariaroithmayr.com/pdfs/Posner-The%20Skin%20Trade-The%20New%20Republic.pdf |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |volume=217 |issue=15 |pages=40–43 |issn=0028-6583 |access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is most arresting about critical race theory is that...it turns its back on the Western tradition of rational inquiry, forswearing analysis for narrative. Rather than marshal logical arguments and empirical data, critical race theorists tell stories — fictional, science-fictional, quasi-fictional, autobiographical, anecdotal—designed to expose the pervasive and debilitating racism of America today. By repudiating reasoned argumentation, the storytellers reinforce stereotypes about the [[Race and intelligence|intellectual capacities of nonwhites]].&lt;ref name=Posner /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] writes that critical race theorists have constructed a philosophy which makes a valid exchange of ideas between the various disciplines unattainable.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The radical multiculturalists' views raise insuperable barriers to mutual understanding. Consider the "[[The Space Traders|Space Traders]]" story. How does one have a meaningful dialogue with Derrick Bell? Because his thesis is utterly untestable, one quickly reaches a dead end after either accepting or rejecting his assertion that white Americans would cheerfully sell all blacks to the aliens. The story is also a poke in the eye of American Jews, particularly those who risked life and limb by actively participating in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Bell clearly implies that this was done out of tawdry self-interest. Perhaps most galling is Bell's insensitivity in making the symbol of Jewish hypocrisy the little girl who perished in the Holocaust—as close to a saint as Jews have. A Jewish professor who invoked the name of Rosa Parks so derisively would be bitterly condemned—and rightly so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kozinski |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Kozinski |date=November 2, 1997 |title=Bending the Law |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/reviews/971102.02kosinst.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry have argued that critical race theory, along with critical feminism and critical legal studies, has [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and anti-Asian implications, has worked to undermine notions of democratic community and has impeded dialogue.{{sfn|Farber|Sherry|1997|pp=9–11}}

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] has written a critical evaluation of CRT.{{sfn|Gates|1996}} Gates emphasizes how campus speech codes and anti-hate speech laws have been applied to anti-white speech, contrary to the intentions of CRT theorists: "During the year in which Michigan's speech code was enforced, more than twenty blacks were charged—by whites—with racist speech. As Trossen notes, not a single instance of white racist speech was punished."

Jeffrey J. Pyle wrote in the ''[[Boston College Law Review]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Critical race theorists attack the very foundations of the [classical] liberal legal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism and neutral principles of constitutional law. These liberal values, they allege, have no enduring basis in principle, but are mere social constructs calculated to legitimate white supremacy. The rule of law, according to critical race theorists, is a false promise of principled government, and they have lost patience with false promises.{{sfn|Pyle|1999|p=788}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Wood considers CRT a "grievance ideology" and an "absurdity". He sees the central tenet of "white racism in the American legal system" to be shown false because of items such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the [[Voting Rights Act]]s and ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/bell-epoque/31897|title=Bell Epoque|first=Peter |last=Wood|date=March 13, 2012|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offshoot fields ==
Within critical race theory, various sub-groupings have emerged to focus on issues that fall outside the black-white paradigm of race relations as well as issues that relate to the intersection of race with issues of gender, sexuality, class and other social structures. See for example, critical race feminism (CRF), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit){{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1998}} Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit),{{sfn|Harpalani|2013}} and American Indian critical race studies (sometimes called TribalCrit). CRT methodology and analytical framework have also been applied to the study of white immigrant groups.{{sfn|Myslinska|2014a|pp=559–560}}

Critical race theory has also begun to spawn research that looks at understandings of race outside the United States.{{sfn|Myslinska|2014b}}&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvnb|Levin|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and impact ==
Critical race theory has stirred controversy since the 1980s over such issues as its deviation from the ideal of [[Color blindness (race)|color blindness]], promotion of the use of narrative in legal studies, advocacy of "legal instrumentalism" as opposed to ideal-driven uses of the law, analysis of the Constitution and existing law as constructed according to and perpetuating racial power, and encouraging legal scholars to be partial on the side of ending racial subordination.&lt;ref name=Ansell&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = SAGE | isbn = 978-1-4129-2694-2 | pages = 344–46 | editors = Richard T.

Conservative opponents of political appointees including [[Lani Guinier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 78| last = Will| first = George| title = Sympathy for Guinier| work = Newsweek| date = June 14, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; have included a general critique of critical race theory in their criticism of these figures' actions on racial issues.

The '''''Crónica Mexicayotl''''' is a chronicle of the history of [[Aztec Empire]] from the early [[Nahua people|Nahua ]] migrations to the colonial period, which was written in the [[Nahuatl]] language around in the 16th century.  Its authorship is debated because the earliest copy is written in the hand of [[Chimalpahin]] (1579-1660) while the manuscripts itself states that the author is [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc]] (before 1542 - ca. 1610).&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, S. (2011). The Truth about the Crónica Mexicayotl. Colonial Latin American Review, 20(2), 233-247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peperstraete/&gt; A description of the manuscript is included in the census of central Mexican prose writings in the ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]]. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, pp. 326-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest extant version of the manuscript was written by Chimalpahin, this manuscript, which is designated MS374, was held at Cambridge University until 2013. In 2014, it was repatriated by the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|Mexican National Institute for Archeology and History]], and is now on display at the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. In the 18th century a copy of the manuscript was made by [[Lorenzo Boturini]] who published it in Tome 4 of his 1746 "Catálogo del museo histórico indiano". In the late 19th century Boturini's manuscript was copied by father José Pichardo and Antonion León y Gama and their manuscript is designated (MS 311) - this tertiary copy is now held at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Peperstraete&gt; Peperstraete, Sylvie, and Gabriel Kenrick Kruell. "Determining the Authorship of the Crónica Mexicayotl: Two Hypotheses." The Americas 71, no. 2 (2014): 315-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, working from photocopies of the tertiary manuscript MS311, Adrian León translated the Crónica Mexicayotl into Spanish and the National Autnonomous University of Mexico published it with the Nahuatl and Spanish text. This version has since been published in several editions, but being based on the tertiary version it contains errors and omissions. In 1997 American ethnohistorians [[Susan Schroeder]] and [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], translated the earliest manuscript MS374 into English and published it as part of their book "Codex Chimalpahin". A Spanish translation of by Rafael Tena was published in 2013, and a German translation of the same by Betrthold Riese was published in 2004.&lt;ref name=Peperstraete/&gt; 

==Authorship==
The problem of the authorship of the Crónica Mexicayotl arose in early studies of the document, since the introduction explicitly names Tezozomoc as the author, although written in Chimalpahin's hand and with additions in which Chimalpahin mentions himself by name. Alexis Aubin considered that Chimalpahin simply copied and annotated the text from an original manuscript by Tezozomoc. Paul Kirchoff argued that there is a stylistic break between the first part of the Cronica and the second part, and argued that the first part was written by Tezozomoc and the second by Chimalpahin. 

Susan Schroeder has argued that the Crónica Mexicayotl was Chimalpahin's original work and that only the introduction was by Tezozomoc - and that it was in fact not an introduction to the Crónica Mexicayotl, but an appendix to the work ''Historia o Crónica Mexicana'' which precedes the Crónica Mexicayotl in the volume of the MS374. Schroeder has been contradicted by Peperstraete and Kruell, who argue that Tezozomocs authorship of the main part of the Mexicayotl is established by the introduction (which they argue can only properly be considered an introduction and not an appendix to another work), and by the fact that most of the chronicle is about Tezozomocs family using sources that would have been only available to him. They also add that Tezozomoc's Spanish language ''Crónica Mexicana'', is essentially a translation of the Mexicayotl - making it all the more likely that both works are of his authorship. They consider that in writing the Mexicayotl, Tezozomoc may have also worked from the so-called [[Crónica X]], a lost document of Mexican history which was also used by other authors for their works. As for Chimalpahin's role they argue that Chimalpahin not only copied the manuscript but also added and intercalated some parts into Tezozomoc's text. Peperstraete and Kruell argue that Tezozomoc's original version of the Crónica Mexicayotl would have been elaborated before 1581, because they believe that fray [[Diego Durán]] consulted this manuscript in preparing his own ''History of the Indies of New Spain''.&lt;ref name=Peperstraete/&gt;

==Overview==
Aspects of digitality include near continuous contact with other people through [[Mobile phone|cell phones]],&lt;ref name="digitalism" /&gt; near instantaneous access to information through the [[World Wide Web]], third wave information storage (where any fragment in a text can be searched and used for categorization, such as through search engine [[Google]]), and communicating through [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[email]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Seb. “Control.” ''MIT Press'', 3 Sept. 2015, [https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/control mitpress.mit.edu/books/control].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the negative aspects of digitality include [[computer virus]]es and [[spam (electronic)|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelly, Gary B., and Misty E. Vermaat. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Discovering_Computers_2010_Living_in_a_D.html?id=YFtwxoFUSt4C ''Discovering Computers 2010: Living in a Digital World''.] 1 ed., Boston, MA, Course Technology Press, 2009.e&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapidly growing technology, children at increasingly younger ages are learning to speak through the cyber world rather than in face-to-face conversation. They are becoming more [[Digital literacy|digitally literate]] and creating a new culture in which they communicate more efficiently online than they do in person.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, David. [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/rcie.2007.2.1.43 “Digital Media Literacies: Rethinking Media Education in the Age of the Internet.” ''Research in Comparative and International Education''], vol. 2, no. 1, 1 Nov. 2007, pp. 43–55., doi:10.2304/rcie.2007.2.1.43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the 1990s, literature of the effects of interactivity with information began to be written and published, particularly focused on the immediacy and ubiquity of [[digital communications]] , and the interactivity and participatory nature of [[digital media]].&lt;ref&gt;Hershman, Lynn. "The Fantasy Beyond Control." ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Illuminating_Video.html?id=JnH5nQEACAAJ Illuminating Video: An Essentail Guide to Video Art]'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; While in the tradition of [[Postmodernism]] in that they presume a decisive role for media in the formation of personality, culture and social order,&lt;ref&gt;Bignell, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0lVabD9fYBIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=postmodern+media+theorists&amp;ots=c1T3NehwtI&amp;sig=clemvY7Gh9H7Ckj0YkwBjkC8kjc#v=onepage&amp;q=postmodern%20media%20theorists&amp;f=false Post Modern Media Culture]''. Akaar Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; they differ fundamentally from the analog critical theory, in that the audience has the ability to do more than create a personal idiolectic text, but instead is able to create new texts which reinforce the behavior of other participants.&lt;ref&gt;Landow, George P. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=exzQDHI8rpQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=critical+theory+of+media&amp;ots=yYtzNnF3DH&amp;sig=juX-E9iieSzXDUvSIYru2cNYWPk#v=onepage&amp;q=critical%20theory%20of%20media&amp;f=false Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization]''. 3rd ed., Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it possible to individuals to express themselves through interactivity of digital media.

Many works have been written outlining the fear of digitality. In the 1990s, the realization of digitality caused many artists to visualize and fear a future where analog would become completely extinct. They viewed digitalization as a deletion of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Swanstrom, Lisa. “External Memory Drives: Deletion and Digitality in ''Agrippa (A Book of The Dead)''.” ''Science Fiction Studies'', vol. 43, no. 1, 2016, p. 14., doi:10.5621/sciefictstud.43.1.0014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the computer was originally created to complete large scale computations, it ultimately progressed into a processing machine that could retrieve and interpret information very quickly. The first personal computer was first introduced by [[Ed Roberts (computer engineer)|Ed Roberts]] in 1975 and this sparked the introduction of other "personal computers".&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Harry. ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Computer_Science_and_Tec.html?id=3Tla6d153uwC Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology]''. CRC Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As technology continued to advance, more and more intelligent computers were coming to light with stronger processing power and wider range of utilities. This new age of technology lead to the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 which revolutionized the modern world. With the introduction of this [[World Wide Web]] people were able to more commonly access a data pool online with a trove of information. This information is now easily accessible from a [[Smartphone]] which can connect people from anywhere at any time.

==In the 21st century==
Digital technology plays an important role in 21st century life. In the United States, nearly two-thirds of people own [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/ | title=U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015 | publisher=Pew Research Center | date=April 1, 2015 | accessdate=April 14, 2016 | author=Aaron Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[social networking service]]s and [[online forum]]s, people are able to communicate with other users, regardless of geographic region or time constraints. The rise of this type of interaction partly explains the significant increase in phone use in younger people, and [[mobile technology]] is mainly used for the purposes of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/08/19/teens-and-mobile-phones-over-the-past-five-years-pew-internet-looks-back/ | title=Teens and Mobile Phones Over the Past Five Years: Pew Internet Looks Back |publisher=Pew Research Center | date=August 19, 2009 | accessdate=April 14, 2016 | author=Amanda Lenhart}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digitalism is also slowly replacing many forms of physical aids, such as print encyclopedias and dictionaries, with people turning to newer technology for various needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://capitalismmagazine.com/2000/12/how-encyclopedia-britannica-was-blown-to-bits/ | contribution=How Encyclopædia Britannica Was Blown To Bits | title=Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy | work=Capitalism Magazine|publisher=Harvard Business Review Press| date=December 5, 2000 | accessdate=April 14, 2016 |author1=Philip Evans |author2=Thomas Wurster |isbn= 978-0875848778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Nicholas Negroponte explains how necessities in the future will be [[Digitizing|digitized]]. For example, a large proportion of [[mass media]] (including newspapers and magazines) are becoming digitized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.simon-kucher.com/sites/default/files/stud_benchmarking_study_digitalization_2014.pdf|title=Just how digital are newspapers and magazines today? A global perspective|author=Annette Ehrhardt|author2=Lisa Jäger|author3=Christoph Röttgen|work=Simon-Kucher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large percentage of financial transactions made in the United States are being made without the physical exchange of money (e.g. [[Online banking|online]]).

Computation is frequently discussed in debates on digitality. Modern theorists are now choosing to focus more on our relation to computers rather than the computers themselves as an important element of digitality.&lt;ref&gt;Boast, Robin. ''[http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780237398 The Machine in the Ghost: Digitality and its Consequences]''. Reaktion Books Ltd, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
[[Social media]] are computer generated tools that allow for people to convey their thoughts, ideas, or interests through digital communities or networks. Social media are online platforms for human interactions with local and global reach designed to circulate information. These platforms support social interactions and give rise to a complex interplay between communication, social practices, and technological infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Miguel del Fresno García|author2=Alan J. Daly|author3=Sagrario Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo|date=3 May 2016|title='Identifying the new Influences in the Internet Era: Social Media and Social Network Analysis|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=fa61e78d-0e40-4803-a44f-aaebdee5bbdf%40sessionmgr103&amp;hid=114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=112344028|journal=Revista Española De Investigaciones Sociologicas 153}} (Login required.)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that everything is connected in real-time, and with these connections, people, information, data and events are instantly and globally spread. This allows for platforms like [[Twitter]] to be a media medium where there is an intersection of media and social interaction.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Social media is different from social networks but is commonly looked at as the same which makes differentiating them harder. Social media is just that, media. Just like television and ads, social media has a great potential for business and marketing opportunities where companies can formulate custom promotions geared for specific audiences.

==Education==
Digitality in the 2000s has had a great impact in the world of education. The [[internet]] creates an abundance easily accessible and globally diverse resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/07/05/reading-the-digital-future/ | title=Reading: The Digital Future | work=The New York Review of Books | date=July 5, 2001 | accessdate=April 14, 2016 | author=Jason Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digitization of textbooks and other written texts reduces the demand for the print versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.project-disco.org/competition/112113-the-changing-textbook-industry/#.VxBFmPkrLrc | title=The Changing Textbook Industry | work=Disruptive Competition Project | date=November 21, 2013 | accessdate=April 14, 2016 | author=Jonathan Band}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast majority of books now come with digital version of the text that allows for easier access from anywhere. This applies for scholarly textbooks, religious texts, books, and other texts that would normally have to be found in physical form. Digitalism has also made it so that children are now presented with electronic knowledge at a very early age, resulting in the increased implementation of electronics in school systems (for example in [[Educational technology|electronic learning]], [[mobile learning]], and [[blended learning]]). Students and academics alike have adopted social media such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], and blogging platforms to expand the horizons for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vimala Balakrishnan|author2=Chin Lay Gan|date=2 May 2016|title=Students' learning styles and their effects on the use of social media technology for learning|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA448061668&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=miam11506&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=8830bbe5ce6a6b1bfab9ae7c6ba6a450|journal=Telematics and Informatics 33.3|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intercultural communication ==
[[Intercultural communication]] is an important part of globalization. In the past intercultural communication was made difficult because of the distance separating different cultures. However, with modern-day technology and digitality, it is becoming increasingly possible to interact and learn about other cultures in an environment where people can openly speak. This interaction allows for people to compare and reflect upon both their own and different cultures.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=0ade5337-54b2-4a91-b5d8-1be42f52260f%2540sessionmgr120&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=126|publisher=eds.b.ebscohost.com|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet creates platforms and forums where people from different backgrounds can develop intercultural communication skills and gain a cross-cultural abundance of knowledge. With the digitality of religious texts and cultural meetings, it is increasingly feasible to be submerged in a culture or religion without the need to travel to the source.
&lt;!--
One school of thought says that digitality in the 2000s is a separate condition from late 20th century [[postmodernity]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Secondary meaning==
A secondary meaning of digitality relates to the risk characteristics of [[exotic option]]s in finance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The digitality of an option is the amount of "digital risk" or discontinuity in the payoff profile of an exotic option as the underlying asset price approaches a given barrier level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9777">[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[Global Studies]] at the University of Hawaii at Manoa argues that globalization has four main dimensions: economic, political, cultural, ecological, with ideological aspects of each category. David Held's book ''[[Global Transformations]]'' is organized around the same dimensions, though the ecological is not listed in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 1999 | author= Held, David| title=Global Transformations: Politics, Economics and Culture | publisher= Polity Press | location=Cambridge|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of categories relates to the four-domain approach of circles of social life, and [[Circles of Sustainability]].

Steger compares the current study of globalization to the [[Blind men and the elephant|ancient Buddhist parable of blind scholars and their first encounter with an elephant]].&lt;ref name=steger&gt;"Since the blind scholars did not know what the elephant looked like, they resolved to obtain a mental picture, and thus the knowledge they desired, by touching the animal. Feeling its trunk, one blind man argued that the elephant was like a lively snake. Another man, rubbing along its enormous leg, likened the animal to a rough column of massive proportions. The third person took hold of its tail and insisted that the elephant resembled a large, flexible brush. The fourth man felt its sharp tusks and declared it to be like a great spear. Each of the blind scholars held firmly to his own idea of what constituted an elephant. Since their scholarly reputation was riding on the veracity of their respective findings, the blind men eventually ended up arguing over the nature of the elephant."{{cite book|last=Steger|first=Manfred|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the blind scholars, some globalization scholars are too focused on compacting globalization into a singular process and clashes over “which aspect of social life constitutes its primary domain” prevail.

=== Political ===
{{main article|Political globalization}}

Political globalization is the intensification and expansion of political interrelations around the globe.&lt;ref name="steger" /&gt; Aspects of political globalization include the modern-[[nation state]] system and its changing place in today’s world, the role of [[global governance]], and the direction of our global political systems.

==== Military ====
{{main article|Military globalization}}
Military globalization, as subdomain of political globalization, is defined as the intensification and stretching of military power across the globe through various means of military power (nuclear military weapons, radiation weapons simply weapons of mass destruction). This form of globalization occurs across offensive and defensive uses of power and survival in international field. Beyond states, global organizations such as the United Nations also extend military means globally through support given by both Global North and South countries.

=== Cultural ===&lt;!--and information etc--&gt;
{{main article|Cultural globalization}}
{{See also|Internet}}
Cultural globalization is the intensification and expansion of cultural flows across the globe.&lt;ref name="steger" /&gt; [[Culture]] is a very broad concept and has many facets, but in the discussion on globalization, Steger means it to refer to “the symbolic construction, articulation, and dissemination of meaning.” Topics under this heading include discussion about the development of a global culture, or lack thereof, the role of the media in shaping our identities and desires, and the globalization of languages.

=== Ecological === 
{{See also|Anthropocene|Global issue}}
Topics of ecological globalization include population growth, access to food, worldwide reduction in biodiversity, the gap between rich and poor as well as between the global North and global South, human-induced climate change, and global environmental degradation.

== Ideologies ==
Globalization operates on a cross-cutting "ideological dimension" filled with a range of norms, claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself. According to Steger, there are three main types of globalisms (ideologies that endow the concept of globalization with particular values and meanings): market globalism, justice globalism, and religious globalisms. Steger defines them as follows:&lt;ref name="steger" /&gt;

* ''Market globalism'' seeks to endow ‘globalization’ with free-market norms and neoliberal meanings.
* ''Justice globalism'' constructs an alternative vision of globalization based on egalitarian ideals of global solidarity and distributive justice.
* ''Religious globalisms'' struggle against both market globalism and justice globalsm as they seek to mobilize a religious values and beliefs that are thought to be under severe attack by the forces of secularism and consumerism.

These ideologies of globalization (or globalisms) then relate to broader imaginaries and ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | year=2013 | author= Manfred B.

'''''Esther before Ahasuerus''''' is a 1546-47 painting by [[Tintoretto]] showing a scene from the [[Book of Esther]].

It is recorded in the inventory of the collection of [[Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] in 1627 as hanging alongside ''[[The Muses (painting)|The Muses]]'' in a passage in the [[Palazzo Ducale, Mantua|Palazzo Ducale]] in [[Mantua]]. It was acquired from the Gonzagas by [[Charles I of Great Britain]]. On his execution it was valued at £120 and sold, before being reacquired by the royal family on the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]. It now hangs in [[Kensington Palace]].

[[File:900-158 Ahnentafel Herzog Ludwig.jpg|thumb|300px|The family tree of [[Louis III, Duke of Württemberg|Ludwig Herzog von]] [[Württemberg]] (ruled 1568–1593)]]
'''Genealogy''' (from {{lang-el|γενεαλογία}} ''{{transl|el|genealogia}}'' from {{lang|el|γενεά}} ''{{transl|el|genea}}'', "generation" and {{lang|el|λόγος}} ''{{transl|el|logos}}'', "knowledge"), also known as '''family history''', is the study of [[Family|families]] and the tracing of their [[Kinship|lineages]] and history. Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate [[kinship]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]] of its members. The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives.

The pursuit of family history and origins tends to be shaped by several motives, including the desire to carve out a place for one's family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility to preserve the past for future generations, and a sense of self-satisfaction in accurate storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bishop, "In the Grand Scheme of Things: An Exploration of the Meaning of Genealogical Research," ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 2008 41(3): 393–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Family tree indian.jpg|thumb|220px|12 generations patrilineage of a Hindu Lingayat male from central [[Karnataka]] worth over 275 years, depicted in descending order]]
Amateur genealogists typically pursue their own ancestry and that of their spouses. Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires—or leads to—knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.

Genealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.

Genealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries. Some schools engage students in such projects as a means to reinforce lessons regarding immigration and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=| url=http://www.byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/| title=Teacher's guide for PBS Ancestors series  | publisher=BYU | date=| accessdate=2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other benefits include family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.

The terms "genealogy" and "family history" are often used synonymously, but some offer a slight difference in definition. The [[Society of Genealogists]], while also using the terms interchangeably, describes genealogy as the "establishment of a Pedigree by extracting evidence, from valid sources, of how one generation is connected to the next" and family history as "a biographical study of a genealogically proven family and of the community and country in which they lived".&lt;ref name="sog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/guide-ten/|title=Genealogy or Family History? What’s the Difference?|publisher=Society of Genealogists|accessdate=10 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "family history" may be more popular in Europe, "genealogy" more popular in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fgs.org/cstm_memberLocList.php |title=FGS member societies|publisher=Federation of Genealogical Societies| accessdate=11 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
In [[collective identity|communitarian]] societies, one's identity is defined as much by one's kin network as by individual achievement, and the question "Who are you?" would be answered by a description of father, mother, and tribe. New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]], for example, learn [[whakapapa]] (genealogies) to discover who they are.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Family history plays a part in the practice of some religious belief systems. For example, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has a doctrine of [[baptism for the dead]], which necessitates that members of that faith engage in family history research.

In societies such as Australia or the United States, there was by the 20th-century growing pride in the pioneers and nation-builders. Establishing descent from these was, and is, important to such groups as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].

Modern family history explores new sources of status, such as celebrating the resilience of families that survived generations of poverty or slavery, or the success of families in integrating across racial or national boundaries. Some family histories even emphasize links to celebrity criminals, such as the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]] in Australia.

The growing interest in family history in the media coupled with easier access to online records has allowed those who are curious to do so to start investigating their ancestry. This curiosity can be particularly strong among those whose family histories were lost or unknown due to, for example, [[adoption]] or separation from family, perhaps as a result of [[Grief|bereavement]].

==History==
[[File:P. 63 genealogy and history from Adam and Eve to Asclobitotus (unfinished).jpg|thumb|A Medieval genealogy traced from [[Adam and Eve]]]]
Historically, in Western societies the focus of genealogy was on the [[kinship and descent]] of rulers and nobles, often arguing or demonstrating the legitimacy of claims to wealth and power. The term often overlapped with [[heraldry]], in which the ancestry of royalty was reflected in their [[coats of arms]]. Modern scholars consider many claimed noble ancestries to be fabrications, such as the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] that traced the ancestry of several English kings to the god [[Woden]].

Some family trees have been maintained for considerable periods.  The family tree of [[Confucius]] has been maintained for over 2,500 years and is listed in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the largest extant family tree. The fifth edition of the [[Confucius Genealogy]] was printed in 2009 by the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]] (CGCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New ''Confucius Genealogy'' out next year |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029.htm |work=[[China Internet Information Center]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Updated Confucius family tree has two million members |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/16/content_7616027.htm |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=February 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
In modern times, genealogy became more widespread, with commoners as well as nobility researching and maintaining their family trees.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills, [http://www.ngsgenealogy.org/galleries/Ref_Researching/NGSQVol91Pg26077GenealogyHistory.pdf "Genealogy in the 'Information Age': History's New Frontier?"] ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' 91 (December 2003): 260–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogy received a boost in the late 1970s with the television broadcast of ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'', [[Alex Haley]]'s account of his family line.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Hudson, "The Effect of 'Roots' and the Bicentennial on Genealogical Interest among Patrons of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History," ''Journal of Mississippi History'' 1991 53(4): 321–336&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Internet]], the number of resources readily accessible to genealogists has vastly increased, resulting in an explosion of interest in the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://genealogy.about.com/library/weekly/aa011502a.htm |title=Grow Your Family Tree in Salt Lake City – Genealogy is the Fastest Growing Hobby in North America |access-date=2008-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515062519/http://genealogy.about.com/library/weekly/aa011502a.htm |archive-date=2008-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, genealogy is one of the most popular topics on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogy.com/press-051600.html Genealogy.com: Recent Maritz Poll Shows Explosion in Popularity of Genealogy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516230036/http://www.genealogy.com/press-051600.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has become not only a major source of data for genealogists, but also of education and communication.

===India===
In India, [[Charan]]s are the [[Bard]]s who traditionally keep the written genealogy records of various [[caste]]s. Some notable places where traditional genealogy records are kept include: [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar|Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar (Uttarakhand)]], [[Varanasi]] and [[Allahabad]] ([[Uttar Pradesh]]), [[Hindu genealogy registers at Kurukshetra, Haryana|Kurukshetra (Haryana)]], [[Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple|Trimbakeshwar]] ([[Maharashtra]]), and [[Chintpurni|Chintpurn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i ([[Himachal Pradesh]]).&lt;ref name=gene1&gt;[http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/travel/10-places-across-the-world-that-help-you-trace-your-ancestors-249825.html 10 Places Across The World That Help You Trace Your Ancestors; India Times, Published on 29-Jan-2016; Accessed on 8-May-2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Genealogical research in the [[United States]] was first systematized in the early 19th century, especially by [[John Farmer (author)|John Farmer]] (1789–1838).&lt;ref name="weil"&gt;François Weil, ''Family Trees: A History of Genealogy in America'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2013), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Farmer's efforts, tracing one's genealogy was seen as an attempt by colonists to secure a measure of social standing within the British Empire, an aim that was counter to the new republic's egalitarian, future-oriented ethos.&lt;ref name="weil"/&gt; As Fourth of July celebrations commemorating the Founding Fathers and the heroes of the Revolutionary War became increasingly popular, however, the pursuit of 'antiquarianism,' which focused on local history, became acceptable as a way to honor the achievements of early Americans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Farmer capitalized on the acceptability of antiquarianism to frame genealogy within the early republic's ideological framework of pride in one's American ancestors. He corresponded with other antiquarians in New England, where antiquarianism and genealogy were well established, and became a coordinator, booster, and contributor to the growing movement. In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people. Though Farmer died in 1839, his efforts led to the creation of the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] (NEHGS), one of New England's oldest and most prominent organizations dedicated to the preservation of public records.&lt;ref&gt;François Weil, "John Farmer and the Making of American Genealogy," ''New England Quarterly'' 2007 80(3): 408–434.&lt;/ref&gt; NEHGS publishes the ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register.''

The [[Genealogical Society of Utah]], founded in 1894, later became the Family History Department of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS). The department's research facility, the [[Family History Library]], which has developed the most extensive genealogical record-gathering program in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/mormon/family_history.htm|title=Family History Library|accessdate=11 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to assist in tracing family lineages for special religious ceremonies which LDS adherents believe will seal family units together for eternity. LDS members believe that this fulfilled a biblical prophecy stating that the prophet [[Elijah]] would return to "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers."&lt;ref&gt;James B. Allen et al. "Hearts Turned To The Fathers," ''BYU Studies'' 1994–1995 34(2): 4–392&lt;/ref&gt; There is a network of LDS Family HIstory Centers all over the country and around the world, where volunteers assist the public with tracing their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Introduction_to_LDS_Family_History_Centers Introduction to LDS Family History Centers] Accessed 18 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigham Young University]] offers bachelor's degree, minor, and concentration programs in Family History, and is the only school in North America to offer this.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.byu.edu/Pages/Programs/FamilyHistory/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society of Genealogists]] is the scholarly honorary society of the U.S. genealogical field. Founded by John Insley Coddington, Arthur Adams, and Meredith B. Colket, Jr., in December 1940, its membership is limited to 50 living fellows. ASG publishes [[The Genealogist]], a scholarly journal of genealogical research semi-annually since 1980. [[Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists]], who bear the post-nominal acronym FASG, have written some of the most notable genealogical materials of the last half-century.&lt;ref name=FASG&gt;{{Cite web

Some of the most notable scholarly American genealogical journals are ''[[The American Genealogist]]'', ''[[National Genealogical Society Quarterly]]'', ''[[The New England Historical and Genealogical Register]]'', ''[[The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record]]'', and ''[[The Genealogist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;5 Genealogical Journals You Should Be Reading [https://www.thoughtco.com/scholarly-genealogical-journals-1421857]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L. Greene, "Scholarly Genealogical Journals in America, ''[[The American Genealogist]]'' 61 (1985-86): 116-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research process==
Genealogical research is a complex process that uses historical records and sometimes genetic analysis to demonstrate kinship. Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].&lt;ref&gt;Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Genealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used. Formerly handwritten, these can now be generated by genealogical software.

===Genetic analysis===
{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}
[[File:D1S80Demo.png|left|thumb|Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals]]
Because a person's [[DNA]] contains information that has been passed down relatively unchanged from early ancestors, [[Genetic fingerprinting|analysis of DNA]] is sometimes used for genealogical research. Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.

A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.

===Collaboration===
Most [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]]. In that format it can be shared with other genealogists, added to databases, or converted into family web sites. [[Social networking service]] (SNS) websites allow genealogists to share data and build their family trees online. Members can upload their family trees and contact other family historians to fill in gaps in their research.  In addition to the (SNS) websites, there are other resources that encourage genealogists to connect and share information such as http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ and http://rsl.rootsweb.ancestry.com/.

===Volunteerism===
[[Volunteerism|Volunteer efforts]] figure prominently in genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2004-04-22 | accessdate=2009-01-14 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E3D8163AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print | title= From Shared Resources, Your Personal History | author=[[Peter Wayner]], | work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from the extremely informal to the highly organized.

On the informal side are the many popular and useful [[Internet forum|message boards]] such as [[Rootschat]] and [[electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] on particular surnames, regions, and other topics. These forums can be used to try to find relatives, request record lookups, obtain research advice, and much more.

Many genealogists participate in loosely organized projects, both online and off. These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service. Volunteers do record lookups or take photos in their home areas for researchers who are unable to travel.

Those looking for a structured volunteer environment can join one of thousands of [[genealogical societies]] worldwide. Most societies have a unique area of focus, such as a particular surname, [[ethnicity]], geographic area, or [[List of hereditary &amp; lineage organizations|descendancy from participants in a given historical event]]. Genealogical societies are almost exclusively staffed by volunteers and may offer a broad range of services, including maintaining libraries for members' use, publishing newsletters, providing research assistance to the public, offering classes or seminars, and organizing record preservation or transcription projects.

[[File:GRAMPS 3.3.1 edit person screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gramps]] is an example of genealogy software.]]
{{Main|Genealogy software}}
[[Genealogy software]] is used to collect, store, sort, and display genealogical data. At a minimum, genealogy software accommodates basic information about individuals, including births, marriages, and deaths. Many programs allow for additional biographical information, including occupation, residence, and notes, and most also offer a method for keeping track of the sources for each piece of evidence.

Most programs can generate basic kinship charts and reports, allow for the import of digital photographs and the export of data in the [[GEDCOM]] format (short for GEnealogical Data COMmunication) so that data can be shared with those using other genealogy software. More advanced features include the ability to restrict the information that is shared, usually by removing information about living people out of [[privacy]] concerns; the import of sound files; the generation of family history books, web pages and other publications; the ability to handle [[same sex marriage]]s and [[Illegitimacy|children born out of wedlock]]; searching the Internet for data; and the provision of research guidance.

Programs may be geared toward a specific religion, with fields relevant to that religion, or to specific nationalities or ethnic groups, with source types relevant for those groups.

==Records and documentation==
[[File:Family-bible-births.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A family history page from an [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era|antebellum era]] family Bible]]

Genealogists use a wide variety of records in their research. To effectively conduct genealogical research, it is important to understand how the records were created, what information is included in them, and how and where to access them.

To keep track of their citizens, governments began keeping [[public records|records]] of persons who were neither [[royal family|royalty]] nor [[nobility]]. In England and Germany, for example, such record keeping started with parish registers in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thea Miller, "The German registry: The evolution of a recordkeeping model," Archival Science Volume 3, Number 1 / March, 2003 pp 43–62; Michael Drake, "An Elementary Exercise in Parish Register Demography," ''Economic History Review'' Vol. 14, No. 3 (1962), pp. 427–445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2591886 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; As more of the population was recorded, there were sufficient records to follow a family. Major life events, such as births, marriages, and deaths, were often documented with a license, permit, or report. Genealogists locate these records in local, regional or national offices or [[archive]]s and extract information about family relationships and recreate [[Chronology|timelines]] of persons' lives.

In [[China]], [[India]] and other Asian countries, [[genealogy book]]s are used to record the names, occupations, and other information about family members, with some books dating back hundreds or even thousands of years. In the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]], there is a written tradition of genealogical records among Maithil Brahmins and Karna Kayasthas called "[[Panjis]]", dating to the 12th century CE. Even today these records are consulted prior to marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Verma | first=Binod Bihari | authorlink=Binod Bihari Verma | title=[[Maithili Karna Kayasthak Panjik Sarvekshan]] (A Survey of the Panji of the Karan Kayasthas of Mithila) | location=Madhepura | publisher=Krānti Bihārī Varmā | year=1973 | oclc=20044508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Carolyn Brown Heinz, | title=Fieldnotes: First lesson of the Genealogist | url=http://www.csuchico.edu/anth/mithila/genealogist2.htm | publisher=Department of Anthropology, California State University, Chico | date= | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329053241/http://www.csuchico.edu/anth/mithila/genealogist2.htm | archive-date=2008-03-29 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Pranava K Chaudhary | title=Family records of Maithil Brahmins lost | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1848092.cms | work=India Times | date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], genealogical records were recorded by professional families of ''senchaidh'' (historians) until as late as the mid-17th century. Perhaps the most outstanding example of this genre is [[Leabhar na nGenealach]]/[[The Great Book of Irish Genealogies]], by [[Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh]] (d. 1671), published in 2004.

===FamilySearch collections===
[[File:LDS genealogy library slc utah.jpg|thumb|right|The Family History Library, operated by the LDS Church, is the world's largest library dedicated to genealogical research.]]
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has engaged in large-scale microfilming of records of genealogical value. Its Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah, houses over 2 million microfiche and microfilms of genealogically relevant material, which are also available for on-site research at over 4500 [[Family History Center]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Harman Akenson, ''Some Family: The Mormons and How Humanity Keeps Track of Itself'' Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2007; Johni Cerny and Wendy Elliott, ''The Library: A Guide to the LDS Family History Library.''

=== Indexing ancestral Information ===
Indexing is the process of transcribing parish records, city vital records, and other reports, to a digital database for searching.  Volunteers and professionals participate in the indexing process.  Since 2006, the microfilm in the FamilySearch granite mountain vault is in the process of being digitally scanned, available online, and eventually indexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700028045/Mormon-churchs-storied-Granite-Mountain-vault-opened-for-virtual-tour.html?pg=all|title=Mormon church’s storied Granite Mountain vault opened for virtual tour |publisher=Deseret News |date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/granite-mountain-records-vault |title=Granite Mountain Records Vault |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after the 72-year legal limit for releasing personal information for the [[United States Census]] was reached in 2012, genealogical groups cooperated to index the 132 million residents registered in the [[1940 United States Census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/United_States_Census_1940  |title=United States Census 1940 |publisher=FamilySearch |date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2012, the FamilySearch indexing effort produced more than 1 billion searchable records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MormonNewsroom.org/article/family-history-volunteers-reach-billion-record-milestone |title=Family History Volunteers Reach Billion-Record Milestone |publisher=The Church of JESUS CHRIST of LATTER-DAY SAINTS |date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of information==
Genealogists who seek to reconstruct the lives of each ancestor consider all historical information to be "genealogical" information. Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006; David Hey, ''Family History and Local History in England.'' London: Longman, 1987; Sherry Irvine, ''Scottish Ancestry: Research Methods for Family Historians'', 2nd ed. Provo, UT: Ancestry, 2003; David Moody, ''Scottish Family History''. Baltimore: Genealogical Pub. Co., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; with growing resources for other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Trafford R. Cole, ''Italian Genealogical Records: How to Use Italian Civil, Ecclesiastical &amp; Other Records in Family History Research'' Salt Lake City, Utah: Ancestry, 1995; Cruise, M. T. W., ''Guidelines For Ancestry Research With an Emphasis on African-American Genealogy'' Dublin, VA: Author, 2007; Jessie Carney Smith, ''Ethnic Genealogy: A Research Guide'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family names===
[[File:Lineage scroll of Mary Fane.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lineage of a family, c1809]]
Family names are simultaneously one of the most important pieces of genealogical information, and a source of significant confusion for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. A. Guth, "Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage," ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10–19, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze, | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used. In order to protect the patronymics system, in Iceland it is forbidden by law to introduce a new surname.{{cite web | title=Lög um Mannanöfn | url=http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | language=Icelandic | accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark and Norway patronymics and farm names were generally in use through the 19th century and beyond, though surnames began to come into fashion toward the end of the 19th century in some parts of the country. Not until 1856 in Denmark&lt;ref&gt;An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1923 in Norway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; were there laws requiring surnames.

The transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580–1837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., "Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?," ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221–227&lt;/ref&gt; Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Picard, "Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names," ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Surname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.

===Given names===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Genealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.

Middle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.

Historically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.

An example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
{|width=50% |gap=4em
| '''Child'''
| '''Namesake'''
|-
| 1st son
| paternal grandfather
|-
| 2nd son
| maternal grandfather
|-
| 3rd son
| father
|-
| 4th son
| father's oldest brother
|-
| 1st daughter
| maternal grandmother
|-
| 2nd daughter
| paternal grandmother
|-
| 3rd daughter
| mother
|-
| 4th daughter
| mother's oldest sister
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Another example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.

Personal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., "William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John".

Many names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).

===Place names===
While the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.

Available sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.

Maps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.

===Dates===
It is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.&lt;ref name="knights"&gt;Peter R. Knights, "The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860," ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79–83; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, "Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census," ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563–573.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.

People sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under "full age" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.

Although baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.

Calendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.

For further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].

The [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need "translating" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupations===
Occupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.

It is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf "Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries"], ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description "ironer of rabbit burrows" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, "shoemaker" and "cordwainer" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.

Occupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.&lt;ref&gt;For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability of sources==
Information found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.

The quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.&lt;ref name="knights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Steckel, "The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda," ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of the informant===
The informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.

When the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.

When a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.

===Motivation of the informant===
Even individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.

===The effect of time===
The passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event is usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.

===Copying and compiling errors===
Genealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.

In addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.

===Primary and secondary sources===
In genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.

==Major Classes==
The ''Book of the Major Classes'' (Arabic: ''Kitab Tabaqat Al-Kubra'') is a compendium of biographical information about famous [[Islam]]ic personalities. This eight-volume work contains the lives of [[Muhammad]], his [[Sahaba|Companions]] and [[Ansar (Islam)|Helpers]], including those who fought at the [[Battle of Badr]] as a special class, and of the following generation, [[Tabi‘un|the Followers]], who received their traditions from the Companions. Ibn Sa'd's authorship of this work is attested in a postscript to the book added by a later writer. In this notice he is described as a "client of al-Husayn ibn ‘Abdullah of the [[Abbasid|‘Abbasid]] family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnalhyderabadee.blogspot.com/2006/04/muhammad-ibn-saad.html |title=Muhammad Ibn Sa'ad Ibn al-Hyder Abadee Blogspot |publisher=Ibnalhyderabadee.blogspot.com |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ihor Ševčenko''' (1922–2009) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[philologist]] and [[historian]] of Ukrainian origin. He died 26 December 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huri.harvard.edu/news3.html The Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute announces the death of its co-founder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627095159/http://www.huri.harvard.edu/news3.html |date=2010-06-27 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.

==Biography==
Ševčenko was born in [[Radość, Warsaw|Radość]] near [[Warsaw]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] parents and was educated at the [[Adam Mickiewicz]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and Lycaeum in [[Warsaw]], the [[Charles University in Prague|Deutsche Karlsuniversität]] in Prague, the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Université Catholique de Louvain]], and the Foundation Byzantine of Professor [[Henri Grégoire]] (as member of the Seminar) in Brussels. His work reflects the influence of the numerous scholarly traditions he encountered via this education, and the multiple source languages from which he was able to draw: he learned [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] at the Gymnasium in Warsaw, encountered [[German language|German]], [[Czech (people)|Czech]] and [[francophone]] approaches to scholarship in Prague and Brussels, and is a fluent native speaker of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. Ševčenko later moved to the [[United States]], where he taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Harvard University]], where he was [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Professor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine History]] and [[Literature]] [[emeritus]] until his death. He was also a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Collegium Artium]] in [[Kraków]]. During his early years in the United States, Ševčenko became acquainted with [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], an eminent [[medievalist]] who worked on political and intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schreiner, “Das Janusportrait eines Gelehrten: Ihor Sevcenko als Byzantinist und Slavist” ''Palaeoslavica'' 10: 1 (2002), v-ix. ISSN 1070-5465&lt;/ref&gt;  Ševčenko was married to Margaret (née Bentley) Ševčenko and to Nancy (née [[Patterson (surname)|Patterson]]) Ševčenko; both marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huri.harvard.edu/na/sevcenko1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628153311/http://www.huri.harvard.edu/na/sevcenko1.html |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }} Ihor Sevcenko biography ([[Harvard]] Ukrainian Studies Program)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Ševčenko has contributed to two connected yet distinct disciplines, [[Byzantine studies|Byzantine]], [[Slavistics|Slavic studies]], and Ukrainian Studies. His work addresses Byzantine written culture and society from the [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] period to the 15th century, and explores contact between the Slavic world and Byzantium from the medieval to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]]. Ševčenko  has written on philology, literature, [[epigraphy]], [[paleography]] and [[codicology]]. He was noted for the engaging, "detective novel" style of his prose,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} as in his famous article “The Date and Author of the So-Called Fragments of Toparcha Gothicus”,&lt;ref&gt;''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 25 (1971), 117-188.&lt;/ref&gt; which reveals that the text considered the earliest surviving narrative source on the history of the [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus’]] is a 19th-century forgery crafted by its “discoverer” and editor [[Carl Benedict Hase]].

Ševčenko’s approach was noted for its extensive engagement with [[primary source]] material, not simply as edited texts but as original manuscripts. He uses these sources to elucidate key issues in [[Byzantine]] and [[Slavic studies]], such as the evangelizing mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]] among the [[Slavs]], Byzantine political ideology and its reception in the Slavic world, and the [[Zealot]] uprising in 14th century [[Thessaloniki]]. His most recent publication was an edition and English translation of the only extant secular biography in [[Byzantine literature]], that of the life of the 9th century emperor [[Basil I]], which was written by scholars associated with Basil’s grandson, [[Constantine VII|Emperor Constantine VII]]. Basil’s biography is a major source for the political and cultural history of [[Byzantium]] and its neighbors in the 9th and 10th centuries.

==''Animal Farm''==
While working with displaced Ukrainian persons after World War ii, Ševčenko wrote to [[George Orwell]] and received permission to translate ''[[Animal Farm]]'' into Ukrainian, one of the first translations of the book.  Orwell agreed, waiving his royalties and also writing a detailed preface for the edition.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/world/europe/05sevcenko.html "Ihor Sevcenko, Byzantine and Slavic Scholar, Dies at 87"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ševčenko's law==
Ševčenko's law, or Ševčenko's law of the dog and the forest is the tendency of historians to repeat the coverage and the work of previous historians, to the disadvantage of general historical coverage.  The situation is compared to a [[dog]] and a [[forest]]. A dog going into a virgin forest picks a tree at random, and [[raised-leg urination|urinates against it]]. Despite the tree having no intrinsic outstanding attraction as an object for urinating against, other dogs subsequently entering the same forest will show a tendency to urinate against the same tree.&lt;ref&gt;Xi Yu, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/1/7/evenko-flier-elisabeth-according/ "Eminent Byzantinist Dies, Leaves Legacy of Open-Minded Scholarship"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivan Venedikov was born in [[Sofia]] on 10 January 1916. Between 1934 and 1939 he studied classical phylology in the [[Sofia University]]. Among his lectors were [[Aleksandar Balabanov]], [[Dimitar Dechev]], [[Gavril Katsarov]], [[Veselin Beshevliev]], [[Bogdan Filov]], [[Petar Mutafchiev]]. His first work was ''Phonetics of the Latin Inscriptions from the Bulgarian Lands'', published in 1942. Between 1941 and 1944 he worked in the Museum in [[Skopje]] and made his first excavations discovering the large antique and medieval town Bargala and the medieval Kozyak. Venedikov worked in the Department of Antiquity in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Bulgaria)|National Archaeological Museum]] between 1945 and 1973 and later worked in the Department of Antique Archaeology in the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]]. In 1981 he became a Professor. He was also a lecturer on Thracian history in the Sofia University.

Venedikov had more than 150 publications on [[Thracian]] history, culture, art and language based on many studied archaeological sites and monuments. He made a periodization of the Thracian art; researched and restored the outlook of the Thracian chariots. In 1972, he organized an exhibition of Thracian art which included the finest objects from all over Bulgaria which travelled in many cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Venedikov |first=Ivan |title=Thracian Treasures from Bulgaria |editor= Higgins, R.

Venedikov also proved that [[Preslav]], which would become capital of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in 893, already existed as a significant settlement in the beginning of the 9th century. In 1979 he made monography on the military and administrative organization of the Bulgarian Empire and made research on many titles and offices of the Bulgarian rulers and nobility.

'''Johann Conrad Fischer''' (14 September 1773 - 26 December 1854) was a Swiss [[metallurgist]], inventor, and pioneer in the [[steel industry]]. As an entrepreneur he also held public offices. He was the first president of the City Council of [[Schaffhausen]]. He was the founder of [[Georg Fischer AG]].

==Biography==
Johann Conrad Fischer was born on 14 September 1773 as son of the entrepreneur Johann Conrad Fischer in Schaffhausen.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Knoepfli. ''Vier Generationen Fischer Schaffhausen: Mit Eisen- und Stahlguss zum Erfolg''. Naefels: Verein fuer wirtschaftshistorische Studien, 2001. {{ISBN|3-909059-24-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the ''Gymnasium'' in Schaffhausen, he learned the trades of coppersmith and [[fire pump]] maker in his father's company. Between 1792 and 1794 he travelled through Germany, Scandinavia and England. After his return to [[Switzerland]] in 1794 he took over the management of the family business in 1797. In 1802 he purchased several former mills in [[Muehlental (SH)]] section of the [[Merishausertal]] on the northern outskirts of Schaffhausen and set up a small [[foundry]] for the production of cast iron bells and fire pump engines. In 1806, as the first on continental Europe, he began to cast steel. Once the [[Continental Blockade]] was lifted in 1814, Fischer undertook a study trip to England and subsequently published his experiences in a travel journal. In particular he was critical of the economic upheavals he observed in the Midlands, the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He continued to travel through England, Austria, Germany and France. In France he was invited by the Ministry of the Interior to set up a business there. He began to experiment with the addition of alloys to cast steel. In 1807 he cast steel with [[manganese]], in 1814 he mixed so-called yellow steel with cooper, in 1819 with silver, and in 1823 with chromium. In 1827 he successfully created a cast iron which could be employed as [[malleable iron]] and obtained a patent in Austria for this invention. His last alloyed cast iron consisted to one-third part of copper, which he named ''Fischer-Metall''. This would be useful much later for railroad axials.

==Family==
In 1797 Johann Conrad Fischer married Catharina von Waldkirch and they had three sons who carried on their father's work:
*[[Georg Fischer (1804-1888)]]
*[[Berthold Fischer (1807-1879)]]
*[[Wilhelm Fischer (1803-1882)]]
Johann Conrad Fischer died in Schaffhausen at the age of 81. His grandson [[Georg Fischer II (1834-1887)]] and great-grandson [[George Fischer III (1864-1925)]] continued to expand the family business until the beginning of the 20th century.

==Fischer as Entrepreneur and Civic Leader==
Fischer was more active as an inventor than as manufacturer and businessman. In 1819 he supported the establishment of a steel factory near [[Montbeliard]] in eastern France. He held license agreements with manufacturing companies in London and Luettich. Due to its favorable legal conditions, he patented nearly all his inventions in Austria. Furthermore he set up three steel foundries in Austria which were managed by his sons: 1827 in Hainfeld, 1833 in Traisen and 1839 in Salzburg.

Johann Conrad Fischer held several public offices in Schaffhausen beginning in 1797. His opinion was often sought by newspapers and journalists in matters related to railroads, coinage, import and export taxation, as well as constitutional matters. He maintained regular correspondence with many friends not only in Switzerland, but also in numerous other European countries. Fischer is regarded as one of the leading public figures of Schaffhausen in the 19th century.

==Biography==
Born in Adelaide, Hirst attended [[Unley High School]] and undertook his undergraduate and postgraduate study at the [[University of Adelaide]]. Abandoning an early desire to become a Methodist minister, in 1968 he was appointed a  lecturer at Melbourne's new [[La Trobe University]], where he remained until the end of his career. His wife and fellow-student Christine accompanied him to Melbourne. They had two children, Catherine and David.&lt;ref name=StuartMacintyre&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuart Macintyre, Graeme Davison|title=Shunning awards, historian set his own true course|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/shunning-awards-historian-set-his-own-true-course-20160310-gnfd9b.html|accessdate=11 Apr 2016|work=SMH|date=16 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirst was subsequently head of department and Reader in History at La Trobe.

Hirst died on 3 February 2016 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=DeathNotice /&gt;

==Academic contribution==
Hirst had a distinguished career "in teaching, supervision and research. He developed new subjects and methodologies to teach them."&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frost|first1=Alan|title=Challenging the Orthodoxies: a distinctive figure in our intellectual life|journal=Australian Book Review|date=September 2010|issue= 324|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a large number of important articles, chapters and books on Australian history. His academic interests were wide-ranging, including social, cultural and political history. Hirst's goal was to elucidate the qualities and characteristics of Australian society and how they had developed. Jeremy Sammut has described him as "an elegant and outstanding stylist, as adept at clarifying complex issues by reducing them to their essentials as he was at crafting the pithy line that eliminated all doubt his interpretation was true and correct".&lt;ref name=Sammut1 &gt;{{cite news|last1=Sammut|first1=Jeremy|title=John Hirst: culture warrior shaped future through the past|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/john-hirst-culture-warrior-shaped-future-through-the-past/news-story/1fbf15bdb645edd400dc3b4c63df3dd6|access-date=10 Feb 2016|work=Australian|date=9 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his historical work, Hirst's colleague at La Trobe University, Alan Frost, has noted that Hirst "challenged orthodoxies and produced many new insights".&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt;

Hirst wrote two seminal books on colonial [[New South Wales]] which Frank Bongiorno has described as displaying "a raw intellectual power":&lt;ref name=Bongiorno1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bongiorno|first1=Frank|title=John Hirst (1942–2016) Remembering a historian of fierce independence and unusual originality|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/frank-bongiorno/2016/18/2016/1455753931/john-hirst-1942-2016|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=The Monthly|publisher=Black Inc.|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Convict Society and its Enemies'' (1983) and ''The Strange Birth of Colonial Democracy'' (1988) (both reprinted as ''Freedom on the Fatal Shore'' in 2008). ''Convict Society and its Enemies'' was particularly influential, arguing that rather than being a brutal slave society, early New South Wales was a place where rights and freedoms were well-established from the beginning. Hirst's study of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], ''The Sentimental Nation'', was also a ground-breaking work, arguing that national sentiment was more important than economics in uniting the nation. Alan Frost has described Hirst's shorter analyses as notable: "Distance in Australia: Was It a Tyrant?" (1975), his response to [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s most famous concept, "deserves much more attention than it now receives";&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; his "Egalitarianism" (1986) challenges "received wisdom about colonial life".&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; Many of his best shorter pieces were collected in ''Sense and Nonsense in Australian History'' (2009). A major achievement of Hirst's was a project to index the Melbourne ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|Argus]]'' newspaper (1860–1909).&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; In addition to those concerning Australian history there was his pioneering subject designed to inform students about Australia's European cultural heritage."  This work was published as ''The Shortest History of Europe'' and has been translated into nine languages (Swedish, Greek, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Korean).&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;

==Public intellectual==
Historian Frank Bongiorno described Hirst as a "creative historian capable of engaging a wide audience, as well as a public intellectual who delighted, infuriated and provoked".&lt;ref name="Bongiorno1" /&gt; He contributed many influential opinion pieces and commentaries to leading Australian newspapers and journals. Jeremy Sammut has noted that Hirst was motivated by an independent mind and a distaste for unthinking conformity. He "defied simplistic categorisation as a partisan because his politics were idiosyncratic". Hirst described himself as an old-fashioned social democrat.&lt;ref name=Sammut1 /&gt; To read Hirst is not to encounter a reactionary but "to be delighted as he marshals facts, logic and evidence with unarguable skill and precision to establish the heterodox case, while conveying powerful insights into whatever historical experience or process is discussed". A common theme in the obituaries cited is that Hirst was fearlessly honest, whatever the subject. As Sammut has noted, he was inspired by a commitment to "the rigorous pursuit of historical truth that drove him to explore the deeper patterns and meanings of the past, and the contemporary implications, that others had missed or misled us about".&lt;ref name=Sammut1 /&gt;

==Public appointments==
Never an ivory tower academic, Hirst held a number of influential appointments during the course of his career. He was a member of the Prime Minister's [[Republic Advisory Committee]], the chair of the Commonwealth Civics Education Group, a member of the [[Film Australia]] Board, a council member of the [[National Museum of Australia]], and a member of the board of [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]]. He wrote the official history of Australia for new citizens and took a prominent part in the history summit convened by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] in 2006. Hirst advised the Victorian Government on the school history curriculum and was history adviser to the National Curriculum Authority. He was elected to the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] in 1986. A committed [[Republicanism in Australia|republican]], Hirst was the Convenor of the Republican Movement in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Steger1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buckingham" /&gt;

'''Lewis Wallace''' (April 10, 1827{{spaced ndash}}February 15, 1905) was an American lawyer, [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]], [[governor of New Mexico|governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]], politician, diplomat, and author from [[Indiana]]. Among his novels and biographies, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), a bestselling novel that has been called "the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name=Humanities&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amy Lifson|title=Ben-Hur: The Book That Shook the World|journal=Humanities|volume=30|issue=6|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities
|location=Washington D.C.|date=2009|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2009/novemberdecember/feature/ben-hur-the-book-shook-the-world|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's military career included service in the [[Mexican–American War]] and the American Civil War. He was appointed Indiana's [[Adjutant General|adjutant general]] and commanded the [[11th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]. Wallace, who attained the rank of major general, participated in the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], the [[Battle of Shiloh]], and the [[Battle of Monocacy]]. He also served on the military commission for the trials of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln#Conspirators.27 trial|Lincoln assassination conspirators]], and presided over the trial of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant of the [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison camp]].

Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army, before returning to the United States. Wallace was appointed [[governor of New Mexico|governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]] (1878–81) and served as U.S. minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1881–85). Wallace retired to his home in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he continued to write until his death in 1905.

==Early life and education==
Lewis "Lew" Wallace was born on April 10, 1827, in [[Brookville, Indiana|Brookville]], [[Indiana]]. He was the second of four sons born to Esther French Wallace (née Test) and [[David Wallace (governor)|David Wallace]].&lt;ref name=McKee206&gt;McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew's father, a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] in [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; left the military in 1822 and moved to Brookville, where he established a law practice and entered Indiana politics. David served in the Indiana General Assembly and later as the state's [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana|lieutenant governor]], and [[governor of Indiana|governor]], and as a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, p. 82 and 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew Wallace's maternal grandfather was circuit court judge and Congressman [[John Test]].

In 1832 the family moved to [[Covington, Indiana]], where Lew's mother died from tuberculosis on July 14, 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 1; Boomhower, p. 14 and 16; and McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1836, David married nineteen-year-old [[Zerelda G. Wallace|Zerelda Gray Sanders Wallace]], who later became a prominent [[suffragist]] and [[The Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] advocate. In 1837, after David's election as governor of Indiana, the family moved to [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, p. 82 and 85; Boomhower, p. 19; and Stephens, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow3&gt;Morrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington, but he much preferred the outdoors. Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read, but he was a discipline problem at school.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 9 and 15, and Morrow, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, at the age of nine, Lew joined his older brother in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he briefly attended the preparatory school division of  [[Wabash College]], but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, when Wallace was thirteen, his father sent him to a private academy at [[Centerville, Indiana]], where his teacher encouraged Lew's natural affinity for writing. Wallace returned to [[Indianapolis]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Gronert71&gt;Gronert, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 9 and 20–21, and McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842, after his father refused to pay for more schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace found a job copying records at the [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] clerk's office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the Marion Rifles, a local militia unit, and began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 2–3 and 13, and Boomhower, p. 3, 9, and 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace said in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion, but he did believe "in the Christian conception of God".&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1846, at the start of the [[Mexican–American War]], the nineteen-year-old Wallace was studying law at his father's law office, but left that pursuit to establish a recruiting office for the Marion Volunteers in Indianapolis. He was appointed a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], and on June 19, 1846, mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers (also known as Company H, 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 4; oomhower, p. 3, 26–27; and Morrow, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] while serving in the army of [[Zachary Taylor]], but Wallace personally did not participate in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 536–37; Woodworth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was mustered out of the volunteer service on June 15, 1847,&lt;ref name=Eicher551&gt;Eicher, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Indiana, where he intended to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Wallace and William B. Greer operated a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] newspaper, ''The Free Soil Banner,'' in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.imcpl.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/fsb "Free Soil Banner"], digitized by the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1848 Wallace met [[Susan Wallace|Susan Arnold Elston]] at the Crawfordsville home of [[Henry Smith Lane]], Wallace's former commander during the Mexican War.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan was the daughter of Major Isaac Compton Elston, a wealthy Crawfordsville merchant, and Maria Akin Elston, whose family were Quakers from upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan accepted Wallace's marriage proposal in 1849, and they were married in Crawfordsville on May 6, 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallaces had one son, Henry Lane Wallace, who was born on February 17, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early law and military career==
Wallace was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in February 1849, and moved from Indianapolis to [[Covington, Indiana]], where he established a law practice. In 1851 Wallace was elected prosecuting attorney of [[Indiana's 1st congressional district]],&lt;ref name=Gronert71/&gt; but he resigned in 1853 and moved his family to [[Crawfordsville, Indiana|Crawfordsville]], in [[Montgomery County, Indiana]]. Wallace continued to practice law and was elected as a Democrat to a two-year term in the [[Indiana Senate]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 9, 11, and 13, and Boomhower, p. 41 and 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes388&gt;Forbes, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow9&gt;Morrow, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1849 to 1853, his office was housed in the [[Fountain County Clerk's Building]].&lt;ref name="SHAARD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html|title=Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) |publisher=Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology |format=Searchable database|accessdate=2015-10-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/23210/N/Fountain_CO_Clerks_Bldg__Nom.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Fountain County Courthouse |accessdate=2015-10-01|author1=Carol Ann Freese |author2=Nancy Wagner |format=PDF|date=December 2001}} and Accompanying photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

While living in Crawfordsville, Wallace organized the Crawfordsville Guards Independent Militia, later called the Montgomery Guards. During the winter of 1859–60, after reading about elite units of the [[French Army]] in [[Algeria]], Wallace adopted the [[Zouave]] uniform and their system of training for the group. The Montgomery Guards would later form the core of his first military command, the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Forbes388/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 14, and Boomhower, p. 4 and 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-hur.com/meet-lew-wallace/timeline/ Timeline from the General Lew Wallace Study and Museum.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War service==
Wallace, a staunch supporter of the Union, became a member of the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican party]],&lt;ref name=Forbes388/&gt; and began his full-time military career soon after the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]], on April 12, 1861. Indiana's governor, the Republican [[Oliver P. Morton]], asked Wallace to help recruit Indiana volunteers for the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;Morsberger and Morseberger, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace, who also sought a military command, agreed to become the state's [[Indiana Adjutant General|adjutant general]] on the condition that he would be given command of a regiment of his choice.&lt;ref name="swansburg20130326"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/03/ben_hur_and_lew_wallace_how_the_scapegoat_of_shiloh_became_one_of_the_best.single.html |title=The Passion of Lew Wallace |work=Slate |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=March 30, 2013 |author=Swansburg, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana's quota of six regimental units was filled within a week,&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 2 and 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallace took command of the [[11th Indiana Infantry Regiment|11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], which was mustered into the Union army on April 25, 1861. Wallace received his formal commission as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Union army the following day.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1861, Wallace went with the 11th Indiana to [[Cumberland, Maryland]], and on June 12, the regiment won a minor battle at [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]], [[Virginia]], (in present-day [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It was misdated on Wallace's official report. See Stephens, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|swansburg20130326}} The rout boosted morale for Union troops and led to the Confederate evacuation of [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 1861, Wallace was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Army volunteers]] and given command of a brigade.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;

===Forts Henry and Donelson===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Henry|Battle of Fort Donelson}}
On February 4 and 5, 1862, prior to the advance against [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]], Union troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and a flotilla of Union ironclads and [[timberclad warship|timberclad]] gunboats under the command of Flag Officer [[Andrew Hull Foote]] made their way toward the Confederate fort along the [[Tennessee River]] in western [[Tennessee]]. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]]'s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]], surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.&lt;ref name=Stephens45-47&gt;Stephens, p. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort Donelson Feb15pm.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing Wallace's counterattack at [[Fort Donelson]] (1862)]]
Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], was concerned that Confederate reinforcements would try to retake the two forts when the Union troops moved overland toward [[Fort Donelson]], so Wallace was left in command at Fort Henry to keep the forts secure.&lt;ref name=Boom50&gt;Boomhower, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Displeased to have been left behind,{{r|swansburg20130326}} Wallace prepared his troops to move out at a moment's notice. The order came at midnight on February 13. Wallace arrived along the Cumberland River the following day and was placed in charge of the 3rd [[division (military)|Division]]. Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.&lt;ref name=Boom50/&gt;

During the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and in Grant's absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft's brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant's authority to take the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant later approved of Wallace's actions. See Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 62, and Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C. F. Smith were promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] for their efforts.&lt;ref name=Eicher773&gt;Eicher, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace, who was age thirty-four at the time of his promotion, became the youngest major general in the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 67–68, and Boomhower, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiloh===
{{Main|Battle of Shiloh}}
[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr6pm.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, afternoon of April 6, 1862.]]
Wallace's most controversial command came at the [[battle of Shiloh]], where he continued as the 3rd Division commander under Maj. Gen. Grant.

What was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 129, and Stephens, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 65 and 72, and Ferraro, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. [[John Milton Thayer|John M. Thayer]]'s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L. Smith]]'s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump's Landing, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 83, and Ferraro, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 83–84, and Boomhower, p. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 71, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 72 and 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 86, and Boomhower, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 85, and Boomhower, p. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, v. I, p. 336–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}

After a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 82 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2 and 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 87–88, and Boomhower, p. 60—61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}

Wallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 80 and 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr7.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862.]]
The next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line. Two of Wallace's batteries with the aid of a battery from the 1st Illinois Light Artillery were the first to attack at about 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 93 and 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The March of Lew Wallace's Division to Shiloh." In [http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/books/battles/index.cfm ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War''], vol. 1, edited by Robert Underwood Johnson and Clarence C. Buel. New York: Century Co., 1884–1888. 608–610. {{OCLC|2048818}}. (Johnson and Buel list no author for this article, but indicate it was based on material from Wallace.)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman's and Wallace's troops helped force the Confederates to fall back, and by 3 p.m. the Confederates were retreating southwest, toward Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiloh controversy===
[[File:Lew Wallace (ca. 1865).jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace]]
At first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 105–6, and Boomhower, p. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.&lt;ref name=Stephens107-8&gt;Stephens, p. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders", and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; ordering him to "tell him to come up at once" and that "if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, "Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it." Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.&lt;ref&gt;[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp.90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 112, and Morrow, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt; He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.&lt;ref name=Stephens107-8/&gt; On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 131–34, 138, and 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.&lt;ref name=Stephens232&gt;Stephens, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferraro147&gt;Ferraro, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter "modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh."&lt;ref name=Ferraro147 /&gt; While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.&lt;ref name="Stephens232" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, v. I, p. 351–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's article in the February 1885 issue of ''Century'' became the basis of his chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were published in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace's actions on the first day of battle.&lt;ref name=Ferraro147 /&gt; Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: "If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road."&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt; Wallace's account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of ''Ben-Hur'', Wallace continued to lament, "Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly."{{r|swansburg20130326}}

===Other military assignments===
On August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 127, 137–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 153–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monocacy===
{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}
Wallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 305, and Stephens, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 161–62, 164 and 175, and Boomhower, p. 8 and 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 73, and Stephens, p. 196 and 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 201, 203, and 205, and Boomhower, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&amp;nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later military service===
On January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 212–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 219, 221–22, and Morrow, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 223 and 226, and Boomhower, 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,&lt;ref name=Eicher773 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Juárez|Juárez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, p. 215–17 and 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and diplomatic career==
Wallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 229, and Boomhower, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 98 and 101; Ferraro, p. 142; and Morrow, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial governor of New Mexico===
Wallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 97 and 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; and Ferraro, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''Ben Hur''.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 108, and Morrow, p. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.&lt;ref name=Boom102&gt;Boomhower, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds."&lt;ref&gt;Utley, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a "fake" arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 106–7 and 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a "lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity" over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=2010-12-31|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===
On May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 112, 118, and 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled "An American and yet a Despot". The editorial caused the Havatzelet to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. Havatzelet claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175–180, Warsaw, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 119 and 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.&lt;ref name=Boom122&gt;Boomhower, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.&lt;ref name=Boom122/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 230–31, and Morrow, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Wallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 11, and Forbes, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on William H. Prescott's ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, p. 387, and McKee, "The Early Life of Lew Wallace", p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's book sold seven thousand copies in its first year. Its sales continued to rise after Wallace's reputation as an author was established with the publication of subsequent novels.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 90, and Morrow, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace wrote the manuscript for ''Ben-Hur'', his second and best-known novel, during his spare time at Crawfordsville, and completed it in Santa Fe, while serving as the territorial governor of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow15&gt;Morrow, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ben-Hur'', an adventure story of revenge and redemption, is told from the perspective of a Jewish nobleman named Judah Ben-Hur.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Wallace had not been to the [[Holy Land]] before writing the book, he began research to familiarize himself with the area's geography and its history at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., in 1873.&lt;ref name=Morrow15/&gt; [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers]] published the book on November 12, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 9, 91, and 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ben-Hur'' made Wallace a wealthy man and established his reputation as a famous author.&lt;ref name=Stephens229&gt;Stephens, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were slow at first; only 2,800 copies were sold in the first seven months after its release, but the book became popular among readers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 11 and 110.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886, it was earning Wallace about $11,000 in annual royalties (equivalent to $290,000 in 2015 dollars),&lt;ref name=Stephens229/&gt; and provided Wallace's family with financial security.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889, Harper and Brothers had sold 400,000 copies and the book had been translated into several languages.&lt;ref name=Boom111&gt;Boomhower, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, ''Ben-Hur'' became the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lew Wallace|title=''Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'', with a New Introduction by Tim LaHaye|publisher=Signet Classic|year=2003|page=vii |url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0192831992&amp;id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;vq=wallace&amp;dq=ben-hur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Lifson, an editor for ''Humanities'', identified it as the most influential Christian book of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Others named it one of the best-selling novels of all time.&lt;ref name=Boom111/&gt; At the time of ''Ben-Hur'''s one hundredth anniversary in 1980, it had "never been out of print"&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been adapted for the stage and several motion pictures.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 11 and 138, and Morrow, p. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian, [[Victor Davis Hanson]], has argued that ''Ben-Hur'' drew from Wallace's life, particularly his experiences at Shiloh, and the damage it did to his reputation. The book's main character, Judah Ben-Hur, accidentally causes injury to a high-ranking Roman commander, for which he and his family suffer tribulations and calumny.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Davis Hanson|Hanson, Victor Davis]], (2003) ''Ripples of Battle: How Wars of the Past Still Determine How We Fight, How We Live, and How We Think'', Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-50400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace wrote subsequent novels and biographies, but ''Ben-Hur'' remained his most important work. Wallace considered ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'' (1893) as his best novel.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a biography of President [[Benjamin Harrison]], a fellow Hoosier and Civil War general, and ''The Wooing of Malkatoon'' (1898), a narrative poem. Wallace was writing his autobiography when he died in 1905. His wife Susan completed it with the assistance of [[Mary Hannah Krout]], another author from Crawfordsville. It was published posthumously in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 234 and 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Wallace continued to write after his return from Turkey. He also patented several of his own inventions, built a seven-story apartment building in Indianapolis, [[The Blacherne]], and drew up plans for a private study at his home in Crawfordsville.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 126, and Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace remained active in veterans groups, including writing a speech for the dedication of the battlefield at the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's elaborate writing study, which he described as "a pleasure-house for my soul",&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; served as his private retreat.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Now called the [[General Lew Wallace Study|General Lew Wallace Study and Museum]], it was built between 1895 and 1898, adjacent to his residence in Crawfordsville, and set in an enclosed park. The study along with three and one-half acres of its grounds were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1590&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=General Lew Wallace Study|accessdate=2014-08-29|work=National Historic Landmark Program, Quick Links|publisher=National Park Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231501/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1590&amp;ResourceType=Building|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is operated as a museum, open to the public.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=George R.|author2=Ralph Christian |title=Wallace, Gen. Lew, Study NRHP Nomination Form|publisher=American Assoc. for State and Local History|year=1975|url={{NHLS url|id=76000013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace had a moat on two sides of the Study and stocked it so he could fish from the back porch and a landing. In winter, he would fire up the coal furnace in the Study basement and fish from the windows. He loved fishing so much he invented and patented a special traveler's fishing pole. After just a few years he had the moat drained as it was negatively affecting the Study foundation and he worried about his grandchildren and neighborhood children falling into the water.

On April 5, 1898, at the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], Wallace, at age seventy-one, offered to raise and lead a force of soldiers, but the war office refused. Undeterred, he went to a local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private, but was rejected again, presumably because of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 236; Boomhower, p. 129; and Morrow, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's service at the battle of Shiloh continued to haunt him in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 231, and Ferraro, p. 143–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission's historian, and others. Wallace died before the manuscript of his memoirs was fully completed, and it is unknown whether he would have revised his final account of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 233–34 and 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Wallace died at home in Crawfordsville, on February 15, 1905,{{r|swansburg20130326}} of [[atrophic gastritis]].&lt;ref&gt;The physician's cause of death on his death certificate is "atrophy of stomach", which is consistent with documented reports of his health beginning in Fall 1904. See, {{cite news |title=General Lew Wallace dies at Indiana home |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 16, 1905 |page=9 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A1EF63D5912738DDDAF0994DA405B858CF1D3}} See also, Welsh, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; He was seventy-seven years old.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt; Wallace is buried in Crawfordsville Oak Hill Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 12 and 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
Wallace was a man of many interests and a lifelong adventure seeker, who remained a persistent, self-confident man of action. He was also impatient and highly sensitive to personal criticisms, especially those related to his command decisions at Shiloh.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, p. 389–91 and 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Wallace's career in law and politics, combined with years of military and diplomatic service, he achieved his greatest fame as a novelist, most notably for his best-selling biblical tale, ''Ben-Hur''.

Following Wallace's death, the State of Indiana commissioned sculptor Andrew O'Connor to create a [[Lew Wallace (O'Connor)|marble statue of Wallace]] dressed in a military uniform for the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. The statue was unveiled during a ceremony held on January 11, 1910.&lt;ref name=Boom138&gt;Boomhower, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace is the only novelist honored in the hall.&lt;ref name="Humanities"/&gt; A bronze copy of the statue is installed on the grounds of Wallace's study in Crawfordsville.&lt;ref name=Boom138/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lew Wallace High School]] opened in 1926 at 415 West 45th Avenue in [[Gary, Indiana]]. On June 3, 2014, the Gary School Board voted 4 to 2 to close Lew Wallace, along with five other schools.&lt;ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[North American Soccer League|NASL]] Indianapolis based team The [[Indy Eleven]] pays homage to the 11th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. The inspiration for the name came from Donna Schmink, the Collection Manager at the Indiana War Museum, who, when asked by team officials for ideas on a team name connected to Indiana history, suggested "the Eleventh" in honor of the regiment that valiantly fought under the initial direction of Colonel Lew Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indyeleven.com/about-indy|title=About Indy Eleven {{!}} Indy Eleven|website=www.indyeleven.com|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use Wallace's image on various merchandise.

The term '''Serbian lands''' has been used for medieval Serbian state creations, for Serb-inhabited territories in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period and in political-geopraphical use{{sfn|Vuković|Vemić|2014}} since the independence of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. During the [[Yugoslav wars]] it was used for the ethnic unification of [[Serbs]] through union of [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbia]], [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]], [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srpska]] and [[Republic of Srpska Krajina]].

==History==
[[File:Seal of Strojimir.gif|thumb|right|220px|Seal of prince [[Strojimir]] of [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]], from the late 9th century]]
The "medieval Serbian lands" included Serbian tribes, polities and monarchies, such as [[Raška (region)|Raška]], [[Serbian Empire]], etc.{{sfn|Vuković|Vemić|2014}}

Roots of the [[Greater Serbia]]n ideology are often traced back to Serbian minister [[Ilija Garašanin]]'s ''Načertanije'' (1844),&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Philip J. |last2=Riesman |first2=David |title=Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0-89096-760-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who envisioned a reconstruction of the Serbian Empire and unification of "Serbian lands", which included Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|Montenegro]], northern Albania, parts of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]] and the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]].&lt;ref name="TrencsenyiKopecek2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Balazs Trencsenyi|author2=Michal Kopecek|title=National Romanticism: The Formation of National Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpPWvubBL0MC&amp;pg=PA240|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-60-8|pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, while traveling across "Ancient Serbia", [[Alexander Hilferding]] (1831-1872), a Russian Slavist and travel writer of German origin, wrote: ''"an [[Orthodox Serb]], wherever he might live – in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Hungary, [[Principality of Serbia]] – has, besides a church, one great homeland, Serbian land, which is, to tell the truth, divided among many masters, but it exists as an ideal, as the land of the unified Orthodox Serbian nation. He has his own oral tradition, folklore; he knows about Serbian [[Saint Sava]], Serbian [[Emperor Dušan]], Serbian martyr [[Lazar Hrebeljanović|Lazar]], popular hero [[Prince Marko]]. His current life rests upon the foundations of his nation and it is permeated with the previous historical life of the nation".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/pas/pas2003/pas2003-02.pdf|title=Elements Of Ethnic Identification Of The Serbs|page=727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by political theorist [[Dobrica Ćosić]] for the ethnic unification of Serbs through union of Serbia, Montenegro, [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Republic of Srpska Krajina]] during the [[Yugoslav wars]] (1991–95).&lt;ref name="Jović2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Dejan Jović]]|title=Yugoslavia: A State that Withered Away|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po03enYpbqsC&amp;pg=PA135|date=January 2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-495-8|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">{{about|the swimsuit||Maillot (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Bathing-apparel-maillot-nyt-1916.png|right|thumb|Historical advertisement for a maillot from 1916 (far right).]]
The '''maillot''' ( [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: British  /mʌɪˈəʊ/, U.S.  /maɪˈ(j)oʊ/)&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 3rd Ed. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; is the fashion designer's name for a woman's [[one-piece swimsuit]], also called a '''tank suit'''.  A maillot swimsuit generally consists of a tank-style torso top with high-cut legs.  However, a maillot may also include a plunging neckline, turtleneck-style top, or revealing cutouts.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

In addition to describing women’s one-piece swimsuits, the word maillot has also been used to refer to [[tights]] or [[leotard]]s made of stretchable, jersey fabric, generally used for [[dance]] or [[gymnastics]]. The term maillot was first used to describe tight-fitting, one-piece swimsuits in the 1920s, as these swimsuits had been manufactured from a similar stretchable, jersey fabric.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[Image:Fotothek df roe-neg 0002999 003 Portrait eines Mädchens in Badebekleidung aus dem Becken steigend, Bad Süd-Ost i.jpg|thumb|right|Young woman in a maillot (one-piece) swimsuit in Germany, 1950]]
In the present day, the phrase one-piece swimsuit has almost completely replaced the term maillot in colloquial language.  While the word has now become somewhat obsolete in common language, fashion designers and consumers used it quite often in the early days of the modern swimsuit. It is now most often used to distinguish between several different types of one-piece swimsuits, including the tank maillot and the pretzel maillot. The term is also used in bicycle racing. For example, the leader of the [[Tour de France]] wears the ''maillot jaune'', referring to the yellow jersey that the overall race leader is awarded after each leg of the race.

==Etymology==
The term maillot was inducted into the English dictionary in 1928; it derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase for swaddling clothes.  In the French language, the word maillot means "shirt" and is used to distinguish leaders in the [[Tour de France]].  The modern French term for a swimsuit, maillot de bain, also makes use of the word.  The name "tanksuit" or "tank suit" (as well as "tank top") alludes to the "tank" or pool in which the wearer swims.
In colloquial [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]], particularly in the [[Levant]] region, the term maillot (مايوه) is a generic term used to refer to a swimsuit for both men and women.

== Biography ==
María Ugarte was born in [[Segovia]], [[Old Castile]], [[Spain]], to Comdt. Jerónimo de Ugarte Roure, a Basque soldier who became civil governor of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] in the second [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] biennium.&lt;ref name="Aizpuru-FernandezBlanco" /&gt; She was a student of [[Antonio Machado]] and [[Ortega y Gasset]], and classmate of [[Julián Marías]].&lt;ref name="ElPais-Campo27F"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campo |first1=Iban |title=Cuando me reconocen con estos galardones me pregunto si me los merezco |url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2006/02/27/actualidad/1140994801_850215.html |publisher=[[El País]] |accessdate=23 September 2014 |language=Spanish |date=27 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugarte España obtained a degree in ''Philosophy and Literature'' (1935) at the Central University of Madrid (now [[Complutense University of Madrid]]), specializing in ''Historical Sciences'', and was assistant professor of the historian {{illm|Pío Zabala|es|Pío Zabala y Lera}} (1934–1936).&lt;ref name="Clio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOMINICANAonline" /&gt;

At the university she met Constantino Brusíloff (b. Constantin Alekseievich Brusiloff-Nigehorodzeff, Saint Petersburg, 1895 – Caracas, 1977), a Russian exile, veteran of the [[First World War]] (and later from the [[Spanish Civil War]] too).&lt;ref name="Aizpuru-FernandezBlanco"&gt;{{Smallcaps|Aizpuru}}, Mikel; {{Smallcaps|Fernández Blanco}}, Aída:«Los estudios de Filología Moderna.

The political situation in the country with the outbreak of the civil war and the rise of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], forced them to fled into exile in the Dominican Republic,&lt;ref name="DiaroLibre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aizpuru-FernandezBlanco" /&gt; where they arrived on early February 1940.&lt;ref name="Clio" /&gt; At first, Ugarte worked at the State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs;&lt;ref name="LD-Suriel" /&gt; she also went on to teach the Spanish language to the refugees of the World War II in [[Sosúa]], in northern Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = El Informe Brusíloff: la Guerra Civil de 1936 en el Frente Norte vista por un traductor ruso|last = Aizpuru |first = Mikel|publisher = Alberdania SL|year = 2009|isbn = 978-84-9868-056-0|location = Zarautz|pages = 305|accessdate = 24 September 2014|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O8LYGm81Mq8C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between June and November 1943 she taught at the [[University of Santo Domingo]] the first course of [[Archival Science]] that was ever held at the Dominican Republic. She made the first Bulletin Index of the General Archive of the Nation, which was published in 1947.&lt;ref name="Clio" /&gt; During the 1940s, Ugarte discovered a huge repertoire of colonial documents, among them, the ''Royal Archives of Bayaguana''.&lt;ref name="Clio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOMINICANAonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=MARÍA UGARTE: Dedicatoria especial en la 5ta.

On April 1948, Ugarte started her career as journalist in the newspaper ''El Caribe'',&lt;ref name="ElPais-Campo23F" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOMINICANAonline" /&gt; invited by its managing editor, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Rafael Herrera;&lt;ref name="ElPais-Campo27F" /&gt; at ''El Caribe'' she was assistant editor, director of the cultural supplement (1963–1998), and director of Supplements and worked in there until she retired, in 2000.&lt;ref name="ElPais-Campo23F" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOMINICANAonline" /&gt; In 1950, she married with separate property to the cattleman José Antonio Jiménez Álvarez.&lt;ref name="LD-Suriel" /&gt;

The '''National Historic Preservation Act''' ('''NHPA'''; Public Law 89-665; 54 U.S.C. 300101 ''et seq.'') is legislation intended to preserve historical and [[archaeological site]]s in the [[United States of America]]. The act created the [[National Register of Historic Places]], the list of [[National Historic Landmark]]s, and the [[State Historic Preservation Office]]s.

Senate Bill 3035, the National Historic Preservation Act, was signed into law on October 15, 1966, and is the most far-reaching preservation legislation ever enacted in the United States. Several amendments have been made since. Among other things, the act requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of all federally funded or permitted projects on historic properties (buildings, archaeological sites, etc.) through a process known as ''Section 106 Review''.

==Early development==
Prior to the 1960s, "historic preservation was," according to a 2015 column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "neither a public policy issue nor part of America's architectural, planning and real estate development culture. Historic-preservation laws didn't exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger K.|last=Lewis|date=September 11, 2015|title=Historic preservation doesn't have a long history in U.S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/historic-preservation-doesnt-have-a-long-history-in-us/2015/09/10/36458684-50c4-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html|work=The Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no national policy regarding preservation until 1966, efforts in the 19th century initiated the journey towards legislation. One of the earliest efforts of the preservation movement occurred around the 1850s when George Washington's home, [[Mount Vernon]], was in shambles. His nephew attempted to sell it to the federal government for $200,000, but no one bought it.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Duerken et all., ''A Handbook on Historic Preservation Law'', edited by Christopher J. Duerken (Washington D.C.: Conservation Foundation: National Center for Preservation Law, 1983), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further destruction or conversion to a resort, Ann Pamela Cunningham created the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association to fight for this house. After establishing the first group promoting preservation efforts, they raised the money to acquire the property and protect it from ruin. Due to their efforts, not only does this house stand to represent the nation and the birth of independence, but it also, "served as a blueprint for later organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tunnard, "Landmarks of Beauty," ''With Heritage So Rich'', chaired by Albert Rains, directed by Laurence G. Henderson (New York: Random House, 1966), 30. &amp; Mitchell Schwarzer, "Myths of Permanence and Transience in the Discourse on Historic Preservation in the United States," ''Journal of Architectural Education'' 48, no. 1 (September 1994): 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, an act was passed on the behalf of the nation's history and land. President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] signed the [[Antiquities Act]] that "prohibited the excavation of antiquities from public lands without a permit from the Secretary of Interior."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. King, ''Cultural Resource: Law and Practice'', 2nd ed. (New York: Altamira Press, 2004), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave the president authority to declare a specific piece of land a national monument, therefore protecting it from scavengers and proclaiming national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Duerken, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the [[Department of the Interior]] established a new entity known as the [[National Park Service]], the nation's first agency to regulate and manage public space, including the national monuments.&lt;ref&gt;King, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; "Over the past fifty years the NPS has acquired more than {{convert|26000000|acre|km2}} of land, including not only the great chain of parks preserved for their natural beauty and value, but an extraordinary variety of historic buildings, monuments, and sites."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Muri Whitehall, "The Right of Cities to be Beautiful," ''With Heritage So Rich'', chaired by Albert Rains, directed by Laurence G. Henderson (New York: Random House, 1966), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1935, Congress formed the [[Historic Sites Act]] that established a national policy for preservation and permitted the Secretary of Interior to create programs on behalf of preservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Adina W. Kanefield, ''Federal Historic Preservation Case Law, 1966-1996'', rev. ed., http://www.achp.gov/book/TOC2.html (accessed April 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), one of the established programs, provided jobs for unemployed architects, engineers, and surveyors during the Great Depression era. They were charged with surveying, recording, documenting, and interpreting historic properties.&lt;ref&gt;King, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Historic Sites Act also organized the national parks under the National Park Service, which created the foundation for the future development of National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;Duekern, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Antiquities Act and Historic Sites Act were major stepping stones for the preservation movement, it did not create a public "national awareness."&lt;ref name="Kanefield"&gt;Kanefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 1949, President [[Harry Truman]] signed legislation creating the National Trust for Historic Preservation "to facilitate public participation in the preservation of sites, buildings, and objects of national significance or international interest." In addition, the law enforced public participation in preserving and protecting the sites, buildings, objects of national significance in American history."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehall, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] did not provide funds for preservation projects. Today, they offer funds for planning and education and provide a plethora of information, techniques, and methods to assist people in carrying out preservation efforts locally.

==Post WWII and urban renewal==
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage = [[File:Sally Jewell official portrait.jpg|210px]] '''Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell''' |video1 = [http://www.c-span.org/video/?400317-1/national-historic-preservation-act-50th-anniversary National Historic Preservation Act 50th Anniversary], [[C-SPAN]], 53:41, November 6, 2015 | accessdate = December 20, 2015 }}

In 1956, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] into law which established the [[Interstate Highway System]], providing an easy and efficient way for troops to depart if under attack. Due to this new construction, many historic properties were destroyed. In the 1960s, President [[John F. Kennedy]] launched the Urban Renewal Program. Hoping the plan would rejuvenate the cities, it in fact increased the destruction in the downtown areas.&lt;ref&gt;King, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in population around this time, as well, and the manufacturing of cars called for a rapid change, therefore hindering our nation and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tunnard, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; "With the urbanization, tear downs, and rebuilding America ... it is destroying the physical evidence of the past." During the 1950s and 1960s, people saw the negative changes in their cities and developed a concern for their "quality of life that reflected their identity."&lt;ref name="King, 22"&gt;King, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the nationwide destruction brought about by federally initiated programs, a report coordinated by [[Lady Bird Johnson]] analyzed the country and the effects of urban renewal. ''With Heritage So Rich'', an accumulation of essays, wrote "an expansive inventory of properties reflecting the nation's heritage, a mechanism to protect those properties from unnecessary harm caused by federal activities, a program of financial incentives, and an independent federal preservation body to coordinate the actions of federal agencies affecting historic preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stipe, ''A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in 21st Century'' (Chapel Hill: University of Chapel Hill Press, 2003), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The book triggered public awareness of the issue and offered a proposition to handle the situation through the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;ref name="Kanefield"/&gt;

==National Historic Preservation Act==

The National Historic Preservation Act was signed into law by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 15, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stipe, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;   This act established several institutions: [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]], State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, and the Section 106 review process.&lt;ref name="King, 22"/&gt; The Section 106 Process is further explained and defined in [http://www.achp.gov/regs-rev04.pdf 36 CFR Part 800].

Meeting four times a year, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation consists of 23 members from both public and private sectors, with the chairman appointed by the president.&lt;ref&gt;Stipe, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Council's role is to advise the President and Congress on historic preservation issues, to develop policies and guidelines handling any conflicts of federal agencies, and to participate in the Section 106 review process.&lt;ref&gt;Duerken, 9. &amp; Kanefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Register of Historic Places]], overseen by the National Park Service, is the nation's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects worthy of preservation,&lt;ref&gt;King, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and are officially designated "historic properties" regardless of whether they are archaeological or historic.  To be eligible for listing, a property must meet one of four criteria and have sufficient integrity.&lt;ref&gt;A property does not have to be officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places to receive protection, they just have to be considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. One historian notes that National Park Service administrators "...responded enthusiastically to their growing professional authority by issuing a new, systematic outline of American history to serve as a guideline for the agency." John A. Matzko, ''Reconstructing Fort Union'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2001), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Being listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register does not automatically prevent damage or destruction but it qualifies these approved properties for grants, loans, and tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Fisher, "Promoting the Preservation of Historic Buildings: Historic Preservation Policy in the United States," ''APT Bulletin'' 29, no. ¾ (1998): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO) and Officer was established by the NHPA to coordinate statewide inventory of historic properties, nominate properties to the National Register, maintain a statewide preservation plan, assist others, and advise and educate locals.&lt;ref&gt;King, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;   There are a total of 59 SHPO officers, one for each state with eight additional ones, which include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others.

==Section 106 review process==
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act mandates federal agencies undergo a review process for all federally funded and permitted projects that will impact sites listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places. Specifically it requires the federal agency to "take into account" the effect a project may have on historic properties. It allows interested parties an opportunity to comment on the potential impact projects may have on significant archaeological or historic sites. The main purpose for the establishment of the Section 106 review process is to minimize potential harm and damage to historic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Stipe, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any federal agency whose project, funding or permit may affect a historic property, both those listed or eligible for inclusion in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], must consider the effects on historic properties and "seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate" any adverse effects on historic properties. The typical Section 106 Review involves four primary steps: 1 - Initiation of the Section 106 Review; 2 - Identification of Historic Properties; 3 - Assessment of Adverse Effects; and 4 - Resolution of Adverse Effects. Further steps may be required if there is a disagreement among the consulting parties on adverse effects or the resolution of the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, "Protection Historic Properties: A Citizen's Guide to Section 106 Review," Updated Brochure 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal agency overseeing the project inventories the project area (or contracts with a qualified consultant) to determine the presence or absence of historic properties. They then submit to the SHPO a Determination of Effect/Finding of Effect (DOE/FOE) outlining to the SHPO the project, the efforts taken identify historic properties, and what effects, if any, the project may have on historic properties. If the project is believed to have no adverse effect on eligible historic resources and the SHPO and other consulting parties agree, then the Section 106 process is effectively closed and the project may proceed. Alternatively, if an adverse effect is expected, the agency is required to work with the local State Historic Preservation Office to ensure that all interested parties are given an opportunity to review the proposed work and provide comments. This step seeks ways for the project to avoid having an adverse effect on historic properties. Ideally, a Memorandum of Agreement is reached between all consulting parties outlining agreed to mitigation or avoidance of historic properties, but this is not always the case. Without this process historical properties would lose a significant protection. This process helps decide different approaches and solutions to the project, but does not prevent any site from demolition or alteration.&lt;ref name="King, 22"/&gt;

==Motives==

Early preservation efforts were driven by patriotism and a desire to protect the new establishment of the nation by wealthy, private individuals. Early efforts focused primarily on individual structures as opposed to areas such as a neighborhood in a city or a rural landscape. The preserved structures were often turned into museums to create a showcase and generate tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of preservation eventually shifted from patriotism to the aesthetics of a structure or area and ultimately to their structural relationships with society at large.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzer, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Robin Elizabeth Datel, modern motivations for preservation can be summed up in four points: 
* to retain diverse elements of past
* to perpetuate the distinctive identities of places
* to involve amateurs in landscape care
* to practice a conservation approach to environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Elizabeth Datel, "Preservation and a Sense of Orientation for American Cities," ''Geographical Review'' 75, no. 2 (April 1985): 125.&lt;/ref&gt;
The economic benefits of preservation continue to become more important and better understood and documented. Preservation efforts produce the most number of jobs in the nation's economy&lt;ref&gt;Donovan D. Rypkema, T''he Economics of Historic Preservation: A Community Leader's Guide'' (Washington D.C.: National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1994), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and these jobs create new businesses and tourism, increase property values, and enhanced the quality of life in a community.

==Effects==
The National Historic Preservation Act has led to major changes in the employment trends in historic preservation fields. Archaeologists, historians, historic architects, and others have been employed in vast numbers in the field of cultural resource management. Cultural resource management is an umbrella term which encompasses archaeology, historic preservation and other disciplines when employed for the purposes of compliance with NHPA and other federal and state-mandated historic preservation laws.

Prior to the passage and subsequent enforcement (through litigation) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and other laws, most archaeologists, historians, and other historic preservation specialists were employed primarily in the field of academia, working at universities or other places of higher learning. However, since the passage of the NHPA, ever-increasing numbers of these professionals are employed in support of the [[cultural resources management]] industry. Large public works projects often require that teams of archaeologists perform limited excavations in order to properly inventory buried archaeological remains and assess their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. This industry has also allowed a larger swath of individuals to participate in archaeology and history as, unlike in the academic arena, a PhD is not required to earn a professional livelihood.

[http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/Prof_Qual_83.htm The Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards] for archeologists require a graduate degree plus at least one year of full-time experience, at least four months of fieldwork, and demonstrated ability to carry research to completion. Additionally, the basic field work often required in support of performing inventories of cultural resources is conducted by individuals with or earning bachelor's degrees. As a result, many undergraduates and recent graduates in the fields which support the implementation of the National Historic Preservation Act have found gainful employment. In the past, they stood little chance of earning a living in these fields without an advanced degree.  However, Cultural Resource Management (CRM) is still one of the lowest paying fields for educated professionals.

The '''National Reconstruction Bureau''' ([[Reporting name|reporting name:]] '''NRB''') of [[Pakistan]] was an independent and constitutionally established federal institution tasked with economic recovery and prosperous development through the [[Local government in Pakistan|local government]] system. It was dissolved in May 2011.

==Overview==
The NRB formulated public policy matters for the development of local economic independence, local government system evaluation and generate fundamental thought on promoting [[good governance]] to strengthen democracy through the reconstruction of institutions of state related to all aspects of governance and social welfare.

Codified under the [http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch2.html Article 89(1)] (this is wrongly expressed as the Article 89(1) is for promulgation of Ordinance by the President of Pakistan, therefore it does not allow for notification of National Reconstruction Bureau, kindly correct the matter, by the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], the institute was chaired by the Chairman and directly reports to the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] on yearly basis. Established on 18 November 1999, its primary mission is to formulate public-level national policy for the nationwide reconstruction, economic development and recovery all over the nation. As of present, the institution is currently chaired by Dr. [[Asim Hussain]] as its appointed and designated chairman of the NRB.&lt;ref name="Daily Times Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Press|title=Dr Asim appointed {{Sic|nolink=y|honou|rary|expected=honorary}} NRB chairman|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\05\20\story_20-5-2008_pg7_10|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=Daily Times Pakistan|date=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Organization is now stands defunct by the Government of Pakistan and merged with Prime Minister's Secretariat as Policy Implementation Wing.

==History==

===Background===
During the 1980-1990s, the country had seen a rapid rise of the [[Illegal immigration to Pakistan|illegal immigration]] from [[Afghanistan]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Iran]], [[Bangladesh]], Burma, and other countries. The outcomes of the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|civil war]] in [[Afghanistan]] had damaged the planned cities of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] region in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province]]. The war torn areas in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Western Pakistan]], the unplanned and illegal housing caused major disturbances in planned [[Driving licence in Pakistan|traffic systems]] and cities. In 1999, President [[Pervez Musharraf]] took the recommendation from [[Pakistan Army]] and his government to established the National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) for quick economic recovery and development in war-torn areas.

===Negotiations and consensus===
The proposal was pushed forward by Pakistan Army when [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Tanveer Naqvi]] presented the plan at the cabinet-level meeting in Islamabad.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2000"&gt;{{cite news|last=Faraz Hashmi|title=Women to get 33% seats: NSC, cabinet opt for separate electorate|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2000/aug05.html|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn Archives, 2000|date=5 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  General Naqvi suggested to President Musharraf that the "[[Pakistan police|Police]] should be under the control of district mayors who would be an elected person and accountable before the district assembly."&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2000"/&gt; However, [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Interior Minister]] [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Moinuddin Haider]] objected the plan and differed with him as he insisted to the proposal that the proposed police safety commission which would also have public representation.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2000"/&gt;

The massive commutative political alliance, [[Alliance for Restoration of Democracy|ARD]], led by [[Benazir Bhutto]] rejected the whole plan, as she termed it as "not workable".&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, August 2000"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashraf Mumtaz|title=Devolution plan rejected: APC wants immediate timeframe for polls|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2000/aug12.html|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn Archives, August 2000|date=6 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its senior leader, [[Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan|Nasrullah Khan]] took punitive approach, pressing for quick elections, revival of assemblies rather than an acceleration in economic rehabilitation, demanding unconditional fulfillment of all prior reparation claims, and pressing for progress toward nationwide socioeconomic transformation.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, August 2000"/&gt; The ARD noted that devolution plan, given by the National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB), was "neither workable nor practically possible".&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, August 2000"/&gt; The ARD demanded that any restructuring of the system should be left to the elected representatives.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, August 2000"/&gt; The ARD alliance was divided when half of the political parties rejected the NRB plan for reconstruction while other half showed its support to NRB and admitted that the "new system is better than the one which had been given by the National Reconstruction Bureau."&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, August 2000"/&gt;

On 6 August 2000, over three dozen parties which took part in the all-party conference had rejected the NRB plan.&lt;ref name="Dawn 19"/&gt; While other three dozen parties marked the NRB's proposal as "it was better was "practicable."&lt;ref name="Dawn 19"&gt;{{cite news|last=OSR|title=Most political parties reject devolution plan|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2000/aug19.html|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn 19|date=19 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, President Musharraf reconcile the matter between Interior ministry and NRB at the high level meeting over the economic recovery plans.&lt;ref name="1 July 2000"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansar Abbasi|title=NRB, interior ministry told to mend fences|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2000/sep02.html|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=1 July 2000|date=1 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Reconstruction Bureau===
The Bureau was established on 18 November 1999 with the mission to formulate policy for national reconstruction. It is a focal organisation to generate fundamental thoughts on promoting good governance to strengthen democracy through reconstruction of institutions of State. The National Reconstruction Bureau formulated recommendations for reconstruction of Local Governments and the Police. Local Government Ordinance, 2001 was promulgated by the provincial governments in August, 2001. The Police Order, 2002 was promulgated on 14 August 2002 which replaced the Police Act, 1861. The Devolution Plan and Local Government Ordinances brought about a wholesale transformation in Pakistan's system of government, especially at the local level. Divisions were abolished, and instead a three-tier local government structure comprising three categories of local government - districts, tehsils and unions - was brought in.

This meant the decentralization of many functions previously handled by the provincial governments to the districts and tehsils. Alongside administrative and political decentralization, provisions have been made for transfer of funds to the local governments so they can carry out their planning and development functions effectively.

==Termination==

The National Reconstruction Bureau was dissolved by the government in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2011/05/govt-dissolves-national-reconstruction-bureau/ "Govt. dissolves National Reconstruction Bureau" Samaa, May 27, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nevis Historical and Conservation Society''' ('''NHCS''') is a nonprofit non-governmental organisation ([[NGO]]) based in the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Nevis]], founded in 1980 to protect the cultural and natural heritage of the island.

==Mission and funding==
The NHCS, founded in 1980, is charged with protecting the cultural and natural heritage of the island of [[Nevis]], which is part of the Federation of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], in the [[Leeward Islands]], [[West Indies]]. The stated mission of the society is "to conserve the natural, cultural and historic fabric of the Island of Nevis and her surrounding sea for all its people."&lt;ref name=nhcs-about/&gt;

The organization is funded through local and international memberships, donations, museum admissions and sales, annual fundraising events, and an endowment fund. On May 2, 2012, the [[Nevis Island Assembly]] unanimously enacted an ordinance to establish a Heritage Trust in support of the organization.&lt;ref name=nia2012/&gt; However, it was later discovered that in its original legislative form, the ordinance would have deprived the trust of its NGO status, resulting in a "stalemate" on implementation of the trust.&lt;ref name=np-ngo/&gt;

==Museums and services==
The NHCS maintains two museums on the island, and has instituted projects and policies designed to preserve the island's unique history and environment, and to make that heritage accessible and intelligible to locals and visitors.

[[File:Nevis Hamilton.jpg|thumb|A closer view of the east end of the Hamilton House]]
The Alexander Hamilton Museum is located in the Hamilton House, on the waterfront near the center of [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]], the capital of Nevis. Hamilton House is a [[Georgian Architecture|Georgian]] building, rebuilt and restored from the ruins of the house where the American statesman [[Alexander Hamilton]] is believed to have been born and to have lived during his childhood. The museum features a presentation about his life and times.

The upper floor of Hamilton House hosts the Nevis Island Government's Legislative Offices, the [[Nevis Island Assembly]].

Together with the Trott House next door, which was acquired by the society in 2011, the two buildings and their immediate surroundings are known as the Nevis Heritage Centre.

===Museum of Nevis History===
The NHCS also maintains the [[Museum of Nevis History]], formerly known as the Nelson Museum, located to the southeast of Charlestown at Bellevue. The facility houses the Nevis Island Archives of historical records.

This museum features the [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] Collection, an extensive collection of Nelson memorabilia. When Admiral Nelson was a young sea captain, he was stationed on Nevis during the mid-1780s. In 1787, Nelson married a young widow who was a Nevis plantation owner's daughter-in-law, Frances (Fanny) Nesbit.

===Joan Robinson Biodiversity and Oral History Resource Centre===
The Bellevue facility also houses the Joan Robinson Biodiversity and Oral History Resource Centre, which was opened on April 22, 2009, and which currently consists of two laboratories. One is dedicated to recording and preserving the flora and fauna of Nevis and the other is a video editing suite, which is designed to preserve the oral history of the island by digitally recording the oldest people on the island, to preserve their memories of life on Nevis during the early parts of the 20th century.
 
The Biodiversity and Oral History Projects are jointly funded by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives ([[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]]), the British High Commission ([[Barbados]]); and The Strabon Project (French Embassy, [[Saint Lucia]]).  
 
Among the notable aspects of these two projects is that local high school students perform most of the work. During the process they learn technical and scientific skills from NHCS staff and other experts in a wide variety of disciplines, including but not limited to, archaeology, marine and terrestrial biology, botany, [[GPS]]/[[GIS]] mapping and surveying techniques, still and video photography, website design and maintenance, video editing and production, and desktop publishing.

==NHCS publications==
The society publishes a quarterly newsletter, ''The Gathering'', which details its current and ongoing projects.

In 1989, the NHCS published ''The Birds of Nevis'', a 56-page booklet written by Paul Hilder. The list of species included in that publication has since been expanded and updated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-diversity-nevis.org/new_page_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-diversity-nevis.org/images/Nevis%20Birds/Birds%20of%20Nevis%20Check%20List.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the society published a 69-page book entitled ''The Natural History of the Island of Nevis'', edited by David Robinson and Jennifer Lowery, which included contributions such as a chapter on the island's freshwater invertebrates by biologist T. David Bass.&lt;ref name=bass/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12899">Scholarly theories about the '''origin of the Székelys''' (a subgroup of the [[Hungarians|Hungarian people]]) can be divided into four main groups. Medieval chronicles unanimously stated that the [[Székelys]] were descended from the [[Huns]] and settled in the [[Carpathian Basin]] centuries before the [[Hungarians]] (or Magyars) conquered the territory in the late 9th century. This theory is refuted by most modern specialists. According to a widely accepted modern hypothesis, the Székelys were originally a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] who joined the Magyars in the [[Pontic steppes]]. Other scholars say, the Székelys were descended from the border guards of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] who settled in the easternmost region of the Carpathian Basin and preserved their special privileges for centuries. According to a fourth theory, the Székelys' origin can be traced back to the [[Late Avar]] population of the Carpathian Basin.

== Medieval chronicles ==

Medieval chronicles associated the [[Székelys]] with the [[Huns]], also claiming that both the Huns and the Hungarians were descended from the [[Scythians]].{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Medieval scholars also agreed that the Székelys had already been present in the [[Carpathian Basin]] before the Hungarians (or [[Magyars]]) conquered the territory.{{sfn|Pop|1996|p=162}} The early 13th-century ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' was the first to mention that the Székelys "were previously the peoples"&lt;ref name=Anonymus_ch50_p109&gt;''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 50.), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]].{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} According to the same source, the Székelys "gave their sons as hostages along with diverse gifts"&lt;ref name=Anonymus_ch50_p109/&gt; to the Hungarian chieftain, Ősbő, at the [[Körös River]] before joining his campaign against [[Menumorut]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Pop|1996|pp=108-109}}

[[Simon of Kéza]] stated that the Székelys were "remnants of the Huns" who "remained on the [[field of Csigla]]"&lt;ref name=Simon_of_Keza_ch21_p71&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 21.), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; after the fall of the Hunnic Empire.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}}{{sfn|Pop|1996|p=162}} In contrast with the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', Kéza said, the Székelys joined the Hungarians "on the borders of [[Kievan Rus'|Ruthenia]]"&lt;ref name=Simon_of_Keza_ch21_p71/&gt; when the Hungarians crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=23}} All subsequent Hungarian chronicles repeated Kéza's story and most scholars accepted the identification of the Székelys with the Huns for centuries.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}}{{sfn|Kordé|1993|pp=22-23}} The theory was also mentioned in [[István Werbőczy]]'s ''[[Tripartitum]]'', which was published several times in [[Székely Land]] after 1517.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} As a consequence, it cannot be decided whether the Székelys' well-documented own tradition of their Hunnic origin is a genuine part of their folklore, or it is only an adoption of a medieval scholarly fabrication.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Most Székelys still regard themselves as descendants of the Huns, but the majority of modern scholars refute this theory.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}

{{Quote|There are ... in [[Transylvania]], privileged nobles called ''Scythuli'', originating from the [[Scythians|Scythian people]] when they first came to Pannonia, whom we call by a corrupt name: ''Székely''. They enjoy quite different laws and customs; they are very skilled in warfare; and divide up and distribute inheritances and offices among themselves by tribes and kindreds and the lineages of kindreds, in the manner of the ancients.|''[[Tripartitum]]''&lt;ref name='Werbőczy_381'&gt;''Stephen Werbőczy: The Customary Law of the Renowned Kingdom of Hungary in Three Parts (1517)'' (3.4.), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Modern scholarship ==

The linguist Pál Hunfalvy was the first scholar to question the association of the Székelys with the Huns in the 1870s.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}} However, scholars have not reached a consensus about the origin of the Székelys.{{sfn|Pop|1996|p=162}} The modern theories can be divided into three major groups.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}}

=== Late Avars ===

{{See also|Pannonian Avars}}

Medieval chronicles evidence that the Székelys were regarded as a distinct ethnic group which had settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=1}} Some scholars (especially [[Gyula László]] and [[Pál Engel]]) say that the Székelys are the direct descendants of the "[[Late Avar]]" population of the region.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=178}}{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=25}} The "Late Avar" period started around 700 A.D., and lasted for about a century.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=92}} Artifacts (mostly [[buckle]]s and strap ends) decorated with floral patterns and [[griffin]]s are the most featured items of the [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblages]] for this period.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=92}} László and Engel attribute this new [[archaeological horizon]] to a group of [[Onogurs]] who had fled from the [[Pontic steppes]] to the West after the [[Khazars]] destroyed their empire around 680.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=3}} According to most scholars, the Onogurs spoke a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]],{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=178}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=3, 6}} but László proposed that they were a Hungarian-speaking group.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=6}} A charter of [[Louis the German]], [[King of East Francia]], mentioned the ''Wangariorum marcas'' ("Wangars' frontier") around 860, implying that Onogurs still lived in the westernmost region of the Carpathian Basin in the second half of the 9th century.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=6, 387}} Most scholars refute the association of the Székelys with the "Late Avars" or Onogurs.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|pp=25-26}}

=== Hungarian border guards ===

The Székelys speak the [[Hungarian language]] "without any trace of a Turkic [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]]", indicating that they did not have a [[language shift]] during their history, according to scholars, who propose that the Székelys were descended from privileged Hungarian groups.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=116}}{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=13}} Most place names in Székely Land are of Hungarian origin, showing that the Székelys spoke Hungarian when they settled in the region.{{sfn|Benkő|Szabó T.|1985|p=26}} The three main Hungarian dialects of Székely Land are closely connected to the Hungarian variants spoken along the western and southwestern borders of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary.{{sfn|Benkő|Szabó T.|1985|p=26}} The dialect of the Székelys of [[Marosszék]] is similar to the dialects spoken by the Hungarian communities near [[Pressburg]] (now Bratislava in Slovakia) and in southern [[Burgenland]].{{sfn|Benkő|Szabó T.|1985|p=25}} The Hungarian variant of [[Udvarhelyszék]] is closely related to the tongue of the Hungarians in [[Baranya County (former)|Baranya County]] and [[Slavonia]].{{sfn|Benkő|Szabó T.|1985|p=25}} The easternmost Székely communities' dialect is connected to the Hungarian variant of Burgenland.{{sfn|Benkő|Szabó T.|1985|p=25}}

=== Associated people ===

According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, the Székelys had originally been a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] who joined the Magyars in the [[Pontic steppes]] (to the east of the Carpathian Basin).{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Kordé|1993|p=29}} Written sources evidence, the Székelys were regarded a separate ethnic group in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Kordé|1993|p=29}} Simon of Kéza wrote of the "Hungarian and Székely forces"&lt;ref&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 71.), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Andrew II of Hungary]]; a charter of William, [[Bishop of Transylvania]], distinguished the Hungarians and Székelys in 1213.{{sfn|Kordé|1993|p=29}} The Székelys were listed along with other peoples in the Middle Ages, also indicating that they were considered an ethnic group.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=7}} In 1250, a royal charter enumerated the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]], [[Vlachs]], Székelys and [[Pechenegs]] when mentioning a campaign against Bulgaria; the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles wrote of Székelys and Pechenegs participating in the [[Battle of Olšava]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=7}}

== Alternative theories ==
[[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] scholar Petrus Ransanus was the first to propose an alternative theory about the origin of the Székelys.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Based on the Latin ''Siculus'' form of their [[ethnonym]], he said that Sicilian soldiers who allegedly fought in the army in Attila the Hun were the Székelys' ancestors.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Jesuit friar Ferenc Fasching stated that the Székelys were descended from a [[Jasz people|Jasz]] group whom [[Béla IV of Hungary]] had supposedly settled in Transylvania.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} [[Nicolae Iorga]] proposed that the Székelys were originally Romanians, but he abandoned this theory.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=13}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to prehistoric technology.

'''[[Prehistoric technology]]''' – [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records; it is also the record itself. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] (meaning "before history"), including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, cut food, and bury their dead.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Nature of prehistoric technology ==
{{Human timeline}}
Prehistoric technology can be described as:
* [[Prehistoric]] – "before we had written records," from the Latin word for "before," præ. Prehistory is the span of time before recorded history, that is, before the invention of writing systems.
* [[Technology]] – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function.

== Old World prehistoric technology ==
* [[Three-age system]] – in archaeology and physical anthropology, the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, each named after the main material used in its respective tool-making technologies: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.
* Beginning of prehistoric technology – the earliest technology began (2.5 million years) before recorded history, that is, at the beginning of the Stone Age.
* Latest prehistoric technology – the level of technology reached before true writing was introduced differed by region (and usually included proto-writing)...
** Latest prehistoric technology in the Near East – cultures in the Near East achieved the development of writing first, during their Bronze Age.
** Latest prehistoric technology in the rest of the Old World: Europe, India, and China reached Iron Age technological development before the introduction of writing there.

=== Stone Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Stone Age]] – broad prehistoric period, lasting roughly 2.5 million years, during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period began with hominids and ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.

==== Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Paleolithic]] – prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory.

==== Lower Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Lower Paleolithic]] – earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million years]] ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominids]] appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].
** [[Stone tools|Stone tool use]] – early human (hominid) use of stone tool technology, such as the [[hand axe]], was [[Tool use by animals|similar to that of primates]], which is found to be limited to the intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years. Ancestors of homo sapiens (modern man) used stone tools as follows:

==== Middle Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Middle Paleolithic]] period – in Europe and the Near East during which the [[Neanderthal]]s lived (c. 300,000–28,000 years ago). Their technology is mainly the [[Mousterian]].  The earliest evidence ([[Mungo Man]]) of settlement in [[Australia]] dates [[History of Australia before 1901|to around 55,000 years ago]] when modern humans likely crossed from Asia by island-hopping.  The [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] exhibit the earliest traces of human life in [[India]], some of which are approximately 30,000 years old.

==== Mesolithic technology ====
* Mesolithic – the transitional period between the Paleolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, beginning with the [[Holocene]] warm period around 11,660 [[Before Present|BP]] and ending with the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic]] introduction of farming, the date of which varied in each geographical region.  Adaptation was required during this period due to climate changes that affected environment and the types of available food.
** Stone tool changes – small stone tools called [[Microlith]]s, including small [[Bladelet (archaeology)|bladelets]] and [[microburin]]s, emerged during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson.

==== Neolithic Revolution ====
* [[Neolithic Revolution]] – first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] nomadic life to an [[agriculture]] existence.  It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years [[Before Present|BP]] (8,000–5,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]). The earliest known evidence exists in the tropical and subtropical areas of [[Southwest Asia|southwestern]]/[[southern Asia]], [[North Africa|northern]]/[[central Africa]] and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;Gupta, Anil.(October 2010).

* [[Iron Age]] – age characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel, which coincided with other changes in society, including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles.
** Tools – best tools and weapons were made from steel.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

=== End of prehistory and the beginning of history ===
* Development of true writing systems – in the Old World, true writing systems developed from [[neolithic]] writing in the [[Early Bronze Age]] ([[4th millennium BC]]).  The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic (pre-[[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]) writing and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest true writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]].

====Transition from proto-writing to true writing====
* General developmental stages leading from proto-writing to true writing:
** ''Picture writing system'': glyphs directly represent objects and ideas or objective and ideational situations. In connection with this the following substages may be distinguished:
**# The mnemonic: glyphs primarily a reminder;
**# The pictographic (pictography): glyphs represent directly an object or an objective situation such as (A) chronological, (B) notices, (C) communications, (D) totems, titles, and names, (E) religious, (F) customs, (G) historical, and (H) biographical;
**# The ideographic (ideography): glyphs represent directly an idea or an ideational situation.
** ''Transitional system'': glyphs refer not only to the object or idea which it represents but to its name as well.
** ''Phonetic system'': glyphs refer to sounds or spoken symbols irrespective of their meanings. This resolves itself into the following substages:
**# The verbal: glyph ([[logogram]]) represents a whole word;
**# The syllabic: glyph represent a syllable;
**# The alphabetic: glyph represent an elementary sound.

Along with [[Carlo Ginzburg]], [[Marcello Flores]], [[Sergio Luzzatto]], [[Claudio Pavone]], [[Enzo Traverso]], etc., he  signed a call in January 2002 against a law project, presented by Justice Minister [[Clemente Mastella]], which was to specifically penalize [[Holocaust denial]]. They argued that Italy's legislation was sufficient to cope with such acts. The amended law project finally restricted itself to reinforcing sentences concerning [[hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article1826 Sous la pression des historiens, l’Italie renonce à pénaliser le négationnisme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201324/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article1826 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH), February 1, 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Cambodia}}

The '''People's Republic of Kampuchea''' ('''PRK'''; {{lang-km|សាធារណរដ្ឋប្រជាមានិតកម្ពុជា}}, {{lang|km-Latn|Sathéaranakrâth Pracheameanit Kâmpŭchéa}}; {{lang-fr|République populaire du Kampuchéa}}) was founded in [[Cambodia]] by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|Salvation Front]], a group of Cambodian [[Communism|communists]] dissatisfied with the [[Khmer Rouge]] after the [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|overthrow]] of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], [[Pol Pot]]'s government. Brought about by an invasion from the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], which routed the Khmer Rouge armies, it had Vietnam and the [[Soviet Union]] as its main allies.

The PRK failed to secure [[United Nations]] endorsement due to the diplomatic intervention of the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[ASEAN]] countries. The Cambodian seat at the United Nations was held by the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], which was the Khmer Rouge in coalition with two non-communist guerrilla factions. However, the PRK was considered the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Cambodia between 1979 and 1993, albeit with limited international recognition.

Beginning May 1989, the PRK restored the name Cambodia by renaming the country '''State of Cambodia''' ('''SOC''') ({{lang-km|រដ្ឋកម្ពុជា}}, {{Lang|km-Latn|Rath Kâmpŭchéa}}) during the last four years of its existence in an attempt to attract international sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leifer, ''Dictionary of the modern politics of South-East Asia''&lt;/ref&gt; However, it retained most of its leadership and one-party structure while undergoing a transition and eventually giving way to the restoration of the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]]. The PRK/SOC existed as a [[communist state]] from 1979 until 1991, the year in which the ruling single party abandoned its [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology.

Under Vietnamese control, the PRK was established in the wake of the total destruction of the country's institutions, infrastructure and intelligentsia wreaked by Khmer Rouge rule.&lt;ref name="peou"&gt;Sorpong Peou, ''Intervention &amp; change in Cambodia; Towards Democracy?'', {{ISBN|0-312-22717-5}} {{ISBN|978-0312227173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The PRK was established in January 1979 as a result of a process that began with Khmer Rouge belligerence.

===Khmer Rouge directs its hostility against Vietnam===
Initially, communist North Vietnam was a strong ally of the Khmer Rouge while it was fighting against [[Lon Nol]]'s [[Khmer Republic]] during the 1970–1975 civil war. Only after the Khmer Rouge took power things began to turn sour, when on 1 May 1975 (the day after [[Fall of Saigon|Saigon fell]]), Khmer Rouge soldiers raided the islands of [[Phu Quoc]] and [[Tho Chau]], killing more than five hundred Vietnamese civilians; following the attack, the islands were swiftly recaptured by Hanoi. Even then, the first reactions of the Vietnamese were ambiguous, and it took Vietnam a long time to react with force, for the first impulse was to arrange matters "within the family sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/03_pole_regional/pedago/img/l8/interview.pdf |title=S21 : la machine de mort khmère rouge |access-date=25 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724200552/http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/03_pole_regional/pedago/img/l8/interview.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massacres of ethnic Vietnamese and of their sympathisers, as well as destruction of Vietnamese Catholic churches,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Milton Osborne, ''Sihanouk, Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness.'' Silkworm 1994&lt;/ref&gt; by the Khmer Rouge took place sporadically in Cambodia under the [[Democratic Kampuchea]] regime, especially in the Eastern Zone after May 1978. By early 1978 the Vietnamese leadership decided to support internal resistance to Pol Pot and the Eastern Zone of Cambodia became a focus of insurrection. In the meantime, as 1978 wore on, Khmer Rouge bellicosity in the border areas surpassed Hanoi's threshold of tolerance. War hysteria against Vietnam reached bizarre levels within Democratic Kampuchea as Pol Pot tried to distract attention from bloody inner purges.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, ''The Pol Pot Regime'', 2d ed. Silkworm.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1978, on the eve of [[So Phim]]'s Eastern Zone uprising, Radio Phnom Penh declared that if each Cambodian soldier killed thirty Vietnamese, only 2 million troops would be needed to eliminate the entire Vietnamese population of 50 million. It appears that the leadership in Phnom Penh was seized with immense territorial ambitions, i.e., to recover [[Kampuchea Krom]], the [[Mekong|Mekong Delta]] region which they regarded as Khmer territory.
In November,  pro-Vietnamese Khmer Rouge leader [[Vorn Vet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/32.htm |title=An Elusive Party |access-date=2 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015221944/http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/32.htm |archive-date=15 October 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; led an unsuccessful [[coup d'état]] and was subsequently arrested, tortured and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://khmernews.wordpress.com/2007/08/03/five-kr-ministers-tortured-at-tuol-sleng-prison-and-killed-at-boeng-cheung-aek/ |title=Khmernews - Five KR Ministers Tortured At Tuol Sleng Prison And Killed At Boeng Cheung Aek |access-date=2 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116151820/http://khmernews.wordpress.com/2007/08/03/five-kr-ministers-tortured-at-tuol-sleng-prison-and-killed-at-boeng-cheung-aek/ |archive-date=16 January 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents escalated along all of Cambodia's borders. There were now tens of thousands of Cambodian and Vietnamese exiles on Vietnamese territory, and even so Hanoi's response was half-hearted.

===Salvation Front===
{{Main|Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation}}
The Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (KUFNS or FUNSK) was an organisation that would be pivotal in overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and establishing the PRK/SOC state. The Salvation Front was a heterogeneous group of communist and non-communist exiles determined to fight against Pol Pot and rebuild Cambodia. Led by [[Heng Samrin]] and [[Pen Sovann]], both Khmer Rouge [[defector]]s,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; in a zone liberated from the Khmer Rouge after the purge of the Eastern Zone, the front's foundation was announced by [[Radio Hanoi]] on 3 December 1978. Of the Salvation Front's fourteen central committee members, the top two leaders —Heng Samrin, president, and [[Joran Pollie]], vice-president— had been "former" [[Kampuchean Communist Party]] (KCP) officials; others were former [[Khmer Issarak]] as well as "[[Viet Minh#The 'Khmer Viet Minh'|Khmer Viet Minh]]"&lt;ref&gt;The 3,000 to 5,000 Cambodian communist cadres who had repatriated to North Vietnam after the [[1954 Geneva Conference]]; apparently this was a derogatory term used by Sihanouk. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090306190527/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html LOC Appendix B])&lt;/ref&gt; members who had lived in exile in Vietnam. [[Ros Samay]], secretary general of the KUFNS, was a former KCP "staff assistant" in a military unit.

The government of Democratic Kampuchea lost no time in denouncing the KUFNS, as "a Vietnamese political organisation with a Khmer name," because several of its key members had been affiliated with the KCP.&lt;ref name="frings"&gt;Frings, K. Viviane, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/312846 Rewriting Cambodian History to 'Adapt' It to a New Political Context: The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party's Historiography (1979-1991)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110158/https://www.jstor.org/stable/312846 |date=30 August 2018 }}'' in Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 31, No. 4. (Oct. 1997), pp. 807-846.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being dependent on Vietnamese protection and the backing of the Soviet Union behind the scenes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/ftinterface?content=a791875117&amp;rt=0&amp;format=pdf People's Daily commentator on Vietnam-Kampuchea border conflict - Journal of Contemporary Asia, 1752-7554, Volume 8, Issue 3, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt; the KUFNS had an immediate success among exiled Cambodians. This organisation provided a much-needed rallying point for Cambodian leftists opposed to Khmer Rouge rule, channelling efforts towards positive action instead of empty denunciations of the genocidal regime. The KUFNS provided as well a framework of legitimacy for the ensuing invasion of Democratic Kampuchea by Vietnam and the subsequent establishment of a pro-Hanoi regime in Phnom Penh.

===Vietnamese invasion===
{{main|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}
Vietnamese policymakers finally opted for a military solution and, on 22 December 1978, Vietnam launched its offensive with the intent of overthrowing [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. An invasion force of 120,000, consisting of combined armour and infantry units with strong artillery support, drove west into the level countryside of Cambodia's southeastern provinces. After a seventeen-day blitzkrieg, Phnom Penh fell to the advancing Vietnamese on 7 January 1979. The retreating [[Democratic Kampuchea#Armed Forces of Democratic Kampuchea|Armed Forces of Democratic Kampuchea]] (RAK) and Khmer Rouge cadres burned rice granaries, which, along with other causes, provoked a severe famine all over Cambodia beginning in the last half of 1979 and which lasted until mid-1980.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime, 2d ed. Silkworm.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1979, the Salvation Front's central committee proclaimed a set of "immediate policies" to be applied in the areas [[Liberty|liberated]] from the Khmer Rouge. First the communal kitchens were abolished and some [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Buddhist monks]] would be brought to every community to reassure the people.&lt;ref name="Michael Vickery 2000"&gt;Michael Vickery, ''Cambodia 1975-1982'',  Silkworm Books 2000, {{ISBN|978-974-7100-81-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of these policies was to establish "people's self-management committees" in all localities. These committees would form the basic administrative structure for the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Council]] (KPRC), decreed on 8 January 1979, as the central administrative body for the PRK. The KPRC served as the ruling body of the Heng Samrin regime until 27 June 1981, when a new Constitution required that it be replaced by a newly elected Council of Ministers. [[Pen Sovann]] became the new prime minister. He was assisted by three deputy prime ministers – Hun Sen, Chan Sy, and Chea Soth.

==Establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea (1979–1989)==
[[File:Flag of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.svg|thumb|left|180px|People's Republic of Kampuchea flag (1979–1989)]]

On 10 January 1979, the DK army had been routed and the Vietnamese troops had captured the capital Phnom Penh. The KPRC proclaimed that the new official name of Cambodia was the '''People's Republic of Kampuchea''' (PRK). The new administration was a [[Eastern Bloc|pro-Soviet]] government supported by a substantial Vietnamese military force and civilian advisory effort.

Despite the Vietnam-sponsored invasion and control, and the loss of independence that went along with it,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Mark Weisburd, ''Use of force: The Practice of States Since World War II''&lt;/ref&gt; the new order was welcomed by almost the entire Cambodian population due to the Khmer Rouge brutality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/index/789073072.pdf Religion in Kampuchea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was some plundering of the almost empty capital of Phnom Penh by Vietnamese forces, who carried the goods on trucks back to Vietnam. This unfortunate behaviour would in time contribute to create a negative image of the invaders.&lt;ref name="Soizick Crochet 1997"&gt;Soizick Crochet, ''Le Cambodge'', Karthala, Paris 1997, {{ISBN|2-86537-722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heng Samrin was named head of state of the PRK, and other Khmer [[communists]] that had formed the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]], like [[Chan Sy]] and [[Hun Sen]], were prominent from the start.

As events in the 1980s progressed, the main preoccupations of the new regime would be survival, restoring the economy, and combating the Khmer Rouge insurgency by military and political means.

The PRK was a communist state. It continued the socialist revolution that had been started by DK, but abandoning the Khmer Rouge's radical policies and channelling the efforts of building [[socialism]] through more pragmatic channels in line with the policies marked by the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Comecon]]. Very soon it would be one of the six countries regarded as socialist, and not just developing, by the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislaw Gomulka, Yong-Chool Ha &amp; Cae-One Kim, ''Economic reforms in the socialist world''&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding ethnic minorities, the People's Republic of Kampuchea was committed to respect Cambodia's national diversity, which brought some welcome relief to the ethnic [[Thai people|Thai]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] and the "[[Khmer Loeu|montagnards]]" of the northeast. The [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese ethnic minority]], however, perceived as an "arm of the hegemonists" continued to be oppressed, even though many of its members, mainly among the trader community, had endured great suffering under the Khmer Rouge. The speaking of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] was severely restricted, in much the same manner as under Pol Pot.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Heder &amp; Judy Ledgerwood, ''Propaganda, Politics, and Violence in Cambodia: Democratic Transition Under United Nations Peace-Keeping''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of cultural and religious life===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0722-019, Bernau, Gaststudenten der Gewerkschaftshochschule.jpg|thumb|215px|PRK students Meak Chanthan and Dima Yim (3d from left and standing) at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] ([[East Germany]]) in 1986.]]
One of the main official acts of the PRK was a partial restoration of [[Buddhism]] as the state religion of Cambodia and temples were gradually reopened to accommodate the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monks]] and to resume a certain measure of traditional religious life. In September 1979 seven old monks were officially reordained at Wat Unnalom in Phnom Penh and these monks gradually reestablished the Cambodian ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' between 1979 and 1981. They began rebuilding the community of monks in Phnom Penh and later in the provinces, reordaining prestigious monks who had been formerly senior monks. They were not allowed, however, to ordain young novices. Repair works were started in about 700 [[Buddhist temple]]s and monasteries, of the roughly 3,600 that had been destroyed or badly damaged by the Khmer Rouge. By mid-1980 traditional [[Buddhist festival]]s began to be celebrated.&lt;ref name="keyes"&gt;Charles F. Keyes, Laurel Kendall &amp; [[Helen Hardacre]], ''Asian visions of authority'', Joint Committee on Southeast Asia&lt;/ref&gt;

The DK had exterminated many Cambodian intellectuals, which was a difficult obstacle for Cambodia's reconstruction, when local leaders and experts were most needed. Among the surviving educated urban Cambodians who could have helped the struggling country to its feet, many opted to flee the Socialist state and flocked to the refugee camps to emigrate to the West.&lt;ref name="Michael Vickery 2000"/&gt;

The PRK's administration was technically unequipped and the state bureaucracy that had been destroyed by the Khmer Rouge was rebuilt slowly. The PRK managed to reopen the ''Ecole de formation des cadres administratifs et judiciels'', where in 1982 and 1986 training programmes were conducted.&lt;ref name="peou" /&gt; To rebuild the nation's intelligentsia, a number of Cambodians were sent to Eastern Bloc countries to study during the PRK's reconstruction period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margaret Slocomb, ''The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot'' {{ISBN|978-974-9575-34-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its efforts in the educational field, the PRK/SOC would struggle with the general lack of education and skills of Cambodian party cadres, bureaucrats and technicians throughout its existence.

Cambodian cultural life began also slowly to be rebuilt under the PRK. Movie houses in Phnom Penh were re-opened, screening at first films from [[Cinema of Vietnam|Vietnam]], the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], Eastern European socialist countries and [[Bollywood|Hindi movies]] from [[India]]. Certain films that did not fit with the pro-Soviet designs of the PRK, such as [[Hong Kong action cinema]], were banned in Cambodia at that time.

The domestic film industry had suffered a severe blow, for a large number of Cambodian filmmakers and actors from the 1960s and 1970s had been killed by the Khmer Rouge or had fled the country. Negatives and prints of many films had been destroyed, stolen, or missing and the films that did survive were in a poor state of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060118224010/http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1327.html Cambodia Cultural Profile, Visiting Arts and the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts of Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia's film industry began a slow comeback starting with ''[[My Mother is Arb|Kon Aeuy Madai Ahp]]'' ({{lang-km|កូនអើយ ម្តាយអាប}}), also known as ''Krasue mother'', a [[horror film|horror movie]] based on [[Khmer folklore]] about [[Ap (ghost)|''Ahp'']], a popular local [[ghost]] which has the distinction of being the first movie made in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge era.
The restoration of cultural life during the PRK was only partial though; there were socialist-minded restrictions hampering creativity that would only be lifted towards the end of the 1980s under the SOC.&lt;ref name="Soizick Crochet 1997"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
The PRK relied heavily on [[propaganda]] to motivate Cambodians for reconstruction, to promote unity and to establish its rule. Large billboards were displayed with patriotic slogans and party members taught the eleven points of the [[Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation]] (FUNSK) to assembled adults.

Survivors of Democratic Kampuchea rule lived in fear and uncertainty, lest the feared Khmer Rouge returned. Most Cambodians were psychologically affected and declared emphatically that they would not be able to survive another DK regime. The PRK government strongly encouraged such sentiments, for much of its legitimacy lay in having liberated Cambodia from [[Pol Pot]]'s yoke. As a consequence, gruesome displays of skulls and bones, as well as photographs and paintings of Khmer Rouge atrocities, were set up and used as a pro-government propaganda tool. The most important museum about the Khmer Rouge era was located at the [[Tuol Sleng]] DK prison and was named "Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes", now [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]].

The annual [[Day of Remembrance (Cambodia)|Day of Remembrance]], also known as "Day of Hatred" against the Khmer Rouge was instituted as part of the PRK's propaganda. Among the slogans chanted on the Day of Remembrance, one of the most often repeated was "We must absolutely prevent the return of the former black darkness" in Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Laban Hinton, ''Annihilating difference: The Anthropology of Genocide'' {{ISBN|0-520-23029-9}} {{ISBN|978-0520230293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction hampered===
At least 600,000 Cambodians had been displaced during the Pol Pot era when cities had been emptied. After the Vietnamese invasion freed them, most Cambodians who had been forcefully resettled elsewhere in the countryside returned to the cities or to their original rural homesteads. Since families had been disrupted and separated, many Cambodians freed from their communes wandered over the country searching for family members and friends.

Following the invasion there were severe famine conditions in the country, with some estimates reaching 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB4.1A.GIF Statistics of Cambodian Democide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916081444/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB4.1A.GIF |date=16 September 2012 }} Rummel estimates over one million from all causes; Etcheson 500,000 by 1981 from famine alone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional farming had been so severely interfered with that it took time to be established anew. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge commune system had completely collapsed, following which there were no jobs and not enough food to eat. It took six months to begin the gradual repopulation of Phnom Penh, as electricity, water and sewage systems were reestablished and street repair and removal of garbage were undertaken.&lt;ref name="Soizick Crochet 1997"/&gt;

The destruction of Cambodian social institutions during the "Year Zero" period (1975&amp;ndash;1979) had been thorough. It had left the PRK with little to start with, for there were no police, no schools, no books, no hospitals, no post and telecommunications, no legal system and no broadcasting networks, either for television or radio, whether state-owned or private.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard A. Postiglione &amp; Jason Tan, ''Going to school in East Asia''&lt;/ref&gt;

To compound the situation for Cambodia, the Western nations, China and the ASEAN states refused to provide reconstruction assistance directly to the new regime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;David P. Chandler, ''A history of Cambodia'', Westview Press; Allen &amp; Unwin, Boulder, Sydney, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to US and China's opposition to the international recognition of the PRK, the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|United Nations relief and rehabilitation agencies]] were not allowed to operate within Cambodia by the [[United Nations System|UN authorities]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The little development help that was available came only from the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations; among these only the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] would refuse assistance to the PRK.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2643712 JSTOR: Kampuchea in 1981: Fragile Stalemate]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugee situation===
[[File:Cambodia anti-PRK border camps.png|thumb|Border camps hostile to the PRK; 1979-1984]]
Faced with a destroyed country and lack of international aid, large numbers of distraught Cambodians flocked to the Thai border in the years that followed. There, international help provided by different international aid organisations, many of them backed by the [[United States]], was available.&lt;ref name="dccam.org" /&gt; At one point, more than 500,000 Cambodians were living along the Thai-Cambodian border and more than 100,000 in holding centres inside Thailand.  More than [[United States dollar|$]]400 million was provided between 1979 and 1982, of which the United States, as part of its [[Cold War]] political strategy against communist Vietnam, contributed nearly $100 million. In 1982, the US government had initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only. This amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988. In late 1988, the United States pared back [[Central Intelligence Agency]] funding to $8 million, following reports that $3.5 million had been diverted by the Thai military. At the same time, the Reagan Administration gave new flexibility to the funds, permitting the NCR to purchase US-made weapons in [[Singapore]] and other regional markets. In 1985, the United States established a separate, overt aid program to the non-communist resistance which came to be known as the Solarz Fund after one of its chief sponsors, [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Stephen Solarz]]. The overt aid program channelled about $5 million per year to the non-communist resistance through [[USAID]].&lt;ref&gt;REFUGEE WARRIORS AT THE THAI-CAMBODIAN BORDER by Cortland Robinson {{Cite web |url=http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Refugee-Warriors-on-the-Thai-Cambodian-Border.pdf |title={title} |access-date=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135121/http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Refugee-Warriors-on-the-Thai-Cambodian-Border.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a sizeable portion of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces regrouped and received a continuous and abundant supply of military equipment from China, channelled across [[Thailand]] with the co-operation of the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://gsp.yale.edu/thailands-response-cambodian-genocide |title=Puangthong Rungswasdisab, ''Thailand's Response to the Cambodian Genocide'' |access-date=24 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031105453/https://gsp.yale.edu/thailands-response-cambodian-genocide |archive-date=31 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other armed factions, the Khmer Rouge launched a relentless military campaign against the newly established People's Republic of Kampuchea state from the refugee camps and from hidden military outposts along the Thai border. Even though the Khmer Rouge was dominant, the non-communist resistance included a number of groups which had formerly been fighting against the Khmer Rouge after 1975. These groups included [[Lon Nol]]-era soldiers —-coalesced in 1979-80 to form the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces]] (KPNLAF)— which pledged loyalty to former Prime Minister [[Son Sann]], and [[Moulinaka]] (Mouvement pour la Libération Nationale du Kampuchea), loyal to [[Prince Norodom Sihanouk]]. In 1979, Son Sann formed the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] (KPNLF) to lead the political struggle for Cambodia's independence.  Prince Sihanouk formed his own organisation, [[FUNCINPEC]], and its military arm, the [[Armée Nationale Sihanoukienne]] (ANS) in 1981. Fraught with both internal and mutual discord, the non-communist groups opposing the PRK, were never very effective, so that all through the civil war against the [[KPRAF]]/[[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces|CPAF]] the only seriously organised fighting force against the state was the former Khmer Rouge militia, ironically labelled as the "[[Resistance movement|Resistance]]". This armed faction would wreak much havoc in Cambodia even after the restoration of the monarchy, well into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Michael Vickery 2000"/&gt;

This protracted civil war would bleed Cambodia's energies throughout the 1980s. Vietnam's occupation army of as many as 200,000 troops controlled the major population centres and most of the countryside from 1979 to September 1989, but Heng Samrin's regime's 30,000 KPRAF troops were plagued by poor morale and widespread desertion owing to low pay and poverty. Men were directly needed in their family farms as they were being rebuilt and there was much work to do.

===Civil war===
[[File:Cambodia-mountainsW5.JPG|thumb|330px|Mountains along the Cambodian-Thai Border north of the road between [[Sisophon]] and [[Aranyaprathet]]. One of the areas where Khmer Rouge insurgents hid at the time of the [[K5 Plan]].]]
Disoriented Cambodian refugees from refugee camps in [[Aranyaprathet]], Thailand, were forcefully sent back across the border beginning in 1980 and many of them ended up in areas under Khmer Rouge control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The process was organised by pro-Democratic Kampuchea cadres, but it was presented to the press as "voluntary". The undermining of the People's Republic of Kampuchea was supported by the United States government, who took a dim view of the existing pro-Vietnamese Cambodian regime, as well as countries like [[Malaysia]], Thailand and Singapore, whose representative exhorted the dispirited refugees to "go back and fight."&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Rowley, ''Red Brotherhood at War''&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war followed a [[wet season]]/[[dry season]] rhythm after 1980. The heavily armed Vietnamese forces conducted offensive operations during the dry seasons, and the Chinese-backed insurgency held the initiative during the rainy seasons. In 1982, Vietnam launched a major offensive against the main Khmer Rouge base at [[Phnom Malai]] in the [[Cardamom Mountains]]. But this operation met with little success.

In the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|1984&amp;ndash;85 dry season offensive]], the Vietnamese again attacked base camps of all three anti-PRK groups. This time the Vietnamese succeeded in eliminating the Khmer Rouge camps in Cambodia and drove the insurgents into neighbouring Thailand.
Before retreating the Khmer Rouge laid down numerous [[landmine]]s and cut down giant trees to block roads in the thick jungle along the Thai-Cambodian border causing heavy [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Vietnamese concentrated on consolidating their gains through the [[K5 Plan]], an extravagant and labour-intensive attempt to seal guerrilla infiltration routes into the country by means of trenches, wire fences, and [[minefield]]s along virtually the entire Thai-Cambodian border.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The K5 border defence project, designed by Vietnamese general [[Lê Đức Anh]], commander of the Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, irritated Cambodian farmers and ended up being psychologically counterproductive for the PRK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/mur.htm Esmeralda Luciolli, ''Le mur de bambou, ou le Cambodge après Pol Pot.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609184010/http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/mur.htm |date=9 June 2011 }} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large swathes of formerly inaccessible [[tropical forest]]s were destroyed, leaving a negative [[ecological]] legacy.

Despite the help of the Vietnamese Army, as well as of Soviet, [[Cuba]]n and Vietnamese advisers, Heng Samrin had only limited success in establishing the PRK regime in the face of the ongoing civil war. Security in some rural areas was tenuous, and major transportation routes were subject to interdiction by sporadic attacks. The presence of Vietnamese throughout the country and their intrusion into Cambodian life added fuel to the traditional Cambodian anti-Vietnamese sentiment.

In 1986, Hanoi claimed to have begun withdrawing part of its occupation forces. At the same time, Vietnam continued efforts to strengthen its client regime, the PRK, and its military arm, the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (KPRAF). These withdrawals continued over the next two years, although actual numbers were difficult to verify. Vietnam's proposal to withdraw its remaining occupation forces in 1989&amp;ndash;90&amp;mdash;one of the repercussions of the dismemberment of the Soviet bloc&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as well as the result of the US and Chinese pressure&amp;mdash;forced the PRK to begin economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to ensure future political dominance. In April 1989, Hanoi and Phnom Penh announced that final withdrawal would take place by the end of September the same year.

On 29–30 April 1989, the National Assembly of the PRK, presided by a smiling Hun Sen, held an extraordinary meeting in order to make some, at first, largely cosmetic constitutional changes. The name of "People's Republic of Kampuchea" was officially changed to '''State of Cambodia''' ('''SOC''')—a name that had been previously used right after the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]—reintroducing the blue colour in the Cambodian flag and other state symbols, although the [[Royal Arms of Cambodia#History|Coat of arms]] remained almost the same. The National Anthem and the military symbols were also changed. The KPRAF armed forces were renamed the "Cambodian People's Armed Forces" (CPAF). Capital punishment was officially abolished and [[Buddhism]], which had been partially reestablished by the PRK in 1979, was fully reintroduced as the national religion, by which the restriction was lifted on the [[Bhikkhu|ordination of men]] under 50 years old and [[Buddhist chant|Buddhist traditional chanting]] was resumed in the media. Following the complete normalisation of traditional religious life, Buddhism became extremely popular in Cambodia, experiencing a widespread revival.

Intending to liberalise Cambodia's economy, a set of laws on "Personal Ownership" and "Free Market Orientation" was passed as well. The new Constitution stated that Cambodia was a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] state. The ruling party also announced that there would be negotiations with the groups of the opposition.&lt;ref name="dccam.org"&gt;Cambodia in the 1980s {{Cite web |url=http://www.dccam.org/Projects/Document_Projects/Cambodia_Social_Studies_Textbook.htm |title={title} |access-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908115105/http://www.dccam.org/Projects/Document_Projects/Cambodia_Social_Studies_Textbook.htm |archive-date=8 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Cambodia lived through a time of dramatic transitions triggered by the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. There was a reduction in Soviet aid to Vietnam which culminated in the withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupying forces. The last Vietnamese troops were said to have left Cambodia on 26 September 1989 but probably they did not leave until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ichiban1.org/html/history/history_map.htm |title=History map |access-date=16 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420080612/http://ichiban1.org/html/history/history_map.htm |archive-date=20 April 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Vietnamese civilians also returned to Vietnam in the months that followed, lacking confidence in the ability of the PRK's new avatar to control the situation after the Vietnamese military had left.

Despite the quite radical changes announced by Hun Sen, the SOC state stood firm when it came to the one party rule issue. The leadership structure and the executive remained the same as under the PRK, with the party firmly in control as the supreme authority. Accordingly, the SOC was unable to restore Cambodia's monarchical tradition. Although the SOC reestablished the prominence of monarchical symbols, like the grand palace in Phnom Penh, that was as far as it would go for the time-being, especially since [[Norodom Sihanouk]] had steadfastly associated himself with the CGDK, the opposition coalition against the PRK that included the Khmer Rouge. In mid-1991, however, succumbing to a number of pressures both within and outside of the country, the government of the State of Cambodia signed an agreement that recognised Prince Norodom Sihanouk as head of state. By late 1991 Sihanouk made an official visit to the SOC and both Hun Sen and Chea Sim took a leading role in the welcoming ceremony.&lt;ref name="keyes" /&gt;

Still, fissures appeared on the monolithic structure that the State of Cambodia was trying to preserve. Revolutionary idealism was replaced by practical cynicism, so that corruption increased. Cambodian state resources were sold without benefitting the state and high placed civil and military individuals in key posts of authority enriched themselves by pocketing whatever benefits they could grab.&lt;ref&gt;John Marston, ''1997 Cambodia 1991-94: Hierarchy, Neutrality and Etiquettes of Discourse.'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this moral breakdown was that students revolted in the streets of Phnom Penh in December 1991. The police opened fire and eight people died in the confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, ''State of Cambodia Human Rights Developments: 1 October 1991 to 31 January 1992.'' London 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions for the [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] improved greatly after 1989. Restrictions placed on them by the former PRK gradually disappeared. The State of Cambodia allowed ethnic Chinese to observe their particular religious customs and Chinese language schools were reopened. In 1991, two years after the SOC's foundation, the [[Chinese New Year]] was officially celebrated in Cambodia for the first time since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/Ledgerwood/Part4.htm |title=Judy Ledgerwood, ''Cambodian Recent History and Contemporary Society;'' 1989-1993 State of Cambodia |access-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114044630/http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/Ledgerwood/Part4.htm |archive-date=14 January 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace agreement===
Peace negotiations between the Vietnam-backed regime in Cambodia and its armed opposition groups had begun formally and informally after the mid-1980s. The negotiations were extremely difficult, for the Khmer Rouge stubbornly insisted in the dismantlement of the PRK/SOC's administration before any agreement could be reached, while the PRK/SOC leadership made it a point of excluding the Khmer Rouge from any future provisional government.&lt;ref name="peou" /&gt; Finally it would be outside historical events, in the form of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall of Communism]] and the ensuing collapse of Soviet support for Vietnam and the PRK, that would bring the PRK/SOC to the negotiating table.

The haphazard efforts towards conciliation in Cambodia culminated in the Paris Agreements in 1991, in which [[United Nations]]-sponsored free and fair elections were scheduled for 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Laban Hinton, ''Why did they kill?''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) was established at the end of February 1992 to supervise the [[cease-fire]] and the ensuing general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/co_mission/untacmandate.html |title=Cambodia - UNTAC - Mandat |access-date=13 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513062201/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/co_mission/untacmandate.html |archive-date=13 May 2006 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The one-party system in the PRK/SOC==
The "Kampuchean (or Khmer) People's Revolutionary Party" (KPRP) was the sole ruling party in Cambodia from the foundation of the pro-Vietnam republic in 1979, as well as during the transitional times under the SOC in 1991, when it was renamed the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) at the beginning of the UN-sponsored peace and reconciliation process.

Many members of the Kampuchean  People's Revolutionary Party were former Khmer Rouge members who had fled to Vietnam after witnessing the wholesale destruction of Cambodian society as a result of the regime's radical [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] and xenophobic policies. Several prominent KPRP members, including [[Heng Samrin]] and [[Hun Sen]], were Khmer Rouge cadres near the Cambodian-Vietnamese border who participated in the Vietnamese invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge.

Founded in June 1981, the KPRP began as a firmly [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] party within the PRK. However, in the mid-1980s it took on a more reformist outlook when some members pointed out problems with [[collectivisation]] and concluded that private property should play a role in Cambodian society. The extreme collectivisation of the Khmer Rouge had caused severe burn-out and distrust among farmers, who refused to work collectively as soon as the threat of the Khmer Rouge disappeared from the liberated areas. Therefore, PRK government policies had to be implemented carefully to win back the rural population's trust and to alleviate the prevailing conditions of poverty.&lt;ref name="peou" /&gt; This led eventually to the effective reinstitutionalisation of the traditional Cambodian family economy and to some more radical change of policies regarding privatisation during the State of Cambodia time (1989–1993). Despite the watered-down ideology the KPRP/CPP remained firmly in control of Cambodia until 1993.

Among the most significant policy shifts of the SOC was putting aside [[Marxism–Leninism]] as the party's ideology in 1991. This move effecively marked the end of the socialist revolutionary state in Cambodia, a form of government which had begun in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over.

Hun Sen, the current Prime Minister of Cambodia, was a key figure in the KPRP and is the current leader of its successor party, the CPP, a party that no longer lays claim to socialist credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/cambodia/government/cambodia_government_the_kampuchean_or_~9232.html |title=Information on KPRP rule |access-date=16 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729061750/http://www.photius.com/countries/cambodia/government/cambodia_government_the_kampuchean_or_~9232.html |archive-date=29 July 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==

After the KPRC proclaimed in January 1979 that the new official name of Cambodia was the "People's Republic of Kampuchea" (PRK), the newly established government notified the [[United Nations Security Council]] that it was the sole legitimate government of the Cambodian people.
Vietnam was the first country to recognise the new regime, and Phnom Penh immediately restored diplomatic relations with [[Hanoi]]. On 18 February, Heng Samrin on behalf of the PRK and [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] on behalf of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam signed a twenty-five-year [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#The PRK's quest for legitimacy|Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pobzeb Vang, ''Five Principles of Chinese Foreign Policies''&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1980, twenty-nine countries had recognized the PRK, yet nearly eighty countries continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://country-studies.com/cambodia/major-political-developments,-1977-81.html |title=Major Political Developments, 1977-81 |access-date=18 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305010854/http://country-studies.com/cambodia/major-political-developments,-1977-81.html |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in turn, the regime's symbols, slogans and ideology, the military uniform and insignia largely copied Soviet-style patterns.

Despite the previous international outcry and concern surrounding Pol Pot's DK regime's gross [[human rights violation]]s it would prove difficult for the PRK/SOC government to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere.

=== United Nations ===
A draft resolution by the People's Republic of China sought to condemn Vietnam in the UN Security Council after its invasion for "its acts of armed invasion and aggression against [[Democratic Kampuchea]], acts which ... cause serious damage to the lives and property of the Kampuchean people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F13022 |title=United Nations Doc.

As a result of the vehement campaign against the PRK, the Khmer Rouge retained its UN seat despite its genocidal record. Cambodia would be represented at the UN by [[Thiounn Prasith]], Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]]'s crony since their [[Khmer Rouge#Paris student group|student days in Paris]]. The seat of '"Democratic Kampuchea"'s regime lasted for three years at the United Nations after the fall of Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia. Only in 1982 it would be renamed as '[[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]]'.&lt;ref name="Michael Vickery 2000"/&gt; The CGDK would hold the seat until 1993, when the SOC gave way to the restoration of the Cambodian monarchy.

To refer to Cambodia as a state, the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] continued using the terms "Democratic Kampuchea" and "Kampuchea" for over a decade. It decided to start using the term "Cambodia" only at the 45th session in 1990, when the transitional phase of the SOC was well on its way.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Alldén &amp; Ramses Amer, ''The United Nations and Peacekeeping: Lessons Learned from Cambodia and East Timor'' (A/45/PV.3 par. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China, East Asia and the West ===
The government of the [[People's Republic of China]], which had consistently supported the Khmer Rouge, quickly labelled the PRK as "Vietnam's [[puppet state]]" and declared it unacceptable. Thailand&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt; and Singapore were very vocal in their opposition to Vietnamese expansion and influence; the Singaporean representative stated that recognition of the PRK would "violate the UN's [[non-intervention]] principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Wheeler, ''Saving strangers: humanitarian intervention in international society''&lt;/ref&gt;
International forums, like [[ASEAN]] meetings and the UN General Assembly would be used to condemn the PRK and the genocide of the Khmer Rouge was removed from the centre stage of attention and [[Pol Pot]] effectively won the support of the US and most of Europe against Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Becker, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/81048.stm "Pol Pot remembered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221061505/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/81048.stm |date=21 February 2009 }}. [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

China and most Western governments, as well as a number of African, Asian and Latin American states&lt;ref&gt;Natalino Ronzitti, ''Rescuing nationals abroad through military coercion and intervention''&lt;/ref&gt; repeatedly backed the Khmer Rouge in the U.N. and voted in favour of DK retaining Cambodia's seat in the organisation at the expense of the PRK. British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] famously explained she believed that there were some among the Khmer Rouge "more reasonable" than Pol Pot.&lt;ref name="Gittings 22-12-2000"&gt;Gittings, John (22 December 2000). [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/23/guardianobituaries.johngittings "Son Sann".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309182347/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/23/guardianobituaries.johngittings |date=9 March 2016 }} ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 12 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Sweden]], however, had to change its vote in the U.N. and to withdraw support for the Khmer Rouge after a large number of Swedish citizens wrote letters to their elected representatives demanding a policy change towards Pol Pot's regime.&lt;ref&gt;John Pilger, ''Tell me no lies", Jonathan Cape Ltd, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]] remained neutral on the issue, claiming that neither side had the right to represent Cambodia at the UN.&lt;ref&gt;''The diplomats dig in'', [[Far Eastern Economic Review]], 5 October 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years that followed, the [[United States]], under the staunch anti-Soviet "[[rollback]]" strategy of the [[Reagan Doctrine]] would support what it perceived as "[[anti-communist]] resistance movements" in Soviet-allied nations. The largest movement fighting Cambodia's communist government was largely made up of members of the former Khmer Rouge regime, whose human rights record was among the worst of the 20th century. Therefore, Reagan authorised the provision of aid to a smaller Cambodian resistance movement, a coalition called the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]],&lt;ref name="feer"&gt;Far Eastern Economic Review, 22 December 1988, details the extensive fighting between the U.S.-backed forces and the Khmer Rouge.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the KPNLF and then run by [[Son Sann]]; in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation. Eventually, the Vietnamese withdrew, and Cambodia's communist regime fell. Then, under [[United Nations]] supervision, free elections were held.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES7451992"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-745(1992) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1992 |resolution_number=745 |accessdate=9 April 2008|date=28 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==

===First draft===
On 10 January 1980, the People's Revolutionary Council named [[Ros Samay]] to lead a council to draft the Constitution. He carefully wrote it in Khmer using clear and easy language whenever possible, mindful that every Cambodian should understand it. He took the constitutions of Vietnam, East Germany, the USSR, [[Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as previous Cambodian constitutions (Kingdom of Cambodia, [[Khmer Republic]]), as a reference. Since Ros Samay's draft failed to please the Vietnamese, he was publicly discredited and his draft scrapped.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Constitution approved by Vietnam===
The wording of the PRK's constitution stressed the relations between the PRK regime and Vietnam. Prime Minister [[Pen Sovann]] acknowledged that the Vietnamese "insisted on changing some clauses they didn't agree with". Finally, on 27 June 1981, a new Constitution was promulgated that pleased the Vietnamese. It defined Cambodia as "a democratic state...gradually advancing toward socialism." The transition to socialism was to take place under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist KPRP. The Constitution explicitly placed Cambodia within the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet Union's orbit]]. The country's primary enemies, according to the Constitution, were "the Chinese expansionists and hegemonists in Beijing, acting in collusion with United States imperialism and other powers."

While technically guaranteeing a "broad range of civil liberties and fundamental rights", the Constitution placed a number of restrictions. For example, "an act may not injure the honor of other persons, nor should it adversely affect the mores and customs of society, or public order, or national security." In line with the principle of socialist collectivism, citizens were obligated to carry out "the state's political line and defend collective property."

The Constitution also addressed principles governing culture, education, social welfare, and public health. Development of language, literature, the arts, and science and technology was stressed, along with the need for cultural preservation, tourist promotion, and cultural co-operation with foreign countries.

Provisions for state organs were in the constitutional chapters dealing with the National Assembly, the Council of State, the Council of Ministers, the local people's revolutionary committees, and the judiciary. Fundamental to the operation of all public bodies was the principle that the Marxist-Leninist KPRP served as the most important political institution of the state. Intermediary linkages between the state bureaucracy and grass-roots activities were provided by numerous organisations affiliated with the [[KUFNCD|Kampuchean (or Khmer) United Front for National Construction and Defense]] (KUFNCD).

===Constitution of the SOC===
The constitution was revised in 1989 to accommodate the market-oriented policies of the newly formed "State of Cambodia". This state was basically a continuation of the PRK regime adapted to the new realities dictated by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] reduced to a minimum Soviet support for Vietnam and Cambodia. Suddenly the Cambodian leadership found itself scrambling for favour abroad, which included the need to open its markets, the gradual abandoning of its original pro-Soviet stance and the pressure to find some accommodation with the factions warring against it.

The PRK's Constitution had not made any mention of a Head of State, perhaps reserving this role for [[Sihanouk]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
The State of Cambodia Constitution, however, stated that the President of the Council of State would be the "Head of State of Cambodia".

==Government structure==
An administrative infrastructure functioning under the  Marxist-Leninist KPRC was more or less in place between 1979 and 1980. With the promulgation of the Constitution in June 1981, new organs, such as the National Assembly, the Council of State, and the Council of Ministers, assumed certain functions that the KPRC had provided. These new bodies evolved slowly. It was not until February 1982 that the National Assembly enacted specific laws for these bodies.

Despite the presence of Vietnamese advisors, the government of the PRK was made up entirely of Cambodian KUFNS members. Initially the Vietnamese advisors, like [[Lê Đức Thọ]], had promised that they would not interfere with Cambodian internal affairs. However, as soon as the PRK was formed and the KUFNS was in power, Lê Đức Thọ, acting as liaison chief between Hanoi and Phnom Penh, broke his promise. Henceforward the members of the Government of the PRK had to walk a narrow path between Cambodian nationalism and "Indochinese solidarity" with Vietnam, which meant making sure they didn't irritate their Vietnamese patrons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; PRK government members, no matter how highly placed, who offended the Vietnamese, whether intentionally or not, were swiftly denounced and purged. Among these were Ros Samai, Pen Sovann and [[Chan Sy]]. The latter, a founding member of the KUNFS who had reached the post of Prime Minister, died in mysterious circumstances in 1984 in Moscow.&lt;ref name="peou" /&gt;

===The National Assembly===
The "supreme organ of state power" was the National Assembly, whose deputies are directly elected for five-year terms. The assembly's 117 seats were filled on 1 May 1981, the date of the PRK's first elections. (The KUFNS had nominated 148 candidates.) The voter turnout was reported as 99.17 percent of the electorate, which was divided into 20 electoral districts.

During its first session in June, the assembly adopted the new Constitution and elected members of the state organs set up under the Constitution. The assembly had been empowered to adopt or to amend the Constitution and the laws and to oversee their implementation; to determine domestic and foreign policies; to adopt economic and cultural programs and the state budget; and to elect or to remove its own officers and members of the Council of State and of the Council of Ministers. The assembly also was authorised to levy, revise, or abolish taxes; to decide on amnesties; and to ratify or to abrogate international treaties. As in other socialist states, the assembly's real function is to endorse the legislative and administrative measures initiated by the Council of State and by the Council of Ministers, both of which serve as agents of the ruling KPRP.

The National Assembly met typically twice a year. During the periods between its sessions, legislative functions were handled by the Council of State. Bills were introduced by the Council of State, the Council of Ministers, the assembly's several commissions (legislative committees), chairman of the KUFNCD, and heads of other organisations. Individual deputies were not entitled to introduce bills.

Once bills, state plans and budgets, and other measures were introduced, they were studied first by the assembly's commissions. Then they went to the assembly for adoption. While ordinary bills were passed by a simple majority, constitutional amendments required a two-thirds majority. The Council of State had to promulgate an adopted bill within thirty days of its passage. Another function of the assembly was to oversee the affairs of the Council of Ministers, which functions as the cabinet. Assembly members were not entitled to call for votes of confidence in the cabinet. Conversely, the Council of Ministers was not empowered to dissolve the National Assembly.

The Constitution stated that in case of war or under "other exceptional circumstances," the five-year life of the Assembly may be extended by decree. In 1986 the assembly's term was extended for another five years, until 1991.

Chairman National Assembly (1985): Chea Sim

Vice chairmen: Math Ly, Tep Vong, Nu Beng

===The Council of State===
The National Assembly elected seven of its members to the Council of State. The chairman of the council served as the head of state, but the power to serve as ex officio supreme commander of the armed forces was deleted from the final draft of the Constitution.

The council's seven members were among the most influential leaders of the PRK. Between sessions of the National Assembly, the Council of State carried out the assembly's duties. It may appoint or remove (on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers) cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and envoys accredited to foreign governments. Foreign diplomatic envoys presented their letters of accreditation to the Council of State.

Council of State(1985):

Chairman: Heng Samrin

Vice-chairman: Say Phouthang

===The Council of Ministers===
The government's top executive organ was the Council of Ministers, or cabinet, which in late 1987 was headed by Hun Sen (as it had been since January 1985). Apart from the prime minister (formally called chairman), the Council of Ministers had two deputy prime ministers (vice chairmen) and twenty ministers. The National Assembly elected the council's ministers for five-year terms.

The Council of Ministers met weekly in an executive session. Decisions made in the executive sessions were "collective," whereas those in the plenary sessions were by a majority. Representatives of KUFNCD and other mass organisations, to which all citizens may belong, were sometimes invited to attend plenary sessions of the council "when [it was] discussing important issues." These representatives could express their views but they were not allowed to vote.

Government ministries were in charge of agriculture; communications, transport, and posts; education; finance; foreign affairs; health; home and foreign trade; industry; information and culture; interior; justice; national defence; planning; and social affairs and invalids. In addition, the cabinet includes a minister for agricultural affairs and rubber plantations, who was attached to the Office of the Council of Ministers; a minister in charge of the Office of the Council of Ministers; a secretary general of the Office of the Council of Ministers, who was also in charge of transport and of Khmer-Thai border defence networks; a director of the State Affairs Inspectorate; and the president-director general of the People's National Bank of Kampuchea.

Council of Ministers (1985):

Chairman: Hun Sen (and Minister Foreign Affairs)

Vice chairmen: Chea Soth, Bou Thang, Kong Sam, Tea Banh, Say Chhum

===The Judiciary===
The restoration of law and order was one of the more pressing tasks of the Heng Samrin regime. Since 1979 the administration of justice was in the hands of people's revolutionary courts that were set up hastily in Phnom Penh and in other major provincial cities. A new law dealing with the organisation of courts and with the Office of Public Prosecutor was promulgated in February 1982. Under this law, the People's Supreme Court became the highest court of the land.

The judicial system comprised the people's revolutionary courts, the military tribunals, and the public prosecutors' offices. The Council of Ministers, on the recommendations of local administrative bodies called people's revolutionary committees, appointed judges and public prosecutors.

===Administrative divisions===
In late 1987, the country was divided into eighteen provinces (''khet'') and two special municipalities (''krong''), Phnom Penh and [[Kampong Saom]], which were under direct central government control.

The provinces were subdivided into about 122 districts (srok), 1,325 communes (''khum''), and 9,386 villages (''phum''). The subdivisions of the municipalities were wards (''sangkat'').

===Local People's Revolutionary Committees===
An elective body, consisting of a chairman (president), one or more vice chairmen, and a number of committee members, ran each people's revolutionary committee. These elective bodies were chosen by representatives of the next lower level people's revolutionary committees at the provincial and district levels.

At the provincial and district levels, where the term of office was five years, committee members needed the additional endorsement of officials representing the KUFNCD and other affiliated mass organisations. At the commune and ward level, the members of the people's revolutionary committees are elected directly by local inhabitants for a three-year term.

Before the first local elections, which were held in February and March 1981, the central government appointed local committee officials. In late 1987, it was unclear whether the chairpersons of the local revolutionary committees reported to the Office of the Council of Ministers or to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Cambodia)|Ministry of Interior]].

===Armed forces===
{{main|Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces}}

The regular armed forces of the People's Republic of Kampuchea were the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces (KPRAF). These were needed to project internationally the image of the new pro-Hanoi administration in Phnom Penh as a legitimate sovereign state. Raising such an indigenous force was not too difficult for the Vietnamese occupiers at the time, because the Vietnamese already had experience training and co-ordinating the army in neighbouring [[Laos]].

The KPRAF was formed initially from militias, former Khmer Rouge members, and conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14730.html |title=Vietnam - Conflict with Cambodia |access-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707194211/http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14730.html |archive-date=7 July 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; KPRAF troops were trained and supplied by the Vietnamese armed forces. But owing to a lack of proper training and weapons, meagre salaries and mass desertions, the fledgling KPRAF was not an effective fighting force and the bulk of the fighting against the CGDK forces was left in the end to the army of the occupiers, the [[Vietnam People's Army]].

The Khmer Rouge forced the Vietnamese to employ guerrilla warfare as one of their tactics. As years went by the Vietnamese suffered damaging casualties, and the persistent civil war debilitated Cambodia and hampered reconstruction efforts.  The Khmer Rouge gained confidence that they could keep swiping away Vietnamese armies, and the Vietnamese found out how easy it is to become the prey rather than the predator. In fact some books have called this "Vietnam's Vietnam War".

The KPRAF was answerable to two organisations below the Council of State, namely, the Ministry of National Defense and the General Staff. Veterans from the Eastern Zone revolution, especially those from [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]], [[Svay Rieng Province|Svay Rieng]], as well as people who had been educated in Vietnam after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Conference]] held important positions in the Ministry of National Defense.&lt;ref name="dccam.org"/&gt; Control of the KPRAF military establishment and its adherence to the political orthodoxy of the Kampuchean (or Khmer) People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) were ensured by a party network, superimposed upon the national defence structure, that extended downward to units at all echelons.

The KPRAF developed also a system of [[military justice]], with [[military tribunal]]s, as well as a network of [[military prison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2238.html |title=Cambodia - Military Service |access-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806003549/http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2238.html |archive-date=6 August 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 began the transition that culminated in the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements. After the name of the People's Republic of Kampuchea had been officially changed to State of Cambodia (SOC), the KPRAF were renamed the Cambodian People's Armed Forces (CPAF). Following the 1993 elections the CPAF were absorbed into a new national army of Royalist, Nationalist and CPAF troops.

'''Pre-industrial society''' refers to social attributes and forms of political and cultural organization that were prevalent before the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which occurred from 1750 to 1850. Pre-industrial is a time before there were machines and tools to help perform tasks en masse. Pre-industrial civilization dates back to centuries ago, but the main era known as the '''Pre-Industrial Society''' occurred right before the [[industrial society]].
Pre-Industrial societies vary from region to region depending on the culture of a given area or history of social and political life. Europe is known for its [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval era]].

==Attributes==

* Limited [[Economic production|production]]
* Extreme agricultural economy
* Limited [[division of labor]]. In pre-industrial societies, production was relatively simple and the number of specialized crafts was limited.
* Limited variation of [[social class]]es
* [[Parochialism]]—[[Communication]]s were limited between communities in pre-industrial societies. Few had the opportunity to see or hear beyond their own village. Industrial societies grew with the help of faster means of communication, having more [[information]] at hand about the world, allowing [[knowledge transfer]] and [[cultural diffusion]] between them.
* Populations grew at substantial rates &lt;ref&gt;Cipolla, Carlo M. Before the Industrial Revolution: European Society and Economy, 1000-1700. New York: Norton, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social classes: peasants and lords&lt;ref name=Persson&gt;Persson, Karl Gunnar. Pre-industrial Economic Growth: Social Organization, and Technological Progress in Europe. Oxford: Blackwell, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Subsistence economy|Subsistence]] level of living&lt;ref name=Persson/&gt;
* Population dependent on peasants for food&lt;ref name=Persson/&gt;
* People were located in villages rather than in cities

==Economic systems==

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
Harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were equally as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"&gt;R.M.

'''Richer of Senones''' (sometimes in [[French (language)|French]]: Richer le Lorrain) (circa 1190&amp;ndash;1266) was a monk and chronicler of [[Senones Abbey]] in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], a traveller and one of the very few chroniclers or historians of the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] whose works have survived complete.

==Life==

He was born probably around 1190, quite possibly in the Val de Lièpvre (now in [[Haut-Rhin]]), perhaps a younger son of an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] or [[Lorraine (province)|Lotharingian]] noble family. He studied at [[Strasbourg]] and was admitted to Senones Abbey under abbot Henri (1202–1225). In about 1218 Richer was sent as an ambassador of Senones to [[Würzburg]] when [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine]], was prisoner of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], after the fire of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and the siege of [[Amance, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Amance]].

He travelled extensively throughout the Vosges, which he knew extremely well, and throughout Alsace and Lorraine, where he often encountered monks from [[Lièpvre]] Priory as well as monks from [[St. Denis' Abbey]] in [[Paris]], who had possessions in the Val de Lièpvre. He visited St. Denis' Abbey himself in 1223, probably together with monks from Lièpvre. He often visited the castles of [[Château du Bilstein|Bilstein]] in [[Urbeis]] and [[Château d'Échéry|Échéry]] in [[Sainte Croix-aux-Mines]], as well as the renowned castle of [[Château du Bernstein|Bernstein]]. He also knew [[Gorze Abbey]],&lt;ref&gt;In about 960 Gorze Abbey re-established Moyenmoutier Abbey and a number of others dependent upon it, possibly including Senones&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Evre's Abbey, Toul]], and the abbey at [[Saint-Dié]].

==Works==
Richer is an enthusiastic recorder of his travels, and of religious stories and traditions that he has encountered. Unusually for the time, he is also a fine observer of landscapes, particularly the spectacular scenery of the Vosges, and takes great pains to describe what he has observed. A peculiarity of his language is the use of the word "Teudons"&lt;ref&gt;cf "[[Teuton]]s"&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the inhabitants of Alsace.

His [[Latin]] chronicles survive in nine copy manuscripts. Four date from the 16th century, two are translations, another two are from the 17th century and one is from 1826. The copies originate from the monasteries at Senones, [[Moyenmoutier Abbey|Moyenmoutier]] and [[Etival Abbey|Etival]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6355">'''Robert Sabatino Lopez''' (October 8, 1910 –  July 6, 1986), also known as '''Robert S. Lopez''', was a Jewish-Italian-American historian of medieval European economic history. He taught for many years at [[Yale University]] as a [[Sterling Professor]] of History with a great passion also for the history of the Commons in Italy and Europe in general.

==Early life and education==
Roberto Sabatino Lopez was born in [[Genoa]], Italy. He received a doctorate from the [[University of Milan]] in 1932 and taught [[medieval history]] at various universities in Italy until 1939, when he fled [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime to go to the United States. Hoping to find employment at an American university, Lopez enrolled in the graduate history program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], which awarded him a Ph.D in 1942.

==Early work in the United States==
From 1942 to 1944 Lopez worked in the Italian section of the [[Office of War Information]] in New York City. There he met his future wife, [[Claude-Anne Lopez|Claude-Anne Kirschen]], a wartime refugee from [[Belgium]] who had come to New York with her family in 1940. He afterward maintained that his successful courtship of her was his supreme wartime accomplishment.

==Marriage and family==
He married Claude-Anne Kirschen in 1946. They had two sons, Michael and Lawrence, after moving to [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Resumption of academic career==
In 1946, Lopez was hired as an assistant professor at Yale. He rose through the academic ranks to full professor. He was honored by selection as a [[Sterling Professor]] of History, a recognition of his academic contributions.

At Yale, in 1962 Lopez founded the interdisciplinary graduate program in Medieval Studies, and served as its chairman for many years. Originally a master's program, it awarded doctorates by 1965. When founded, it was the third such medieval studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/medieval/ Medieval Studies Program], Yale University, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopez trained a number of distinguished medieval scholars, among them [[David Herlihy]], Edward M. Peters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.upenn.edu/faculty/peters.shtml Edward M. Peters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517013901/http://www.history.upenn.edu/faculty/peters.shtml |date=2009-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patrick J. Geary]]. Lopez retired from the Yale faculty in 1981 after 35 years at the university.

Lopez's main contributions to the field were in the history of trade and commerce in the medieval Mediterranean. He was particularly interested in showing the dynamism and creativity of medieval towns and economic networks. Other scholars had frequently compared unfavorably to those of the [[Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]].

In his best-known book, ''The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages'' (1971, with numerous reprints), Lopez argued that the key contribution of the medieval period to European history was the creation of a commercial economy. He said it was first based in the Italo-Byzantine eastern Mediterranean, but eventually extended to the [[Italian city-states]] and through the rest of Europe. Lopez noted that it was the Renaissance period that was characterized by economic decline.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Lopez, "Hard Times and Investment in Culture," in ''The Renaissance: A Symposium'' (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1953), pp. 19-32; reprinted in Karl H.

Cipolla]], "Economic Depression of the Renaissance?" ibid 16 (1963), pp. 519-24; and the responses of Lopez and Miskimin, pp. 525-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Lopez's scholarship was underpinned by his expert knowledge of medieval agriculture, industry and especially coinage.

Lopez died from cancer in 1986. His library and papers were acquired by [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmrs.org/web_pages/online_resources/online_resources_lopez.html "The Robert S. Lopez Collection"], Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sabino Policarpo Arana Goiri''', self-styled as '''Arana ta Goiri'taŕ Sabin''' (26 January 1865 – 25 November 1903), was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] writer. He was the founder of the [[Basque Nationalist Party|Basque Nationalist Party (PNV)]] and father of [[Basque nationalism]].

He died in [[Sukarrieta]] at the age of 38 after falling ill with [[Addison's disease]] during time spent in prison. He had been charged with treason for attempting to send a telegram to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], in which he praised the United States for helping [[History of Cuba|Cuba gain independence from Spain]].

==Background==
[[File:Sabino Arana.jpg|thumb|Statue in Abando, near Sabin-Etxea.]]
One of the consequences of the [[First Carlist War]] was the substitution of the [[Ancien Régime]] Basque home rule ([[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|''fueros'']]) by a limited still relevant autonomy. A majority in [[Navarre]] and the rest of the Basque districts supported the pretender to the Spanish crown [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] for his support to their institutions and laws (characterized for being [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1a_antes_y_despu%C3%A9s_de_1833:_4 more liberal than elsewhere] in Spain). However, they were defeated in 1839, and Navarre, [[Biscay]], [[Álava]] and [[Gipuzkoa]] were integrated into the Spanish customs system. Basque industrialists profited from privatization of exploitations and the Spanish [[protectionism|captive market]] with the iron ore and the [[Bessemer converter]], and Biscay became "the iron [[California Gold Rush|California]]". Workers from all of Spain were attracted to the area as labourers for the burgeoning industry.

Arana was born in a ''[[jauntxo]]'' ("petty noble") family from [[Abando]], a neighbourhood that had been recently incorporated into the city of [[Bilbao]] as the new extension for the growth of the industrial era. Abando was a Basque speaking town, but following the attitudes of the elites in the area of Bilbao during this period, Basque was not transmitted to Arana's siblings within the family. Abando and its port were at the centre of [[History of the Basques#Under the nation-states|the ''Zamacolada'']] uprising against attempts by the Spanish premier [[Manuel Godoy]] to recruit Basques for the Spanish army (1804), a ''contrafuero'' or breach of basic Basque legislation.

In the aftermath of the [[Third Carlist War]] (1876), Arana attended the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] School of Orduña along with his brother Luis (1876–1881). Orduña became a hotspot and meeting point for the pro-''fueros'', primeval Basque nationalists concerned with [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Ley_de_21_de_julio_de_1876 the loss of the Basque native institutions].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Revuelta Gonzalez |first=Manuel |date= |title=La Compañía de Jesús en la España contemporánea: Supresión y reinstalación (1863-1883)|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=wNywBp7CMr0C&amp;pg=PA774&amp;lpg=PA774&amp;dq=sabino+arana+seminario+ordu%C3%B1a&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-2DMuyQ1IR&amp;sig=I8N8Q4axEcoqrcfJZE9pIvvuSHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n_wzVYrwPIHSaMzfgPgB&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Arana&amp;f=false |location=Madrid |publisher=Universidad Pontificia Comillas|page=774 |isbn=84-85281-52-7|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arana claimed that he had a quasi-religious revelation at Easter 1882,&lt;ref name="Granja"&gt;It was the origin of the [[Aberri Eguna|Basque Fatherland Day]]. [[José Luis de la Granja Sáinz]], however, claims that the revelation was dated on Easter in 1932 after Arana's death, when the EAJ-PNV established the commemoration. José Luis de la Granja Sáinz, ''Historia y política: Ideas, procesos y movimientos sociales'', ISSN 1575-0361, Nº 15, 2006 , pags. 65–116&lt;/ref&gt; one that he communicated to his brother [[Luis Arana]]. From then he devoted himself to the nationalist cause of Biscay, later extended to the Basque Country.

==Ideology==
[[File:Flag of the Basque Country.svg|thumb|The [[ikurriña]] flag is a joint design of the Arana brothers.]]
He was an early defender of the use of the [[Basque language]] in all areas of society, to avoid its increasing marginalization in the face of Spanish language penetration, imposed as mandatory in schooling and administration, even certain cultural events (theatre, etc.). He learned the language as a young man, but was ready to compete for a position as a Basque language professor at the ''Instituto de Bilbao'', contending against [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and the winner, [[Resurrección María de Azkue]] who became an erudite scholar of the language. He made a strong effort to establish a codified orthography&lt;ref name="Ortografia"&gt;''Lecciones de ortografía del euskera bizkaino'', Arana eta Goiri'tar Sabin, Bilbao, Bizkaya'ren Edestija ta Izkerea Pizkundia, 1896 (Sebastián de Amorrortu).&lt;/ref&gt; and grammar for the Basque language, and proposed several [[neologism]]s to replace loanwords of Spanish origin. Some of these innovations, like the characters ''[[ĺ]]'' and ''[[ŕ]]'', were ultimately rejected in the standardization efforts for the Basque language undertaken since 1968 leading to the establishment of [[Standard Basque]]—the ''Euskara Batua''.

His first published work was ''Bizkaya por su independencia'' ("Biscay for its independence"), where he calls for the independence of the Biscay district from Castile-Spain ("as it was before 1200"), echoing like proposals put forward by [[Gipuzkoa]]'s governmental representatives to the [[National Convention]] officials Pinet and [[Jean-Baptiste Cavaignac|Cavaignac]] in [[Getaria, Gipuzkoa|Getaria]] during the [[War of the Pyrenees]] (1793–1795). The document is a collection of historical events, mythical stories and sometimes inaccurate accounts of earlier battles of the ancient people of Biscay. Just as others nationalist ideologies were doing during the period, e.g. [[Spanish nationalism]], Arana's historic accounts distorted and magnified events from Basque history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mina |first=María Cruz |editor-last1=Arriazkuenaga |editor-first1=Joseba |editor-last2=Urquijo Goitia |editor-first2=Jose Ramón |title=150 Años del Convenio de Bergara y la Ley del 25 -X - 1939 |publisher=Eusko Legebiltzarra/Parlamento Vasco |date=1990 |chapter=Historia y Política: Las Vicisitudes de una Ley |pages=316-317 |isbn=84-87122-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing himself from the pro-''fueros'' advocates, Arana refused to demand a reversal of [[S:es:Ley de 21 de julio de 1876|the ''fueros'' suppressed in May 1876]], instead putting an emphasis on the full restoration of [[End of Basque home rule in Spain#Basque home rule altered|home rule suppressed in 1839]]. He considered the [[s:es:Ley de Confirmación de Fueros|1839 Spanish law 'upholding' home rule]] as the act putting an end to the Basque own sources of authority and 'secular Basque independence', as well as a violation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Mina, María Cruz (1990). 316-317. or.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, he founded the first [[batzoki|center]] for the new nationalist party, ([[EAJ-PNV|Partido Nacionalista Vasco]]), the second-oldest political party in Spain, to provide a place for gathering and proselytizing. Sabino Arana, like many Europeans of his time, believed that the essence of a country was defined by its blood or ethnic composition. In Spain, the supremacy of the Spanish race and its "civilizing" pursuit over peoples held to be inferior was defended by the main political figures and parties, while a number of intellectuals Spanish and even Basque, including the Socialists, advocated for the extinction of the Basque language—ever more marginalized to family and informal environments. Despite his religious [[integrism]] and racist views, he is considered by many Basques to be a [[Gadfly (social)|gadfly]] that sparked the movement for the cultural revival of the Basques, and for the freedom of his people. In that respect, Arana defended the Constitutional foundations of the abolished Basque institutional and legal framework (the ''fueros''). The [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]], the party in power in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] from the end of Francoism (except during 2009-2012), developed along more nuanced and pragmatic lines in respect of religion and views on race, moving away from his most controversial ideas but not from his figure.

He was a prolific writer, with over 600 journalism articles, most of them with a propaganda purpose. He liked to shock and provoke, in order to get attention from a society that he deemed unaware of its fate. There are two key aspects of Sabino Arana's political figure:

* He was not a conventional conservative; he strongly opposed slavery (legal in Spanish-held Cuba until ten years before its independence) and defended the right of South African [[Zulus]] to their land.
* He was an indefatigable worker, taking action in many areas; he learned the Basque language as an adult, undertook a number of activities to promote the Basque language and culture, created a political movement, and inventing the symbols ([[Ikurriña|flag]], [[Gora ta Gora Euzkadi|anthem]], [[Euzkadi|country name]]) used to this day not only by Basque nationalists, but other political parties and representatives also, especially in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]].

Another essential part of his ideology was devout Catholicism. He considered this to be an essential part of the Basque identity that contrasted with the secularism imported from other parts of Spain and abroad along with new means of production and labour, often unprecedented immigration. However, his Basque nationalism kept him away from [[Carlism]] that was the dominant ultra-Catholic and conservative movement in the area and the ideology of his father. Arana and his Basque nationalist movement were persecuted for their ideas against Spanish imperialism, for which he was convicted when he submitted a [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Telegrama_de_Sabino_Arana_a_Theodore_Roosevelt a telegram to Theodore Roosevelt] to congratulate him for his assistance in 'liberating' Cuba in 1902, and put to harsh time in prison, which ruined his health and would die soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=Basque History Of The World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQpfod-EQDsC&amp;pg=PT32|date=11 March 2011|publisher=Knopf Canada|pages=174–175|isbn=978-0-307-36978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of his demise, a baffling manifesto attributed to him was released by which [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Liga_de_Vascos_Espa%C3%B1olistas_-_Grave_y_Trascendental he relinquished the core of his ideas] to everyone's surprise. The nature of this document establishing the ''Liga de Vascos Españolistas'' ('League for the Spanish-minded Basques') is still subject to debate, whether he had sincerely changed his views or he was trying to improve the conditions of his imprisonment. Arana's death left the question unanswered and neither his brother Luis nor the party followed through with his proposal.

==Racial views==
{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Sabino_Arana_in_Larrinaga_prison,_1895.jpg|thumb|Sabino Arana imprisoned in Larrinaga for supporting Cuba's independence]]
Sabino Arana, coming from a [[Carlist]] background, created a [[xenophobic]] ideology centered on the purity of the Basque race and its so-called moral supremacy over others (a derivation of the system of ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' of [[Siglo de Oro|Modern-Age Spain]]), anti-Liberal Catholic [[integrism]], and deep opposition to the migration of Spaniards to the Basque Country.

Unlike many contemporary conservative politicians in Spain, he was against [[slavery]] in [[Spanish colonies]] such as [[Cuba]]. He was disturbed by the immigration into [[Biscay]] of many workers from western and central Spain during the [[industrial revolution]], into a small territory whose native political institutions had recently been suppressed (1876), believing that their influence would result in the disappearance of the 'pure' Basque race. He presented the Basque as opposed to the ''[[maketo]]'' (people from the rest of Spain):

{{quote|text="It is necessary to isolate ourselves from the maketos. Otherwise, in this land we walk on, it is not possible to work toward the Glory of God." ''Bizkaitarra'', No. 19}}

==Legacy==
{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}
Sabino Arana's ideas are considered to have spawned the Basque nationalist movement. Today, he is viewed by some as a controversial figure, due to his [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]] and his ideas of a [[pure race]].

In 2015 a [[TV Movie]] called 'Sabin' was released.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eitb.eus/es/television/detalle/2908628/tvmovie-sabino-arana/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 the [[People's Party of the Basque Country]] called for a street named after Arana to be renamed because of his "racism" and because he “made possible the existence of phenomena such as the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] terrorist group”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/basque-street-names-fuel-debate-around-historical-memory-1.2976931&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco]] has kept only the more moderate part of his message. On the other hand, some Basques still revere him as the father of the Basque nationalist movement, who managed to start the turnaround of the decay of the Basque language and culture. Many Basque cities have streets named after him.

[[File:Sabin etxea.jpg|thumb|Sabin-Etxea in 2007.]]
The estate of his Abando home is now ''Sabin-Etxea'' ("Sabino-House"), the EAJ-PNV headquarters.

[[Jon Juaristi]] has remarked that perhaps the most influential part of his heritage is the neologistic list of Basque versions of names in his ''Deun-Ixendegi Euzkotarra'' ("Basque saint-name collection", published in 1910). Instead of the traditional adaptations of Romance names, he proposed others he made up and that in his opinion were truer to the originals and adapted to the Basque phonology.

For example, his brother Luis became ''Koldobika'', from Frankish ''Hlodwig''. The traditional ''Peru'', ''Pello'' or ''Piarres'' ("[[Peter (name)|Peter]]") became ''Kepa'' from Aramaic כיפא (Kepha). He believed that the suffix ''-[n]e'' was inherently feminine, and new names like ''Nekane'' ("pain"+''ne'', "[[Dolores (given name)|Dolores]]") or ''Garbine'' ("clean"+''ne'', "[[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate [Conception]]]") are frequent among Basque females. Even the name of the brother-in-law of the king of Spain is [[Iñaki Urdangarin]], ''Iñaki'' being Arana's alternative for [[Ignatius]] instead of the Basque traditional ''Inazio'', ''Iñigo'' or ''Eneko'' (which are all related).

==Early career==
===Early life===

The two brothers were born in [[Thessalonica]], in present-day [[Greece]] – Cyril in about 827–828 and Methodius about 815–820. Cyril was reputedly the youngest of seven brothers; he was born Constantine,&lt;ref&gt;''Cyril and Methodius'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but was given the name Cyril upon becoming a monk in Rome shortly before his death,&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Constantini slavica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RIdFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA246 Cap. 18: Denkschriften der kaiserl.

Methodius was born Michael and was given the name Methodius upon becoming a monk at [[Mysia]]n Olympus (present-day [[Uludağ]]), in northwest Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carpatho-rusyn.org/spirit/cyril.htm|title=Blank|author=|date=|website=www.carpatho-rusyn.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317030046/http://www.carpatho-rusyn.org/spirit/cyril.htm|archivedate=17 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father was Leo, a ''[[droungarios]]'' of the Byzantine [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of Thessalonica, and their mother was Maria.

The exact ethnic origins of the brothers are unknown, there is controversy as to whether Cyril and Methodius were of [[Early Slavs|Slavic]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The two brothers lost their father when Cyril was fourteen, and the powerful minister [[Theoktistos]], who was ''[[logothetes tou dromou]]'', one of the chief ministers of the Empire, became their protector. He was also responsible, along with the regent [[Bardas]], for initiating a far-reaching educational program within the Empire which culminated in the establishment of the [[University of Magnaura]], where Cyril was to teach. Cyril was ordained as [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] some time after his education, while his brother Methodius remained a [[deacon]] until 867/868.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q7EuWhDYxM4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=Constantine+was+ordained+as+priest++Methodius++deacon#v=onepage&amp;q=Constantine%20was%20ordained%20as%20priest%20%20Methodius%20%20deacon&amp;f=false |title=The Lives of the Ninth-Century Popes (Liber Pontificalis)– Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date= January 1, 1995|accessdate=2015-12-24|isbn=0-85323-479-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission to the Khazars===
About the year 860, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (a professor of Cyril's at the University and his guiding light in earlier years), sent Cyril on a missionary expedition to the [[Khazars]] who had requested a scholar be sent to them who could converse with both Jews and Saracens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20090617.html Pope Benedict XVI.

After his return to Constantinople, Cyril assumed the role of professor of [[philosophy]] at the University while his brother had by this time become a significant player in Byzantine political and administrative affairs, and an abbot of his monastery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Mission to the Slavs==
=== Great Moravia ===
[[File:Cyril and Methodius.jpg|thumb|upright|Cyril and Methodius, painting by [[Jan Matejko]], 1885]]
[[File:Velehrad.JPG|thumb|left|Basilica of St.Cyril and Methodius in [[Moravia]]n [[Velehrad]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
In 862, the brothers began the work which would give them their historical importance. That year Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] of [[Great Moravia]] requested that Emperor Michael III and the Patriarch Photius send missionaries to evangelize his Slavic subjects. His motives in doing so were probably more political than religious. Rastislav had become king with the support of the [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler [[Louis the German]], but subsequently sought to assert his independence from the Franks. It is a common misconception that Cyril and Methodius were the first to bring Christianity to [[Moravia]], but the letter from Rastislav to Michael III states clearly that Rastislav's people "had already rejected paganism and adhere to the Christian law."&lt;ref name=Ivanov&gt;Vizantiiskoe missionerstvo, Ivanov S. A., Iazyki slavianskoi kul'tury, Moskva 2003, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Rastislav is said to have expelled missionaries of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] and instead turned to Constantinople for ecclesiastical assistance and, presumably, a degree of political support.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Cyril and Methodius, Saints, O.Ed., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor quickly chose to send Cyril, accompanied by his brother Methodius.&lt;ref name=IUN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iun.edu/~hisdcl/h113_2001/byzantium.htm |title=From Eastern Roman to Byzantine: transformation of Roman culture (500-800) |publisher=Indiana University Northwest |date= |access-date=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916164425/http://www.iun.edu/~hisdcl/h113_2001/byzantium.htm |archivedate=16 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The request provided a convenient opportunity to expand Byzantine influence. Their first work seems to have been the training of assistants. In 863, they began the task of translating the [[Bible]] into the language now known as [[Old Church Slavonic]] and travelled to Great Moravia to promote it.&lt;ref name=Pravmir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |title=Sts. Cyril and Methodius |publisher=Pravmir |date= |access-date=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307085339/http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They enjoyed considerable success in this endeavour. However, they came into conflict with German ecclesiastics who opposed their efforts to create a specifically Slavic liturgy.

For the purpose of this mission, they devised the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] [[alphabet]], the first alphabet to be used for Slavonic manuscripts. The Glagolitic alphabet was suited to match the specific features of the Slavic language. Its descendant script, the Cyrillic, is still used by many languages today.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than [[Latin]] or Greek. In Great Moravia, Constantine and Methodius encountered Frankish missionaries from Germany, representing the western or Latin branch of the Church, and more particularly representing the Holy Roman Empire as founded by Charlemagne, and committed to linguistic, and cultural uniformity. They insisted on the use of the Latin liturgy, and they regarded Moravia and the Slavic peoples as part of their rightful mission field.

When friction developed, the brothers, unwilling to be a cause of dissension among Christians, travelled to Rome to see the Pope, seeking an agreement that would avoid quarrelling between missionaries in the field.  [[Pope Adrian II]] gave Methodius the title of Archbishop of Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia) and sent him back in 869, with jurisdiction over all of Moravia and Pannonia, and authorisation to use the Slavonic Liturgy. Soon, however, Prince Ratislav, who had originally invited the brothers to Moravia, died, and his successor did not support Methodius. In 870 the Frankish king Louis and his bishops deposed Methodius at a synod at Ratisbon, and imprisoned him for a little over two years. [[Pope John VIII]] secured his release, but instructed him to stop using the Slavonic Liturgy.

In 878, Methodius was summoned to Rome on charges of heresy and using Slavonic. This time Pope John was convinced by the arguments that Methodius made in his defence and sent him back cleared of all charges, and with permission to use Slavonic. The Carolingian bishop who succeeded him, Witching, suppressed the Slavonic Liturgy and forced the followers of Methodius into exile. Many found refuge with Knyaz [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris]] of Bulgaria, under whom they reorganised a Slavic-speaking Church. Meanwhile, Pope John's successors adopted a Latin-only policy which lasted for centuries.

The brothers wrote the first Slavic [[Civil Code]], which was used in Great Moravia. The language derived from Old Church Slavonic, known as [[Church Slavonic]], is still used in [[liturgy]] by several [[Orthodox Church]]es and also in some [[Eastern Catholic]] churches.

It is impossible to determine with certainty what portions of the Bible the brothers translated. The [[New Testament]] and the [[Psalms]] seem to have been the first, followed by other lessons from the [[Old Testament]]. The ''"Translatio"'' speaks only of a version of the [[Gospels]] by Cyril, and the ''"Vita Methodii"'' only of the ''"evangelium Slovenicum,"'' though other liturgical selections may also have been translated.

Nor is it known for sure which liturgy, that of Rome or that of Constantinople, they took as a source. They may well have used the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], as suggested by liturgical fragments which adhere closely to the Latin type. This view is confirmed by the "Prague Fragments" and by certain Old [[Glagolitic]] liturgical fragments brought from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Kiev]] and discovered there by Saresnewsky—probably the oldest document for the Slavonic tongue; these adhere closely to the Latin type, as is shown by the words ''"Mass,"'' ''"Preface,"'' and the name of one Felicitas. In any case, the circumstances were such that the brothers could hope for no permanent success without obtaining the authorization of Rome.

===Journey to Rome===
[[File:San clemente fresco.jpg|thumb|left|Saints Cyril and Methodius in Rome. Fresco in San Clemente]]
In 867, [[Pope Nicholas I]] invited the brothers to Rome. Their evangelizing mission in Moravia had by this time become the focus of a dispute with [[Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg|Theotmar]], the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[bishop of Passau]], who claimed ecclesiastical control of the same territory and wished to see it use the Latin liturgy exclusively. Travelling with the relics of [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]] and a retinue of disciples, and passing through [[Pannonia]] (the [[Balaton Principality]]), where they were well received by Prince [[Koceľ]] (Kocelj, Kozel), they arrived in Rome in 868, where they were warmly received. This was partly due to their bringing with them the relics of Saint Clement; the rivalry with Constantinople as to the jurisdiction over the territory of the Slavs would incline Rome to value the brothers and their influence.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

The brothers were praised for their learning and cultivated for their influence in Constantinople. [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] would later call Cyril "a man of apostolic life" and "a man of great wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;"Vir apostolicae vitae...sapientissimus vir" MGH Epist., 7/2, 1928, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Their project in Moravia found support from [[Pope Adrian II]], who formally authorized the use of the new Slavic liturgy. Subsequently Methodius was ordained as priest by the pope himself, and five Slavic disciples were ordained as priests ([[Saint Gorazd]], [[Clement of Ohrid|Saint Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Saint Naum]]) and as deacons ([[Saint Angelar]] and [[Saint Sava (disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius)|Saint Sava]]) by the prominent bishops [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]] and Gauderic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frantiskani.sk/kazatel/svati/0727.htm|title=Sv.

Feeling his end approaching, Cyril became a monk, was given the new name Cyril,&lt;ref&gt;As is customary, when one becomes a monk in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, one receives a new name.&lt;/ref&gt; and died in Rome fifty days later (14 February 869). There is some question as to assertion of the ''Translatio'' (ix.) that he was made a bishop.

===Methodius alone===
Methodius now continued the work among the Slavs alone; not at first in Great Moravia, but in Pannonia (in the [[Balaton Principality]]), owing to the political circumstances of the former country, where Rastislav had been taken captive by his nephew [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]], then delivered over to Carloman, and condemned in a [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] of the empire at the end of 870.

Friendly relations had been established with Koceľ on the journey to Rome. This activity in Pannonia made a conflict inevitable with the German episcopate, and especially with the bishop of [[Salzburg]], to whose jurisdiction Pannonia had belonged for seventy-five years. In 865 Bishop Adalwin is found exercising all Episcopal rights there, and the administration under him was in the hands of the archpriest Riehbald. The latter was obliged to retire to Salzburg, but his superior was naturally disinclined to abandon his claims. Methodius sought support from Rome; the ''Vita'' asserts that Koceľ sent him thither with an honorable escort to receive Episcopal consecration.

The letter given as Adrian's in chap. viii., with its approval of the Slavonic mass, is a pure invention. The pope named Methodius archbishop of Sirmium with jurisdiction over Great Moravia and Pannonia, thus superseding the claims of Salzburg by an older title. The statement of the ''"Vita"'' that Methodius was made bishop in 870 and not raised to the dignity of an archbishop until 873 is contradicted by the brief of [[Pope John VIII]], written in June 879, according to which Adrian consecrated him archbishop; John includes in his jurisdiction not only Great Moravia and Pannonia, but Serbia as well.

===Methodius' final years===
The archiepiscopal claims of Methodius were considered such an injury to the rights of Salzburg that he was forced to answer for them at a synod held at [[Regensburg]] in the presence of King Louis. The assembly, after a heated discussion, declared the deposition of the intruder, and ordered him to be sent to Germany, where he was kept prisoner in [[Ellwangen]] for two and a half years. In spite of the strong representations of the ''[[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]]'', written in 871 to influence the pope, though not avowing this purpose, Rome declared emphatically for Methodius, and sent a bishop, Paul of Ancons, to reinstate him and punish his enemies, after which both parties were commanded to appear in Rome with the legate.
[[File:Stanislav Dospavski - Saints Cyril and Methodius.png|thumb|upright|[[Saint]] Cyril and Methodius by [[Stanislav Dospevski]], [[Bulgaria]]n painter]]
The papal will prevailed, and Methodius secured his freedom and his archiepiscopal authority over both Great Moravia and Pannonia, though the use of Slavonic for the mass was still denied to him. His authority was restricted in Pannonia when after Koceľ's death the principality was administered by German nobles; but [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]] now ruled with practical independence in Great Moravia, and expelled the German clergy. This apparently secured an undisturbed field of operation for Methodius, and the ''Vita'' (x.) depicts the next few years (873–879) as a period of fruitful progress. Methodius seems to have disregarded, wholly or in part, the prohibition of the Slavonic liturgy; and when [[Franks|Frankish]] clerics again found their way into the country, and the archbishop's strictness had displeased the licentious Svatopluk, this was made a cause of complaint against him at Rome, coupled with charges regarding the ''[[Filioque clause|Filioque]]''.

Methodius vindicated his orthodoxy at Rome, the more easily as the creed was still recited there without the ''Filioque'', and promised to obey in regard to the liturgy. The other party was conciliated by giving him a [[Swabia]]n, {{Not a typo|Wiching}}, as his coadjutor. When relations were strained between the two, John VIII steadfastly supported Methodius; but after his death (December 882) the archbishop's position became insecure, and his need of support induced Goetz to accept the statement of the ''Vita'' (xiii.) that he went to visit the Eastern emperor.

It was not until after Methodius' death, which is placed on 6 April 885,&lt;ref&gt;Житїе Меөодїя (Life of Methodius), title &amp; chap. XVIII - [http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=2164 available on-line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305205114/http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=2164 |date=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the animosity erupted into an open conflict. Gorazd, whom Methodius had designated as his successor, was not recognised by [[Pope Stephen V]]. The same Pope forbade the use of the Slavic liturgy&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, Lives of the Popes, (HarperCollins, 2000), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and placed the infamous {{Not a typo|Wiching}} as Methodius' successor. The latter exiled the disciples of the two brothers from Great Moravia in 885.  They fled to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], where they were welcomed and commissioned to establish theological schools.  There they and scholar Saint Clement of Ohrid&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/in-pictures-ohrid-home-of-cyrillic-05-23-2018&lt;/ref&gt; devised the [[Cyrillic script]] on the basis of the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]].  Cyrillic gradually replaced Glagolitic as the alphabet of the Old Church Slavonic  language, which became the official language of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] and later spread to the Eastern Slav lands of [[Kievan Rus']]. Cyrillic eventually spread throughout most of the Slavic world to become the standard alphabet in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Slavic countries.  Hence, Cyril and Methodius' efforts also paved the way for the spread of Christianity throughout Eastern Europe.

Methodius' body was buried in the main cathedral church of Great Moravia. Until today it remains an open question which city was capital of Great Moravia and therefore the place of Methodius' eternal rest remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Short Life of Cyril &amp; Methodius. Translated by Ján STANISLAV: Životy slovanských apoštolov Cyrila a Metoda v legendách a listoch. Turčiansky Sv. Martin: Matica slovenská, 1950, p. 88. (Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of the Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets==
[[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Baška tablet]] is an early example of the Glagolitic from [[Croatia]].]]
[[File:Cyril and Methodius - Bulgarian cartoon, 1938.jpg|thumb|A cartoon about Saints Cyril and Methodius from Bulgaria in 1938. The caption reads : ''Brother Cyril, go tell those who are inside to learn the alphabet so they know freedom ({{lang-bg|свобода}}) and eradication ({{lang-bg|слободия}}) are not the same.'']]
The Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets are the oldest known Slavic [[alphabet]]s, and were created by the two brothers and their students, to translate the [[Bible]] and other texts into the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name=BritGlago&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Major alphabets of the world, Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets'', 2008, O.Ed. "The two early Slavic alphabets, the Cyrillic and the Glagolitic, were invented by St. Cyril, or Constantine (c. 827–869), and St. Methodius (c. 825–884). These men were Greeks from Thessalonica who became apostles to the southern Slavs, whom they converted to Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Glagolitic alphabet was used in Great Moravia between 863 (the arrival of Cyril and Methodius) and 885 (the expulsion of their students) for government and religious documents and books, and at the Great Moravian Academy (''Veľkomoravské učilište'') founded by Cyril, where followers of Cyril and Methodius were educated, by Methodius himself among others. The alphabet has been traditionally attributed to Cyril. That attribution has been confirmed explicitly by the papal letter ''Industriae tuae'' (880) approving the use of Old Church Slavonic, which says that the alphabet was "invented by Constantine the Philosopher". The term invention need not exclude the possibility of the brothers having made use of earlier letters, but implies only that before that time the Slavic languages had no distinct script of their own.

The [[early Cyrillic alphabet]] was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire&lt;ref name="Paul Cubberley 1996"&gt;Paul Cubberley (1996) "The Slavic Alphabets"&lt;/ref&gt; and later finalized and spread by disciples Kliment and Naum in the Ohrid and Preslav schools of Tsar [[Boris I]] of Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Bright, eds. ''The World's Writing Systems.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-507993-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a simplification of the Glagolitic alphabet which more closely resembled the [[Greek language|Greek]] alphabet. It was developed  by the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius at the [[Preslav Literary School]] at the end of the 9th century.

After the death of Cyril, [[Clement of Ohrid]] accompanied Methodius from Rome to Pannonia and Great Moravia. After the death of Methodius in 885, Clement headed the struggle against the German clergy in Great Moravia along with Gorazd. After spending some time in jail, he was expelled from Great Moravia, and in 885 or 886 reached the borders of the Bulgarian Empire together with [[Saint Naum|Naum]] of [[Preslav]], Angelarius, and possibly Gorazd (according to other sources, Gorazd was already dead by that time). The four of them were afterwards sent to the Bulgarian capital of [[Pliska]], where they were commissioned by Tsar [[Boris I]] of Bulgaria to instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavonic language.

After the adoption of Christianity in 865, religious ceremonies in Bulgaria were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the adoption of the Old Slavonic language as a way to preserve the political independence and stability of Bulgaria, so he established two literary schools (academies), in Pliska and [[Ohrid]], where theology was to be taught in the Slavonic language. While [[Naum of Preslav]] stayed in Pliska working on the foundation of the [[Pliska Literary School]], Clement was commissioned by Boris I to organise the teaching of theology to future clergymen in Old Church Slavonic at the [[Ohrid Literary School]]. For seven years (886-893)  Clement taught some 3,500 students in the Slavonic language and the Glagolitic alphabet.

==Commemoration==
===Saints Cyril and Methodius' Day===
[[File:Cross Procession in Novosibirsk 04.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Saints Cyril and Methodius procession]]
The [[canonization]] process was much more relaxed in the decades following Cyril's death than today. Cyril was regarded by his disciples as a saint soon after his death. His following spread among the nations he evangelized and subsequently to the wider Christian Church, and he was famous as a holy man, along with his brother Methodius. There were calls for Cyril's canonization from the crowds lining the Roman streets during his funeral procession. The brothers' first appearance in a papal document is in ''Grande Munus'' of Leo XIII in 1880. They are known as the "Apostles of the Slavs", and are still highly regarded by both Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians. Their [[feast day]] is currently celebrated on 14 February in the Roman Catholic Church (to coincide with the date of St Cyril's death); on 11 May in the Eastern Orthodox Church (though for Eastern Orthodox Churches which use the [[Julian Calendar]] this is 24 May according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]); and on 7 July according to the old sanctoral calendar that existed before the revisions of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The celebration also commemorates the introduction of literacy and the preaching of the gospels in the Slavonic language by the brothers. The brothers were declared "Patrons of Europe" in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/Martis/contents/doc19.html|title=Nikolaos Martis: MACEDONIA|author=|date=|website=www.hri.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502164052/http://www.hri.org/Martis/contents/doc19.html|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to old Bulgarian chronicles, the day of the holy brothers was celebrated ecclesiastically as early as the 11th century. The first recorded secular celebration of Saints Cyril and Methodius' Day as the "Day of the Bulgarian script", as traditionally accepted by [[Bulgarian history]], was held in the town of [[Plovdiv]] on 11 May 1851, when a local Bulgarian school was named "Saints Cyril and Methodius": both acts on the initiative of the prominent Bulgarian educator [[Nayden Gerov]],&lt;ref&gt;"История на България", Том 6 Българско Възраждане 1856–1878, Издателство на Българската академия на науките, София, 1987, стр. 106 (in Bulgarian; in English: "History of Bulgaria", Volume 6 Bulgarian Revival 1856–1878, Publishing house of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, 1987, page 106).&lt;/ref&gt; although an Armenian traveller mentioned his visit to the "celebration of the Bulgarian script" in the town of [[Shumen]] on 22 May 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilee speech of the Academician Ivan Yuhnovski, Head of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, held on 23 May 2003, published in [http://195.96.224.7/basnews/bulletin/Bul62.pdf Information Bulletin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203045117/http://195.96.224.7/basnews/bulletin/Bul62.pdf |date=3 December 2007 }} of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 3(62), Sofia, 27 June 2003 (in Bulgarian).&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]] in the following countries:

* In [[Bulgaria]] it is celebrated on 24 May and is known as the "Bulgarian Education and Culture, and Slavonic Script Day" (Bulgarian: Ден на българската просвета и култура и на славянската писменост), a [[Public holidays in Bulgaria|national holiday]] celebrating [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian culture]] and [[Bulgarian literature|literature]] as well as the alphabet. It is also known as "Alphabet, Culture, and Education Day" (Bulgarian: Ден на азбуката, културата и просвещението). Saints Cyril and Methodius are patrons of the National Library of Bulgaria. There is a monument to them in front of the library. Saints Cyril and Methodius are the most celebrated saints in the Bulgarian Orthodox church, and icons of the two brothers can be found in every church.
* In the [[Republic of Macedonia]], it is celebrated on 24 May and is known as the "Saints Cyril and Methodius, Slavonic Enlighteners' Day" ({{lang-mk|Св. Кирил и Методиј, Ден на словенските просветители}}), a [[Public holidays in the Republic of Macedonia|national holiday]]. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia enacted a statute of the national holiday in October 2006 and the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia passed a corresponding law at the beginning of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Announcement about the eleventh session of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 October 2006 from the [http://www.vlada.mk/sednici/Oktomvri2006/sednica24-10-2006.htm official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610142420/http://www.vlada.mk/sednici/Oktomvri2006/sednica24-10-2006.htm |date=10 June 2008 }} of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (in Macedonian).&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it had only been celebrated in the schools. It is also known as the day of the "[[Thessaloniki|Solun]] Brothers" ({{lang-mk|Солунските браќа}}).
* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the two brothers were originally commemorated on 9 March, but [[Pope Pius IX]] changed this date to 5 July for several reasons.&lt;ref name="CMHoliday"/&gt; Today, Saints Cyril and Methodius are revered there as national saints and their name day (5 July), "Sts Cyril and Methodius Day" is a [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic|national holiday in Czech Republic]] and [[National holidays in Slovakia|Slovakia]]. In the Czech Republic it is celebrated as "Slavic Missionaries Cyril and Methodius Day" (Czech: Den slovanských věrozvěstů Cyrila a Metoděje); in [[Slovakia]] it is celebrated as "St. Cyril and Metod Day" (Slovak: Sviatok svätého Cyrila a Metoda).&lt;ref name="CMHoliday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/cmholiday.html |title=Holiday date |accessdate=11 March 2009 |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514063632/http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/cmholiday.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Russia]], it is celebrated on 24 May and is known as the "Slavonic Literature and Culture Day" (Russian: День славянской письменности и культуры), celebrating Slavonic culture and literature as well as the alphabet. Its celebration is ecclesiastical (11 May in the Church's [[Julian calendar]]). It is not a public holiday in Russia.

The saints' [[feast day]] is celebrated by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on 11 May and by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]] on 14 February as "[[Saints Cyril and Methodius Day]]". The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]] of Western Christianity commemorate the two saints either on 14 February or 11 May. The [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Rite Lutheran Churches]] celebrate Saints Cyril and Methodius Day on 24 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrlc.org/?p=227|title=День Св.

'''Tableware''' are the '''dishes''' or '''dishware''' used for setting a table, serving food and dining. It includes [[cutlery]], [[List of glassware|glassware]], serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=Bloomfield&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Linda|title=Contemporary tableware|date=2013|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|location=London|isbn=9781408153956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venable&gt;{{cite book|last=Venable|first=Charles L.|display-authors=etal|title=China and Glass in America, 1880-1980: From Table Top to TV Tray|year=2000|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-6692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, [[cuisine]] and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/tableware|title=Tableware |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dinnerware" is another term used to refer to tableware and "crockery" refers to [[porcelain]] and [[bone china]] produced by makers such as [[Sèvres]] in France, [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] in Germany, [[Royal Copenhagen]] in Denmark, [[Royal Doulton]] in England, or [[Belleek Pottery]] in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=English porcelain and bone china | author1=Hughes, G. Bernard (George Bernard), 1896-  | author2=Hughes, Therle  | year=1955  | publisher=Lutterworth Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of dishes are referred to as a table service, dinner service or service set. [[Table setting]]s or place settings are the dishes, cutlery and glassware used for formal and informal dining. In Ireland such items are normally referred to as ''delph'', the word being an English language phonetic spelling of the word ''delft'', the town from which so much [[delftware]] came. [[Silver service]] or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal.

Setting the table refers to arranging the tableware, including individual [[place setting]]s for each diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion. Tableware and table decoration is typically more elaborate for special occasions. Unusual dining locations demand tableware be adapted.

==Materials==
[[File:WLANL - jpa2003 - Gedekte tafel.jpg|thumb|[[Pewter]] and old glass tableware]]

Dishes are usually made of ceramic materials such as [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], [[faience]], bone china or porcelain. However, they can be made of other materials such as [[wood]], [[pewter]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[glass]], [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] and [[plastic]]. Before it was possible to purchase mass-produced tableware, it was fashioned from available materials, such as wood. [[Industrialisation]] and developments in ceramic manufacture made inexpensive washable tableware available. It is sold either by the piece or as a matched set for a number of diners, normally four, six, eight, or twelve place settings. Large quantities are purchased for use in restaurants. Individual pieces, such as those needed as replacement pieces for broken dishes, can be procured from "open stock" [[inventory]] at shops, or from antique dealers if the pattern is no longer in production.

==Ownership==
Possession of tableware has to a large extent been determined by individual wealth; the greater the means, the higher was the quality of tableware that was owned and the more numerous its pieces. In the [[London]] of the 13th century, the more affluent citizens owned fine furniture and silver, "while those of straiter means possessed only the simplest pottery and kitchen utensils." By the later 16th century, "even the poorer citizens dined off pewter rather than wood" and had plate, jars and pots made from "green glazed earthenware".&lt;ref name=Ackroyd&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Peter Ackroyd]]|title=London: the biography|date=2003|publisher=Anchor books|location=New York|isbn=0385497717|edition=1st Anchor Books}}p.55, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility often used their arms on [[heraldic china]].

==Table decoration==
[[File:Zuckerplastik zur Freiheitsidee 1880 Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|Sugar sculpture (1880)]]
Tableware is generally the functional part of the settings on dining tables but great attention has been paid to the purely decorative aspects, especially when dining is regarded as part of [[entertainment]] such as in [[banquet]]s given by important people or special events, such as State occasions.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savage|first1=George|title=Dictionary of Antiques|date=1970|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|location=London|isbn=0214652459|pages=419–420|edition=[2nd rep.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table decoration may be ephemeral and consist of items made from [[confectionery]] or wax - substances commonly employed in Roman banqueting tables of the 17th century. During the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], ephemeral table decoration was done by men known as "table-deckers" who used sand and similar substances to create [[marmotinto]] works (sand painting) for single-use decoration.&lt;ref name=Savage/&gt; In modern times, ephemeral table decorations continue to be made from sugar or carved from [[Ice sculpture|ice]].

In wealthy countries such as 17th century France, table decorations for the aristocracy were sometimes made of silver. One of the most famous table decorations is the ''[[Cellini Salt Cellar]]''. Ephemeral and silver table decorations were replaced with porcelain items after its reinvention in Europe in the 16th century.

==Western tableware==
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006279 017 Porträt einer alten Frau.jpg|thumb|left|Setting the table for a family meal, [[Leipzig]] (1952)]]

===Table settings===
{{further|Place setting}}
A table setting in Western countries is mainly in one of two styles: ''[[service à la russe]]'' (French for "in the [[Russian Empire|Russian style]]"), where each course of the meal is brought out in specific order; and ''[[service à la française]]'' (French for "in the French style"), where all the courses for the meal are arranged on the table and presented at the same time that guests are seated. ''Service à la russe'' has become the custom in most restaurants, whereas ''[[service à la française]]'' is the norm in family settings.

Place settings for ''service à la russe'' dining are arranged according to the number of courses in the meal. The tableware is arranged in a particular order. With the first course, each guest at the table begins by using the tableware placed on the outside of place setting. As each course is finished the guest leaves the used cutlery on the used plate or bowl, which are removed from the table by the server. In some case, the original set is kept for the next course. To begin the next course, the diner uses the next item on the outside of the place setting, and so on. Forks are placed on the left of a dinner plate, knives to the right of the plate, and spoons to the outer right side of the place setting.

===Plates and bowls===
[[File:Formal 01.jpg|thumb|''Service à la russe'' formal place setting showing glassware for a range of beverages]]
[[File:Palais-Niel couverts.JPG|thumb|Table laid out for a banquet in [[Toulouse]] at the Palais Niel (2010)&lt;br&gt;'''''Plates''''' Dinner plate with rolled table napkin; small bread plate above forks.&lt;br&gt;
'''''Glasses''''' Small glass for water, larger one behind for red wine, and smaller wine glass for white wine.&lt;br&gt;
'''''Cutlery''''' (from the outside toward the plate) Fish cutlery (knife and fork, as fish will be served without any sauce, otherwise it would be a fish spoon (cuillère à gourmet)); meat cutlery and cheese or fruit cutlery, the end of the knife rests on a knife rest. Above the plate, dessert cutlery (spoon and fork). ]]

Items of tableware include a variety of [[Plate (dishware)|plates]], [[Bowl (vessel)|bowls]]; or cups for individual diners and a range of serving dishes to transport the food from the kitchen or to separate smaller dishes. Plates include [[Charger (table setting)|charger plates]] as well as specific dinner plates, lunch plates, dessert plates, salad plates or side plates. Bowls include those used for soup, cereal, pasta, fruit or dessert.  A range of [[saucer]]s accompany plates and bowls, those designed to go with teacups, coffee cups, demitasses and cream soup bowls. There are also individual covered casserole dishes.

Dishes come in standard sizes, which are set according to the manufacturer. They are similar throughout the industry. Plates are standardised in descending order of [[diameter]] size according to function. One standard series is [[charger (table setting)|charger]] (12 inches); [[dinner plate]] (10.5 inches); [[dessert plate]] (8.5 inches) [[salad plate]] (7.5 inches); [[side plate]], [[tea plate]] (6.75 inches).

===Drinkware===
{{Main|Glassware|Lead crystal}}

Glasses and [[mug]]s of various types are an important part of tableware, as beverages are important parts of a meal. Vessels to hold alcoholic beverages such as [[Wine glass|wine]], whether [[Red wine|red]], [[White wine|white]], [[Sparkling wine|sparkling]] tend to be quite specialised in form, with for example [[Port wine]] glasses, [[beer glass]]es, [[Snifter|brandy balloons]], [[aperitif]] and [[liqueur]] glasses all having different shapes. [[Water glass]]es, [[juice]] glasses and [[hot chocolate]] mugs are also differentiated. Their appearance as part of the tableware depends on the meal and the style of table arrangement.

Tea and coffee tend to involve strong social rituals and so [[teacup]]s and, coffee cups (including [[demitasse]] cups) have a shape that depends on the culture and the social situation in which the drink is taken.

===Cutlery===
{{Main|Cutlery|List of eating utensils|Silver (household)}}
{{Category see also|Silversmiths by nationality}}

Cutlery is an important part of tableware. A basic formal place setting will usually have a dinner plate at the centre, resting on a [[charger (table setting)|charger]]. The rest of the place setting depends upon the first course, which may be soup, salad or fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Marion|title=The Fannie Farmer Cookbook|year=1996|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.|isbn=0679450815|page=817}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[soup]] is the first course, to the left of the [[dinner]] [[Plate (dishware)|plate]], moving clockwise, are placed a small salad fork to the left of the dinner plate; a large dinner fork to the left of the salad fork; a side plate above the forks; a wine or water glass above and to the right of the dinner plate; a large dinner knife to the right of the dinner plate; a smaller butter knife to the right of the dinner knife; a dinner spoon to the right of the knives; a [[soup spoon]] to the right of the dinner spoon.
* If [[salad]] is the first course, the soup spoon is skipped. The dinner fork is placed immediately left of the dinner plate; the salad fork is placed on the outer left side of the place setting.

In either arrangement, the napkin may either rest folded underneath the [[fork]]s, or it may be folded and placed on the dinner plate.

When more courses are being served, place settings may become more elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and [[pastry fork]]. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table.

===Serving dishes===
[[File:Service à thé à la menthe .JPG|thumb|left|Tableware for serving mint tea]]
A wide range of serving dishes are used to transport food from kitchen to table or to serve it at table, in order to make food service easier and cleaner or more efficient and pleasant. Serving dishes include: [[butter dish]]es; [[casserole]]s; [[fruit]] bowls; [[ramekin]]s or lidded serving bowls; [[compote]]s; [[Pitcher (container)|pitchers]] or [[Jug (container)|jugs]]; [[Platter (dishware)|platters]], [[salver]]s, and [[tray]]s; [[salt and pepper shakers]] or [[salt cellar]]s;   [[Sauce boat|sauce or gravy boats]]; [[tureen]]s and [[tajine]]s; [[vegetable]] or [[salad]] bowls.

A range of items specific to the serving of tea or coffee also have long cultural traditions. They include [[teapot]]s and [[coffee pot]]s as well as [[samovar]]s, [[Sugar bowl (dishware)|sugar bowls]]; [[Creamer (vessel)|milk or cream jugs]].

=== Place markers ===
Place markers are used to designate assigned seats to guests.  They are typically used at large formal functions such as weddings, banquets for dignitaries, politicians or diplomats as well as on special occasions such as large children's parties. Some are collectible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Place marker|url=http://www.horniman.ac.uk/object/1989.114|publisher=Horniman Museum and Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese tableware==
[[File:Chinese Cutlery.jpg|thumb|A place setting for a Chinese meal]]
[[File:Table Service MET DT11573.jpg|thumb|upright|A c. 1785-90 Chinese set of tableware for the American market]]
Chinese [[Table setting|table settings]] are traditional in style. Table setting practices in Japan and other parts of East Asia have been influenced by Chinese [[Table (furniture)|table]] setting customs.&lt;ref name="KotschevarLuciani"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kotschevar, Lendal H.  |author2=Valentino Luciani |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Presenting Service: The Ultimate Guide for the Foodservice Professional|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471475781|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis in Chinese table settings is on displaying each individual food in a pleasing way, usually in separate bowls or dishes. Formal table settings are based upon the arrangements used in a family setting, although they can become extremely elaborate with many dishes. Serving bowls and dishes are brought to the table, where guests can choose their own portions. Formal [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese restaurants]] often use a large turning wheel in the centre of the table to rotate [[food]] for easier service.

In a family setting, a meal typically includes a ''fan'' dish, which constitutes the meal's base (much like bread forms the base of various sandwiches), and several accompanying mains, called ''cai'' dish (''choi'' or ''seoung'' in Cantonese). More specifically, ''fan'' usually refers to cooked rice, but can also be other staple grain-based foods. If the [[meal]] is a light meal, it will  typically include the base and one main dish. The base is often served directly to the guest in a bowl, whereas main [[Dish (food)|dishes]] are chosen by the guest from shared serving dishes on the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Jacqueline M.|title=Food Culture in China|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313325816|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Place setting
An "elaborate" formal meal would include the following place setting:&lt;ref name="KotschevarLuciani"/&gt;
* Centre plate, about 6 inches in diameter
* Rice bowl, placed to the right of the centre plate
* Small cup of [[tea]], placed above the plate or rice bowl
* [[Chopsticks]] to the right of the centre plate, on a [[chopstick rest]]
* A long-handled spoon on a spoon rest, placed to the left of the chopsticks
* Small condiment dishes, placed above the centre plate
* Soup bowl, placed to the left above the centre plate
* A soup [[spoon]], inside the soup bowl

==Japanese tableware==
[[File:New Year sake set with images of cranes from Japan, lacquer on wood, late 19th century.JPG|thumb|New Year [[sake]] set with images of cranes, lacquer on wood (Japan, late 19th century)]]
[[File:Japan table setting.jpg|thumb|A Japanese table setting.]]

Japanese ceramic tableware is an industry that is many centuries old. Unlike in Western cultures, where tableware is often produced and bought in matching sets, Japanese tableware is set on the table so that each dish complements the type of food served in it. Since Japanese meals normally include several small amounts of each food per person, this means that each person has a place setting with several different small dishes and bowls for holding individual food and condiments. The emphasis in a Japanese table setting is on enhancing the appearance of the food, which is partially achieved by showing  contrasts between the items. Each bowl and dish may have a different shape, colour or pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Dave|title=The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi: Everything You Need to Know about Sushi Varieties and Accompaniments, Etiquette and Dining Tips, and More|year=2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=9781458764140|pages=313–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Place setting
A basic complete place setting for one person in Japan would include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moriyama|first=Naomi|title=Japanese Women Don't Get Old or Fat: Secrets of My Mother's Tokyo Kitchen|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital |isbn=9780385339988|pages=74–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hot noodle bowl
* Rice bowl
* Soup bowl
* Two to three shallow 3- to 5-inch diameter dishes
* Two to three 3- to 5-inch diameter, 1- to 3-inch-deep bowls
* Two square or rectangular pieces, traditionally served for serving fish
* Three 2- to 3-inch diameter condiment plates
* Cold noodle tray with bamboo strainer
* Dipping sauce cup
* [[Chopstick]]s and [[chopstick rest]]

Not all of these plates and bowls would be necessary for one meal. A rice bowl, a soup bowl, two or three small dishes with accompanying foods, and two or three condiment dishes for person would be typical. Various serving bowls and platters would also be set on a table for a typical meal, along with a soy sauce [[cruet]], a small pitcher for [[tempura]] or other sauce, and a tea setting of tea pot, tea cups and tea cup saucers.

Tableware for special circumstances has to be adapted. Dining in the outdoors, for example, whether for recreational purposes, as on a [[picnic]] or as part of a journey, project or mission requires specialised tableware. It must be portable, more robust and if possible, lighter in weight than tableware used indoors. It is usually carefully packed for transportation to the place where it will be used.

'''''The Romance of Yachting''''' (full title: The Romance of Yachting: Voyage The First) is an 1848 work by [[Joseph C. Hart]] published by Harper and Brothers. The work is considered notable for being the first work to  claim that [[William Shakespeare]] was not the true author of the plays that are attributed to him&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Wyman (2003), ''Bibliography of the Bacon-Shakespeare Controversy with Notes and Extracts'', Kessinger Publishing Co, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The work was for a long time overlooked in the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] debate with an article in the ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' generally being treated by all authorities as the first work that questioned whether Shakespeare was the true author. References to ''The Romance of Yachting'' first appeared in ''The Bibliography of the Bacon-Shakespeare Literature''. Despite its title, the book has little to say about yachting and has been described as a 'kind of horn book of digression'.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Friedman, Elizabeth S. Friedman (2011) ''The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined: An analysis of cryptographic systems used as evidence that some author other than William Shakespeare wrote the plays commonly attributed to him'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Wyman characterise the work as a 'gossipy account of a voyage to Spain'.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Wyman (2003), ''Bibliography of the Bacon-Shakespeare Controversy with Notes and Extracts'', Kessinger Publishing Co, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2006 - In Conservative Judaism, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] makes the movement's decisions concerning [[Conservative Halakha|Jewish law]]. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three distinct [[Responsum|responsa]] reflecting very different approaches to homosexuality. One [[responsum]] substantially liberalized Conservative Judaism's approach including lifting most (but not all) classical prohibitions on homosexual conduct and permitted the blessing of homosexual unions and the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. Two others completely retained traditional prohibitions. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, the adoption of multiple opinions permits individual Conservative rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to select which opinion to accept, and hence to choose individually whether to maintain a traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, or to permit openly gay/lesbian/bisexual unions and clergy. The liberalizing responsum, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 of 25 votes, was authored by Rabbis [[Elliot N. Dorff]], Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. It lifted most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opened the way to the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbis and cantors and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopped short of religiously recognizing same-sex marriage. The responsum invoked the [[Talmud|Talmudic principle]] of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot|kavod habriyot]]'', which the authors translated as "human dignity", as authority for this approach. The responsum maintained a prohibition on male-male anal sex, which it described as the sole Biblically prohibited homosexual act. This act remains a ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor'' ("[[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law|die rather than transgress]]" offense) under the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Elliott N.

* 2010 - TorahWeb.org published a brief position statement entitled "Torah View on Homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2010/homosexuality.html |title=Torah View on Homosexuality |publisher=Torahweb |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-authored by [[Hershel Schachter|Rav Hershel Schachter]], [[Mordechai Willig|Rav Mordechai Willig]], [[Michael Rosensweig|Rav Michael Rosensweig]], and [[Mayer Twersky|Rav Mayer Twersky]]. These four are all [[rosh yeshiva|roshei yeshiva]] (i.e., rabbinic leaders) at the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] at [[Yeshiva University]], the largest and most influential [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbinic program in America. In part, the statement reads:

"::... Prohibited homosexual activity includes any non-platonic physical contact; even ''yichud'' (seclusion) with someone of the same gender is forbidden for homosexually active individuals. ...

::... today's ''galus'' [exile] seeks to legitimize and mainstream the abominable practice (''toeiva'') of homosexuality. Frighteningly, we who live here are not only practically affected, but also axiologically and ideationally infected. Not only our behavior but our very [[Weltanschauung]] has been compromised and contaminated.

::... Homosexual behavior is absolutely prohibited and constitutes an abomination. Discreet, unconditionally ''[[halacha|halachically]]'' committed Jews who do not practice homosexuality but feel same sex attraction (ssa) should be sympathetically and wholeheartedly supported. They can be wonderful Jews, fully deserving of our love, respect, and support. They should be encouraged to seek professional guidance. Moreover, in an uninfected Torah society, appropriate sympathy for discreet ''shomrei Torah u'mitzvos'' who experience but do not act upon ssa is clearly distinguished from brazen public identification of their ''yetzer hara'' [temptation] for forbidden behavior. ...

::How painful, sad and sobering is the sharp contrast between the clear attitude that should prevail in a pure Torah community and the confusion that exists among well-intentioned individuals within our communities. ... ssa is not viewed as a challenge of ''kevishas hayetzer'' (overcoming and taming impulses for forbidden behavior), but rather as a troubling ''halacha'' lacking in compassion, ''rachmanah litzlan'' [God forbid].

::... Inevitably, with respect to homosexuality, ''Talmud Torah'' [Torah study] will place us at odds with political correctness and the temper of the times. Nevertheless, we must be honest with ourselves, and with ''Hakadosh Baruch Hu'' [God], regardless of political correctness, considerations or consequences."
* 2010 - On July 22, 2010, a "Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community" was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nati Helfgot |date=July 28, 2010 |url=http://statementofprinciplesnya.blogspot.com/ |title=Statement of Principles |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written primarily by [[Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot|Nathaniel Helfgot]], [[Rabbi Aryeh Klapper|Aryeh Klapper]], and [[Rabbi Yitzchak Blau|Yitzchak Blau]]. Signatories include more than a hundred rabbis and laypeople. Some of the statement's more notable supporters are [[Marc D. Angel|Rabbi Marc Angel]], co-founder of [[The Rabbinic Fellowship]]; [[Shlomo Riskin|Rabbi Shlomo Riskin]], founder of [[Lincoln Square Synagogue]], [[Efrat]], and [[Ohr Torah Stone Institutions]]; and [[Avi Weiss|Rabbi Avi Weiss]], head of the [[Hebrew Institute of Riverdale]], founder of [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]] and [[Yeshivat Maharat]], and co-founder of [[The Rabbinic Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137251 |title=RCA: No Female Rabbis |publisher=Israel National News |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement makes it clear that homosexual activity is still prohibited, saying inter alia that "Halakhah sees heterosexual marriage as the ideal model and sole legitimate outlet for human sexual expression"; "Halakhic Judaism views all male and female same-sex sexual interactions as prohibited"; and "halakhic values proscribe individuals and communities from encouraging practices that grant religious legitimacy to gay marriage and couplehood". However, it emphasizes that homosexuals need to be treated with compassion and respect. Some of the statement's points that diverge from other common Orthodox positions are [the asterisk before each point has been removed for clarity]: "We affirm the religious right of those with a homosexual orientation to reject therapeutic approaches they reasonably see as useless or dangerous. We believe that the decision as to whether to be open about one's sexual orientation should be left to such individuals, who should consider their own needs and those of the community. We are opposed on ethical and moral grounds to both the “outing” of individuals who want to remain private and to coercing those who desire to be open about their orientation to keep it hidden. Communities should display sensitivity, acceptance and full embrace of the adopted or biological children of homosexually active Jews in the synagogue and school setting. Jews who have an exclusively homosexual orientation should, under most circumstances, not be encouraged to marry someone of the other gender."

: September 11/12 - '''[[2012 Benghazi Attack]]''' -  when Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith. Stevens was the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979. The attack has also been referred to as the Battle of Benghazi.  Several hours later, a second assault targeted a different compound about one mile away, killing two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. Ten others were also injured in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/332961/lessons-battle-benghazi-clifford-d-may Lessons from the Battle of Benghazi] NationalReview sourced 11 Nov 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

: January 27 - '''[[2015 Corinthia Hotel attack]]''' -  ISIS-affiliated men detonated a car bomb in the parking garage of the hotel. In the chaos, an estimated 5 gunmen stormed past the local guard and entered the hotel, intent on killing guests. Some of the attackers survived the initial contact, leading to a protracted hostage situation. Five foreigners died in the attack: one American, one Frenchman, and three Tajiks (including two women). The attack was carried out by ISIS-affiliated men belonging to the "Islamic State-Tripoli Province".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-bomb-explodes-outside-luxury-hotel-in-libyas-capital-city-of-tripoli-1422351120 |  work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 28 January 2015 | accessdate = 28 January 2015 | title = Gunmen Stage Deadly Attack on Libyan Hotel | first = Benoit | last = Faucon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trabzon''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈtɾɑbzon}}), historically known as '''Trebizond''', is a city on the [[Black Sea]] coast of northeastern [[Turkey]] and the capital of [[Trabzon Province]]. Trabzon, located on the historical [[Silk Road]], became a [[melting pot]] of [[religions]], languages and culture for centuries and a trade gateway to [[Persia]] in the southeast and the [[Caucasus]] to the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/trabzon.htm Trabzon (tr)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103214447/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/trabzon.htm |date=2011-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchants paid visits to Trebizond during the medieval period and sold [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[woolen]] fabric; the Republic of Genoa had an important merchant colony within the city called [[Leonkastron]] that played a role to Trebizond similar to the one [[Galata]] played to [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]).&lt;ref name="latorio"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Miller |title=The Latin Orient |year=2009 |pages=51–54 |publisher=Bibliobazaar LLC|isbn=1-110-86390-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trabzon formed the basis of several states in its long history and was the capital city of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] between [[Fourth Crusade|1204]] and [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|1461]]. During the early modern period, Trabzon, because of the importance of its port, again became a focal point of trade to Persia and the [[Caucasus]].

==Name==
[[File:Trapezus.png|thumb|left|160px|Coin of Trapezous from the 4th century BCE in the [[British Museum]]. The coin promotes the colonial city as a 'table of plenty'.]]
The Turkish name of the city is Trabzon. It is historically known in English as '''Trebizond'''. The first recorded name of the city is Τραπεζοῦς (''Trapezous''), referencing the table-like central hill between the Zağnos (İskeleboz) and Kuzgun streams on which it was founded (''τράπεζα'' meant "table" in [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]; note the table on the coin in the figure.) In [[Latin]], Trabzon was called ''Trapezus'', which is a [[latinization (literature)|latinization]] of its ancient Greek name. Both in [[Pontic Greek language|Pontic Greek]] and Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], it is called Τραπεζούντα (''Trapezounta''). In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], it is written as طربزون. During Ottoman times, ''Tara Bozan'' was also used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rRgYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 Campbell, Lawrence Dundas, ''The Asiatic annual register, or, A View of the history of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce, Literature of Asia'', London 1802 Page 3, Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malte-Brun, Conrad, ''Universal geography: or a description of all parts of the world ...'', Volume 2 Google Books link: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KNwuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_53iqKU0A5gC&amp;pg=PA92|title=The modern traveller, a popular description geographical, historical, and topographical of the varieus countries of the globe|date=14 January 2018|publisher=J.

In [[Laz language|Laz]] it is known as ტამტრა (''T'amt'ra'') or ''T'rap'uzani'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lazuri.com/lazuri_ceviri/index.php|title=Türkçe Lazca sözlük / Çeviri / Online Çeviri / Lazuri.Com|first=|last=Y.Dutxuri|website=www.Lazuri.com|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] it is ტრაპიზონი (''T'rap'izoni'') and in Armenian it is [[wikt:Տրապիզոն|Տրապիզոն]] ''Trapizon''. The 19th-century Armenian travelling priest Byjiskian called the city by other, native names, including ''Hurşidabat'' and ''Ozinis''.&lt;ref&gt;Özhan Öztürk claims that Ozinis means "flat place" in Laz language and Hurşidabat means "City of the Sun" in Persian/Ottoman language.

Before the city was founded as a Greek colony the area was dominated by Colchian (Caucasian) and Chaldian (Anatolian) tribes. It is possible that the settlement origins of Trabzon go back to these tribes. The [[Hayasa]], who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian [[Hittites]] in the 14th century BCE, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the [[Macrones]] and the [[Chalybes]] as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the [[Laz people|Laz]], who were part of the monarchy of the [[Colchis]], together with other related [[Kartvelians|Georgian]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''Phoenix: The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus'' by Charles Burney, David Marshall Lang, Phoenix Press; New Ed edition (December 31, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition (December 1994), Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}, page 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timothygrove.blogspot.ro/2012_07_01_archive.html|title=A Star in the East|website=TimothyGrove.Blogspot.ro|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greek sources the city was founded in [[classical antiquity]] in 756 BCE as Τραπεζοῦς (''Trapezous''), by [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] traders from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]]. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian ''emporia'' or [[colonies in antiquity|trading colonies]] along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] and [[Cyzicus]] in the [[Dardanelles]], and nearby [[Giresun|Kerasous]]. Like most [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested occurring in the city already in the 4th century BCE, according to a silver [[drachma]] coin from Trapezus in the [[British Museum]], London. [[Cyrus the Great]] added the city to the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a [[satrapy]]).

[[File:The Return of the Ten Thousand under Xenophon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Thálatta! Thálatta! ("The Sea! The Sea!").&lt;br&gt; Trebizond was the first Greek city the [[Ten Thousand]] reached on their retreat from Persia. 19th c. illustration by Herman Vogel.]]

Trebizond's trade partners included the [[Mossynoeci]]. When [[Xenophon]] and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]] mercenaries were fighting their way out of [[Persia]], the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, ''Anabasis'', 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.

Up until the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god [[Mithra]]. In the 2nd century BCE the city with its natural harbours was added to the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] by [[Pharnaces I of Pontus|Pharnaces I]]. [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.

After the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BCE the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Galatia]] two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the ''[[Roman Navy#Classis Pontica|Classis Pontica]]''. The city received the status of [[Free city (classical antiquity)|civitas libera]], extending it judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trabzon gained importance for its access to roads leading over the [[Zigana Pass]] to the [[Armenia]]n frontier or the upper [[Euphrates]] valley. New roads were constructed from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] under the rule of [[Vespasian]]. In the next century, the emperor [[Hadrian]] commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor.&lt;ref name=Miller-9&gt;[[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]], ''Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire'', 1926, (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1968), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border ([[limes]]). A [[mithraeum]] now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (''Kızlar Manastırı'') in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.

[[File:Aquila, Valerian, Eugene and Candidus of Trebizond (Menologion of Basil II).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Martyrdom of Eugenius, Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila. Work dated to 985, [[Vatican Library]].]][[File:Trabzon City walls and Aquaduct.JPG|thumb|230px|Parts of the [[Walls of Trabzon|city walls of Trabzon]] and the Eugenius Aqueduct are among the oldest remaining structures in the city.]]
Trebizond was greatly affected by two events over the following centuries: in the civil war between [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], the city suffered for its support of the latter, and in 257 the city was pillaged by the [[Goths]], despite reportedly being defended by "10,000 above its usual garrison", and being defended by two bands of walls.&lt;ref name=Miller-9/&gt;

Although Trebizond was rebuilt after being pillaged by the Goths in 257 and the Persians in 258, the city did not soon recover. Only in the reign of [[Diocletian]] appears an inscription alluding to the restoration of the city; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] could only write of Trebizond that it was "not an obscure town." [[Christianity]] had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of [[Eugenius of Trebizond|Eugenius]] and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenius had destroyed the statue of [[Mithras]] which overlooked the city from [[Mount Minthrion]] (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established [[Vazelon Monastery]] in 270 AD and [[Sumela Monastery]] in 386 AD. As early as the [[First Council of Nicea]], Trebizond had its own bishop.&lt;ref name="Hewsen46"&gt;Hewsen, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the [[Metropolitan Bishop]] of [[Poti]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen46" /&gt; Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of [[Lazica]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen46" /&gt;

By the time of [[Justinian]], the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general [[Belisarius]] "long adorned the church of St. Basil."&lt;ref name=Miller-11&gt;Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls following an earthquake at Justinian's expense.&lt;ref name=Miller-11/&gt; At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a [[quadrivium]] curriculum. The university drew students not just from the Byzantine Empire, but from Armenia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Calzolari, V. "The Armenian translation of the Greek Neoplatonic Works" in ''Greek Texts and Armenian Traditions: An Interdisciplinary Approach'', 2016, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The city regained importance when it became the seat of the theme of [[Chaldia]]. Trebizond also benefited when the trade route regained importance in the 8th to 10th centuries; 10th-century Muslim authors note that Trebizond was frequented by Muslim merchants, as the main source transshipping [[Byzantine silk]]s into eastern Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant, ''Islamic Textiles: material for a history up to the Mongol conquest'', 1972, pp 63, 213, noted by David Jacoby, "Silk Economics and Cross-Cultural Artistic Interaction: Byzantium, the Muslim World, and the Christian West", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''58''' (2004:197-240)  p. 219 note 112.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 10th century [[Arabs|Arab]] geographer [[Abu'l-Fida|Abul Feda]] it was regarded as being largely a [[Lazica|Lazian]] port. The Italian maritime republics such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and in particular the [[Republic of Genoa]] were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries, using Trabzon as an important seaport for trading goods between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="latorio"/&gt; Some of the [[Silk Road]] caravans carrying goods from Asia stopped at the port of Trebizond, where the European merchants purchased these goods and carried them to the port cities of Europe with ships. This trade provided a source of revenue to the state in the form of custom duties, or ''kommerkiaroi'', levied on the goods sold in Trebizond.&lt;ref&gt;Speros Vryonis, ''The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century'' (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks protected the coastal and inland trade routes with a vast network of garrison forts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Edwards, “The Garrison Forts of the Pontos: A Case for the Diffusion of the Armenian Paradigm,” ''Revue des Études Arméniennes'' 19, 1985, pp.181-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, Trebizond came under [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] rule. This rule proved transient when an expert soldier and local aristocrat, [[Theodore Gabras]] took control of the city from the Turkish invaders, and regarded Trebizond, in the words of [[Anna Comnena]], "as a prize which had fallen to his own lot" and ruled it as his own kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting Comnena's assertion, Simon Bendall has identified a group of rare coins he believes were minted by Gabras and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Bendall, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42666585 . "The Mint of Trebizond under Alexius I and the Gabrades"], ''Numismatic Chronicle'', Seventh Series, '''17''' (1977), pp. 126-136&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was killed by the Turks in 1098, other members of his family continued his de facto independent rule into the next century.

The [[Empire of Trebizond]] was formed after [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] [[Georgian expedition to Chaldia|expedition]] in [[Chaldia]],&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Vasiliev, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2846872 "The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1222)"], ''Speculum'', '''11''' (1936), pp. 18f&lt;/ref&gt; commanded by [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios]] [[Komnenos]] a few weeks before the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]]. Located at the far northeastern corner of [[Anatolia]], it was the longest surviving of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] successor states. Byzantine authors, such as [[George Pachymeres|Pachymeres]], and to some extent Trapezundines such as [[John Lazaropoulos|Lazaropoulos]] and [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a [[Lazica|Lazian]] border state. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the [[Laskaris|Lascaris]] and later with the [[Palaiologos]], the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finlay, George.

Geographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of little more than a narrow strip along the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]], and not much further inland than the [[Pontic Mountains]]. However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trabzon. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification "Leonkastron", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306.

One of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was [[Marco Polo]], who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown [[Venice]] with a ship; passing by [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261. A year earlier, in 1260, [[Niccolò and Maffeo Polo]] (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the [[Latin Empire]]. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away.&lt;ref name="Britannica571"&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the ruler of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Captured Venetian citizens in Constantinople were blinded,&lt;ref&gt;Zorzi, Alvise, Vita di Marco Polo veneziano, Rusconi Editore, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other [[Republic of Venice|Venetian colonies]] in the [[Aegean Sea]].

Together with Persian goods, Italian traders brought stories about the city to Western Europe. Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late middle-ages and the Renaissance. [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[François Rabelais]] gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city.&lt;ref&gt;'The lure of Trebizond' by Anthony Eastmond, in ''Byzantium's Other Empire: Trebizond'', p.22, 2016, Istanbul&lt;/ref&gt; Next to literature, the legendary history of the city - and that of the Pontus in general - also influenced the creation of [[paintings]], [[Play (theatre)|theatre plays]] and [[operas]] in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.

The city also played a role in the early [[Renaissance]]; The western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond's political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially [[Alexios II of Trebizond]] and his grandson [[Alexios III of Trebizond|Alexios III]] were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university [[Gregory Choniades]] opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari,&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Shams_al-Din_al-Bukhari_BEA.htm "Shams al‐Dīn al‐Bukhārī"]. Thomas Hockey et al. (eds.). ''The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers''.  New York: Springer, 2007, pp. 1047-1048. Retrieved 12 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] and [[Al-Khazini|Abd al-Rahman al-Khazini]] from Tabriz, which he translated into Greek. These works later found their way to western Europe, together with the [[astrolabe]]. The observatory Choniades built would become known for its accurate [[solar eclipse]] predictions, but was probably used mostly for [[astrology|astrological]] purposes for the emperor and/or the church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/29570856/Astronomy_in_the_Trebizond_Empire Astronomy in the Trebizond Empire] Ahmet M. Zehiroğlu (trans. by Paula Darwish). from Trabzon İmparatorluğu 2016, Trabzon.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] arrived at the city late 1346, probably via [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]]. At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the [[Trapezuntine Civil War]]. Constantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453, who also [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|conquered Trebizond]] eight years later, in 1461.

Its demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of [[Greek Orthodox]] inhabitants, usually referred to as [[Pontic Greeks]], continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand [[Greek Muslims]] still live in the area, mostly in the Çaykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni-Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and possibly a few [[Crypto-Christians]] in the Tonya/Gümüşhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.

Painted just after the fall of the city, it depicts Trabzon as being equal to Constantinople (at the far left). Even the battle displayed in between the two cities was mostly a fantasy. The city held a legendary place in Western-European literature and thought throughout the late medieval period and the renaissance, with a lasting influence that can be felt even to present times.]]

According to the Ottoman tax books (''[[tahrir defterleri]]''), the total population of adult males in the city was 1,473 in the year 1523.&lt;ref name="Modern Times page 27/28"&gt;''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times'', Richard G.

Trabzon was sanjak centre in [[Rum Eyalet]] (1461–1514) and (1520–1535), Erzincan-Bayburt eyalet (1514–1517), [[Anadolu Eyalet]] (1517–1520) and [[Erzurum Eyalet]] (1535–1598).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofhayrat.com/news_print.php?id=4895|title=Haber Yazdır : Trabzon'un fethi araştırmaları ve 15 ağustos 1461  - Of hayrat haberleri|website=www.OfHayrat.com|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trabzon had a wealthy merchant class during the late Ottoman period, and the local Christian minority had a substantial influence in terms of culture, economy and politics. A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century Trabzon even became the main port for Persian exports. However, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] greatly diminished the international trading position of the city. In the last decades of the 19th century the city saw some demographic changes. Many residents from the wider region (mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking muslims) started to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the booming cities along the northern and eastern coasts of the Black Sea. Among these migrants were the grandparents of [[Bob Dylan]] and Greek politicians and arists. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the [[Circassian genocide]].

Next to Constantinople, Smyrna and Selanik, Trabzon was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rev.

The following is a list of missionaries who have been connected with the station for at least one year:  ... Rev. [[George Warren Wood|G. W.

The city got a post office in 1845. New churches and mosques were built in the second half of the 19th century, as well as the first theater, public and private printing houses, multiple photo-studios and banks. The oldest known photographs of the city center date from the 1860s and depict one of the last [[camel train]]s from Persia.

Between one and two thousand Armenians are believed to have been killed in the Trebizond vilajet during the [[Hamidian massacres]] of 1895. While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France. The large Greek population of the city was not affected by the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Edwin Munsell Blis on he Hamidian Massacres in 'Modern Genocide: The Definitive Resource and Document Collection', 2014, p. 147, Paul R. Bartrop &amp; Steven Leonard Jacobs (eds)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high number of Western-Europeans in the city, news from the region was being reported on in many European newspapers. These western newspapers were in turn also very popular among the residents of the city.

In 1901 the harbour was equipped with cranes by [[Clarke Chapman|Stothert and Pitt]] of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in England. In 1912 the Sümer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The city lost many young male citizens at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] in the winter of 1914–15.  The coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier was the site of key battles between the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] armies during the [[Trebizond Campaign]], part of the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of World War I. A bombardment of the city in 1915 by the Russian navy cost the lives of 1300 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maldonado in 'Historic Cities of the Islamic World', 2007, p. 525, C. Edmund Bosworth (ed)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1915 most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of Gümüşhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were reportedly taken out to sea in boats that were then capsized.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Globe'', August 26, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; After the genocide, Trabzon was one of the locations of subsequent trials (see [[Trabzon during the Armenian Genocide]]). The Trabzon trials reported Armenians having been drowned in the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Takvimi Vekdyi'', No. 3616, August 6, 1919, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian army landed at [[Pazar, Rize|Atina]], east of Rize on March 4, 1916. [[Lazistan Sanjak]] fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and Çaykara some 50&amp;nbsp;km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west.&lt;ref&gt;Infographic by the newspaper ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'' showing the advance of the Russian front on Trebizond, The Sphere, April 29, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop [[Chrysantos Philippidis]]. Chrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] under command of [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]]. Many adult Turkish males left the city out of fear for reprisals, even though mayor Chrysantos included them in his administration. According to some sources the Russians banned Muslim [[mosque]]s, and forced [[Turkish people|Turks]], who were the largest ethnic group living in the city, to leave Trabzon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Grand Larousse encyclopedia'' Turkish edition, 22, page: 11669, ''Librairie Larousse''&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=June 2017}} However, already during the Russian occupation many Turks who had fled to surrounding villages started to return to the city, and mayor Chrysantos helped them to re-establish their facilities such as schools, to the dismay of the Russian governor. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. The Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern [[Anatolia]].

During the [[Turkish War of Independence]] several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond vilajet rebelled against the new army of [[Mustafa Kemal]] (notably in [[Bafra]] and [[Dumanlı|Santa]]), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek mayor Crhysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trabzon opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the [[Erzurum Congress]]. The governor and mayor of Trabzon were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects,&lt;ref&gt;[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sjHxXvkEGiIJ:https://www.thenationalherald.com/176214/seattle-city-council-asia-minor Seattle City Council and Asia Minor - The articles of Herbert Adams Gibbons in the Christian Science Monitor] Stavros T. Stavridis in ''The National Herald'', September 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the government of Trabzon thus refused arms to Mustafa Kemal's henchman [[Topal Osman]], who was responsible for mass murders in the western Pontus. Osman was forced out of the city by armed Turkish port-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=kVZ3sLBEPEcC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=1921&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B-F5U_W6Je-IyAOTrIHYBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Twice a Stranger: The Mass Expulsions that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey|pages=112–116|first=Bruce|last=Clark|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|access-date=15 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war and the annulment of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920), which was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), Trabzon again became a part of Turkey. The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trabzon only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|forced population exchange]]. This exchange included well over one hundred thousand Greeks from Trabzon and the vicinity, to the relatively new [[Greece|Greek state]].&lt;ref&gt;Baum, Wilhelm (2006). ''The Christian minorities in Turkey''. Kitab. p. 162. {{ISBN|978-3-902005-62-5}}. "On October 11, 1922, Turkey concluded an armistice with the allied forces, but not with the Greeks. The Greeks in the other settlement areas of Asia Minor were also expelled at that time, like e.g. the Kappadocian Greeks in the Goreme area and the other Greeks in Pontus, in the Trabzon area and on the west coast."&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Trabzon parliamentarian [[Ali Şükrü Bey]] was one of the leading figures of the [[Second Group (Turkey)|first Turkish opposition party]]. Through his newspaper ''Tan'', Şükrü and his colleges publicized their critiques of the Kemalist government, such as its violence towards Greeks during the population exchange.
[[File:Uzun Sokak at night.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Uzun Sokak, a pedestrianized shopping street.]]

Topal Osman would eventually murder parliamentarian Şükrü for his criticism of the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal. Ali Şükrü Bey, who had studied in the [[United Kingdom]], is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman.

During World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, [[tobacco]] and [[hazelnut]], could not be sold and living standards degraded.

As a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.

Trabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its [[anchovies]] called ''hamsi'', which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include [[hazelnuts]] and [[tea]].

The city still has a sizable community of [[Greek Muslims#Greek Muslims of Pontus|Greek-speaking Muslims]], most of whom are originally from the vicinities of [[Tonya, Turkey|Tonya]], [[Sürmene]] and [[Çaykara]]. However, the [[Pontic Greek|Pontic Greek language]] (known as Romeiaka or Ποντιακά, ''Pontiaka'') is spoken mostly by the older generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Özhan Öztürk]]: [http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/pontus-anticag%e2%80%99dan-gunumuze-karadeniz%e2%80%99in-etnik-ve-siyasi-tarihi/ ''Pontus: Antik Çağ’dan Günümüze Karadeniz’in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi'', Genesis Yayınları, Ankara, 2011], pp. 417-421, {{ISBN|978-605-54-1017-9}}; Peter Mackridge: ''Greek-Speaking Muslims of North-East Turkey: Prolegomena to a study of the Ophitic sub-dialect of Pontic'', Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, Oxford University Press, 1987, pp. 115–137; [[Ömer Asan]]: ''Pontus Kültürü'', Belge Yayınları, Istanbul, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==

[[File:Village in Çaykara district2.jpg|left|thumb|A village in [[Çaykara]] district, Trabzon]]
[[Trabzon Province]] has a total area of {{convert|4685|km²|0|abbr=out}} and is bordered by the provinces of [[Rize Province|Rize]], [[Giresun Province|Giresun]] and [[Gümüşhane Province|Gümüşhane]]. The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The [[Pontic Mountains]] pass through the Trabzon Province.

Trabzon used to be an important [[pilotage|reference point]] for [[navigation|navigators]] in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions. The popular expression "perdere la Trebisonda" (losing Trebizond) is still commonly used in the [[Italian language]] to describe situations in which the sense of direction is lost.&lt;ref name="latorio"/&gt; The Italian maritime republics such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and in particular [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries.&lt;ref name="latorio"/&gt;

Trabzon has four lakes: [[Uzungöl]], Çakırgöl, Sera and Haldizen Lakes. There are several streams, but no rivers in Trabzon.

===Climate===
Trabzon has a climate typical of the Black Sea region with plentiful precipitation. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], it has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen: ''Cfa'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are warm and humid, and the average maximum temperature is around {{convert|26.7|°C|0}} in August. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around {{convert|5|°C}} in January. Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature renders a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional 1–2 degrees Celsius enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Köppen: Cfb) followed by [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen: Dfb), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a typical characteristic of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen: Csa), but with only one month below 40&amp;nbsp;mm rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.

Precipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a [[microclimate|microclimatic]] condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.

The water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is always cool and fluctuates between {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} throughout the year.

==Economy==
As of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered "the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports" by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. It traded as far as [[Tabriz]] and [[Mosul]]. As of 1911, the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] signed an agreement to develop a [[harbor]] at the port. When the Russians occupied Trabzon, a [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] was built.&lt;ref name=Prothero51&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=51|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/51/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and were responsible for creating an extended pier, making loading and unloading easier. In 1920, Trabzon produced [[linen]] cloth, [[silver]] [[filagree]], [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] and small amounts of [[cotton]], [[silk]] and [[wool]]. [[Tobacco]] and [[hazelnut]]s were exported.&lt;ref name=Prothero52&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=52 |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/52/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco produced in Trabzon was called ''Trebizond-Platana''. It was described as having "large leaves and a bright colour."&lt;ref name=Prothero61&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=61|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/61/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trabzon was known for producing poor quality [[cereal]]s, most which were grown for local use.&lt;ref name=Prothero60&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Trabzon produced a white [[green bean]], which was sold in Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province.&lt;ref name=Prothero61/&gt; [[Poultry farming]] was also popular in Trabzon. [[Sericulture]] was seen in the area before 1914.&lt;ref name=Prothero64&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Copper was kept for local use by [[coppersmith]]s. During the [[Balkan Wars]] production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.&lt;ref name=Prothero73&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Russian language shops and facilities can be found in the town.

[[Pontic Greek]] has been spoken in the region since early antiquity. The local dialect developed along its own lines and is today partly intelligible to speakers of Standard Greek. It was spoken mainly by a [[Greek Orthodox]] multi-ethnic population up to the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]]; nearly all speakers of this local variant of Pontic Greek are now [[Muslim]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} A very similar dialect is spoken by a community of about 400 speakers, descendants of Christians from the Of valley now living in Greece in the village of [[Nea Trapezounta, Pieria|Nea Trapezounta]] (New Trebizond), today part of [[Katerini]], [[Central Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="urlwww.latsis-foundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latsis-foundation.org/files/Meletes2009/11.report.pdf |title=www.latsis-foundation.org |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131201021/http://www.latsis-foundation.org/files/Meletes2009/11.report.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laz people]], who are aboriginal to this area, also live in Trabzon. Numerous villages inside and out of Trabzon of the Laz date back as early as the period of [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]]'s rule (Georgian: თამარი, also transliterated as T'amar or Thamar; c. 1160 – 18 January 1213) in the newly unified [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. During the Queen's rule, sizeable groups of immigrating Georgians moved to Trabzon where they continue to preserve their native tongue. There was an Armenian community in Trebizond as early as the 7th century.&lt;ref name=sae&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Victor Amazaspovich Ambartsumian; Abel Poghosi Simonyan; Makich Vahani Arzumanyan|year= 1986|encyclopedia= Haykakan sovetakan hanragitaran ("[[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]") |volume= 12|location= Yerevan |pages = 87|oclc= 10431241   |language=Armenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th and 14th centuries, numerous [[Armenians|Armenian]] families migrated there from [[Ani]].&lt;ref name="sae"/&gt; Robert W. Edwards published part of an early 15th-century diary from the Castilian ambassador who visited Trabzon and compared the churches of the Greek and Armenian communities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Edwards, “Armenian and Byzantine Religious Practices in Early Fifteenth-Century Trabzon: A Spanish Viewpoint,” ''Revue des Études Arméniennes'' 23, 1992, pp. 81–90.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was stated by the ambassador that the Armenians, who were not well like by the Greeks, had a population large enough to support a resident bishop.  According to Ronald C. Jennings, in the early 16th century, Armenians made up approximately 13 percent&lt;ref&gt;15.5% of 85%&lt;/ref&gt; of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Ronald C. (Jan. 1976) ''Urban Population in Anatolia in the 16th Century'': International Journal of MiddleEast Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1 pp. 21–57.&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Trabzon does not have an Armenian-speaking community.

The [[Chepni]] people, a tribe of [[Oghuz Turks]] who played an important role in the history of the eastern Black Sea area in the 13th and 14th centuries, live in the [[Şalpazarı]] (Ağasar valley) region of the Trabzon Province.&lt;ref&gt;Bernt Brendemoen, ''The Turkish dialects of Trabzon'', [[University of Oslo]], 2002 p 18&lt;/ref&gt; Very little has been written on the [[Turkification]] of the area.

It is possible that the majority of the population of Trabzon and [[Rize]] (and other ancient Greek colonies in the Pontus region) — except up to the time of the Chepni Turk immigration waves — consisted of indigenous Caucasian tribes (the [[Colchians]] and the Laz) who had been partly [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] religiously and linguistically.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meeker, "The Black Sea Turks: some aspects of their ethnic and cultural background", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' (1971) '''2''':318–345&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Meeker stresses the cultural resemblances (e.g. in village structure, house types, and pastoral techniques) between the Eastern Black Sea coast and the areas in the [[Caucasus]] proper.&lt;ref&gt;Meeker, 1971: p. 326 "''As the mentioned, the villages along the Black Sea coast from Ordu to Artvin are composed of many hamlets, each dominating a hilltop or mountain side on which its own crops are separately planted.

Trabzon has a number of tourist attractions, some of them dating back to the times of the [[ancient]] [[empire]]s that once existed in the region. In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the ''[[Meydan (park)|Meydan]]'', a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.

* The [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] ({{lang-tr|Ayasofya Müzesi}}), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town's most important tourist attraction.
* [[Trabzon Castle]] ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone.  The outside wall of the castle now serves as the back wall of a military building.
* The "Atatürk Köşkü" is a villa built in 1890 by a local Greek merchant. In 1924 [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.
* [[Boztepe hill, Trabzon|Boztepe Park]] is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.
* Uzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.
* [[Trabzon Museum]] is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.
* Trabzon's Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kunduracılar Street from the Meydan (town square).
* [[Kostaki Mansion]] is located to the north of [[Zeytinlik, Artvin|Zeytinlik]] near Uzun Sokak.

Other sites of the city include: [[Fatih Mosque of Trabzon|Fatih Mosque]] (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), [[Yeni Cuma Mosque]] (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), [[Nakip Mosque]] (originally the Agios Andreas Church), Hüsnü Köktuğ Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), [[İskender Pasha Mosque, Trabzon|İskender Pasha Mosque]], Semerciler Mosque, Çarşı Mosque, Gülbahar Hatun Mosque and Türbe (commissioned by Sultan [[Selim I]]), [[Kalepark]] (originally Leonkastron).

Within [[Trabzon Province]], the main attractions are the [[Sümela Monastery]] (i.&amp;nbsp;e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumelá) and the [[Uzungöl]] lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the city. Uzungöl is known for its natural environment and scenery. Other sites of interest in the broader region include:

==Culture==
[[File:Trebizonde - National dance of Laz.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Postcard of Trabzon showing the national dance [[Horon]].]]
Folk dancing is still very much in evidence in the [[Black Sea region]]. The "[[Horon]]" is a famous dance which is indigenous to the city and its surrounding area. It is performed by men, women, the young and elderly alike; in festivities, local weddings and [[harvest]] times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karalahana.com/english/archive/people.html People and culture of Trabzon and Black sea region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210010135/http://karalahana.com/english/archive/people.html |date=2010-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to Russian [[Cossacks|Cossack]] dances in terms of vividness, the Trabzon folk dance is probably indigenous to the eastern Black Sea region, which has an impressive variety of folk music .

The people of Trabzon have a reputation for being religiously conservative and nationalist. Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atatürk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of [[Giresun]] because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.

Outside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.

The people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region ''Karadeniz fıkraları'' (Black Sea jokes). The character ''Temel'', a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.

The city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by [[Rose Macaulay|Dame Rose Macaulay]]'s last novel, ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'' (1956), which is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rose Macaulay|Macaulay, Rose]]: ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (Collins, London, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Ktu foto 1.jpg|thumb|A view from the [[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] campus]]

[[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea]] and [[East Anatolia Region, Turkey|East Anatolian]] regions, as well as students from the [[Turkic states]] in [[Central Asia]].

Historically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as [[Phrontisterion of Trapezous]], which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Özdalga|first=Elisabeth | title= Late Ottoman society: the intellectual legacy | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sRtTyyGIgXsC&amp;pg=PA261 | isbn= 978-0-415-34164-6| page =261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school ''Anadolu Lisesi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Bryer |first1=Anthony  |last2=Winfield|first2=David | title= The post-Byzantine monuments of Pontos | publisher=Ashgate | year=2006 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gmfqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Trebizond%2Bgreek%2Bphrontisterion&amp;q=phrontisterion#search_anchor | isbn= 978-0-86078-864-5| page =xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
Trabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially ''hamsi'' (fresh [[European Anchovy]] similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the ''[[Akçaabat]] [[köfte]]'' (spicy lamb meatball from the Akçaabat district), ''Karadeniz pidesi'' (canoe shaped [[pita]] bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), ''kuymak'' (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), ''Vakfıkebir ekmeği'' (large country-style bread), ''Tonya tereyağı'' (Tonya butter), ''tava mısır ekmeği'' (deep-dish corn bread) and ''kara lahana çorbası'' (bean and cabbage soup). ''Taflan kavurması'' is a [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel]] dish served with onions and [[olive oil]]. Trabzon is also famous for its [[hazelnut]]s. The [[Black Sea region]] of Turkey is the world's largest producer of [[cherry]] and [[hazelnut]]; and a large production area of [[tea]]; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.

==Sports==
[[File:Trabzonspor trophy museum.jpg|thumb|Trophies won by [[Trabzonspor]] at the club's museum.]]

[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, [[Trabzonspor]], was until [[2009–10 Süper Lig|2010]] the only Turkish football club in [[Anatolia]] to win the [[Süper Lig]] (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the [[1975–76 1.Lig|1975–76 season]]) won only by the "Big Three" clubs of [[Istanbul]], namely [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbahçe SK|Fenerbahçe]] and [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]]. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term "Big Three" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the "Big Four". 
Trabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the [[UEFA|European Cups]], managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais]]. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include [[Şenol Güneş]], [[Lars Olsen]] and [[Shota Arveladze]].

Trabzon hosted the [[2007 Black Sea Games|First Edition]] of the [[Black Sea Games]] in July 2007 and the [[2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival]].

The '''treatment of [[slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]]''' varied by time and place, but was generally brutal and degrading. Whipping and sexual abuse, including rape, were common.

Teaching slaves to read was discouraged or (depending upon the state) prohibited, so as to hinder aspirations for escape or rebellion. In response to [[slave rebellion]]s such as the [[Haitian Revolution]], the [[1811 German Coast Uprising]], a failed uprising in 1822 organized by [[Denmark Vesey]], and [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] in 1831, some states prohibited slaves from holding religious gatherings without a white person present, for fear that such meetings could facilitate communication and lead to rebellion.

Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, beating, mutilation, branding and/or imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but masters or overseers sometimes abused slaves to assert dominance. Pregnancy was not a barrier to punishment; methods were devised to administer lashings without harming the baby. Slave masters would dig a hole big enough for the woman's stomach to lie in and proceed with the lashings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray White|first=Deborah|title=Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|year=2013|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martins|isbn=978-0-312-19729-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; But such "protective" steps gave neither expectant slave mothers nor their unborn infants much real protection against grave injury or death from excess zeal or number of lashes inflicted, as one quote by ex-captive Moses Grandy took note: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of my sisters was so severely punished in this way, that labour was brought on, and the child born in the field. This very overseer, Mr. Brooks, killed in this manner a girl named Mary: her [parents] were in the field at the time. He also killed a boy about twelve years old. He had no punishment, or even trial, for either [murder].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/grandy/grandy.html Grandy, M.(1843). Narrative of the Life of Moses Grandy; Late a Slave in the United States of America, p. 29. Retrieved from ''Documenting the American South'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mistreatment of slaves frequently included rape and the sexual abuse of women. The sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in historical [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]] and its view of the enslaved as property.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 234"/&gt; After 1662, when [[Virginia]] adopted the legal doctrine ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', sexual relations between white men and black women were regulated by classifying children of slave mothers as slaves regardless of their father's race or status. Particularly in the Upper South, a population developed of mixed-race ([[mulatto]]) offspring of such unions, although white Southern society claimed to abhor [[miscegenation]] and punished sexual relations between white women and black men as damaging to [[racial purity]].

[[Frederick Law Olmsted]] visited Mississippi in 1853 and wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A cast mass of the slaves pass their lives, from the moment they are able to go afield in the picking season till they drop worn out in the grave, in incessant labor, in all sorts of weather, at all seasons of the year, without any other change or relaxation than is furnished by sickness, without the smallest hope of any improvement either in their condition, in their food, or in their clothing, which are of the plainest and coarsest kind, and indebted solely to the forbearance or good temper of the overseer for exception from terrible physical suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reef | first = Catherine | title = Poverty in America | publisher = Facts on File | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oNkZaTixb0IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 9781438108117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Living conditions==
An 1850 publication provided slaveholders with guidance on how to produce the "ideal slave":&lt;ref&gt;Christian, p 144&lt;/ref&gt;
#Maintain strict discipline and unconditional submission.
#Create a sense of personal inferiority, so that slaves "know their place."
#Instill fear.
#Teach servants to take interest in their master's enterprise.
#Deprive access to education and recreation, to ensure that slaves remain uneducated, helpless, and dependent.

===Brutality===
According to historians [[David Brion Davis]] and [[Eugene Genovese]], treatment of slaves was harsh and inhumane. During work and outside of it, slaves suffered physical abuse, since the government allowed it. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders. Small slaveholders worked together with their slaves and sometimes treated them more humanely.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides slaves' being vastly overworked, they suffered brandings, shootings, "floggings," and even worse punishments. Flogging was a term often used to describe the average lashing or whipping a slave would receive for misbehaving. Many times a slave would also simply be put through "wanton cruelties" or unprovoked violent beatings or punishments.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, D. (2005). "Slavery As It Is:" Medicine and Slaves of the Plantation South. ''OAH Magazine Of History'', 19(5), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humane treatment===
After 1820,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abolition.nypl.org/print/suppression/|title=Suppression – The Abolition of The Slave Trade|website=abolition.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the inability to legally import new slaves from Africa following prohibition of the international slave trade, some slaveholders improved the living conditions of their slaves, to influence them not to attempt escape.&lt;ref name="Christian, p 90"&gt;Christian, p 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Some slavery advocates asserted that many slaves were content with their situation. African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[J. Sella Martin]] countered that the apparent contentment was a psychological reaction to dehumanizing brutality, such as witnessing their spouses sold at [[auction]] or their daughters raped.&lt;ref&gt;
*Davis, pp 228-9
*Johnson, p 371
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and access to information===
Slaveholders feared slave rebellions and attempts of escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|isbn=978-0717806058
|publisher=International Publishers
|place=New York
|quote=Widespread fear of slave rebellion was characteristic of the South (p. 39).

|last=Aptheker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them sought to minimize slaves' exposure to the outside world to reduce the risk of rebellion. The desired result was to eliminate slaves' dreams and aspirations, restrict access 
to information about other slaves and rebellions, and stifle their mental faculties.&lt;ref name="Christian, p 90"/&gt;

Education of slaves was generally discouraged for fear that knowledge and literacy would cause rebelliousness, as they might learn of the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] and of the existence, in more northern states, of substantial groups of [[free negro]]s.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, pp 616-7"&gt;Rodriguez, pp.616-617&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Education during the Slave Period]].) During the mid-19th century, some states prohibited the education of slaves. In 1841, [[Virginia]] punished violations of this law by 20 lashes to the slave and a $100 fine to the teacher, and [[North Carolina]] by 39 lashes to the slave and a $250 fine to the teacher.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, pp 616-7"/&gt; In [[Kentucky]], education of slaves was legal but almost nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, pp 616-7"/&gt; Some [[Missouri]] slaveholders educated their slaves or permitted them to do so themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Jeffery C., ''Slavery, Southern culture, and education in Little Dixie, Missouri, 1820–1860'', 	CRC Press, 2006, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Utah]], slave owners were required to send black slaves to school for eighteen months between the ages of six and twenty years&lt;ref name=Utah_codes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/primarywest/utah-slave-code-1852|title=The Utah Territory Slave Code (1852) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian slaves for three months every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts, Resolutions, and Memorials Passed at the ... Annual, and Special Sessions, of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNFGAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Brigham H. Young, Printers|year=1866|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
In 1740, following the [[Stono Rebellion]], [[Maryland]] limited slaves' working hours to 15 per day in the Summer and 14 in the Winter, with no work permitted on Sunday. Historian [[Charles R. Johnson|Charles Johnson]] writes that such laws were not only motivated by compassion, but also by the desire to pacify slaves and prevent future revolts. Slave working conditions were often made worse by the plantation's need for them to work overtime to sustain themselves in regards to food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;"Cyrus Bellus" Born into Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers Project, 1936–1938, Manuscript 	Division, Library of Congress http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In Utah, slaves were required to work "reasonable" hours.&lt;ref name=Utah_codes /&gt;

===Medical treatment===
The quality of medical care to slaves is uncertain; some historians conclude that because slaveholders wished to preserve the value of their slaves, they received the same care. Others conclude that medical care was poor. A majority of plantation owners and doctors balanced a plantation need to coerce as much labor as possible from a slave without causing death, infertility, and a reduction in productivity; the effort by planters and doctors to provide sufficient living resources that enabled their slaves to remain productive and bear many children; the impact of diseases and injury on the social stability of slave communities; the extent to which illness and mortality of sub-populations in slave society reflected their different environmental exposures and living circumstances rather than their alleged racial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth F. Kiple and Virginia Himmeisteib King, Another Dimension to the Black Diaspora: Diet, Disease, and Racism (Cambridge: Cambridge University)&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves may have also provided adequate medical care to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, p 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies show that a slave-owner would care for his slaves through only "prudence and humanity." Although conditions were so harsh for slaves, many slave-owners saw that it was in their best interest financially to see that each slave stayed healthy enough to maintain an active presence on the plantation. An ill slave meant less work force for the plantation which coerced some plantation owners to regularly have medical doctors monitor their slaves in an attempt to keep them healthy. Other slave-owners wishing to save money would often rely on their own self-taught remedies combine with any helpful knowledge of their wives to help treat the sickly. Older slaves and oftentimes grandparents of slave communities would pass down useful medical skills and remedies as well. Also, large enough plantations with owners willing to spend the money would often have specific infirmaries built to deal with the problems of slaves' health.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, D. (2005). "Slavery As It Is:" Medicine and Slaves of the Plantation South. OAH Magazine Of History, 19(5), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Michael W. Byrd, a dual system of medical care provided poorer care for slaves throughout the South, and slaves were excluded from formal medical training.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, p 4-5, citing Byrd, p 200&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that slaves were mainly responsible for their own care, a "health subsystem" that persisted long after slavery was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, p 4, citing Byrd, p 200&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves took such an active role in the health care of their community that in 1748 Virginia prohibited them from advertising certain treatments.&lt;ref name="Covey, p 5"&gt;Covey, p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical care was usually provided by fellow slaves or by slaveholders and their families, and only rarely by physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p 155; *Covey, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; Care for sick household members was mostly provided by women. Some slaves possessed medical skills, such as knowledge of [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] and [[midwifery]] and often treated both slaves and non-slaves.&lt;ref name="Burke, p 155"&gt;Burke, p 155&lt;/ref&gt; Covey suggests that because slaveholders offered poor treatment, slaves relied on African remedies and adapted them to North American plants.&lt;ref name="Covey, p 5"/&gt; Other examples of improvised health care methods included folk healers, grandmother midwives, and social networks such as churches, and, for pregnant slaves, female networks. Slave-owners would sometimes also seek healing from such methods in times of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, D. (2005). "Slavery As It Is:" Medicine and Slaves of the Plantation South. OAH Magazine Of History, 19(5), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In Missouri, slaveholders generally provided adequate health care to their slaves, and were motivated by humanitarian concerns, maintenance of slaves' productivity, and protection of the owners' investment.&lt;ref name="Burke, p 155"/&gt;

Researchers performed medical experiments on slaves without consent, and frequently displayed slaves to illustrate medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
During the early 17th century, some colonies permitted slaves who converted to Christianity to become free, but this possibility was eliminated by the mid 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1725 Virginia granted slaves the right to establish a church, leading to the establishment of the [[First Church of Colored Baptists]].&lt;ref name="Christian, p 33"&gt;Christian, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases throughout the American South, slaves created hybrid forms of Christianity, mixing elements of traditional African religions with traditional as well as new interpretations of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;"Story of Reverend Williams, aged 76, colored Methodist minister, born Greenbriar County, West Virginia" Born into Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers Project, 1936–1938, Manuscrupt Division, Library of Congress.http://memory.loc.gov/cgibinquery&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Carolina]] permitted law enforcement to disband any religious meeting where more than half the participants were black.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Thomas D., ''Southern Slavery and the Law, 1619-1860'', p 347&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earnings and possessions===
Masters commonly paid slaves small bonuses at [[Christmas]], and some slaveholders permitted them to keep earnings and gambling profits. One slave, [[Denmark Vesey]], bought his freedom with a lottery prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===In comparison to non-slaves===
[[Robert Fogel]] argued that the material conditions of slaves were better than those of free [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] workers.  However, 58% of historians and 42% of economists surveyed disagreed with Fogel's proposition.&lt;ref name="weiss"/&gt; Fogel's view was that, while slaves' living conditions were poor by modern standards, all workers during the first half of the 19th century were subject to hardship. He further stated that over the course of their lifetime, a typical slave field hand "received" about 90% of the income he produced.&lt;ref name="weiss"/&gt;

Slaves were legally considered non-persons unless they committed a crime. An [[Alabama]] court ruled that slaves "are rational beings, they are capable of committing crimes; and in reference to acts which are crimes, are regarded as persons. Because they are slaves, they are incapable of performing civil acts, and, in reference to all such, they are things, not persons."&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, Helen T., Ed. 1926. ''Judicial Cases Concerning Slavery and the Negro'', Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institute, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment and abuse==
Slaves were punished  by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding, rape, and imprisonment. Punishment was often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was performed to re-assert the dominance of the master (or overseer) over the slave.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p 114&lt;/ref&gt;
They were punished with knives, guns, field tools and nearby objects. The whip was the most common instrument used against a slave; one said "The only punishment that I ever heard or knew of being administered slaves was whipping", although he knew several who were beaten to death for offenses such as "sassing" a white person, hitting another "negro", "fussing" or fighting in quarters.&lt;ref name="Rawick, George P 1972"&gt;Rawick, George P. "From Sundown to Sunup", ''Making of the Black Community'' 1. (1972): n. pag. Web. 21 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves who worked and lived on [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s were the most frequently punished. [[Punishment]] could be administered by the plantation owner or master, his wife, children or (most often) the overseer or driver.

Slave overseers were authorized to whip and punish slaves. One overseer told a visitor, "Some Negroes are determined never to let a white man whip them and will resist you, when you attempt it; of course you must kill them in that case."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zinn, Howard|Howard Zinn]] ''A People's History of the United States''. New York: Harper Collins Publications, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A former slave describes witnessing females being whipped: "They usually screamed and prayed, though a few never made a sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aae.greenwood.com/doc.aspx?i=14&amp;fileID=2000db8f&amp;chapterID=2000db8f-p2000db8f9970053001&amp;path=/books/dps/|title=The American Mosaic: The African American Experience  – Username|website=aae.greenwood.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the woman was pregnant, workers might dig a hole for her to rest her belly while being whipped. After slaves were whipped, overseers might order their wounds be burst and rubbed with turpentine and red pepper. An overseer reportedly took a brick, ground it into a powder, mixed it with lard and rubbed it all over a slave.&lt;ref name="Rawick, George P 1972"/&gt;

A metal collar was put on a slave to remind him of his wrongdoing. Such collars were thick and heavy; they often had protruding spikes which made fieldwork difficult and prevented the slave from sleeping when lying down. Louis Cain, a former slave, describes seeing another slave punished: "One nigger run to the woods to be a jungle nigger, but massa cotched him with the dog and took a hot iron and brands him. Then he put a bell on him, in a wooden frame what slip over the shoulders and under the arms. He made that nigger wear the bell a year and took it off on Christmas for a present to him. It sho' did make a good nigger out of him."&lt;ref name="Rawick, George P 1972"/&gt;
[[File:Plantation slave houses South Carolina Low Country.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Old black-and-white photo of wooden shacks|Plantation slave cabins, South Carolina Low Country]]

Slaves were punished for a number of reasons: working too slowly, breaking a law (for example, running away), leaving the plantation without permission or insubordination. Myers and Massy describe the practices: "The punishment of deviant slaves was decentralized, based on plantations, and crafted so as not to impede their value as laborers."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Martha, and James Massey. "Race, Labor, and Punishment in Postbellum Georgia." 38.2 (1991): 267–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites punished slaves publicly to set an example. A man named Harding describes an incident in which a woman assisted several men in a minor rebellion: "The women he hoisted up by the thumbs, whipp'd and slashed her with knives before the other slaves till she died."&lt;ref name="Lasgrayt, Deborah 1999"&gt;Lasgrayt, Deborah. ''Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South'', 2nd edition, New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women were sometimes punished differently; according to the 1789 report of the Virginia Committee of the Privy Council, males were often shackled but women and girls were left free.&lt;ref name="Lasgrayt, Deborah 1999"/&gt;

The branding of slaves for identification was common during the colonial era; however, by the nineteenth century it was used primarily as punishment.&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 102-3"&gt;Christian, pp 102-3&lt;/ref&gt; Mutilation (such as castration, or amputating ears) was a relatively common punishment during the colonial era and still used in 1830. Any punishment was permitted for runaway slaves, and many bore wounds from shotgun blasts or dog bites used by their captors.&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 102-3"/&gt;

In 1717, Maryland law provided that slaves were not entitled to a jury trial for a misdemeanor, and empowered county judges to impose a punishment of up to 40 lashes.&lt;ref&gt;Christian, p 31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1729, the colony passed a law permitting punishment for slaves including hanging, decapitation, and cutting the body into four quarters for public display.&lt;ref name="Christian, p 33"/&gt;

In 1740, South Carolina passed a law prohibiting cruelty to slaves; however, slaves could still be killed under some circumstances. The anti-cruelty law prohibited cutting out the tongue, putting out the eye, castration, scalding, burning and amputating limbs, but permitted whipping, beating, putting in irons and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Christian, p 36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Utah passed the [[Act in Relation to Service]], which provided several protections for slaves.  They were freed if the slave owner was found guilty of cruelty or abuse, or neglect to feed, clothe, or shelter the slave, or if there were any sexual intercourse between the master and the slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/primarywest/utah-slave-code-1852|title=The Utah Territory Slave Code (1852) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The definition of cruelty was vague and hard to enforce, and in practice, slaves received similar treatment to those in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brief History Alex Bankhead and Marinda Redd Bankhead (mention of Dr Pinney of Salem)|publisher=The Broad Ax|date=March 25, 1899|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/72065072/#id=2719347&amp;offset=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws governing treatment===
By law, slaveholders could be fined for not punishing recaptured runaway slaves. Slave codes authorized, [[indemnity|indemnified]] or required violence, and were denounced by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] for their brutality. Both slaves and free blacks were regulated by the [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]], and their movements were monitored by [[slave patrol]]s conscripted from the white population. The patrols were authorized to use summary punishment against escapees; in the process, they sometimes maimed or killed the escapees.

Historian [[Nell Irvin Painter]] and others have documented that Southern history went "across the color line." Contemporary accounts by [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]] (both married in the  Deep South planter class) and accounts by former slaves gathered by the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) attested to the abuse of women slaves by white owners and overseers.

====Slave codes====
{{main|Slave codes}}
The slave-owning colonies had laws governing the control and punishment of slaves which were known as [[slave codes]].&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 27-28"&gt;Christian, pp 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina established its slave code in 1712, based on the 1688 English slave code in [[Barbados]]. The South Carolina slave code was a model for other North American colonies. In 1770, Georgia adopted the South Carolina slave code and Florida adopted the Georgia code.&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 27-28"/&gt; The 1712 South Carolina slave code included the following provisions:&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 27-28"/&gt;
*Slaves were forbidden to leave the owner's property unless accompanied by a white person, or with permission. If a slave left the owner's property without permission, "every white person" was required to chastise them.
*Any slave attempting to run away and leave the colony (later, the state) received the death penalty.
*Any slave who evaded capture for 20 days or more was to be publicly whipped for the first offense; branded with an "R" on the right cheek on the second offense; lose one ear if absent for thirty days on the third offense, and castrated on the fourth offense.
* Owners refusing to abide by the slave code were fined and forfeited their slaves.
* Slave homes were searched every two weeks for weapons or stolen goods. Punishment escalated from loss of an ear, branding and nose-slitting to death on the fourth offense.
* No slave could work for pay; plant corn, peas or rice; keep hogs, cattle, or horses; own or operate a boat; buy or sell, or wear clothes finer than "Negro cloth".

The South Carolina slave code was revised in 1739, with the following amendments:&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 27-28"/&gt;
* No slave could be taught to write, work on Sunday, or work more than 15 hours per day in summer and 14 hours in winter.
* The willful killing of a slave was fined £700, and "passion" killing £350.
* The fine for concealing runaway slaves was $1,000 and a prison sentence up to one year.
* A fine of $100 and six months in prison were imposed for employing a freeman or slave as a clerk.
* A fine of $100 and six months in prison were imposed for selling (or giving) alcoholic beverages to slaves.
* A fine of $100 and six months in prison were imposed for teaching a slave to read and write; the death penalty was imposed for circulating incendiary literature.
* Freeing a slave was forbidden except by deed (after 1820, only by permission of the legislature; Georgia required legislative approval after 1801).

The slave codes in the [[tobacco colonies]] (Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia) were modeled on the Virginia code, established in 1667.&lt;ref name="Christian, pp 27-28"/&gt; The 1682 Virginia code included the following provisions:&lt;ref&gt;Christian, pp 19&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slaves were prohibited from possessing weapons.
* Slaves were prohibited from leaving their owner's plantation without permission.
* Slaves were prohibited from attacking a white person, even in self-defense.
* A runaway slave, refusing to surrender, could be killed without penalty.

===Owners convicted of crimes===
In 1811, [[Arthur William Hodge]] was the first slaveholder executed for the murder of a slave in the [[British West Indies]]. However, he was not (as some have claimed) the first white person to have been [[capital punishment|executed]] for killing a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', {{ISBN|0-934139-05-9}}, page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Records indicate at least two earlier incidents. On November 23, 1739, in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], two white men (Charles Quin and David White) were hanged for the murder of another white man's slave. On April 21, 1775, the ''[[Virginia Gazette]]'' in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] reported that a white man (William Pitman) was hanged for the murder of his own slave.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN078640339X&amp;id=quwi6J7GZ6wC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22murder+of+a+negro&amp;sig=S2F7SIl7IrkP28ysc_4abwh3Q_0#PPA101,M1 ''Blacks in Colonial America]'', p. 101, Oscar Reiss, McFarland &amp; Company, 1997; [http://departments.umw.edu/hipr/www/Fredericksburg/newspapers/vagaz/12may75s_1_3.htm ''Virginia Gazette'', April 21, 1775] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624151602/http://departments.umw.edu/hipr/www/fredericksburg/newspapers/vagaz/12may75s_1_3.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}, [[University of Mary Washington]] Department of Historic Preservation archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws punishing whites for punishing their slaves were weakly enforced or easily avoided. In ''Smith v. Hancock'', the defendant justified punishing his slave to a white jury; the slave was attending an unlawful meeting, discussed rebellion, refused to surrender and resisted the arresting officer by force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aae.greenwood.com/doc.aspx?i=4&amp;fileID=WHL0748&amp;chapterID=WHL0748-1046&amp;path=/primarydoc/greenwood ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual relations and rape==

===Rape and sexual abuse===
[[File:Christiaen van Couwenbergh - Three Young White Men and a Black Woman - WGA5568.jpg|thumb|''Three Young White Men and a Black Woman'' (1632) by [[Christiaen van Couwenbergh]].]]
Slavery in the United States encompassed wide-ranging rape and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 234"&gt;Moon, p 234&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and some died resisting them; others were left with psychological and physical scars.&lt;ref name="Marable, p 74"&gt;Marable, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; "Soul murder, the feeling of anger, depression and low self-esteem" is how historian [[Nell Irvin Painter]] describes the effects of this abuse, linking it to slavery. Slaves regularly suppressed anger before their masters to avoid showing weakness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Harriet Jacobs]] said in her narrative that she believed her mistress was jealous of her master's sexual interest in her, the reason she did not try to protect her. Victims of abuse during slavery may have blamed themselves for the incidents, due to their isolation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Rape laws in the south embodied a race-based double standard. Black men accused of rape during the colonial period were often punished with castration, and the penalty was increased to death during the antebellum period;&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"&gt;Moon, p 235&lt;/ref&gt; however, white men could rape female slaves without fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"/&gt; Men and boys were also sexually abused by slaveholders.&lt;ref&gt;Getman, Karen A. "Sexual Control in the Slaveholding South: The Implementation and Maintenance of a Racial Caste System," ''Harvard Women's and Law Journal'', 7, (1984), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Foster says that although historians have begun to cover sexual abuse during slavery, few focus on sexual abuse of men and boys because of the assumption that only enslaved women were victimized. Foster suggests that men and boys may have also been forced into unwanted sexual activity; one problem in documenting such abuse is that they, of course, did not bear mixed-race children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Thomas |title=The Sexual Abuse of Black Men under American Slavery |journal=[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=445–464 [pp. 448–49] |doi=10.1353/sex.2011.0059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both masters and mistresses were thought to have abused male slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Thomas |title=The Sexual Abuse of Black Men under American Slavery |journal=[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=445–464 [p. 459] |doi=10.1353/sex.2011.0059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela Davis]] contends that the systematic rape of female slaves is analogous to the medieval concept of ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', believing that the rapes were a deliberate effort by slaveholders to extinguish resistance in women and reduce them to the status of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, p 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal southern culture which treated all women, black and white, as property.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 234"/&gt; Although southern mores regarded white women as dependent and submissive, black women were often consigned to a life of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 234"/&gt; Racial purity was the driving force behind the southern culture's prohibition of sexual relations between white women and black men; however, the same culture protected sexual relations between white men and black women. The result was a number of mixed-race (mulatto) offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Many women were raped, and had little control over their families. Children, free women, [[indentured servants]] and men were not immune from abuse by masters and owners. Nell Irvin Painter also explains that the psychological outcome of such treatment often had the same results ("soul murder"). Children (especially young girls) were often subjected to sexual abuse by their masters, their masters' children and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Nell Irvin&gt; "Soul Murder and Slavery: Toward A Fully Loaded Cost Accounting," ''U.S. History as Women's History'', 1995, p 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, indentured servants and [[slave women in the United States|slave women]] were often abused. Since these women had no control over where they went or what they did, their masters could manipulate them into situations of high risk (for instance, forcing them into a dark field or making them sleep in their master's bedroom to be available for service).&lt;ref&gt;Block, Sharon. "Lines of Color, Sex, and Service: Sexual Coercion in the Early Republic," ''Women's America'', p 129-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Free (or white) women could charge their perpetrators with rape, but slave women had no legal recourse; their bodies legally belonged to their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Sharon. "Lines of Color", 137.&lt;/ref&gt; This record has also given historians the opportunity to explore sexual abuse during slavery in populations other than enslaved women.

In 1662, the southern colonies adopted into law the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', by which the children of slave women took the status of their mothers (regardless of paternity). This was a departure from English common law, which held that children took the status of their father. Some fathers freed their children, but many did not. The law relieved men of responsibility to support their children, and restricted the open secret of [[miscegenation]] to the slave quarters. However, Europeans and other visitors to the south noted the number of mixed-race slaves. During the 19th century [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]], whose husbands were planters, chronicled the disgrace of white men taking sexual advantage of slave women.

===Resisting reproduction===
Some women resisted reproduction in order to resist slavery. They found medicine or herbs to terminate pregnancies or practiced abstinence. For example, chewing on [[cotton]] root was one of the more popular methods to perform abortion and end a pregnancy. This method was often used as the plant was readily available, especially for the women who worked in cotton fields.&lt;ref name=Perrin&gt;Perrin, Liese M. "Resisting Reproduction: Reconsidering Slave Contraception in the Old South," ''Journal of American Studies'' 35, no. 2 (August 2001): 255. America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost (accessed October 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gossypol]] was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant, and it was described by scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It appears to inhibit the development of sperm or restrict the mobility of the sperm.&lt;ref name=Perrin/&gt; Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones. Women's knowledge of different forms of contraception helped them control some factors in their life.&lt;ref name=Perrin/&gt;

By resisting reproduction, enslaved women took control over their bodies and their lives. Richard Follet says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;by consciously avoiding pregnancy or through gynecological resistance, black women reclaimed their own bodies, frustrated the planters' pro-natalist policies, and in turn defied white male constructions of their sexuality. Whether swallowing abortifacients such as calomel and turpentine or chewing on natural contraceptives like cotton roots or okra, slave women wove contraception and miscarriages through the dark fabric of slave oppositional culture.&lt;ref name=Follett&gt;Follett, Richard. "'Lives of living death': The reproductive lives of slave women in the cane world of Louisiana," ''Slavery &amp; Abolition'' 26, no. 2 (August 2005): 289-304. America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost (accessed November 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By using various ways to resist reproduction, some women convinced their masters they could not bear children. Deborah Gray White cites several cases of women who were considered by their masters to be infertile during slavery. These women went on to have several healthy children after they were freed.&lt;ref name=White&gt;Deborah Gray White, Mia Bay and Waldo E. Martin, ''Freedom on My Mind'', Volume 1: A History of African Americans, with Documents (Bedford/St. Martins, Dec 14, 2012), 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Other slave women used [[abstinence]]. "Slave men and women appear to have practised abstinence, often with the intention of denying their master any more human capital." It was not just women who resisted reproduction, in some instances men did also. An ex-slave, Virginia Yarbrough, explained how one slave woman persuaded the man that her master told her to live with to practice abstinence. After three months, the master realized that the couple were not going to produce any children, so he let her live with the man of her choice, and they had children. "By abstaining from sexual intercourse, she was able to resist her master's wishes and live and have children with the man she loved."&lt;ref name=Perrin/&gt;

Women resisted reproduction to avoid bringing children into slavery, and to deprive their owners of future property and profit. "In addition to the labor they provided, slaves were a profitable investment: Their prices rose steadily throughout the antebellum era, as did the return that slave owners could expect when slaves reproduced."&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Liese M. Perrin writes, "In avoiding direct confrontation, slave women had the potential to resist in a way which pierced the very heart of slavery- by defying white slave owners the labour and profits that their children would one day provide."&lt;ref name=Perrin/&gt; Women knew that slave children were forced to start working at a very young age.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;Li, Stephanie. "Motherhood as Resistance in Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl," ''Legacy'' 23, no. 1 (May 2006): 14-29. America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost (accessed October 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Life was harsh under slavery, with little time for a mother and child to bond. Enslaved women and their children could be separated at any time.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; Women were forced to do heavy work even if pregnant. Sometimes this caused miscarriage or difficulties in childbirth. Richard Follett explains that "heavy physical work undermines reproductive fitness, specifically ovarian function, and thus limits success in procreation."&lt;ref name=Follett/&gt; An enslaved woman carried her infant with her to field work, nursing it during brief breaks. For instance, in ''Freedom on My Mind''', it is said that "as an infant, he rode on his mother's back while she worked in the fields to nurse."&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Women's use of contraception was resistance and a form of strike, since slave women were expected to reproduce.&lt;ref name=Perrin/&gt;

Despite acts of resistance, many slave women had numerous children. Peter Kolchin notes that some historians estimate a birthrate of 7 children per slave woman during the antebellum era, which was an era of large families among free women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, Peter. ''American Slavery: 1619-1877''. Hill and Wang, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on womanhood===
Slave women were unable to maintain African traditions, although some were carried on. African women  were born/raised to give birth, there were no rituals or cultural customs. "Under extreme conditions the desire and ability of women to have children is reduced".{{Attribution needed|date=May 2014}} Slavery removed everything that made them feel woman, motherly, African. A "normal" African family life was impossible; women were in the field most of the day and fathers were almost non-existent. In Africa, "Motherhood was the fulfillment of female adulthood and fertility the African women's greatest gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=Barbara|title=African Caribbean Slave Mothers And Children: Traumas Of Dislocation And Enslavement Across The Atlantic World|journal=Caribbean Quarterly|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave breeding was the attempt by a slave-owner to influence the reproduction of his slaves for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, Manning, ''How capitalism underdeveloped Black America: problems in race, political economy, and society'' South End Press, 2000, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; It included forced sexual relations between male and female slaves, encouraging slave pregnancies, sexual relations between master and slave to produce slave children and favoring female slaves who had many children.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ibid, p 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel economist [[Robert Fogel]] disagreed in his controversial 1970s work that slave-breeding and sexual exploitation destroyed black families. Fogel argued that since the family was the basic unit of social organization under slavery, it was in the economic interest of slaveholders to encourage the stability of slave families and most did so. Most slave sales were either of entire families, or of individuals at an age when it would have been normal for them to leave home.&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;Weiss, Thomas. [http://eh.net/book_reviews/time-on-the-cross-the-economics-of-american-negro-slavery/ "Review of Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman, ''"Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery"''], ''Economic History News Services – Book Reviews'', November 16, 2001. Book review. Retrieved July 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, testimony from former slaves does not support Fogel's view. For instance, [[Frederick Douglass]] (who grew up as a slave in Maryland) reported the systematic separation of slave families and widespread rape of slave women to boost slave numbers.&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Douglass, Frederick [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Douglass/Autobiography/01.html ''Autobiography of Frederick Douglass''], ''Autobiography of Frederick Douglass'', 1845. Book. Retrieved June 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of cotton plantations in the Deep South, planters in the Upper South frequently broke up families to sell "surplus" male slaves to other markets. In addition, court cases (such as those of [[Margaret Garner]] in Ohio or [[State of Missouri v. Celia, a Slave|Celia, a slave]] in 19th-century [[Missouri]], who killed her master when pregnant by him for the third time) dealt{{how|date=April 2018}} with women slaves who had been sexually abused by their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Melton A. McLaurin, ''Celia, A Slave'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1991, pp. x–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Families===
Slaves were predominantly male during the early colonial era, but the ratio of male to female slaves became more equal in later years. Under slavery, planters and other slaveholders owned, controlled and sold entire families of slaves.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 234"/&gt; The slave population increased in the southern United States as native-born slaves produced large families. Slave women were at high risk for sexual abuse from slave owners and their sons, overseers, or other white men in power, as well as from male slaves.

Slaves were at a continual risk of losing family members if their owners decided to sell them for profit, punishment or to pay debts. Slaveholders also made gifts of slaves to grown children (or other family members) as wedding settlements. They considered slave children ready to work and leave home as young as age 12 or 14. A few slaves retaliated by murdering their owners and overseers, burning barns, and killing horses. But work slowdowns were the most frequent form of resistance and hard to control. Slaves also "walked away," going to the woods or a neighboring plantation for a while.&lt;ref name="Genovese 1967"&gt;Genovese (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slave narratives]] by escaped slaves published during the 19th century often included accounts of families broken up and women sexually abused.

During the early 1930s, members of the [[Federal Writers' Project]] interviewed former slaves and also made recordings of the talks (the only such records made). In 2007, the interviews were remastered, reproduced on [[CD]]s and published in book form in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]], [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Productions]] and a [[National Public Radio]] project. In the introduction to the oral history project (''Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Emancipation''), the editors wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As masters applied their stamp to the domestic life of the slave quarter, slaves struggled to maintain the integrity of their families. Slaveholders had no legal obligation to respect the sanctity of the slave's marriage bed, and slave women— married or single – had no formal protection against their owners' sexual advances. ...Without legal protection and subject to the master's whim, the slave family was always at risk.&lt;ref&gt;''Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Emancipation'' edited by [[Ira Berlin]], Marc Favreau, and Steven F. Miller, pp. 122–3. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-228-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book includes a number of examples of enslaved families who were torn apart when family members were sold out of state, and accounts of sexual violation of enslaved women by men in power.

==={{anchor|Stereotypes of female slaves}}Female slave stereotypes===
The evidence of white men having sexual unions with slave women was obvious in the many mixed-race children who were born into slavery and part of many households. In some areas, such mixed-race families became the core of domestic and household servants, as at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]]. Both his father-in-law and he took mixed-race slave women as [[concubines]] after being widowed; each man had six children by his slave. Jefferson's young concubine, [[Sally Hemings]], was 3/4 white, the daughter of his father-in-law John Wayles and the half-sister of his late wife.

By the 19th century, popular Southern literature characterized female slaves as lustful and promiscuous "[[Jezebel]]s" who shamelessly tempted white owners into sexual relations. This stereotype of the promiscuous slave was partially motivated by the need to rationalize the obvious sexual relations that took place between female slaves and white males, as evidenced by the children.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"/&gt; The stereotype was reinforced by female slaves' working partially clothed, due to the hot climate. During slave auctions, females were sometimes displayed nude or only partially clothed.&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"/&gt; [[Edward Ball (American author)|Edward Ball]], in his ''Slaves in the Family'' (1995), noted that it was more often the planters' sons who took advantage of slave women before their legal marriages to white women, than did the senior planters.

===Concubines and sexual slaves===
{{main|History of sexual slavery in the United States|Plaçage}}
Many female slaves (known as "fancy maids") were sold at auction into concubinage or prostitution, which was called the "fancy trade".&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"/&gt; Concubine slaves were the only female slaves who commanded a higher price than skilled male slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Baptist, Edward E. "'Cuffy', 'Fancy Maids', and 'One-Eyed Men': Rape Commodification, and the Domestic Slave Trade in the United States", in ''The Chattel Principle: Internal Slave Trades in the Americas'', Walter Johnson (Ed.), Yale University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early [[Louisiana]] colonial period, French men took wives and mistresses from the slaves; they often freed their children and, sometimes, their mistresses. A sizable class of [[free people of color]] developed in [[New Orleans]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and outlying areas (such as Isle Brevelle). By the late 18th century white creole men of New Orleans, known as French Creoles, had a relatively formal system of ''[[plaçage]]'' among free women of color, which continued under Spanish rule. Mothers negotiated settlements (or dowries) for their daughters to be mistresses to white men. In some cases, young men took such mistresses before their marriages to white women; in others, they continued the relationship after marriage. They were known to pay for the education of their children (especially their sons, whom they sometimes sent to France for schooling and military service).

===Anti-miscegenation sentiment===
{{See also|Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States}}
There was a growing feeling among whites that [[miscegenation]] was damaging to [[racial purity]].  Some segments of society began to disapprove of any sexual relationships between blacks and whites, whether slave or free, but particularly between white women and black men.  In Utah, sexual relationships with a slave resulted in the slave being freed.&lt;ref name=Utah_codes /&gt;

===Mixed-race children===
{{main|Children of the plantation}}
The children of white fathers and slave mothers were mixed-race slaves, whose appearance was generally classified as [[mulatto]] (this term originally meant a person with white and black parents, but then encompassed any mixed-race person). By the turn of the 19th century many mixed-race families in Virginia dated to colonial times; white women (generally indentured servants) had unions with slave and free African-descended men. Because of the mother's status, those children were born free and often married other [[free people of color]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina''], 1998–2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the generations of interaction, an increasing number of slaves in the United States during the 19th century were of mixed race. In the United States, children of mulatto and black slaves were also generally classified as mulatto. With each generation, the number of mixed-race slaves increased. The 1850 census identified 245,000 slaves as mulatto; by 1860, there were 411,000 slaves classified as mulatto out of a total slave population of 3,900,000.&lt;ref name="Marable, p 74"/&gt; As noted above, some mixed-race people won freedom from slavery or were born as free blacks.

If free (depending on state law), some mulattoes were legally classified as white because they had more than one-half to seven-eighths white ancestry. Questions of social status were often settled in court, but a person's acceptance by neighbors, fulfillment of citizen obligations and other aspects of social status were more important than lineage in determining "whiteness".

Notable examples of mostly-white children born into slavery were the "natural" children of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by his mixed-race slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was three-quarters white by ancestry. Since 2000 historians have widely accepted Jefferson's paternity; the change in scholarship has been reflected in exhibits at Monticello and in recent books about Jefferson and his era. Some historians, however, continue to disagree with this conclusion.

Speculation exists on the reasons George Washington [[Manumission|freed his slaves]] in his will. One theory posits that the slaves included two half-sisters of his wife, [[Martha Washington|Martha Custis]]. Those mixed-race slaves were born to slave women owned by Martha's father, and were regarded within the family as having been sired by him. Washington became the owner of Martha Custis' slaves (under Virginia law) when he married her, and faced the ethical conundrum of owning his wife's sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiencek|first=Henry|title=An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America|date=November 15, 2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|isbn=978-0374175269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship of skin color to treatment====
As in Thomas Jefferson's household, the use of lighter-skinned slaves as household servants was not simply a choice related to skin color. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants (or favored artisans) because they were their children, or otherwise relatives. Six of Jefferson's later household slaves were the grown children of his father-in-law [[John Wayles]] and his slave mistress [[Betty Hemings]].&lt;ref&gt;Note: As the historians [[Philip D. Morgan]] and Joshua D. Rothman have written, this was one of numerous interracial relationships in the Wayles-Hemings-Jefferson families, Albemarle County and Virginia, often with multiple generations repeating the pattern. {{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=jaoC2BtS4OIC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Philip+D.+Morgan#v=onepage&amp;q=Philip%20D.%20Morgan&amp;f=false| author=Philip D.

Onuf| publisher= University of Virginia Press| year= 1999| isbn= 978-0-8139-1919-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;Joshua D. Rothman, ''Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Interracial Relationships Across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861'', University of North Carolina Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Half-siblings of Jefferson's wife Martha, they were inherited by her (with Betty Hemings and other slaves) a year after her marriage to Jefferson following the death of her father. At that time, some of the Hemings-Wayles children were very young; [[Sally Hemings]] was an infant. They were trained as domestic and skilled servants, and headed the slave hierarchy at Monticello.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Annette Gordon-Reed]], ''[[The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family]]'', New York: W.W. Norton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, historians have widely accepted that the widowed Jefferson had a nearly four-decade relationship with [[Sally Hemings]], the youngest daughter of Wayles and Betty.&lt;ref name="Rothman"/&gt; It was believed to have begun when he was US minister in Paris, and she was part of his household. Sally was nearly 25 years younger than his late wife; Jefferson had six children of record with her, four of whom survived. Jefferson had his three mixed-race sons by Hemings trained as carpenters (a skilled occupation) so they could earn a living after he freed them when they came of age. Three of his four children by Hemings (including his daughter Harriet, the only slave woman he freed) "[[passing (racial identity)|passed]]" into white society as adults because of their appearance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account|website=Monticello|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation|accessdate=4 November 2011}} Quote: "Based on the documentary, scientific, statistical, and oral history evidence, the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (January 2000) remains the most comprehensive analysis of this historical topic. Ten years later, TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston Hemings."&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians disagree with these conclusions about Jefferson's paternity; see [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy]].

Planters with mixed-race children sometimes arranged for their education (occasionally in northern schools) or apprenticeship in skilled trades and crafts. Others settled property on them, or otherwise passed on social capital by freeing the children and their mothers. While fewer in number than in the Upper South, free blacks in the [[Deep South]] were often mixed-race children of wealthy planters and sometimes benefited from transfers of property and social capital. [[Wilberforce University]], founded by [[Methodist]] and [[African Methodist Episcopal]] (AME) representatives in [[Ohio]] in 1856 for the education of African-American youth, was during its early history largely supported by wealthy southern planters who paid for the education of their mixed-race children. When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, the majority of the school's 200 students were of mixed race and from such wealthy Southern families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfWCqvkp_OUC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA260,M1 James T.

'''''Warnings: Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes''''' is a book published by HarperCollins Ecco and written by former United States intelligence and counterterrorism official [[Richard A. Clarke]], and former White House National Security Council Director, and U.S. and UN senior diplomat [[RP Eddy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Warnings-Finding-Cassandras-Stop-Catastrophes/dp/0062488023 | title=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book offers a framework, "The Cassandra Coefficient," to help determine which warnings decisions makers should look into more closely, and if some warnings deserve less attention. The case studies range from national security, to threatening technologies, to the global economy, to climate change and speculates on various potential threats to civilization.

==Content==
The authors cover seven case studies in which data driven, proven, credible experts specifically warned of a pending catastrophe, were ignored by the decision makers, and the disaster subsequently struck just as predicted. The authors call these seers, "Cassandras" after the Greek mythological figure who could foretell disaster but was cursed to never be believed. The authors propose a method to separate accurate predictions of danger from inaccurate doomsayers, "The Cassandra Coefficient." They then investigate experts who today are warning of future disasters—the threats from artificial intelligence, bio-hacking, mutating viruses, and more—and whose calls are not being heeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062488022/warnings | title=Harpercollins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concluding chapter describes how individuals and organizations can employ the Cassandra Coefficient, hedging and "sentinel intelligence," to watch potential disasters so as to not be surprised by them, and expend the necessary remediative resources only when necessary.

==Reception==
''Warnings'' was lauded and recommended by President [[Bill Clinton]] (who noted it on his recommended reading list),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hess|first1=Abigail|title=12 books Bill Clinton hopes you'll enjoy reading as much as he did|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/10/12-books-bill-clinton-hopes-you-enjoy-as-much-as-he-did.html|website=CNBC|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'' and subsequent interviews, [[Hillary Clinton]] referred to ''Warnings'' and noted the value the Cassandra Theory could have had to encourage decision makers to take the Russian hacking threat in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election more seriously.{{pages needed|date=October 2017}}
