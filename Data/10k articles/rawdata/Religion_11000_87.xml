'''After School Satan''' is an [[After-school activity|after school program]] project of [[The Satanic Temple]], an [[United States|American]] [[political]] [[activist]] religious organization based in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; and is sponsored by Reason Alliance LTD, a [[501(c)3]] non-profit organization.&lt;ref name="Snoped1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Did the IRS 'Fast Track' Tax Exempt Status for After School Satan Clubs?|url = https://www.snopes.com/irs-satan-clubs/|publisher=[[Snopes]]|access-date = 2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as an alternative to the [[Christian]]-based after school groups, like the [[Good News Club]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=https://afterschoolsatan.com/educatin-with-satan/faq/|website=After School Satan|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Rick|title=Yes, an after-school Satan Club could be coming to your kid's grade school|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-satanic-after-school-20160928-snap-story.html|website=LA Times|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-port"&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland OKs "After School Satan" for elementary kids|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-school-satan-satanic-temple-portland-approved/|website=CBS News|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are After School Satan clubs in cities across the United States, including [[Atlanta, GA|Atlanta]], [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]], [[Salt Lake City, UT|Salt Lake City]],  [[Pensacola, FL|Pensacola]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Tucson, AZ|Tucson]], [[Springfield, MO]], [[Seattle, WA]] and [[Portland, OR]].&lt;ref name="cbs-port"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satanic Temple brings 'After School Satan Club' to Portland school|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/27/satanic-temple-brings-after-school-satan-club-to-portland-school.html|website=Fox News|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cafazzo|first1=Debbie|title=State’s first After-School Satan Club set to open|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/education/article113424598.html|website=The News Tribune|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Club|url=https://afterschoolsatan.com/find-a-club/|website=After School Satan|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Supreme Court decision ''[[Good News Club v. Milford Central School]]'' held that when a government operates a "limited public forum" it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses. The "limited public forum" in the case was referring to after school programs, that the schools provided space for, but was not run by the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gearan |first1=Anne |title=Supreme Court Says Religious Clubs Can Meet at Public Schools |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92875&amp;page=1 |website=[[ABC News|abc NEWS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716194402/http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92875 |archivedate=16 July 2015 |date=11 June 2001 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After School Satan was created by The Satanic Temple in July 2016 to ensure that equal representation for all religions is upheld in public schools, and religious freedom and plurality is respected.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that religious groups are permitted to establish clubs to proselytize after hours using public school classrooms, the Christian-based Good News Club has established thousands of such clubs. In response, The Satanic Temple began a campaign to establish its own clubs across the United States. According to one organizer, "Whenever religion enters the public sphere, like the Good News Club at public schools, we take action to ensure that more than one religious voice is represented, and that is our intent with the After School Satan Club."&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

The clubs follow a standard syllabus, and strive to provide students with the critical thinking skills necessary to be able to make important life decisions for themselves.  They emphasize a scientific and rationalist, non-superstitious world view, and oppose "indoctrination" into other-worldly belief systems.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

According to The Satanic Temple and After School Satan's co-founder and spokesperson, [[Lucien Greaves]]: {{Quote|text=It’s critical that children understand that there are multiple perspectives on all issues, and that they have a choice in how they think... "Satan" is just a "metaphorical construct" intended to represent the rejection of all forms of tyranny over the human mind.&lt;ref name="satanclub"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/an-after-school-satan-club-could-be-coming-to-your-kids-elementary-school/2016/07/30/63f485e6-5427-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html?tid=pm_pop_b|title=An After School Satan Club Could Be Coming To Your Child's Elementary School|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  and adds {{quote|"We are only doing this because Good News Clubs have created a need for this. If Good News Clubs would operate in churches rather than public schools, that need would disappear. But our point is that if you let one religion into the public schools you have to let others, otherwise it’s an establishment of religion."&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;}}

One "well attended" club in Seattle had to pause their activities during the 2017-2018 school year due to lack of funds and, or volunteers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tacoma Elementary School Is Ending Its After-School Satan Club, but Not for the Reason You Think|url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/09/13/25411593/tacoma-elementary-school-is-ending-its-after-school-satan-club-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/|website=The Stranger|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tacoma’s After-School Satan Club is on pause for now, says Satanic Temple of Seattle|url=https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article173005561.html|website=The News Tribune|first=Candice|last=Ruud|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
After School Satan Clubs "incorporate games, projects, and thinking exercises that help children understand how we know what we know about our world and our universe."&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swann|first1=Jennifer|title=L.A.’s After School Satan Club Is Coming for Your Children|url=http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/l-s-school-satan-club-coming-children/|website=LA Times|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanic Temple spokesman Finn Rezz said the club "would focus on science and rational thinking," promoting "benevolence and empathy for everybody" – while providing an alternative voice to the Bible-centred "Good News Club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School grants Satanic Temple permission to run after-school club for 10-year-olds|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/28/school-grants-satanic-temple-permission-to-run-after-school-club/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After School Satan Clubs do not teach children to believe in supernatural beings named Satan or perform Satanic rituals.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emery|first1=David|title=Satan's Waitin'|url=http://www.snopes.com/after-school-satan-clubs/|website=Snopes|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A group of Christian pastors and other religious leaders met in Tacoma, Washington to discuss the proposition that the After School Satan program would be allowed at a local school. One pastor remarked, "We want to cut this off and defeat it before it ever gets a chance to take root." Another pastor commented, "We are the taxpayers here and we ought to stand up and let them know they are not welcome, they don't pay taxes here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiro7.com/news/south-sound-news/tacoma-pastors-speak-out-against-satanic-temple-after-school-club/458597125 Tacoma pastors speak out against Satanic Temple after-school club]; KIRO7 News;  Henry Rosoff; Oct 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrar|first1=Stefan|title=NATION’S SECOND AFTER-SCHOOL SATANIC CLUB APPROVED|url=http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/nations-second-after-school-satanic-club-approved|website=Church Militant|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A petition circulated in protest of the club gained more than 100,000 signatures, and stated, "I strongly protest the After School Satan Club that is being allowed on your premises. This is a grave threat to the spiritual life of children and the future of education. I urge you to revoke The Satanic Temple's permit. Satan has no place in education. Don't let the devil near our children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/after-school-satan-club-sparks-protests After-School Satan Club Sparks Outrage From Parents]; ''ChurchMilitant.com''; Stefan Farrar; December 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Journalist ===
Sorkin first joined ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a student intern during his senior year in high school. He also worked for the paper while he was in college, publishing 71 articles before he graduated. He began by writing media and technology articles while assisting the advertising columnist, Stuart Elliott. Sorkin spent the summer of 1996 working for ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Businessweek]]'', before returning to ''The New York Times''.  He moved to [[London]] for part of 1998. While there, he wrote about European business and technology for ''The New York Times'' and then returned to Cornell to complete his studies. At Cornell, he was vice president of the [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity.

==== Mergers and acquisitions reporter ====
Sorkin joined ''The New York Times'' full-time in 1999 as the newspaper's European mergers and acquisitions reporter, and was based in London. In 2000, Sorkin became the paper's chief mergers and acquisitions reporter, based in New York, a position he still holds. In 2001, Sorkin founded "DealBook," an online daily financial report published by the ''Times''. As Editor-at-Large of "DealBook," Sorkin writes a weekly column of the same name. Sorkin is also an assistant editor of business and finance news for the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-ross-sorkin|title=Andrew Ross Sorkin|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin has broken news of major [[mergers and acquisitions]], including Chase's acquisition of [[JPMorgan Chase]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s acquisition of [[Compaq]]. He also led ''The New York Times''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' coverage of the largest takeover in history, [[Vodafone]]'s $183 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann. Additionally, he broke the news of [[IBM]]'s sale of its PC business to [[Lenovo]], [[Boston Scientific]]'s $25 billion acquisition of [[Guidant]] and [[Symantec]]'s $13 billion deal for [[Veritas Software]], and reported on News Corp.'s acquisition of [[Dow Jones]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Sorkin has reported on the [[Wall Street]] [[financial crisis]], including the collapse of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Lehman Brothers]], and the government bailout of other major [[investment banks]] and [[AIG]]. He has also written about the troubled American [[auto industry]].

In 2007, Sorkin was one of the first journalists to identify and criticize a tax loophole for private equity firms and hedge funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/business/18sorkin.html |title=Bobbing as the Tax Man Weaves |date=17 May 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first wrote about the topic in a column in March 2007, calling the tax treatment a "charade",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/business/yourmoney/11deal.html|title=Of Private Equity, Politics and Income Taxes|date=11 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later wrote about it on the front page of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/business/21tax.html|title=Congress Weighs End to Private Equity Tax Break|date=21 June 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written at least a half dozen articles critiquing the tax practice by private equity firms and advocated for the government to end the loophole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/business/10sorkin.html|title=Putting a Bull’s-Eye on a Tax Loophole|date=10 March 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Sorkin wrote a series of columns criticizing American corporations for trying to lower their US tax bill by merging with smaller foreign companies in a transaction known as an "inversion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/a-deal-to-dodge-the-tax-man-in-america/|title=A Deal to Dodge the Tax Man in America|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized the Wall Street banks that advised US companies to pursue such deals, describing the banks as "corporate co-conspirators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/banks-cash-in-on-mergers-intended-to-elude-taxes/|title=Banks Cash in on Mergers Intended to Elude Taxes|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin called on the government to end the practice. On September 22, 2014, the Obama Administration changed the tax laws to make it more difficult for US companies to merge to avoid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/22/presidents-statement-todays-treasury-department-action-inversions|title=The President's Statement on Today's Treasury Department Action on Inversions|work=White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] surveillance program and [[Edward Snowden]] situation, Sorkin said, "I would arrest him and now I'd almost arrest [[Glenn Greenwald]], the journalist who seems to be out there, he wants to help him get to Ecuador."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/06/24/greenwald-beltway-media-types-are-courtiers-to-power/ Greenwald: Beltway media types are ‘courtiers to power’], ''Washington Post'', By Erik Wemple, Published: June 24, 2013, retrieved from washingtonpost.com on 6/24/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Sorkin apologized for the comment; Greenwald accepted, tweeting "Thank you: accepted &amp; appreciated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/349536779558338560|title=Glenn Greenwald on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing his record after his anti-Greenwald outburst, [[Matt Taibbi]] described Sorkin as "a shameless, ball-gargling prostitute for Wall Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Matt Taibbi|authorlink=Matt Taibbi|date=27 June 2013|title=Hey, MSM: All Journalism is Advocacy Journalism |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hey-msm-all-journalism-is-advocacy-journalism-78133/ |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anguiped''' is a kind of divinity that is often found on magical [[amulet]]s from the Greco-Roman period, and is characterized by having serpents for legs.

[[Abraxas]], the  most common kind of Anguiped, is depicted as a creature with the head of a [[rooster]] and [[snake]]s for legs, symbolism thought to be of [[Persian Empire|Persian]] origin. Sometimes inscribed below is ''Iao'', a form of the [[Tetragrammaton]] - the four letters used to represent the name of the God of [[Judaism]]. Such amulets as well as the usage of the name ''Iao'' repeatedly in magical papyri, curse tablets, gems, and other amulets, provide evidence of syncretist cults combining elements of Judaism with paganism. In the [[Talmud]], people who turned away from Judaism to such cults are referred to as ''minim'' - often translated as "[[heresy|heretics]]" or "[[apostate]]s".

The '''Authentic Renewal Organization (ORA)''' is an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] political party in [[Venezuela]], originally founded in 1988 by Godofredo Marín and Carlos Mendez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcohuaco.com/mh/bajados%2520marco/cratos.pdf+Organizaci%C3%B3n+Renovadora+Autentica&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=ve ''Partidos y movimientos políticos confesionales evangélicos en América Latina''] Riesgos y mitos de los partidos políticos confesionales en el Perú '''(in Spanish)'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORA does not align itself with any specific political ideology, but believes itself to be a form of government under the "sacred and noble [[Christian]] principles of love, peace, faith, and hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|last1=Reyes|first1=Luis|title=Propuesta de Gobierno|url=http://www.cne.gob.ve/divulgacion_presidencial_2012/programas/V5292054.pdf|accessdate=8 January 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In its first electoral participation, the party nominated one of its founders, Godofredo Ramón Marín, as a candidate for the general elections of 1988. The electoral promise of the party was based on "governing Venezuela for five years according to the Evangelical Bible,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaceta Electoral de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela N° 545|url=http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/gaceta_electoral/gaceta_electoral_detallado.php?num_gac=545|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with only 0.87% of the votes, the party and the candidate did not obtain the results they had expected. Despite their poor performance in the elections, the organization obtained two seats in the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Republic. The deputies elected at that time were Mr. Gabriel Niño Laguado, representative of the [[Zulia|Zulia State]], and Dr. Modesto Rivero, for the Federal District (Capital District). In 1993, ORA obtained a position in the Federal District in the Chamber of Deputies.

In 1997, the party was thrown into conflict when one sector decided to support the candidacy of [[Claudio Fermín]] for the presidency of the Republic. The other group, led by the party's president Godofredo Marín, resolved to support the candidate of the Democratic Action party [[Luis Alfaro Ucero]]. The ORA withdrew its support for Luis Alfaro Ucero. This resulted in him obtaining only 0.38% of the votes, of which ORA contributed 0.11%. That fact caused a fracture in the party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aciprensa.com/notic1998/marzo/notic286.htm ''División en partido evangélico''] ACI Prensa. 5 March 1998. '''(in Spanish)'''&lt;/ref&gt; making its options difficult for the general elections of 2000. The party did not run a presidential candidate nor obtain seats in the then newly installed National Assembly.

ORA last participation in Venezuelan national politics in 1998. After this, the political party was removed by the National Electoral Council for not having nominated new candidates. This removal led to the extinction of the ORA as a political party.

==Revival of ORA==
In 2010, political leader Luis Reyes Castillo, the former general secretary of the YOUNG political party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divulgación Presidenciales 2012|url=http://www.cne.gob.ve/resultado_presidencial_2012/r/1/reg_000000.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; established ORA not as a political party, but as a "Christian, social and political movement". Within two years, the ORA fulfilled the requirements of the National Electoral Council, and was registered as a political organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaceta Electoral de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela N° 545|url=http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/gaceta_electoral/gaceta_electoral_detallado.php?num_gac=545|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Luis Reyes Castillo launched his candidacy for the presidency of the Republic. Through this party he received 8,212 votes, which represented 0.05% of registered voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaceta Electoral de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela N° 545|url=http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/gaceta_electoral/gaceta_electoral_detallado.php?num_gac=545|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former political leader Juan Gonzalez, one of the founders of the original party in 1987, accused Rayes Castillo of kidnapping the political organization and its acronyms. According to González, Reyes Castillo discovered that ORA lacked leadership and resigned the general secretariat of his then-party, the YOUNG political movement, to reorganize the ORA party, without consulting its founders. In the elections of April 14, 2013, after the death of President Hugo Chávez, the party supported the candidate and active president [[Nicolás Maduro]]. This support is still maintained today, although the organization has submitted its candidates for the municipal elections in Venezuela, which were held on December 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Luis|last1=Aular Leal|title=ORA presentó sus candidatos a alcalde y concejales|url=http://elfalconianodigital.com/2013/08/ora-presento-sus-candidatos-a-alcalde-y-concejales/|publisher=Diario El Falconiano|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004830/http://elfalconianodigital.com/2013/08/ora-presento-sus-candidatos-a-alcalde-y-concejales/|archive-date=2013-10-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|first1=Carol|last1=Yanes Rivera|title=ORA organiza maqueta de candidatos a las municipales|url=http://elfalconianodigital.com/2013/07/ora-organiza-maqueta-de-candidatos-a-las-municipales/|publisher=Diario El Falconiano|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005022542/http://elfalconianodigital.com/2013/07/ora-organiza-maqueta-de-candidatos-a-las-municipales/|archive-date=2013-10-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts ''[[Akilathirattu Ammanai]]'' and ''[[Arul Nool]]''. Accordingly, Vaikundar was the Purna [[avatar]] of [[Narayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=A.

Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', pp. 111–113,&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyavazhi is classified as a dharmic belief because of its central focus on dharma.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi first came to public attention in the 19th century as a Hindu sect.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaikundar's activities and the growing number of followers caused a reformation and revolution in 19th century [[Travancore]]an&lt;ref&gt;R.

Though Ayyavazhi followers are spread across India,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dina Malar]]''(Leading Tamil News paper), ''Nagercoil Edition'', 4/3/2005 p. 12: "எனேவ இன்று அய்யா வைகுண்டசாமி வழிபாட்டு ஆலயங்கள் இந்தியா முழுவதும் வேராயிரம் பெற்ற விழுதுகளாய் படந்து ஆறாயிரத்துக்கு மேல் தோன்றி வளர்ந்து வருகிறது" Translated to "So today these worship centers of Vaikunda Sami is spread ''across India'' and growing with more than 6000 of them"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulose: Spread of Ayyavazhi"&gt;C.

Ayyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] (known historically as "Mudisoodum Perumal")&lt;ref name="Sociology of Ayyavazhi" /&gt; (c. 1809 – c. 1851 [[Common Era|CE]])&lt;ref&gt;Vaikundar is a historical as well as mythical figure. The historical Vaikundar ''(often referred to as 'Vaikunta Swami')'' refers to a person who lived between 1809 and 1851 CE. The [[Akilam]] myth says that Vaikundar was the God incarnate who incarnates in the body of [[Sampooranathevan]] (alias Muthukutty) in 1833 and lived to 1851. So according to Akilam, Sampooranathevan lived between 1809 and 1833 and Vaikundar then incarnated in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal (Sampooranathevan), living from 1833 to 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Swamithoppe|Poovandanthoppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 91: ''"By the middle of the nineteenth century, AV (abbreviation of Ayyavazhi) had expanded into a recognisable religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in South Tiruvitankur (Travancore) and in the southern parts of Tirunelveli.

==Symbolism==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi symbolism}}
[[File:Ayyavazhi Sahasrara.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sahasrara]], symbolised in Ayyavazhi as ''Lotus carrying Namam'']]
The symbol of Ayyavazhi is a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] carrying a flame-shaped white ''[[Thirunamam|Namam]]''.&lt;ref name="Namam Symbol"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulendiren|first=Pon|title=Hinduism a Scientific Religion|year=2012|publisher=[[iUniverse]]|location=Bloomington, Indiana.|isbn=9781475936735|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bwxDc6B9eokC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam"&gt;Tha. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled ''[[Sahasrara]]'' (in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''Ladam''), while the Namam represents the ''Aanma Jyothi'' or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]''.&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /&gt; Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Akilam15:39 "Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya ''Thirunama'' Pottumittu"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. Source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool – Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Thirunamam]] (the "flame shaped symbol" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;In the absence of written references, there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older, but is not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythical narration in akilam about the eight [[yuga]]s is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight [[chakra]]s.&lt;ref name="Yugas as Chakras"&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. (Additional) XII–XIII " Athara thana vilakka attavanai ".&lt;/ref&gt; The first, [[Neetiya Yukam]], is [[Bindu (symbol)|Bindu]] and the final state, [[Dharma Yukam]], is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of [[consciousness]] (''namam'') of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment, is for experiencing the absolute "bliss".&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is [[Ekam]], which is a part of Vaikundar a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute.&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /&gt; Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol "Lotus with Thirunamam" shows "Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara."

In certain [[Hindu]] texts, the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |publisher=kheper.net |title=Sahasrara Chakra |accessdate=3 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422124833/http://kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |archive-date=22 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]], Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]].&lt;ref name="Yugas as Chakras" /&gt; ''Sahasrara'' is symbolised as a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] without a stem.

Ayyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of ''Sahasrara'' is used to cover the roof.&lt;ref&gt;See this image[[:File:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png]], a Nizhal Thangal constructed in this architectural manner near Marthandam, [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus may also represent the [[Human heart|heart]] and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Pulavar. R. Shanmugam's, (2000), ''Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam'', Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ' ''Triple Namam'' '(not used currently), and [[Conch]].

==Teachings and impact==
{{Main article|Teachings and impacts of Ayyavazhi}}
The majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as ''Ayya'', "dear father", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam'', pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ekam evolution.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution of [[Ekam]], the source of whole [[existence]] (till [[Kali Yuga]])]]
Ayyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundara Mani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The [[Kali (demon)|evil of Kali]] blocks the ultimate or supreme [[henosis|oneness]] prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of [[Self (spirituality)|individuality]] and of [[Ego (spirituality)|extreme pride]]. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Ekam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woldman|first1=Jeanette|title=Travel guide to other dimensions.|date=2010|publisher=Woldman|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0984531017|page=16|edition=Illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; —the "over-soul" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is "one which undergoes different changes with respect to [[space and time]]" because of the evil force [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', pp. 103–121&lt;/ref&gt;

All of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Janak|title=World religions and the new era of science|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corp.|location=[S. l.]|isbn=1453535721|page=Hinduism 5}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 October 2014--&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam,&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#Worship in front of a mirror|mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship]]. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as [[Paramatma]] (over-soul) by which, God is the "Husband", while all other souls are his "consorts",&lt;ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" &gt;Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; symbolised by [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]], where Vaikundar marries the individual souls.&lt;ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" /&gt; Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the [[Creation myth|creation]] of [[human beings]] and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnumani, ''Ucchippadippu'', pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, p. 114 ''" Other verses from Akilattirattu like, 'throw the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes."''&lt;/ref&gt; It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.
From its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ward and Conner, Geographical and Statistical Memoir, p. 133; V. Nagam Aiya, The Travancore State Manual, Volume-2, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In this contest, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf.

The followers of Ayyavazhi established ''Pathis'' and ''Nizhal Thangals'', which are centers of worship and religious learning in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers"&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers" /&gt; There are thousands of ''Nizhal Thangals''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilstar.com/news/publish/article_3251.shtml |title=Sujibala without a blouse in Ayyavazhi (Preview about the Film 'Ayyavazhi') |accessdate=23 January 2008 |format=www.tamilstar.com |work="Now there are thousands of temples erected in honour of Vaigundaswamy." |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818154224/http://www.tamilstar.com/news/publish/article_3251.shtml |archivedate=18 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kollywoodtoday.com/news/nallakannu-watches-ayyavazhi/|title= Nallakannu Watches Ayyavazhi|accessdate=9 June 2008 |format= www.kollywoodtoday.com|work=" Now there are thousands of temples erected in Honour of Vaigundaswamy."}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout India,&lt;ref&gt;C. Paulose, ''Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattampi Swamikal'', p. 24, "To propagate his teachings and ideas he opened up 7 Pathis and 7 Tangs (The Primary Nizhal Thangals) in Travancore as well as hundreds of small pagodas (Nizhal Thangals) throughout India."

("The headquarters of all these Nizhal Thangals which are found across the country, is at the place called Swamithoppe as told earlier.")&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in South India.&lt;ref name="Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers"/&gt; There more than 7000 worship centres in South India mainly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan's, ''Ayyaa vaikuNdarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'' (Tamil), Chapter 4, p. 83: "இதற்கு ஆதாரமாக அய்யா வைகுண்டரைத் தெய்வமாக ஏற்றுக்கொண்ட சுமார் 8000 – க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அய்யாவழிப் பதிகள் தமிழ்நாடு மற்றும் கேரளப்பகுதிகளில் இயங்குவதைக் கூறலாம்." (This citation is from a Tamil Wikipedia article)&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of ''Nizhal Thangals''.&lt;ref&gt;From the following reports: ''James Town Mission District'' for 1863, ''Neyoor Mission District'' for 1869, ''Santhapuram Mission District'' for 1858, ''Nagercoil Mission District'' for 1864, from the ARTDC for the respective years.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, ''Swamithope pathi'' serves as the religious headquarters for all. The ''Pathi''s earn more importance among the worship centers.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers" /&gt;

The seven ''[[Pathi]]''s,&lt;ref name="Dr. Paulose's book" /&gt; obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers" /&gt; The ''Swamithope pathi'', though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All ''Pathis'', except itself, are managed by independent committees.&lt;ref&gt;N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World'', pp. 41–44&lt;/ref&gt; The five ''Pathis'' known as [[Pancha pathi]] are considered foremost among Pathis.

[[Nizhal Thangal]]s, compared with ''Pathis'', are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikundacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sarvesvaran, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamikal – A Forgotten Social Reformer'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118. Vaikuntacami is said to have established seven of these nilaltankalkal at Chettykudiyirrupu, Agastisvaram, Palur, Chundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadampankulam and Pampankulam.&lt;/ref&gt; and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

These centers emerged as the abode of Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Dharma'' (1985), Published by 'Center for the Study of World Religions', Dharmaram College, Bangalore.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide [[Panividai]] at least once daily.

==Ethics==
[[File:Flag mast of Swamithoppe.jpg|170px|thumb|right|The flag mast of [[Swamithoppe]] with Ayyavazhi symbol at the top]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi ethics}}
The ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, ''Akilattirattu Ammanai''.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics"&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', Chapter 5, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as "told by God" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], [[saint]]s, etc. when ever asked by them.

[[Neetham]] is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics" /&gt;

To an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and "attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] also.&lt;ref name="Dharma for devas" &gt;Mani Bharathi, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part – 2)''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.&lt;ref name="Dharma for devas" /&gt; Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]] with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] rules the minds of people.

Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religious studies==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}
[[File:Tamarai-Namam glossy.png|thumb|left|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]]]]
It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="G. Patrick, p.119"&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.

The philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'', pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name= "Hindu keys to Akilam"&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?'', pp.10–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the 96 [[tatvas]] are understood, then the [[Kaliyan]] is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts.&lt;ref name= "Hindu keys to Akilam" /&gt; Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.

On [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]], including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana and [[Vishnu Purana]], but with limited details.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream {{sic}} story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151.&lt;/ref&gt; Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; some are regenerated,&lt;ref name="G. Patrick, p.119"/&gt; while others are rejected.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures" /&gt; But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures"&gt;''Arisundara Mani'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. ''To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
[[File:The Evolution of Ekam.png|thumb|right|The Evolution – [[Ekam]] to [[Vaikundar]]]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi theology}}
The theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other [[monism|monistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, [[Infinity|infinite]], genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, "one", "absolute",&lt;ref&gt;M. Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]), {{ISBN|81-206-0001-0}}, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; "the whole which exists"&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; and "the incomparable";&lt;ref&gt;''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.

Narrating through mythology, The ''Sivam'' and the ''Sakthi'' are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The ''Natham''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from [[Akilam thirteen]] says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is [[Creation myth|created]] by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.

In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devil What Does He Look Like?|date=2012|publisher=Millennial Mind Pub|isbn=1589826620|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SD6-YKBqGr0C&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called ''Kalimayai'' (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 36, "Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance."&lt;/ref&gt; that contrasts the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

==Festivals and rituals==
[[File:Kodiyetru Thirunal.jpg|thumb|left|The flag hoisting fest during [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in [[Swamithope pathi]].]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}
There are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]] is celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month ''Masi'' (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the [[Solar calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass procession conducted on this day from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithoppe]] is a popular one in this part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021744/http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 27 September 2007|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=5 March 2007 |format= Kanyakumari District|work=Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thiru Edu-Vasippu]] is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ayyavazhi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30|title= www.ayyavazhi.org|accessdate=11 November 2007 |format= Festivals|work=Thiru Edu Vasippu

Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as '' 'Nitham Thirunal' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vazhvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as '' 'Anna Dharmam' '', physical as well as spiritual [[cleanliness]] through Thuvayal Thavasu,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sami+thope&amp;dq=Sami+thope&amp;pgis=1 The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181101/https://books.google.com/books?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sami+thope&amp;dq=Sami+thope&amp;pgis=1 |date=29 June 2016 }}'' (1986), Published by 'Mythic Society', Bangalore, India, v.77 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,&lt;ref name="Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices" &gt;''T. Krishnanathan'', ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.&lt;ref&gt;Akilathirattu p. 252: "the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Churul.jpg|thumb|right|A '' 'churul' '' prepared to be offered for Panividai]]
But they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The [[Muthirikkinaru]] and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the ''Patham'' and ''Namam'' of them have the power to heal all sorts of mental&lt;ref&gt;''N. Amalan'', ''Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varalaru'', Akilam Publications, 86–87: "முத்திரிபுகளை (மும்மலம்) போக்க முத்திரிக்கிணற்றில் பதம் விட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்".&lt;/ref&gt; as well as physical illness.&lt;ref name="Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] Report for the year ''1847'', pp. 88–89: ''"They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water as the cure for all their diseases."''&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundaramani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai'', p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ayyavazhi religious practices#Wearing of headgear during worship|use of the crown]] reveals that "all are kings", visualising an ideology similar to ''advaita''. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==
{{Main article|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}
The formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[Exclusivity (religion)|exclusivity]], as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
[[File:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|thumb|left|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars of Vishnu]] carved on it]]
Ayyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of [[Allah]] and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi"&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /&gt; But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clause|first1=Forrest|title=The Esoteric Codex: Fallen Angels|date=21 March 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329006461|page=41|edition=Illustrated}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda [[Avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in [[Akilam thirteen]] which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana,&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /&gt; but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the [[Books of the Bible|Bible composition]]. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is "it was created with the intention of man and not that of God".&lt;ref&gt;"He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention". – Akilam5:571&lt;/ref&gt; In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like '' 'Accept God; Reject religion' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'' p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' ''Hindu'' ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam 12:151 – "Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal"&lt;/ref&gt; Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boon]] they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali).&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp. 114 -116.&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.&lt;ref name= "Ayyavazhi belief system" /&gt;

==Mythology==

{{Main article|Ayyavazhi mythology}}
The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present, and a future – constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts."&lt;/ref&gt; It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]], is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula −6th&amp;11th Venpaas (a species of verse).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Zecharia (1826–1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805–1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing of Headgear during worship,&lt;ref&gt;M.S.S. Pandiyan, Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal Thavasu&lt;ref&gt;LMS Report for 1838, p. 71 says "About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform."&lt;/ref&gt; all were noted in history.

::::&lt;small&gt; * Chakras: The yugas assumed as chakras &amp; as geological time periods above, are philosophical and geological metaphors respectively and are not mentioned directly so in Akilam. &lt;/small&gt;
::::&lt;small&gt; ** Cambrian Explosion: As per [[Akilam]] the [[Kroni]] is fragmented into six and each of the fragments took birth in each subsequent yugas. So the death of Kroni as in the Akilam narrative is to be considered as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], where the diversification of life begins, in spite of it being listed as an extinction in the context of the destruction of Kroni. . &lt;/small&gt;

Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten [[Avatars of Vishnu]], it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and Dharma yukam==
[[File:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide celestial [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]
{{Main article|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}
[[The Santror]] is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 151 "Canror (Santror) is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)"&lt;/ref&gt; There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.&lt;ref name="Chanar"&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early "Chanars", who were called by the Arabs as "Al Hind", and known in biblical times as the "People of Five Rivers"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp| title= Nadar Community – Who Are they| accessdate= 23 January 2008| format= Nadars – Where they live? what they do? reason behind their success| work= "Nadars are one of the earliest inhabitants of our land, Bharat, which was later called by the Arabs as 'Al Hind'. In biblical times they were known as the 'People of Five Rivers'."| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127144306/http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp| archivedate= 27 January 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term "Santror" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignity&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 23, line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and supreme knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A quote from Akilam too reads, "Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly."&lt;ref name="Chanar" /&gt;

The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to be born in the mythical garden [[Ayotha Amirtha Gangai|Ayodha Amirtha Vanam]] ''(supposed to be between present-day [[Srirangam]], Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, [[Sri Lanka]])'' by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by [[Thirumal]], to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term "Santror" refers to the entire [[human race]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage started at the end phase of [[Dvapara Yuga|Dvapara Yukam]] and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.

The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of [[Dharma Yukam]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam."&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the belief is that [[Ayya Vaikundar]] had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 109 says, "Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it."&lt;/ref&gt; over the Dharma Yukam in the place of [[Kali Yukam]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam."&lt;/ref&gt; after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of ''Dwaraka pathi'', the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]] by [[Krishna]]) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swami|first1=Bhaktivejanyana|title=Ithihaasa: The Mystery of His Story Is My Story of History|date=2013|publisher=Author House|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=1477242732|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BqHBvySDxEQC&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=SM. |last1=Ramasamy|title=Geomatics in tsunami|date=2006|publisher=New India Publ. agency|location=New Dehli|isbn=8189422316|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5gEBfvCBclUC&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 161, "Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist eternally&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to [[Moksha]]—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', pp. 657–658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}
The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remained with Divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kirushnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and are unhelpful.

The reason, as stated in [[Akilam]] for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], there in [[Mount Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Brahma]] surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to [[Shaivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Here the ideology changes similar to that of [[Vaishnavism]]. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.
[[File:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya Vaikundar|Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]] the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by [[Lakshmi]] and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt;

And from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and [[Brahma]] therefore form a part within Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" &gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through [[Vinchai]]s.&lt;ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" /&gt; After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name="Akilathirattu parts" &gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.&lt;ref name="Akilathirattu parts" /&gt; So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.

==Phenomenology==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}
[[File:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar|Prajapathi Adikalar]], Last Descendant of the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyan]] family of [[Swamithope pathi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|title= www.dhyanapeetam.org|accessdate= 20 February 2009|format= Peace Walk (Pada Yatra) by Swamiji – Tamil Nadu – 12 January 2009 onwards|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303104019/http://dhyanapeetam.org/Web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|archivedate= 3 March 2009|deadurl= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiruvasakam – 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.)&lt;/ref&gt; But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' or ''Narayana Swami Temple'', similar to Hindu [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as [[Kali]], [[Hanuman]] and other folk deities in spite of the anti-[[polytheistic]] ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities"&gt;Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten [[Avatar]]s of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 1, ''"Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya."''&lt;/ref&gt; The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" /&gt; Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" /&gt;

The spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).&lt;ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai"&gt;R. Shunmugam, ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', pp. 189–191&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]].&lt;ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai" /&gt; Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, " ... but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and&amp;nbsp;..." Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar.&lt;/ref&gt; Not even the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyans]] from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Court Judgement, District Court, Nagercoil, Case: O.S. No.80/1110, '' "The doctrines and the philosophic basis of this cult are not clearly known. Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism"''&lt;/ref&gt; All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a religion|as a separate belief]] and instead taken as [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a Hindu sect|a Hindu sect]].

There is a common belief that Ayya Vaikundar is a [[prophet]] and he had made many prophecies during his earthly years. On the contrary, there are no implications in [[Akilam]] or other books of [[Arul Nool]] that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)|Thiruvasagam 4]], Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of [[Prophecies]] and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the [[Seedars]] by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. [[Robert Caldwell]], one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] [[Christian missionary]]), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergunder|first1=Michael|last2=Frese|first2=Heiko|title=Ritual, caste, and religion in colonial South India|date=2011|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=9380607210|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OcEM2IsnA1AC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Ayya+Vaikundar#v=onepage&amp;q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}
Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The [[Ayyavazhi rituals|rituals]] are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', "Rituals", p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to [[Shastras]], [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Akilattirattu Ammanai (T. Palaramachandran Nadar), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar,&lt;ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar" /&gt; from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a ''Hindu renaissance''.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp.62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp.163–178.&lt;/ref&gt; as it brought many social changes there in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala|keralite]] society during the 19th century.

The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as ''"Path of God"'' with the phrase ''"Ayya Vazhi"''. On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that [[Vaikundar]] unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar"&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, '' "Ayya Vali – A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon" '', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate [[Ayyavazhi theology|theology]], [[Ayyavazhi mythology|mythology]], [[Ayyavazhi holy sites|holy places]], [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centres]], and ethics of its own. [[File:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|thumb|right|'' 'The Great Masi Procession' '' from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]]]]
Though many new papers, academic researchers&lt;ref name= "Historical Dictionary of Shamanism" /&gt; and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last = Bagavathikan|first = M.

Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.

Regarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across [[India]], comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of [[Tamil Nadu]], it is very hard to find a village without a [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centre of Ayyavazhi]].&lt;ref name="Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers" /&gt; Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers)&lt;ref name="Paulose: Spread of Ayyavazhi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers"&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered [[Hindu]]s in the census.

In [[Malaysian folk religion|Malaysian folklore]], the '''Bisan''' (meaning "woman") is a female [[nature spirit]] or [[deity]] widely venerated among the [[Malay people|Malay]] and [[Jakun people|Jakun]] natives.  It is believed that every species of tree has a unique spirit presiding over it, and the Bisan is said to be the specific guardian of the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor-bearing tree]]. She can appear in the form of a [[cicada]], and even makes cicada-like sounds at night when she sings—a sure indication that camphor will be found nearby. However, the Bisan is a very jealous spirit, and will drive away anyone looking for camphor unless she is correctly propitiated. Offerings of food may be given to her, and she may also accept the sacrifice of a white [[cockerel]]. To prevent the Bisan even further, a person must speak to her only in ''bahasa kapor'' or ''patang kapor'' ("camphor language", a mixture of [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Jakun language|Jakun]]), an artificial language specifically made to completely confuse the Bisan long enough for the person to look for camphor unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Littell, Eliakim and Robert S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">The '''Boethusians''' ({{Lang-he-n|בייתוסים}}) were a [[Jew]]ish sect closely related to, if not a development of, the [[Sadducees]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion - Adele Berlin, Maxine L. Grossman - 2011 - Page 148 "The rabbis considered them primarily a religious sect, founded by Boethus, a heretical disciple of the Mishnaic authority ... Other scholars connect the Boethusians with [[Shimon ben Boethus]], high priest in King Herod's time; the family is   "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins according to the Talmud==

The post-Talmudic work Avot de-Rabbi Natan gives the following origin of the schism between the Pharisees and Sadducees/Boethusians: [[Antigonus of Sokho]] having taught the maxim, "Be not like the servants who serve their masters for the sake of the wages, but be rather like those who serve without thought of receiving wages", his two pupils, [[Zadok (disambiguation)|Zadok]] and Boethus, repeated this maxim to their pupils.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the course of time, either the two teachers or  their pupils understood this to express the belief that there was neither an [[afterlife]] nor a [[resurrection of the dead]] and founded the sects of the [[Sadducees]] and the Boethusians. They lived in luxurious splendor; using silver and golden vessels all their lives, not because they were haughty, but because (as they claimed) the [[Pharisees]] led a hard life on earth and yet would have nothing to show for it in the [[world to come]].&lt;ref&gt;ARN 5:2; Ab. R. N. v., ed. Schechter, p. 26.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story is historical, in that the two groups, the Sadducees and the Boethusians, denied the [[immortality of the soul]] and the [[resurrection]]. Again, the Midrash is on the whole correct in saying that the sects found their followers chiefly among the wealthy; but the origin of the sects is legendary. The [[Mishnah]], as well as the Baraita, mentions the Boethusians as opposing the Pharisees in saying that the sheaf due at the [[Passover]] (compare Omer) must be offered not on the second feast-day, but on the day after the actual [[Shabbat]] of the festival week, and, accordingly, that [[Pentecost]], which comes seven weeks and one day later, should always be celebrated on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Men. x. 3; compare also Ḥag. ii. 4.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another passage it is narrated that the Boethusians hired false witnesses in order to lead the Pharisees astray in their calculations of the new moon.&lt;ref&gt;Tosef., R. H. i. 14; Bab. ib. 22b; Yer. ib. ii. 57d, below; compare Geiger, "Urschrift," p. 137, 138.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of dispute between the Boethusians and the Pharisees was whether the high [[priest]] should prepare the incense inside or outside the [[Holy of Holies]] on the [[Day of Atonement]]&lt;ref&gt;Tosef., Yoma, i. 8; Yer. ib. i. 39a.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the beginnings of this sect are shrouded in obscurity, so also is the length of its duration. The Talmud mentions a Boethusian in a dispute with a pupil of [[Rabbi Akiva]] (Shab. 108a; Soferim i. 2); yet it is probable that the word here means simply a sectarian, a [[heresy|heretic]], just as the term "Sadducee" was used in a much wider sense later on. A Boethus, son of Zonim, and nearly contemporaneous with Akiva (compare Yer. l.c. 10b), is mentioned in the Mishnah (B. M. v. 3); he was not, however, a Boethusian, but a pious merchant. An [[Amoraim|amora]], c. 300 C.E., was also called "Boethus".

==Relationship to the Sadducees==

A parallel to the Yoma 19b has "Sadducees" instead of "Boethusians"; and in other passages the [[Talmud]] undoubtedly uses these two terms indifferently in designating the same sect. Graetz's assumption, therefore, that the Sadducees were the political and the Boethusians the religious opponents of the Pharisees, is untenable.

==A High-Priestly family==

The Boethusians are believed to have been associated with the members of the high-priestly family of Boethus. Simon, son of Boethus from [[Alexandria]], was made a high priest about 25 BCE by [[Herod the Great]], in order that his [[marriage]] with Boethus's daughter, Mariamne, might not be regarded as a ''mésalliance'', a marriage with a person thought to be unsuitable or of a lower social position.&lt;ref name="Jos15"&gt;Josephus, "Antiquitates", xv. 9, § 3; xix. 6, § 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of Boethus produced the following high priests: 
===[[Simon son of Boethus]]===
Or Boethus himself (24-5 BC)&lt;ref name="Jos15"/&gt;
===Joazar, son of Boethus===
(4 BC and before 6 AD), unpopular and an advocate of compliance with the Roman census&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, "Antiquitates", xviii. 1, § 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hatred of the Pharisees toward this high-priestly family is shown by the words of the [[Tanna (Rabbinic sage)|tanna]] Abba Saul b. Baṭnit, who lived about the year 40 CE at [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Pes. 57a; Tosef., Men. xii. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be especially noticed that "the house of Boethus" heads the list of the wicked and sinful priestly families enumerated by Abba.

==Connection to Essenes==

As Talmudic sources never mention the [[Essenes]] but do mention the Boethusians, while Greek sources (including Josephus) never mention the Boethusians as such but mention the Essenes as a prominent group, and as the Essenes are often identified with the sect that produced the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which do indeed bear some similarity to views attributed to the Boethusians by the Talmud, the suggestion has been made&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=KZC_tBzZs1EC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=boethusians+essenes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fGonLay8tP&amp;sig=KDukLZ1pREJLTgQmfA6cvDkr5Xc&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEoKHgrOHLAhWEXCwKHVetDm4Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=boethusians%20essenes&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; that the two groups were more or less identical, the word "Boethusian" being a corruption of "Beit Essaya," or "House of Essenes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Boethusian&lt;/ref&gt; This is admittedly a highly speculative position with little actual evidence to back it up, but is sometimes seen as the most likely explanation at the very least.

'''Louis Charles Birch''' [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science|FAA]] (8 February 1918 in [[Melbourne]] &amp;ndash; 19 December 2009) was an [[Australia]]n geneticist specialising in [[population ecology]] and was also well known as a theologian, writing widely on the topic of science and religion, winning the [[Templeton Prize]] in 1990. The prize recognised his work ascribing intrinsic value to all life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P000230b.htm Birch, Louis Charles (Charles) (1918 - )], The University of Melbourne Scholarship Research Centre, 1994 - 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Birch was born in Melbourne on 8 February 1918, the son of Harry Birch, a New Zealand-born bank manager with the [[ES&amp;A Bank]], and his Irish-born wife, Nora. He had a twin brother, Sidney, and an older brother, Hugh. Birch attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], Melbourne, and focused on agriculture at university in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=SMHobit&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/a-man-of-science-and-religion-20091222-lbpx.html#ixzz3vNhVjFkk "A Man of Science and Religion"], 1918-2009 Charles Birch, Sydney Morning Herald obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birch was educated at [[University of Melbourne]], receiving a Bachelor of [[Agricultural Science]] in 1939.  His first job was in the [[entomology]] department at the [[Waite Agricultural Research Institute]] at the [[University of Adelaide]], where he earned a Doctorate of Science in 1941.&lt;ref name=Sydedu&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/science/biology/news_and_events/newsletters/2010-march-newsletter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During his six years of entomological research with his then-supervisor, [[Herbert Andrewartha]], with whom he forged a close relationship, Birch demonstrated that external processes, driven by weather and other types of disturbance, were vastly important in controlling the numbers and distribution of animals. This radical challenge to the prevailing views, namely that populations were self-regulating based on competition for limited resources, became one of Birch's major and enduring contributions to the science of ecology.&lt;ref name=Sydedu/&gt;

In 1948, Birch became a senior lecturer in the Department of Zoology at the [[University of Sydney]]. Birch was later promoted to Reader in Zoology in 1954, and then the Challis Chair of Biology, which he held for 25 years from 1960 to 1984.&lt;ref name=Sydedu/&gt;

==Views==
Birch credited Dr Herbert Andrewartha as having a great influence on him, teaching him "to think" and to discover "the social responsibility of the scientist",&lt;ref name=SMHobit/&gt; saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the enormous transformation of the modern world as a result of science and technology, the scientist is responsible for much that has happened both good and bad. This understanding is based on the premise that science is not value free.&lt;ref name=SMHobit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Charles Birch never married. He was survived by his twin, Sidney, and sister-in-law, Jenny.&lt;ref name=SMHobit/&gt;

'''Donovan Philips Leitch''' (born 10 May 1946) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer, songwriter and guitarist. He developed an eclectic and distinctive style that blended [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[Popular music|pop]], [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[world music]] (notably [[calypso music|calypso]]). He has lived in Scotland, [[Hertfordshire]] (England), London, California, and since at least 2008 in [[County Cork]], Ireland, with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2008-10-10-3265021134_x.htm|title=Donovan still a Sunshine Superman at 62|date=10 October 2008|first=Michael|last=Hill|journal=[[USA Today]]|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from the British folk scene, Donovan reached fame in the United Kingdom in early 1965 with live performances on the pop TV series ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''.

Having signed with [[Pye Records]] in 1965, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein, after which he signed to [[Epic Records|CBS/Epic Records]] in the US&amp;nbsp;– the first signing by the company's new vice-president [[Clive Davis]]&amp;nbsp;– and became more successful internationally. He began a long and successful collaboration with leading British independent record producer [[Mickie Most]], scoring multiple hit singles and albums in the UK, US, and other countries.&lt;ref name=ukcharts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard 18 Mar 1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=donovan+mickie+most+australia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IEzwDXW35R&amp;sig=UQ13ExrFH40ExUdw2HFwDbU9CYM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C_woUcGrDo6r0AXIlYH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=donovan%20mickie%20most%20australia&amp;f=false|publisher=Google books|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donovan|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/301195/donovan/biography|publisher=www.billboard.com|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most successful [[Single (music)|singles]] were the early UK hits "[[Catch the Wind]]", "[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]" and "[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]" in 1965.  In September 1966 "[[Sunshine Superman]]" topped America's [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart for one week and went to number two in Britain, followed by "[[Mellow Yellow]]" at US No.&amp;nbsp;2 in December 1966, then 1968's "[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]" in the Top 5 in both countries, then "[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]", which reached US No.&amp;nbsp;7 in May 1969.

He became a friend of pop musicians including [[Joan Baez]], [[Brian Jones]] and [[The Beatles]]. He taught [[John Lennon]] a [[finger-picking]] guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in "[[Dear Prudence]]", "[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]", "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]" and other songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbeatles.com/interviews.php?interview=66Paul|title=McCartney Interview 20&amp;nbsp;November 1968|publisher=Dmbeatles.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan's commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time.

Donovan continued to perform and record sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s.  His musical style and [[hippies|hippie]] image were scorned by critics, especially after [[punk rock]]. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain's [[rave]] scene. He recorded the 1996 album ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' with producer [[Rick Rubin]] and in 2004 made a new album, ''[[Beat Cafe]]''. Donovan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012 and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2014.

==Music career==

===1964–65: Rise to fame===
[[File:Donovan (1965).jpg|thumb|left|Donovan (1965)]]
Returning to [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], Donovan spent several months playing in local clubs, absorbing the folk scene around his home in [[St Albans]], learning the [[Fingerpicking|crosspicking]] guitar technique from local players such as [[Mac MacLeod]] and [[Mick Softley]] and writing his first songs. In 1964, he travelled to [[Manchester]] with [[Gyp Mills|Gypsy Dave]], then spent the summer in [[Torquay]], Devon. In Torquay he stayed with Mac MacLeod and took up [[busking]], studying the guitar, and learning [[traditional music|traditional]] folk and blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixon |first=Kevin |url=http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthdevon.co.uk/2010/07/17/torquays-other-history-the-inspiration-of-folk-superstars-donovan-and-mac-macleod |title=Torquay's other history: the inspiration of folk superstars Donovan and Mac Macleod|publisher=Peoplesrepublicofsouthdevon.co.uk|date=17 July 2010|accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201625/http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthdevon.co.uk/2010/07/17/torquays-other-history-the-inspiration-of-folk-superstars-donovan-and-mac-macleod/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmacleod.co.uk/reviews.html |title=reviews |accessdate=2007-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430165209/http://www.macmacleod.co.uk/reviews.html |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1964, Donovan was offered a management and publishing contract by [[Peter Eden]] and [[Geoff Stephens]] of [[Pye Records]] in London, for which he recorded a 10-track demo tape (later released on [[iTunes]]), which included the original of his first single, "[[Catch the Wind]]", and "[[Josie (Donovan song)|Josie]]". The first song revealed the influence of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who had also influenced [[Bob Dylan]]. Dylan comparisons followed for some time.&lt;ref name=pc48&gt;{{Gilliland|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19823/m1 |title=Show 48 – The British are Coming! The British are Coming!: With an emphasis on Donovan, the Bee Gees and the Who. [Part 5] |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[KFOK-LP|KFOK]] radio in the US on 14 June 2005, MacLeod said: "The press were fond of calling Donovan a Dylan clone as they had both been influenced by the same sources: Ramblin' Jack Elliott, [[Jesse Fuller]], Woody Guthrie, and many more."{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

While recording the demo, Donovan befriended [[Brian Jones]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], who was recording nearby. He had recently met Jones' ex-girlfriend, Linda Lawrence, who is the mother of Jones' son, Julian Brian (Jones) Leitch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones and Sympathy for the Devil: The Birth of the Rolling Stones by [[Paul Trynka]] – and the Death of Brian Jones by Paul Trynka&lt;/ref&gt; The on-off romantic relationship that developed over five years was a force in Donovan's career. She influenced Donovan's music but refused to marry him and she moved to the United States for several years in the late 1960s. They met by chance in 1970 and married soon after. Donovan had other relationships – one of which resulted in the birth of his first two children, [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] and [[Ione Skye]], both of whom became actors.

====Donovan and Dylan====
During Bob Dylan's trip to the UK in the spring of 1965, the British music press were making comparisons of the two singer-songwriters and going so far as to stir up allegations of a rivalry, and other luminaries of the pop scene were chiming in. [[The Rolling Stones]] guitarist Brian Jones said,

{{quote|We've been watching Donovan too. He isn't too bad a singer but his stuff sounds like Dylan's. His 'Catch The Wind' sounds like 'Chimes of Freedom'. He's got a song, 'Hey Tangerine Eyes' and it sounds like Dylan's 'Mr. Tambourine Man'.&lt;ref&gt;Rolling Stones off The Record", Mark Paytress, p.&amp;nbsp;90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Donovan is the undercurrent In [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s film ''[[Dont Look Back|Don't Look Back]]'' documenting Dylan's tour. Near the start of the film, Dylan opens a newspaper and exclaims, "Donovan? Who is this Donovan?" and his associates spur the rivalry on by telling Dylan that Donovan is a better guitar player, but that he had only been around for three months. Throughout the film Donovan's name is seen next to Dylan's on newspaper headlines and on posters in the background, and Dylan and his friends refer to him consistently.

Donovan finally appears in the second half of the film, along with [[Derroll Adams]], in Dylan's suite at the [[Savoy Hotel]] despite Donovan's management refusing to allow journalists to be present, saying they did not want "any stunt on the lines of the disciple meeting the messiah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabotage.demon.co.uk/donovan/art/1.htm#mm5/5/65 |title=Melody Maker |date=5 May 1965 |publisher=Sabotage.demon.co.uk |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pennebaker, Dylan told him not to film the encounter, and Donovan played a song that sounded just like "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" but with different words. When confronted with lifting his tune, Donovan said that he thought it was an old folk song.&lt;ref name="Marcus, 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcus |first1=Greil |title=Greil Marcus interviews D.A. Pennebaker about filming Bob Dylan|date=2011|publisher=New Video's Docurama Films|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the camera rolled, Donovan plays his song, "To Sing For You", and then asks Dylan to play "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue|Baby Blue]]". Dylan later told ''[[Melody Maker]]'': "He played some songs to me.&amp;nbsp;... I like him.&amp;nbsp;... He's a nice guy." ''Melody Maker'' noted that Dylan had mentioned Donovan in his song "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Talking World War Three Blues]]" and that the crowd had jeered, to which Dylan had responded backstage: "I didn't mean to put the guy down in my songs. I just did it for a joke, that's all."

In an interview for the BBC in 2001 to mark Dylan's 60th birthday, Donovan acknowledged Dylan as an influence early in his career while distancing himself from "Dylan clone" allegations:

{{quote|The one who really taught us to play and learn all the traditional songs was [[Martin Carthy]] – who incidentally was contacted by Dylan when Bob first came to the UK. Bob was influenced, as all American folk artists are, by the [[Celtic music]] of Ireland, Scotland and England. But in 1962 we folk Brits were also being influenced by some folk Blues and the American folk-exponents of our Celtic Heritage&amp;nbsp;... Dylan appeared after [[Woody Guthrie|Woody]] [Guthrie], [[Pete Seeger|Pete]] [Seeger] and [[Joan Baez|Joanie]] [Baez] had conquered our hearts, and he sounded like a cowboy at first but I knew where he got his stuff – it was Woody at first, then it was [[Jack Kerouac]] and the stream-of-consciousness poetry which moved him along. But when I heard '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' it was the clarion call to the new generation – and we artists were encouraged to be as brave in writing our thoughts in music&amp;nbsp;... We were not captured by his influence, we were encouraged to mimic him – and remember every British band from the [[Rolling Stones|Stones]] to the [[Beatles]] were copying note for note, lick for lick, all the American pop and blues artists – this is the way young artists learn. There's no shame in mimicking a hero or two – it flexes the creative muscles and tones the quality of our composition and technique. It was not only Dylan who influenced us – for me he was a spearhead into protest, and we all had a go at his style. I sounded like him for five minutes – others made a career of his sound. Like troubadours, Bob and I can write about any facet of the human condition. To be compared was natural, but I am not a copyist.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1347199.stm |title=Donovan remembers Dylan |last=Anon |date=23 May 2001 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Collaboration with Mickie Most====

In late 1965, Donovan split with his original management and signed with [[Ashley Kozak]], who was working for [[Brian Epstein]]'s [[NEMS Enterprises]]. Kozak introduced Donovan to American impresario [[Allen Klein]] (later manager of the Rolling Stones and [[The Beatles]]). Klein in turn introduced Donovan to producer [[Mickie Most]],&lt;ref name="classicbands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/donovan.html |title=Donovan |last=Anon |work=www.classicbands.com |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had chart-topping productions with [[The Animals]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], and [[Herman's Hermits]]. Most produced all Donovan's recordings during this period, although Donovan said in his autobiography that some recordings were self-produced, with little input from Most. Their collaboration produced successful singles and albums, recorded with London session players including [[Big Jim Sullivan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guitarist Big Jim Sullivan dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19820424|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 February 2013|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Bruce Discography – 1963–2010 |url=http://www.jackbruce.com/2008/Music/complete_discography.htm |publisher=www.jackbruce.com |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Donovan With Danny Thompson – Discography |url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/donovan-with-danny-thompson/all |publisher=www.45cat.com |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and future [[Led Zeppelin]] members [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref name=lz&gt;{{cite web|title=Season of the Witch |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/season-of-the-witch-mt0010623319 |publisher=www.allmusic.com |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Donovan's late 1960s recordings featured musicians including his key musical collaborator [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]] on piano, Danny Thompson (from [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]) or [[Spike Heatley]] on upright bass, Tony Carr on drums and [[conga]]s and [[Harold McNair]] on saxophone and flute. Carr's conga style and McNair's flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]''.

====''Sunshine Superman''====
By 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt [[flower power]]. He immersed himself in jazz, [[blues]], [[Eastern world|Eastern]] music, and the new generation of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era [[West Coast of the United States|US West Coast]] bands such as [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[The Grateful Dead]]. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician, and jazz fan [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]]. Their first collaboration was "[[Sunshine Superman]]", one of the first [[psychedelic pop]] records.&lt;ref name="classicbands"/&gt;

Donovan's rise stalled in December 1965 when ''Billboard'' broke news of the impending production deal between Klein, Most, and Donovan, and then reported that Donovan was to sign with [[Epic Records]] in the US. Despite Kozak's denials, [[Pye Records]] dropped the single and a contract dispute ensued, because Pye had a US licensing arrangement with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. As a result, the UK release of the ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was delayed for months, robbing it of the impact it would have had. Another outcome was that the UK and US versions of this and later albums differed – three of his Epic LPs were not released in the UK, and ''Sunshine Superman'' was issued in a different form in each country. Several tracks on his late 1960s Epic (US) LPs were not released in the UK for many years. The legal dispute continued into early 1966. During the hiatus, Donovan holidayed in [[Greece]], where he wrote "Writer in the Sun",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interview-donovan/68376 |title=Interview: Donovan |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by rumours that his recording career was over. He toured the US and appeared on episode 23 of [[Pete Seeger]]'s television show ''[[Rainbow Quest]]'' in 1966 with [[Shawn Phillips]] and [[Rev. Gary Davis]]. After his return to London, he developed his friendship with [[Paul McCartney]] and contributed the line "sky of blue and sea of green" to "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/yellowsubmarine.htm|title=Robert Fontenot: "Yellow Submarine: The history of this classic Beatles song", About.com; retrieved 2 December 2008|publisher=Oldies.about.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1966, the American contract problems had been resolved, and Donovan signed a $100,000 deal with Epic Records. Donovan and Most went to [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in Los Angeles, where they recorded tracks for an LP, much composed during the preceding year. Although folk elements were prominent, the album showed increasing influence of jazz, American west coast psychedelia and [[folk rock]] – especially [[The Byrds]]. The LP sessions were completed in May, and "[[Sunshine Superman]]" was released in the US as a single in June. It was a success, selling 800,000 in six weeks and reaching No. 1. It went on to sell over one million, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=204 |isbn=0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LP followed in August, preceded by orders of 250,000 copies, reached No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|album chart]] and sold over half a million.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/&gt;

The US version of the ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' album is in [[chamber music|chamber]]-style folk-jazz arrangements, and features instruments including acoustic bass, [[sitar]], saxophone, tablas and congas, harpsichord, strings and oboe. Highlights include the swinging "[[The Fat Angel]]", which Donovan's book confirms was written for [[Cass Elliot]] of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. The song is notable for naming the Jefferson Airplane before they became known internationally and before [[Grace Slick]] joined. Other tracks include "Bert's Blues" (a tribute to [[Bert Jansch]]), "Guinevere", and "Legend of a Girl Child Linda", a track featuring voice, acoustic guitar and a small orchestra for over six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hurdy Gurdy Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVsIp2DSuQMC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=donovan+legend+of+a+girl+child+linda+orchestra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uBshoedGKk&amp;sig=2BODUryIlds39x4FeMMLk_qyzeQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M7gjUcjcEcSh0QXAiIHYDw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=donovan%20legend%20of%20a%20girl%20child%20linda%20orchestra&amp;f=false |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunshine Superman |url=http://www.discogs.com/Donovan-Sunshine-Superman/release/1182622 |publisher=discogs.com |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album also features the [[sitar]], which was played by American folk-rock singer [[Shawn Phillips]]. Donovan met Phillips in London in 1965, and he became a friend and early collaborator, playing acoustic guitar and sitar on recordings including ''Sunshine Superman'' as well as accompanying Donovan at concerts and on Pete Seeger's TV show. Creatively, Phillips served as a silent partner in the gestation of many of Donovan's songs from the era, with the singer later acknowledging that Phillips primarily composed "[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/follow-the-ever-changing-ballad-of-singer-songwriter-shawn-phillips |title=Follow the ever-changing ballad of Shawn Phillips |date=25 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several songs including the title track had a harder edge. The driving, jazzy "The Trip", named after a Los Angeles club name, chronicled an [[LSD]] [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] during his time in L.A. and is loaded with references to his sojourn on the West Coast, and names Dylan and Baez. The third "heavy" song was "Season of the Witch".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Recorded with American and British session players, it features Donovan's first recorded performance on electric guitar. The song was covered by [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Brian Auger]] &amp; The Trinity on their first LP in 1967, and [[Al Kooper]] and [[Stephen Stills]] recorded an 11-minute version on the 1968 album, ''[[Super Session]]''. Donovan's version is also in the closing sequence of the [[Gus Van Sant]] film, ''[[To Die For]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Because of earlier contractual problems, the UK version of ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was not released for another nine months. This was a compilation of tracks from the US albums ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]''. Donovan did not choose the tracks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====Mellow Yellow====
[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Albert Hall]]
On 24 October 1966, Epic released the single "[[Mellow Yellow]]", arranged by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and purportedly featuring [[Paul McCartney]] on backing vocals, but not in the chorus.&lt;ref name="classicbands"/&gt; In his autobiography Donovan explained "electrical banana" was a reference to a "yellow-coloured vibrator".&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, ''Donovan in Concert'', released on Atlantic July 1968, re-issued on BGO February 2002. ASIN B0000011LU.&lt;/ref&gt; The song became Donovan's signature tune in the US and reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 3 on the Cash Box chart, and earned a gold record award for sales of more than one million in the US.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/&gt;

Through the first half of 1967, Donovan worked on a double-album studio project, which he produced. In January he gave a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] accompanied by a ballerina who danced during a 12-minute performance of "Golden Apples". On 14 January, [[NME|New Musical Express]] reported he was to write incidental music for a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'', but this did not come to fruition. His version of "[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]" did appear on "[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donovan– A Gift From A Flower to a Garden |url=http://www.discogs.com/Donovan-A-Gift-From-A-Flower-To-A-Garden/master/293875 |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month Epic released the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP (not released in the UK), which reached No. 14 in the US album charts, plus a non-album single, "[[Epistle to Dippy]]", a Top 20 hit in the US. Written as an open letter to a school friend, the song had a pacifist message as well as psychedelic imagery. The real "Dippy" was in the [[British Army]] in Malaysia. According to Brian Hogg, who wrote the liner notes for the Donovan boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964–1976|Troubadour]]'', Dippy heard the song, contacted Donovan and left the army. On 9 February 1967, Donovan was among guests invited by the Beatles to Abbey Road Studios for the orchestral overdub for "[[A Day in the Life]]", the finale to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Day in the Life:One Family, the Beautiful People, and the End of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfMWwVXsl0EC&amp;pg=PT78&amp;dq=beatles+abbey+road+a+day+in+the+life+donovan+funny+hats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zpAkUfrwGunQ0QWb5YGYDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA|publisher=Google books |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrest====
In mid-1966, Donovan became the first British pop star to be arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Donovan's drug use was mostly restricted to cannabis, with occasional use of [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]]. His LSD use is referenced indirectly in many of his lyrics (e.g., "The Trip," "Sunshine Superman," "Wear Your Love Like Heaven," and "Epistle To Dippy").&lt;ref name="Hurdy Gurdy Man"/&gt;

Public attention was drawn to his marijuana use by the TV documentary ''A Boy Called Donovan'' in early 1966, which showed the singer and friends smoking cannabis at a party thrown by the film crew. Donovan's arrest proved to be the first in a long series involving the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In early 1967, Donovan was subject of an exposé in the ''[[News of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Music and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ViwZnnR3oC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=donovan+1967+news+of+the+world&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=twc4PqSjZJ&amp;sig=HGsFCfgqZUvpZ6vXxymuRsEofoM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wrkjUeDNMOev0QX_goEo&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=donovan%201967%20news%20of%20the%20world&amp;f=false |publisher=Google books |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Donovan, the article was based on an interview by an ex-girlfriend of his friend Gypsy Dave. The article was the first in a three-part series, ''Drugs &amp; Pop Stars – Facts That Will Shock You.'' It was quickly shown some claims were false. A ''News of the World'' reporter claimed to have spent an evening with [[Mick Jagger]], who allegedly discussed his drug use and offered drugs to companions. He had mistaken Brian Jones for Jagger, and Jagger sued the newspaper for libel. Among other supposed revelations were claims that Donovan and stars including members of [[The Who]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], Rolling Stones and [[The Moody Blues]] regularly smoked marijuana, used other drugs, and held parties where the recently banned hallucinogen LSD was used, specifically naming The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] and Cream's [[Ginger Baker]].

It emerged later that the ''News of the World'' reporters were passing information to the police. In the late 1990s, ''The Guardian'' said ''News of the World'' reporters had alerted police to the party at [[Keith Richards]]'s home, which was raided on 12 February 1967. Although Donovan's was not as sensational as the later arrests of Jagger and Richards, he was refused entry to the US until late 1967. He could not appear at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Season of "Season of the Witch"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/05/season-of-the-witch.html|publisher=www.newyorker.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–69: International success===
In July 1967, Epic released "[[There Is a Mountain]]", which just missed the US top ten and was later used as the basis for [[The Allman Brothers Band]]'s "[[Mountain Jam]]". In September, Donovan toured the US, backed by a jazz group and accompanied by his father, who introduced the show. Later that month, Epic released Donovan's fifth album, a set entitled, ''[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]'', the first rock music box set and only the third pop-rock double album released. It was split into halves. The first, "Wear Your Love Like Heaven", was for people of his generation who would one day be parents; the second, "[[For Little Ones]]", was songs Donovan had written for coming generations. Worried it might be a poor seller, Epic boss [[Clive Davis]] insisted the albums be split and sold separately in the US (the "Wear Your Love Like Heaven" album cover was photographed at [[Bodiam Castle]]), but his fears were unfounded – although it took time, the boxed set sold steadily, eventually peaking at 19 in the US album chart and achieving gold record status in the US in early 1970.

The psychedelic and mystical overtones were unmistakable – the front cover featured an [[infrared photography|infra-red]] photograph by [[Karl Ferris]] showing Donovan in a robe holding flowers and peacock feathers, while the back photo showed him holding hands with Indian guru [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. The liner notes included an appeal for young people to give up drugs. His disavowal of drugs came after his time with the Maharishi in [[Rishikesh]], a topic discussed in a two-part interview for the first two issues of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rolling Stone|title=Donovan: The Rolling Stone Interview|first=John|last=Carpenter|volume=1|issue=1,2|date=9–23 November 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1967 Donovan contributed two songs to the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[Poor Cow]]''. "Be Not Too Hard" was a musical setting of [[Christopher Logue]]'s poem ''September Song'', and was later recorded by such artists as [[Joan Baez]] and [[Shusha Guppy]]. The title track, originally entitled "Poor Love", was the B-side of his next single, "[[Jennifer Juniper]]", which was inspired by [[Jenny Boyd]], sister of [[George Harrison]]'s wife, [[Pattie Boyd]] and was another top 40 hit in the US. Donovan developed interest in eastern mysticism and claims to have interested the Beatles in [[transcendental meditation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In early 1968 he was part of the group that traveled to the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in [[Rishikesh]]. The visit gained worldwide attention thanks to the presence of all four Beatles as well as [[Beach Boys]] lead singer [[Mike Love]], as well as actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her sister Prudence (who inspired Lennon to write "[[Dear Prudence]]"). According to a 1968 [[Paul McCartney]] interview with [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbeatles.com/interviews.php?interview=66|title=Paul McCartney Interview: Promoting the White Album (20 November 1968)|publisher=Dmbeatles.com|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was during this time that Donovan taught Lennon and McCartney [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking guitar]] styles including the [[clawhammer]], which he had learned from Mac MacLeod. Lennon used this technique on songs including "[[Dear Prudence]]", "[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]", "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" and "[[Look at Me (John Lennon song)|Look at Me]]", and McCartney with "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]" and "[[Mother Nature's Son]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rolling Stone - Donovan on teaching guitar technique to the Beatles |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tWkyYXcLc |website=You Tube |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Donovan's next single, in May 1968, was the psychedelic "[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]". The liner notes from EMI's reissues say the song was intended for Mac MacLeod, who had a heavy rock band called [[Hurdy Gurdy (band)|Hurdy Gurdy]]. After hearing MacLeod's version, Donovan considered giving it to [[Jimi Hendrix]], but when Most heard it, he convinced Donovan to record it himself. Donovan tried to get Hendrix to play, but he was on tour. Jimmy Page played electric guitar in some studio sessions and is credited with playing on the song.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964–1976]]'', Sony Music Entertainment, 1992. ("[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]" recording in London, England, 1968, crediting Donovan on vocal, acoustic guitar and tambura, [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Jimmy Page]] on electric guitars, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on bass, [[John Bonham]] and "Clem Clatini" (a misspelling of [[Clem Cattini]]) on drums, produced by Most, arrangement by John Paul Jones, [[Epic Records|Epic]] LP BN 25420, Epic single 5-10345.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony DeCurtis|DeCurtis, A.]], "Donovan's Calling", essay released in liner notes of ''[[Try for the Sun: The Journey of Donovan]]'' 2005 limited-edition boxed set compilation by Sony BMG Music Entertainment [[Legacy Recordings]].&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is credited to [[Alan Parker(musician)|Alan Parker]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Donovan credits Page and "Allen Hollsworth" (a misspelling of [[Allan Holdsworth]]) as the "guitar wizards" for the song, saying they created "a new kind of metal folk".&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;Leitch, Donovan, ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'', [[Random House|Century]], an imprint of [[Random House]], London, 2005 (published in the U.S. as ''The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man'', pp. 218–19 [[St. Martin's Press]], New York, 2005; {{ISBN|0-312-35252-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[John Bonham]] and John Paul Jones also played, Donovan said perhaps the session inspired the formation of [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; The heavier sound of "Hurdy Gurdy Man" was an attempt by Most and Donovan to reach a wider audience in the US, where hard-rock groups like [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] were having an impact. The song became one of Donovan's biggest hits, making the Top 5 in the UK and the US, and the Top 10 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In July 1968, Epic released ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]'', the recording of his Anaheim concert in September 1967. The cover featured only a painting by [[Fleur Cowles]] (with neither the artist's name nor the title). The album contained two of his big hits and songs which would have been new to the audience. The expanded double CD from 2006 contained "Epistle To Derroll", a tribute to one of his formative influences, [[Derroll Adams]]. The album also includes extended group arrangements of "Young Girl Blues" and "The Pebble and the Man", a song later reworked and retitled as "Happiness Runs". In the summer of 1968, Donovan worked on a second LP of children's songs, released in 1971 as the double album, ''[[HMS Donovan (album)|HMS Donovan]]''. In September, Epic released a single, "[[Laléna]]", a subdued acoustic ballad which reached the low 30s in the US. The album ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' followed (not released in the UK), continuing the style of the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP and reached 20 in the US, despite containing two earlier hits, the title track and "Jennifer Juniper".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

After another US tour in the autumn he collaborated with Paul McCartney, who was producing ''[[Postcard (album)|Postcard]]'', the debut LP by Welsh singer [[Mary Hopkin]]. Hopkin covered three Donovan songs: "Lord Of The Reedy River", "Happiness Runs" and "Voyage of the Moon". McCartney returned the favour by playing tambourine and singing backing vocals on Donovan's next single, "[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]", which was released in the UK (with "I Love My Shirt" as the B-side) in late November and reached 23.&lt;ref name=ukcharts&gt;{{cite web|title=Donovan|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/donovan/|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1969, the comedy film ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' featured music by Donovan; the title tune was written by him and sung by J. P. Rags, and he also performed "Lord of the Reedy River" in the film as a singer at a youth hostel. On 20 January, Epic released the single, "To Susan on the West Coast Waiting", with "[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]" as the B-side. The A-side, a gentle [[Calypso music|calypso]]-styled song, contained another anti-war message, and became a moderate Top 40 US hit. However, when DJs in America and Australia flipped it and began playing "Atlantis", that became a hit. The gentle "Atlantis" formed the backdrop to a violent scene in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[GoodFellas]]''. "Atlantis" was revived in 2000 for an episode of ''[[Futurama]]'' titled "The Deep South" (2ACV12) which aired on 16 April that year. For this episode Donovan recorded a satirical version of the song describing the Lost City of [[Atlanta]] which featured in the episode.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In March 1969 (too soon to include "Atlantis"), Epic and Pye released ''Donovan's Greatest Hits'', which included four previous singles – "Epistle To Dippy", "There is a Mountain", "Jennifer Juniper" and "Laléna", as well as rerecorded versions of "[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]" and "Catch The Wind" (which had been unavailable to Epic because of Donovan's contractual problems) and stereo versions of "Sunshine Superman" (previously unissued full length version) and "Season of the Witch". It became the most successful album of his career; it reached 4 in the US, became a million-selling gold record, and stayed on the Billboard album chart for more than a year. On 26 June 1969 the track "[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)]]" (recorded May 1969), which gained him a following on the rave scene decades later, was released, reaching 12 in the UK but charting less strongly in the US. This time he was backed by the original [[Jeff Beck]] Group, featuring Beck on lead guitar, [[Ronnie Wood]] on bass, [[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, and [[Micky Waller]] on drums. The Beck group was under contract to Most and it was Most's idea to team them with Donovan to bring a heavier sound to Donovan's work, while introducing a lyrical edge to Beck's.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On 7 July 1969, Donovan performed at the first show in the second season of free rock concerts in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, which also featured [[Blind Faith]], [[Richie Havens]], [[The Edgar Broughton Band]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]. In September 1969, the "Barabajagal" album reached 23 in the US. Only the recent "Barabajagal"/"Trudi" single and "Superlungs My Supergirl" were 1969 recordings, the remaining tracks {{Clarify|date=February 2013}} were from sessions in London in May 1968 and in Los Angeles in November 1968. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===1970s: Changes===
In late 1969, the relationship with Most ended after an argument over an unidentified recording session in Los Angeles. In the 1995 BBC Radio 2 ''The Donovan Story'', Most recounted:

{{quote|The only time we ever fell out was in Los Angeles when there was all these, I suppose, big stars of their day, the Stephen Stills-es and the Mama Cass-es, all at the session and nothing was actually being played. Somebody brought some dope into the session and I stopped the session and slung them out. You know you need someone to say it's my session, I'm paying for it. We fell out over that.&lt;ref name="Lorne Murdoch 2005"&gt;Lorne Murdoch, liner notes to ''Barabajagal'' expanded CD reissue (EMI, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Open Road band===
Donovan said he wanted to record with someone else, and he and Most did not work together again until ''[[Cosmic Wheels]]''(1973). After the rift, Donovan spent two months writing and recording the album ''[[Open Road (Donovan album)|Open Road]]'' as a member of the rock trio Open Road. Stripping the sound of Most's heavy studio productions down to stuff that could be played by a live band, Donovan dubbed the sound, "[[Celtic Rock]]". The album peaked at No. 16 in the US, the third highest of any of his full-length releases to date, but as his concert appearances became less frequent and new artists and styles of popular music began to emerge, his commercial success would begin to decline. Donovan said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was exhausted and looking for roots and new directions. I checked into Morgan Studios in London and stayed a long while creating Open Road and the ''HMS Donovan'' sessions. Downstairs was McCartney, doing his solo album. I had left Mickie after great years together. The new decade dawned and I had accomplished everything any young singer songwriter could achieve. What else was there to do but to experiment beyond the fame and into the new life, regardless of the result?&lt;ref name="Lorne Murdoch 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donovan's plan for Open Road was to tour the world for a year, beginning with a boat voyage around the [[Aegean Sea]], documented in the 1970 film, ''[[There is an Ocean]]''. This was partially on the advice from his management to go into [[tax exile]], during which he was not to set foot in the UK until April 1971, but after touring to France, Italy, Russia, and Japan, he cut the tour short:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I travelled to Japan and was set to stay out of the UK for a year and earn the largest fees yet for a solo performer, and all tax-free. At the time the UK tax for us was 98%. During that Japanese tour I had a gentle breakdown, which made me decide to break the tax exile. Millions were at stake. My father, my agent they pleaded for me not to step onto the [[BOAC]] jet bound for London. I did and went back to my little cottage in the woods. Two days later a young woman came seeking a cottage to rent. It was Linda.&lt;ref name="Lorne Murdoch 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reunions with Linda Lawrence and Mickie Most===
After this reunion, Donovan and Linda married on 2 October 1970 at Windsor register office and honeymooned in the Caribbean. Donovan dropped out of the round of tour promotion and concentrated on writing, recording and his family. The largely self-produced children's album ''HMS Donovan'' in 1971, went unreleased in the US and did not gain a wide audience. During an 18-month tax exile in Ireland (1971–72), he wrote for the 1972 film ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' in the title role, and for ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'' (1972). The title song from the Zeffirelli film provided Donovan with a publishing windfall in 1974 when it was covered as the B-side of the million-selling US top 5 hit "[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]", by Australia's singing nun, [[Sister Janet Mead]].

After a new deal with Epic, Donovan reunited with Mickie Most in early 1973, resulting in the LP ''Cosmic Wheels'', which featured arrangements by [[Chris Spedding]].&lt;ref name="Lorne Murdoch 2005"/&gt; It was his last chart success, reaching the top 40 in America and Britain. Late in the year he released ''Essence To Essence'', produced by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], and a live album recorded in Japan and only released in Japan, which featured an extended version of "Hurdy Gurdy Man" which included an additional verse written by [[George Harrison]] in [[Rishikesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beatles As Musicians:Revolver through the Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CAvwZPKTkoC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Rishikesh+beatles+donovan+harrison+hurdy+gurdy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bb8jUejpIoHU0QW36YGICg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rishikesh%20beatles%20donovan%20harrison%20hurdy%20gurdy&amp;f=false|publisher=Google books|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recording the album, [[Alice Cooper]] invited Donovan to share lead vocals on his song "[[Billion Dollar Babies (Alice Cooper song)|Billion Dollar Babies]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

''Cosmic Wheels'' was followed up by two albums that same year: his second concert album, ''[[Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973]]'', and the more introspective ''[[Essence to Essence]]''. His last two albums for Epic Records were ''[[7-Tease]]'' (1974) and ''[[Slow Down World]]'' (1976). In 1977, he opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their six-month tour of North America and Europe following the release of ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977). The 1978 LP, ''[[Donovan (album)|Donovan]]'' was on Most's [[RAK Records]] in the UK and on Clive Davis' new [[Arista Records]] in the US; it reunited him for the last time with Most and Cameron, but was not well received at the height of the [[New wave music|new wave]] and did not chart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1980s: occasional appearances===
The punk era (1976–1980) provoked a backlash in Britain against the optimism and whimsy of the hippie era, of which Donovan was a prime example. The word "hippie" became pejorative, and Donovan's fortunes suffered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In this period he released the albums ''Neutronica'' (1980), ''Love Is Only Feeling'' (1981), and ''Lady of the Stars'' (1984), and guest-starred on ''[[Stars on Ice]]'', a half-hour variety show on ice produced by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Toronto. There was a respite when he appeared alongside [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Eric Clapton]] and Jeff Beck in the [[Amnesty International]] benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''.  Accompanied by [[Danny Thompson]], Donovan performed several hits including "Sunshine Superman", "Mellow Yellow", "Colours", "Universal Soldier" and "Catch the Wind". He was also in the performance of Dylan's "[[I Shall Be Released]]" for the show's finale. Donovan also appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 18 June 1989 with the band [[Ozric Tentacles]] accompanying him onstage.

===1990s: a retrospective decade===
In 1990 Donovan released a live album featuring new performances of his classic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donovan– 25 Years in Concert|url=http://www.discogs.com/Donovan-Rising/master/292695|publisher=www.discogs.com|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tribute album]] to Donovan, ''[[Island of Circles]]'', was released by [[Nettwerk]] in 1991. Sony's 2-CD boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964-1976|Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964–1976]]'' (1992) continued the restoration of his reputation, and was followed by the 1994 release of ''Four Donovan Originals'', which saw his four classic Epic LPs on CD in their original form for the first time in the UK. He found an ally in rap producer and [[Def Jam]] label owner [[Rick Rubin]] and recorded an album called ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' for Rubin's [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]] label.&lt;ref name="classicbands"/&gt;

===2000s===
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2011}}
[[File: Donovan -10Aug2007.jpg|thumb|Donovan before a show in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 10 August 2007.]]
In 2000, Donovan narrated and played himself in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode [[The Deep South (Futurama)|"The Deep South"]] on 16 April with the song "Atlantis".

A new album, ''[[Beat Cafe]]'', on Appleseed Records in 2004, marked a return to the jazzy sound of his 1960s recordings and featured bassist [[Danny Thompson]] and drummer [[Jim Keltner]], with production by John Chelew ([[Blind Boys of Alabama]]). At a series of ''Beat Cafe'' performances in New York, [[Richard Barone]] ([[The Bongos]]) joined Donovan to sing and read passages from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl]]''.

In May 2004, Donovan played "Sunshine Superman" at the wedding concert for the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince]] and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess of Denmark]]. He released his early demo tapes, ''Sixty Four'', and a re-recording of the ''Brother Sun, Sister Moon'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]]. A set of his Mickie Most albums was released on 9 May 2005. This EMI set has extra tracks including another song recorded with the Jeff Beck Group. In 2005, his autobiography ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'' was published. In May/June 2005, Donovan toured the UK (Beat Cafe Tour) and Europe with Tom Mansi on double bass, former [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] drummer [[Rat Scabies]] and [[Flipron]] keyboard player, Joe Atkinson.

In spring/summer 2006, Donovan played British festivals and two dates at Camden's [[The Jazz Café]], London.

In January 2007, Donovan played at the [[Kennedy Center]], in Washington, DC, at [[Alice Tully Hall]], in New York City, and at the [[Kodak Theatre]], in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a presentation by film maker [[David Lynch]] supporting the [[David Lynch Foundation]] for [[Transcendental Meditation in education|Consciousness-Based Education]] and world peace. The concert at the [[Kodak Theatre]] was filmed by [[Raven Productions]] and broadcast on [[Public television]] as a [[pledge drive]]. Donovan's partnership with the David Lynch Foundation saw him performing concerts through October 2007, as well as giving presentations about Transcendental meditation. He appeared at [[Maharishi University of Management]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], in May 2007,&lt;ref name=GGN0507&gt;{{cite web|title=David Lynch Weekend draws crowds to Maharishi University of Management|url=http://www.pictures.globalgoodnews.com/archive/archive-2007/lynch-wkend/index.html|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toured the UK with David Lynch in October 2007.&lt;ref name=Independent1007&gt;{{cite news|last=Rajan|first=Amol|title=Bring peace to schools by meditation, say Lynch and Donovan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bring-peace-to-schools-by-meditation-say-lynch-and-donovan-395234.html|accessdate=30 December 2013|location=London|work=The Independent|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, Donovan played two shows at the [[SXSW|South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. He had planned a spring 2007 release of an album, along with a UK tour. However, he announced the tour was cancelled and the album delayed. He said was in good health but gave no reason for the cancellation. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In April 2007, Donovan presented a three-part series on [[Ravi Shankar]] for [[BBC Radio 2]]. In October 2007 Donovan announced plans for the "Invincible Donovan University" focusing on [[Transcendental Meditation]]. It will be near Glasgow or Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/2671-invincible-donovan-university|location=Edinburgh|work=The Journal|title=Invincible Donovan University|date=5 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820170130/http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/2671-invincible-donovan-university|archivedate=20 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 the DVD, ''The Donovan Concert—Live in LA'', filmed at the Kodak Theatre Los Angeles earlier in the year, was released in the UK. On 6 October 2009, Donovan was honoured as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 2009 annual BMI London Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMI Icon Donovan Honored in London|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/1264533/bmi-icon-donovan-honored-in-london|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Icon designation is given to BMI songwriters who have had "a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/538885|title=Kris Kristofferson to be Honored as Icon at 57th Annual BMI Country Awards|publisher=bmi.com|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Donovan's double CD set ''Ritual Groove'' was made available through his website. Prior to the release, he had described it as a multi-media album waiting for videos to be applied.

==Family==
Donovan had a relationship with American model Enid Karl, and they had two children – actor-musician [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] in 1967, and actress [[Ione Skye]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-11-25/entertainment/25647151_1_hurdy-gurdy-man-flower-child-mellow-yellow|title=A '60s Flower Child Looks To Bloom Again: Donovan, The Trippy Troubadour Behind Such Generation- Defining Hits As 'Mellow Yellow'' and ''Sunshine Superman'', Is Back At 50 With A New Album|publisher=Articles.philly.com|date=30 November 2005|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan married Linda Lawrence in October 1970.&lt;ref name=international/&gt; They have two children together, Astrella and Oriole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man|first=Donovan|last=Leitch|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2007|isbn=978-0312364342|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mt8QL1oAhTgC&amp;pg=PA144-IA8&amp;dq=Astrella++Donovan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J7F7VKmuNq7asATUq4KoDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Astrella%20%20Donovan&amp;f=false 144]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrella-celeste.com|title=Page Redirection|publisher=Astrella-celeste.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Lawrence was the inspiration for "Sunshine Superman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/02/how-we-made-sunshine-superman-donovan |title=How we made: Donovan's Sunshine Superman |author=Dave Simpson |date= |work=The Guardian |accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the stepfather of Brian Jones' and Linda Lawrence's son, Julian Brian (Jones) Leitch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Jones' biographer [[Paul Trynka]] writes, "Unsurprisingly, Julian has found the burden of being Brian's son heavy to bear, despite being brought up with obvious love and sensitivity by his adopted father Donovan Leitch."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Accolades ==
In November 2003, Donovan was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the [[University of Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gracious me, Sanjeev's a doctor!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/read_this/2003/11/sanjeev_doctorate_given.shtml|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University to honour Donovan and TV comedian|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/431987.print/|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated by Sara Loveridge (who was a student at the University and had interviewed and reviewed Donovan for the university paper in 2001–2002), Andrew Morris, Sara's partner and Donovan researcher/writer and co-nominated by Mac MacLeod.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|title=Donovan awards and honours |url=http://www.donovan.ie/en/donovan-awards-and-honours/ |accessdate=2 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MKg5kOO4?url=http://www.donovan.ie/en/donovan-awards-and-honours/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dushanbe Synagogue''', also known as the '''Bukharian Synagogue''', located in [[Dushanbe]], the capital of [[Tajikistan]], was constructed in the 19th century in one of the two Jewish Quarters in Dushanbe at the time. It was part of the Jewish community compound, which also included ritual buildings and a school. In February 2006, the Government of Tajikistan began demolition of the Jewish community compound as part of an urban redevelopment plan designed to make way for a new presidential residence, the [[Palace of Nations (Tajikistan)|Palace of Nations]], with adjoining landscaped areas. The demolition of the [[synagogue]] was delayed due to international protests and a series of court actions until the end of June 2008, when the old building was finally razed.&lt;ref name=June2008&gt;[http://subscribe.ru/archive/news.world.turkestan/200806/26150229.html Dushanbe synagogue demolished], 26 June 2008 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996202.html Tajikistan's only synagogue razed], 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The former synagogue building==
Built by the [[Bukharian Jew]] community more than a hundred years ago, in the late 19th century, the synagogue was seized by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviets]] in 1920 and [[nationalization|nationalized]] in 1952. The Jewish community was again allowed access to the building in 1958, although the land remained in government hands (as all land was and still is state-owned in Tajikistan). The synagogue functioned after Tajikistan's independence in 1991 and throughout its [[Civil war in Tajikistan|civil war]] from 1992 to 1997.  It was vandalized in 1995 in an incident which also included the ransacking of Jewish homes.

In May 2003, the Jewish community received an official letter ordering them to vacate the buildings, including the synagogue, by July of that year.  Demolition, originally scheduled for 2004, began in early February 2006 with the destruction of the community's ''[[mikvah]]'', or ritual bath, [[Kosher foods|kosher]] butcher, and classrooms.&lt;ref name=February2006&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=731 Demolition of country's only synagogue begins] 22 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the synagogue was delayed until June 2008 due to international protests and a series of court actions. The synagogue was finally demolished on 22 June 2008.&lt;ref name=June2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Controversy over demolition of old synagogue==
[[File:Dushanbe Synagogue Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Old Synagogue, Dushanbe (main entrance), June 2006]]
The government ordered the demolition of the entire Jewish community compound, including the synagogue, in accordance with city center regeneration plans, specifically the construction of the [[Palance of Nations (Tajikistan)|Palace of Nations]] surrounded by extensive landscaped grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=129 Will Jews get compensation when synagogue is demolished?] - Forum 18, 18 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; At the time demolition began, the synagogue was a functioning house of worship serving Dushanbe's small Jewish community (150 to 350 Jews). This was the last remaining synagogue in Tajikistan. While the government argued that the building was of no historical significance and could be demolished in accordance with city planning needs, the Jewish community stated that, as the last remaining Jewish house of prayer in a country that had been a home to Jews for at least two thousand years, the building was of considerable historical significance. The ownership of the building was also disputed.  The Jewish community reported that it had documentation of its original (pre-Soviet) ownership of the building and the purchase of the land on which the synagogue had been constructed. The Dushanbe municipal authorities argued, on the other hand, that the state owned the land and the building since it underwent nationalisation in 1952 by the [[USSR|Soviet]] authorities.&lt;ref name=May2004&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=325 Dushanbe Jews ordered to vacate synagogue by July], [[Forum 18]] News Service, 21 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dushanbe Synagogue interior.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old Synagogue, Dushanbe (courtyard), June 2006]]
Back in 2004, the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Central Asia]], Rabbi [[Abraham Dovid Gurevich]], raised the issue of [[antisemitism]], hinting that the prospect of a synagogue standing next to the Palace of Nations would cause embarrassment to the authorities,&lt;ref name=May2004/&gt; but the US [[State Department]] framed the issue as "bureaucratic, rather than ideological".&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35488.htm Tajikistan, International Religious Freedom Report 2004] - US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 14 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] wrote a letter to the government of Tajikistan in 2004 that destruction of the synagogue would be in "contradiction with international standards for the protection of cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1139395516487&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Save Dushanbe's synagogue] - [[Jerusalem Post]] Web site 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported in 2006 that "those opposed to the demolition had been threatened by officials and most of the congregation are afraid to speak out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4777586.stm  Last Tajik synagogue to be razed] - [[BBC News]] Web site 5 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 it appeared for a short time that the Government of Tajikistan had reversed their decision and would allow the Jewish community to keep the synagogue on the current site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=370417 Tajikistan’s Only Synagogue Saved in Nick of Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301065152/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=370417 |date=1 March 2007 }} - Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS News Web site 20 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, however, it was announced that the synagogue would be rebuilt on "a suitable new site at the center of the city".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/05/18/eaek/ Synagogue to be rebuilt on a new site], 18 May 2006 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Dushanbe Jewish community, spurred by international public opinion, continued its attempts to save the old synagogue on the original site, but in June 2008, the Dushanbe municipal courts finally ruled that the demolition of the old synagogue would proceed as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/6/719A60B6-BA4F-4E82-8EC3-8074BC40E7EA.html Municipal courts in Dushanbe order demolition of the old synagogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908072152/http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/6/719A60B6-BA4F-4E82-8EC3-8074BC40E7EA.html |date=8 September 2008 }}, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the government refuses to compensate the Jewish community for the loss of the building, it has allocated a plot of 1,500 square meters for the construction of a new synagogue on the banks of the Dushanbinka River in the [[Dushanbe#Districts|Firdavsi municipal district]] in the west of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish.ru/news/cis/2008/04/news994261594.php New site for the synagogue allocated], 15 April 2008 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June 2008, immediately after the destruction of the old synagogue, [[Lev Avnerovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]], the President of the [[Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS]] (FJC), confirmed during a visit to Dushanbe that the construction of a synagogue on the new site would begin soon, financed by FJC, the [[Bukharian Jewish Congress]], and private donors.

'''Ernest Jacques Thiel''' (Norrköping 18 August 1859 – Stockholm 6 January 1947) was a Swedish financier and art collector whose former villa in the Stockholm park area [[Djurgården]] today houses the ''[[Thielska galleriet]]'' (the Thiel Gallery). Thiel also translated works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] into Swedish.

Ernest Thiel's parents were the Belgian Catholic engineer Jacques Thiel and Fanny Stiebel, of German-Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; After school in Stockholm, Thiel was sent to Germany to learn trade in a Hamburg merchant house, and later worked in a bank there. He returned to Stockholm in 1877 and found work in [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]], the bank of the [[Wallenberg family]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he became the manager of the Stockholm office of Hernösands enskilda bank and in 1891 he had accumulated enough capital to start his own bank, Stockholms Kredit- och Diskontoförening, later known as Aktiebolaget Stockholms diskontobank, which he headed until 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Hofberg et al. 1906; Linde, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he had married Anna Josephson, member of a well-known Jewish family and sister-in-law of the publisher [[Bonnier family|Karl Otto Bonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7 f&lt;/ref&gt; He caused a scandal when he divorced her (1896–97) to marry Signe Hansen, a young and beautiful widow with literary and artistic interests who had been his wife's companion.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel's art collecting began in earnest in 1901, when he bought art for the then considerable sum of 19,000 [[Swedish krona|crowns]] at the exhibition of the Konstnärsförbundet artist group. The following year he bought 19 paintings by [[Bruno Liljefors]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The flat at [[Strandvägen]] into which he had moved with second wife in 1897 started to be cramped, and in 1904, Thiel commissioned the architect [[Ferdinand Boberg]] to build him a large villa at Blockhusudden in the [[Djurgården]] park area of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10 f&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon discovered that the art collection had outgrown the building and Boberg had to add another large room in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugen]], the painter and collector, had recently had Boberg design a combined residence and art gallery at [[Waldemarsudde]] in another part of Djurgården, which may have influenced Thiel.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince originally counteracted Thiel's plans and forced him to move his new house to a spot farther away from Waldemarsudde than he had first wanted,&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10, 47&lt;/ref&gt; but when, in 1906, Eugen gave Thiel a painting of his, ''Nattmolnet'' (The Night Cloud) it was a sign that he had accepted his position in the art life of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Pastore''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|s|t|ɔr|i}}; August 21, 1957 &amp;ndash; December 17, 2012) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] player and radio host. He [[pitcher|pitched]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 1979 until 1985 and for the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1986, and was in the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] organization in 1987.

==Playing career==
Pastore was born in [[Alhambra, California]], and was valedictorian of the 1975 class of [[Damien High School]] in [[La Verne, California]].  That year, Pastore went to the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the amateur draft.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Pastore https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pastofr01.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Pastore continued to be promoted within the organization, with an impressive 3.28 ERA in the minor leagues. He made his major league debut on April 4, 1979, at [[Riverfront Stadium]], pitching three scoreless innings in a loss to the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;Wednesday, April 4, 1979, Riverfront Stadium https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN197904040.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Used equally as a [[Relief pitcher|reliever]] and [[Starting pitcher|starter]] during his rookie season, he then moved full-time to the starting rotation in 1980.

Pastore's best statistical season came in 1980 with the Reds, as he posted a record of 13 - 7 with an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 3.27 in 27 appearances.  Pastore was hit on the elbow with a batted ball on June 4, 1984.  That injury caused him to appear in only 41 games in the 1984 and 1985 seasons combined. He was then released by the Reds in 1986 following spring training.  However, Pastore quickly signed with the Minnesota Twins, and spent the entire season coming out of the bullpen.  Following the season, he signed with the Texas Rangers and was assigned to the AAA [[Oklahoma City 89ers]].  However, Pastore started four disappointing games with the team (compiling a 1-3 record and 8.46 ERA) before retiring.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Pastore https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=pastor001fra&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

After baseball, Pastore (a former [[Atheism|atheist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bigger-than-life-christian-radio-personality-frank-pastore-dies-86838/|title='Bigger Than Life' Christian Radio Personality Frank Pastore Dies|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=December 18, 2012|author=Alex Murashko}}&lt;/ref&gt;) went back to school, graduating with a degree in business administration from [[National University (California)|National University]] in 1989. He then spent the next two years with the national leadership of Athletes in Action, the sports ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. He then attended the [[Talbot School of Theology]] at [[Biola University]], graduating ''summa cum laude'' with an MA in philosophy of religion and ethics in 1994. In 2003, Pastore completed his second master's degree, in political philosophy and American government, from [[Claremont Graduate University|Claremont Graduate School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://townhall.com/columnists/frankpastore/ townhall.com on Frank Pastore]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2004, Pastore became the host of ''The Frank Pastore Show'' on [[KKLA-FM]] in [[Los Angeles]], which became one of the largest Christian talk shows in the United States.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/frank-pastore-dies-motorcycle-accident-403765|title=Frank Pastore Dies After Motorcycle Accident He Predicted|author=Paul Bond|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Pastore authored ''Shattered:  Struck Down, But Not Destroyed'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndale.com/Frank-Pastore/bio Tyndale House on Frank Pastore]&lt;/ref&gt; a book recounting how he became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] during recovery from his 1984 pitching arm injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecross-photo.com/A_Big-League_Skeptic_Finds_Faith_At_The_Cross.htm|title=A Big League Skeptic Finds Faith At The Cross (excerpt from Tim LaHaye's Power of the Cross)|author=Frank Pastore|year=1998|accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastore once held the record for the fastest time to finish eating the famous 72-oz steak dinner, "The Texas King", at [[the Big Texan Steak Ranch]]. Pastore's record of 9 minutes 30 seconds stood for 21 years, until being broken by [[Joey Chestnut]] in 2008.

On November 19, 2012, Pastore was critically injured on the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill (210) Freeway]] in [[Duarte, California]], when a woman from [[Glendora, California]], driving a [[Hyundai Sonata]], collided with his [[Honda]] VTX 1800, throwing him off the motorcycle. He was hospitalized in critical condition with serious head injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/ci_22192872|title=KKLA radio host Frank Pastore transferred to Upland hospital|publisher=DailyBulletin|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2012-12-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours before the accident, Pastore commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...you guys know I ride a motorcycle, don’t you? So, at any moment, especially with the idiot people who cross the diamond lane into my lane, all right, without any blinkers -- not that I’m angry about it, but at any minute I could be spread out all over the 210 (Freeway). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/12/18/mlb-player-turned-christian-radio-host-who-eerily-predicted-his-own-motorcycle-accident-dies-and-here-is-his-last-email-exchange-with-theblaze/ Radio Host Who Eerily Predicted His Own Motorcycle Accident Dies] Retrieved 2016-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://drjamesdobson.org/popupplayer?broadcastId=c9eec73f-0352-4494-b5ee-199acb46b97e Podcast with Frank Pastore: When Life Throws You a Curve Ball] Retrieved 2016-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Less than a month later, on December 17, 2012, Pastore died from pneumonia and other complications of his injuries.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kkla.com/frankpastore.aspx|title=Frank Pastore Webpage|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2012-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120625161527/http://www.kkla.com/frankpastore.aspx|archivedate=2012-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pastore is survived by his wife, Gina, children Frank Jr. and Christina, and one grandchild.

A '''god''' is a male [[deity]], in contrast with a [[goddess]], a female deity. While the term "goddess" specifically refers to a female deity, the plural "gods" can be applied to deities collectively, regardless of gender. The [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[pantheon (gods)|pantheons]] were ruled by [[Zeus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornblower|first1=Simon|title=[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-860641-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

When [[ancient Egyptian religion]] developed closer to [[monotheism]], it was [[Amun]], a male god, who rose to the most prominent place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redford|first1=Donald B.|title=The Oxford Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology|date=2003|publisher=Berkley Books|location=New York|isbn=0-425-19096-X|pages=20|edition=Berkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2015}}

Predominantly, [[Burmese Indians]] make up Myanmar's population of Hindus. The practice of Hinduism among Burmese Indians is also influenced by Buddhism. In addition to Hindu deities, the Buddha is also worshiped and many Hindu temples in Myanmar house statues of the Buddha. The [[Burmese Indians]] include [[Myanmar Tamils]], [[Bengalis]], [[Odias]], [[Malayalis]], etc.

The majority of the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] (or Manipuri) in Myanmar practice Hinduism. They are descendants of forced labourers taken from [[Manipur]] during the Manipuri–Burmese war from 1819 to 1825. Manipuris are concentrated in about 13 villages in the [[Mandalay]], [[Sagaing]] and [[Amarapura]] areas. Manipuri settlements are also found along the [[Ningthi]] river, and the areas sandwiched between the river and the boundary of Manipur.

Many [[Nepali language|Nepali]]-speaking [[Burmese Gurkha]] in Myanmar practice Hinduism.

A small minority of predominantly-[[Islam|Muslim]] [[Rohingya people]] also practice Hinduism.

==History==
Hinduism, along with Buddhism, arrived in Burma during ancient times. Both names of the country are rooted in Hinduism; Burma is the British colonial officials' phonetic equivalent for the first half of ''Brahma Desha'', the ancient name of the region.&lt;ref name=tck&gt;Toʻ Cinʻ Khu, {{Google books|tEI6AQAAMAAJ|Elementary Hand-book of the Burmese Language|page=4}}, pp. iv-v&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brahma]] is part of Hindu trinity, a deity with four heads. The name ''Myanmar'' is the regional language&lt;ref&gt;in both Talaing and Burmese languages; ''Prome'' is similarly derived from Brohm or Brahma.&lt;/ref&gt; transliteration of ''Brahma'', where ''b'' and ''m'' are interchangeable.&lt;ref name=tck/&gt;

[[Arakan Mountains|Arakan]] (Rakhine) Yoma is a significant natural mountainous barrier between Burma and India, and the migration of Hinduism and Buddhism into Burma occurred slowly through [[Manipur]] and by South Asian seaborne traders. Hinduism greatly influenced the royal court of Burmese kings in pre-colonial times, as seen in the architecture of cities such as [[Bagan]]. Likewise, the [[Burmese language]] adopted many words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], many of which relate to religion. 

While ancient and medieval arrival of ideas and culture fusion transformed Burma over time, it is in 19th and 20th century that over a million Hindu workers were brought in by British colonial government to serve in plantations and mines. The British also felt that surrounding the European residential centre with Indian immigrants provided a buffer and a degree of security from tribal theft and raids. According to 1931 census, 55% of Rangoon's ([[Yangon]]) population were Indian migrants, mostly Hindus.&lt;ref name=dms&gt;Donald M. Seekins (2006), Historical Dictionary of Burma, {{ISBN|978-0810854765}}, pp. 216-220&lt;/ref&gt; 

After independence from Britain, Burma Socialist Programme Party under [[Ne Win]] adopted xenophobic policies and expelled 300,000 Indian ethnic people (Hindus), along with 100,000 Chinese, from Burma between 1963 and 1967. The Indian policy of encouraging democratic protests in Burma increased persecution of Hindus, as well as led to Burmese retaliatory support of left-leaning rebel groups in northeastern states of India.&lt;ref name=dms/&gt;

==Contemporary status==
[[File:Hindutempleyangon.jpg|thumb|[[Shri Kali Temple]], Burma, a Hindu temple with [[Dravidian architecture]] in Yangon]]
Aspects of Hinduism continue in Burma today, even in the majority Buddhist culture. For example, Thagyamin is worshipped whose origins are in the Hindu god [[Indra]]. Burmese literature has also been enriched by Hinduism, including the Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana, called [[Yama Zatdaw]]. Many Hindu gods are likewise worshipped by many Burmese people, such as [[Saraswati]] (known as Thuyathadi in Burmese), the goddess of knowledge, who is often worshipped before examinations; Shiva is called ''Paramizwa''; Vishnu is called ''Withano'', and others. Many of these ideas are part of thirty seven [[Nat (spirit)|Nat]] or deities found in Burmese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thant Myint-U (2001), The Making of Modern Burma, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521799140}}, pp. 27-47&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Myanmar, most [[Burmese Indians|Hindus]] are found in the urban centres of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. Ancient Hindu temples are present in other parts of Burma, such as the 11th century [[Nathlaung Kyaung Temple]] dedicated to Vishnu in [[Bagan]].

[[File:Family members with massacred Hindus in Rakhine State.jpg|thumb|Hindu villagers gather to identify the corpses of family members who were killed in the [[Kha Maung Seik massacre]].]]
On 25 August 2017, the villages in a cluster known as Kha Maung Seik in northern Maungdaw District of Rakhine State in Myanmar were attacked by Rohingya muslims of [[Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army]] (ARSA).This was called [[Kha Maung Seik massacre]]. Amnesty International said that about 99 Hindus were killed in that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4229789/rohingya-arsa-kill-hindus-rakhine-myanmar/|title=Rohingya militants slaughtered 99 Hindus in a single day: Amnesty International|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44206372|title=Rohingya militants 'massacred Hindus'|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to these, many Rohingya Hindus have started identifying themselves as [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] Hindus rather than Rohingyas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/world/dont-call-us-rohingya-myanmarese-hindu-refugees-in-bangladesh-detest-the-incorrect-labelling-4220141.html|title='Don't call us Rohingya': Myanmarese Hindu refugees in Bangladesh detest the incorrect labelling - Firstpost|website=www.firstpost.com|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In Myanmar and in Bangladeshi refugee camps—according to some media accounts—Hindu Rohingyas (particularly women) faced kidnapping, religious abuse and "forced conversions" at the hands of Muslim Rohingyas.

The '''[[Imamate]] in [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] doctrine'''&lt;ref name="RAWŻA-YE TASLIM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Badakhchani|first=S. Jalal|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/rawza-ye-taslim|title=RAWŻA-YE TASLIM|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|إمامة}}) is a concept in [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism]] which defines the political, religious and spiritual dimensions of authority concerning [[Islamic leadership]] over the [[Ummah|nation of believers]].  The primary function of the Imamate is to establish an institution between an Imam who is present and living in the world and his following whereby each are granted rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="ismaili.net"&gt;Interview on BBC Radio 4 - 1979, September 6|http://www.ismaili.net/heritage/node/17808&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nizari Imamate follows a genealogy of male Imams originating from prophet hood of [[Muhammad]] by means of wedlock of his daughter [[Fatimah]] with his cousin [[Ali]] and in succession, through their son [[Hussein]] and his onward descendants up to the present day. Each ordained as successor Imam of this lineage is charged with serving the Nizari Ismailis community of his era; who are liable to pay the zakat (tithe) dues to him due to his being as ex-officio and the designated Nizari Imam. The Imam in return, imparts them the religious and spiritual guidance and also strives for their physical well-being to the best of his ability.

With respect to their spiritual nature, the Imams are considered living manifestations of the [[Quran|divine word]] as well as intermediaries (wasilah in Qur'an 5:35) between God and the [[Ummah]]. Based on this belief, the Nizari Ismaili concept of Imamate differs from that of the [[Twelver]]'s concept in that the Nizari Imams possess the authority to interpret the Quran according to the times and change or even abrogate any aspect of "The Way/The Path" ([[Sharia]]) of Islam.

The 49th and presently living Nizari Imam is [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan (IV)]].&lt;ref name="nytimesJetSet"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Aga Khan, a jet-setter who mixes business and Islam |first=G.

{{Aqidah|Shia}}

==Concepts==
Ismaili Muslims consider [[Walayah|love and devotion]] for the living imam, his [[Pir (Sufism)|deputies]] and [[Da'i|missionaries]] an integral part of the religion and classify it within the [[Seven pillars of Ismailism|Seven Pillars]] of faith.  The Imam's Teaching Hierarchy (hudud al-din), historically called ''da'wa'' in [[Arabic]], is considered a sacred tenet because without his loyal Da'is the living imam would essentially be disconnected from his following.

The Ismailis record several periods in which generations of Imams lived a clandestine lifestyle resulting from political rivalry, religious persecution, and often both.  When the Imam of the Time's guidance cannot be delivered publicly his responsibilities are kept up through a staff of devotees acting intermediaries between the Imam and his followers.  Ismaili literature traditionally refers to these periods of time as eras of concealment, or ''dawr al-satr'' in [[Arabic]].

===Leadership===
The Imamat is an institution of welfare that is established through a convent between an imam and his followers, whereby each assume rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="ismaili.net"/&gt; In the words of the present living imam, [[Aga Khan IV|Shah Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV]], "the role of the Imam is to listen, not to talk; there's a big difference, in the sense that members of the community must inform me ... what is of concern to them."&lt;ref&gt;Interview on BBC Radio 4 - 1979, September 6. 17:00 minutes. http://www.ismaili.net/heritage/node/17808&lt;/ref&gt; However serving and humble the Imam of the Time may be, in the eyes of his devotees he is spiritually revered as the asylum of the universe and a blessing worthy of protection and sacrifice.

The source of authority of the Imamat is interpreted by Ismaili Muslims as being explicitly stated within the Quran and they also believe the Quran alone provides its framework.  In a [[khutba|sermon]] delivered during the reign of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] the rights and responsibilities between the Imam and his following are explained:

{{Quotation|''The Imam has not the option to reduce the rights of his flock, nor is the flock to decrease the rights of their Imam. Among the rights of the flock against their Imam is the maintaining of the [[Quran|Book of God]] and the [[Sunnah|Sunna of His Prophet]], may God bless him and [[List of Ismaili imams|his family]], and restitution from those who treat them unjustly for those so treated, and from the powerful among them for the weak, from the noble of them for the lowly, investigating their manner of life and the differing conditions of it, looking solicitously upon his dependants in his efforts, watching over them with his eye. For He, great and glorious is He, concerning what He praised of the character of His Prophet and His Messenger said: ‘There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves; a sorrow that befalls you grieves him; he is anxious concerning you; with the believers he is kind and compassionate’ [Q. 9: 128]. When he does that, the flock should revere him, honor him and extend assistance to him, standing prepared and ready, on behalf of what is right according to the book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, may God bless him and his family.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Daftary, Farhad|''Study of Shi‘i Islam, The: History, Theology and Law ''|(Kindle Locations 10208–10220). I.B.Tauris. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khuṭba of al-Q āʾim 302 no. 1"&gt;Khuṭba of al-Q āʾim 302 (no. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Examples of recent developments initiated by the Imamat include the foundation of several welfare and higher learning institutions; they exist within the framework of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]], the [[Aga Khan University]], and the [[Institute of Ismaili Studies]].

====Leader====
{{See also|List of Ismaili Imams}}
Every Nizari Imam is considered to be a ''testament to God's spiritual presence among his people''. When a descendant of the [[Ahlul Bayt|holy family]] is nominated as the "Imam" they become one essence with the divine and a living manifestation of the [[Quran]]. Each such designated (by nass) Imam receives the Nur (Light) of [[Allah|God]] as per the Quranic Ayat which asserts thus:
{{Quotation|''And We have vested everything in the manifest Imam. (Quran 36:12)''}}
This Noor of God exists simultaneously in the present moment in the Almighty God's transcendental form as well as in the Nizari Imam's human form. Thus, when describing the essence of an Imam, the spiritual Nizari instructor of [[Rumi]], the great [[Shams Tabrizi]], wrote:
{{Quotation|''The meaning of the 'Book of God' is not the text (of the Quran); it is the Man who Guides. He is the 'Book of God'. He is its verses. He is scripture.''&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N.|''The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation''|Oxford University Press, New York, 2007|p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In a [[khutba|sermon]] delivered during the reign of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] the measure of obedience to the Imam is explained:
{{Quotation|God said: 'O you who believe, obey God and obey the Messenger and [[Imamah (Nizari Ismaili doctrine)|those with authority among you]]' [Q. 4: 59 ]. Thus He makes obedience a duty, attaching it to obedience to the regulators of His affairs. They are the ones who uphold, on behalf of God, His truth and those who summon to him whoever desires to obey Him. He singled them out by the imamate, which is the highest of the ranks below prophecy. He prescribed for the servants rights due them and ordered them to fulfil these. He stipulated that they are connected to obeying him, doubling their reward on the measure of how well they follow those whose authority is ordained.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khuṭba of al-Q āʾim 302 no. 1" /&gt;}}

===Administration===

During the [[Fatimid]] rule of Egypt the affairs of state governance were a prominent occupation for the Ismaili Imams as the Fatimid Caliphs of Egypt. Aside from the governance of the Fatimid Empire there were also religious and spiritual affairs pertaining to the Fatimid Ismailis of the time who accepted the Fatimid Caliphs also as their spiritual Imams.

An institution of Ismaili Dawa (propagation of the Ismaili faith) was created by the Fatimid Imams and authority was delegated to Dais (spiritual teachers) for specific territories under the Fatimid Empire and even for territories beyond its borders to propagate Ismailism.

==Textual basis==
:''See also: [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Hadith of Ghadir Khumm]] and [[Hadith of Mubahala]]''
At ''al-Ghadir Khumm'', by ''God's direct and emphatic command'', Prophet Mohammad designated his cousin and son-in-law Ali—husband of his daughter Fatima-tz-Zahra—as his successor to his ''spiritual'' office as the first Imam in the continuing line of hereditary Imams and as his successor to his ''temporal'' office as the first Caliph of the entire Muslim ummah (community). Ali was then accepted as the successor to Prophet Mohammad's leadership at al-Ghadir Khumm by about 100,000 pilgrims on their return journey after participating in the Prophet's Farewell Pilgrimage, his last one before his death that same year.

At al-Ghadir Khumm the most prominent and closest ''Companions of the Prophet'' (the Asaba) "gave their allegiance (bayah) personally to Ali under the Prophet's supervision." Among the Prophet's Companions were the first three Caliphs (the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs—i.e., the "Righteous Caliphs") Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman who took Ali's hand in their own hands and publicly spoke their unstinted allegiance to serve him as their Imam and Caliph in the very same manner that all Muslims used to give their allegiance to Prophet Mohammad.

Numerous reliable hadith sources—both Shia and Sunni—record the event at Ghadir Khumm. They agree that Prophet Mohammad on his return journey from the final pilgrimage stopped at an oasis between Mecca and Medina known as Ghadir Khumm and addressed the large gathering of Muslims assembled there at  his explicit command even though it was excruciatingly hot that day in order to hear God's special message to them (the people) according to God's message the Prophet himself had received at Ghadir Khumm directly from God via the Quranic Ayat 5:67 thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"O Apostle: Deliver (to the people) what has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you do not do so then you will not have delivered His Message (of Islam). And God will protect you from the people." —Quran 5:67.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prophet then asked the gathered Muslims whether he (the Prophet) had a greater claim upon them than they had even upon themselves. The Muslims responded that Prophet Mohammad had a greater claim upon them than they had even upon themselves. The Prophet then went on to say, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"God is my Master and I am the master of all the believers. He whose master I am, Ali is his master. He whose master I am, Ali is his master. He whose master I am, Ali is his master. (i.e., repeating it three times). O God, help whoever helps Ali, oppose whoever opposes Ali, support whoever supports Ali, forsake whoever forsakes Ali, and may the truth follow Ali wheresoever he turns. Ali, the son of Abu Talib, is my brother, my executor (Wasi), and my successor (Caliph), and the leader (Imam) after me."&lt;ref&gt;References to the sermon: 1. A'alam al-Wara, pp 132–133; 2. Tadhkirat al-Khawas al-Ummah; 3. Sibt Ibn al-Jawzi al-Hanafi, pp 28–33; 4. al-Sirah al-Halabiyyah by Noor al-Din al-Halabi, v3, p 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Shia Nizari Ismaili tradition bears witness to the continuity of the hereditary authority vested in the ''Imamim Mubeen (the Manifest Imam)'' at Ghadir Khumm by Prophet Mohammad and which has continued over 1,400 years from Ali to the present Imam-of-the-Time, Prince Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary Imam and direct descendant of Mohammad through Ali and Fatima Zahra.

==History==
The changing interpretations of the Quran by the Nizari Ismaili Imams to adapt to changing times creates tension between the Nizari Ismaili Imams and the Orthodox Ulema (Islamic scholars). The two most recent Nizari Ismaili Imams titled Aga Khan III and Aga Khan IV have replaced the obligation to perform the daily prayers from five times a day to three times a day by following the Quranic injunction rather than following the Prophet's custom (hadith and sunnah), in order to ease the religious pressures on the Muslim in the modern world. For example, they have dispensed with the veil for women and replaced it with dressing according to common decency in the country of one's residence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But purdah, as now known, itself did not exist till long after the Prophet’s death and is no part of Islam. The part played by Muslim women at Kardesiah and Yarmuk the two most momentous battles of Islam next to Badr and Honein, and their splendid nursing of the wounded after those battles, is of itself a proof to any reasonable person that purdah, as now understood, has never been conceived by the companions of the Prophet. That we Muslims should saddle ourselves with this excretion of Persian custom, borrowed by the Abbassides, is due to that ignorance of early Islam which is one of the most extraordinary of modern conditions." —Aga Khan III&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Specifically, the Aga Khan IV has emphasized the ethics of pluralism, the cosmopolitan ethic of frontierless brotherhood and sisterhood, the forbearance from killing to settle disputes, governance by constitution and law, and the importance of keeping to the Islamic ethics practiced by the Prophet of Islam.

===Schism===
The Ismailis and the Twelvers split over the succession to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. Ismailis contend that Jafar had designated his son Isma'il ibn Jafar as his heir and the next Imam in the hereditary line and thus the Isma'ilis follow the Imamat of Isma'il and his progeny. Although Imam Ismail predeceased his father, he (i.e., Isma'il ibn Jafar) had in his own right designated his son Muhammad ibn Ismail as the next hereditary Imam who was to follow after him. In direct opposition to this belief, the Twelvers believe that Imam Ismail's younger brother Musa al Kadhim was from the beginning the rightful successor to Imam Jafar and that Ismail himself was never a contender.

The ''Nizari Ismailis'' have always maintained that the [[Imamate|Imamah]] (also known as 'Imamat') can only be inherited from the current Imam to a direct descendant in a father-to-son (or grandson) ''hereditary lineage'' starting with Imam Ali and then to Imam Hussein and so on until their present Imam, Prince Karim al Husseini. Hassan bin (son of) Ali is regarded as a Trustee Imam (imam al-mustawda) as opposed to a Hereditary Imam (imam al-mustaqarr). This fact is clearly demonstrated in the recitation of the Nizari Ismailis' daily prayers three times a day in which Imam Hasan's name is not included in the hereditary lineage&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad (1990). ''The Ismailis: Their History and Doctrines''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;551–553. {{ISBN|0-521-42974-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from Imam Ali to their 49th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=103467 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930190206/http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=103467 |archivedate=2008-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imam Prince Karim al Hussaini (although Hassan bin Ali is revered as part of the Prophet's personal family, the Ahl al-Bayt). If Hassan bin Ali's name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would have to be the 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam, the way he has identified himself and is known to the world.

The '''International League of Non-religious and Atheists''' (German: ''Internationaler Bund der Konfessionslosen und Atheisten'', '''IBKA''') is an international association founded in [[Berlin]] in 1976 as "International League of Non-religious" (IBDK). It originated from the ''MIZ magazine'' and the Bund der Konfessionslosen Berlin (Union of the non-religious in Berlin) founded in 1972, and adopted the name IBKA in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibka.org/en/infos/ibka.html |title=About us |work=IBKA website |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has approximately 1000 members&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/ketzer-ohne-kaefig.1278.de.html?dram:article_id=207014&lt;/ref&gt; and 13 coorporative Members,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibka.org/infos/korporative&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a Scientific Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibka.org/infos/beirat&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as an [[eingetragener Verein]] (e.V.) in [[Germany]].

Among its objectives, IBKA promotes [[rationalism]] and pursues the establishment of [[human rights]] and [[scientific freedom]], as well as the [[Separation of Church and state|separation of Church and State]]. In 2014, it was amongst several secularist organisations to campaign for the right to [[euthanasia]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article125740335/Zehn-Punkte-Papier-gegen-neues-Suizid-Strafgesetz.html |title=Zehn-Punkte-Papier gegen neues Suizid-Strafgesetz |author=Matthias Kamann |work=[[Die Welt]] |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=14 August 2015 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{islam by country}}

According to statistics from 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/press12012011.pdf Singapore Statistics 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124160522/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/press12012011.pdf |date=2011-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 15% of [[Singapore]]'s resident population aged 15 years and over are [[Muslims]]. A majority of [[Malay Singaporean|Malays]] are [[Sunni]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, ''Some Aspects of Sufism as Understood and Practised among the Malays'' (Singapore: Malaysian Sociological Research Institute, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; 17 per cent of Muslims in Singapore are of South Asian origin. Other adherents include those from the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese]], [[Arab Singaporean|Arab]] and [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasian]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71357.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Muslims in Singapore are traditionally Sunni Muslims who follow the [[Shafii|Shafi'i]] [[Fiqh|school of thought]] or the [[Hanafi]] [[Fiqh|school of thought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVO2RR6ymjoC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Muslim Puritans: Reformist Psychology in Southeast Asian Islam | page=147 | accessdate=May 31, 2014 | author=James L. Peacock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==
Islamic bureaucracy long formed an integral part of Malay Sultanates - since the advent of Islam in the region. The [[Malacca Sultanate]] of the 1500s was recorded to have practiced ''syariah'' (sharia) law, as well as its Johor successor of which Singapore was a part until 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Kamali |first1 = Mohammad Hashim |title = Islamic law in Malaysia : issues and developments |date = 2000 |publisher = Ilmiah Publishers|location = Kuala Lumpur |isbn = 9789832092278}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the British started governing Singapore, syariah law was relegated to the realm of personal law.

In 1915 the British colonial authorities established the Mohammedan Advisory Board. The Board was tasked to advise the colonial authorities on matters connected with the [[Islamic]] religion and custom.

Singapura or Singapore  became part of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, before being expelled in 1965. The [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-CONST&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part constitution] of the newly independent Republic of Singapore included two provisions relating to the special position of the Malays and the Muslim religion - Articles 152 and 153.

Article 152 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.

(2) The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of Article 152 Section 2, the Singapore government discourages missionaries from [[proselytism|proselytizing]] the Malay population from Islam to other religions - to avoid racial and religious tensions within Muslim population and because of the [[Malay Islamic identity]], whereby Malay culture has close and strong identification with Islam.

Article 153 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Legislature shall by law make provision for regulating Muslim religious affairs and for constituting a Council to advise the President in matters relating to the Muslim religion.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1966 the Singaporean Parliament passed the [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-3&amp;doctitle=ADMINISTRATION%20OF%20MUSLIM%20LAW%20ACT%0A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part Administration of the Muslim Law Act (AMLA)]. The Act came into effect in 1968 and defined the powers and jurisdiction of three key Muslim institutions:

# the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore
# the Syariah Court
# the Registry of Muslim Marriages

These institutions come under the purview of the [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports]] (MCYS)  though the minister responsible for these institutions is the [[Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;


==Key Muslim institutions==
===Office of the Secretary===

The Secretary of Muis also attend the meetings of Majlis but does not have the right to vote under section 8(1) of AMLA. The duties and powers of the Secretary is delineated in section 20 of AMLA. It states:

Subject to such directions as may be given to him by the President, the Secretary shall —

(a) have charge of all correspondence and documents of the Majlis, including all books of account thereof and all title deeds and securities;

(b) be generally responsible for the proper collection of, accounting for and disposal of all funds of the Majlis; and

(c) in all other respects carry out such duties as may be imposed upon him by this Act or allotted to him by direction of the President.

====Office of the Mufti====

Apart from the President and Secretary of Muis, another important office is that of the Mufti. Under section 30(3), the "Mufti shall be ex-officio a member of the Majlis."

Section 30(1) authorises the President of Singapore to appoint a fit and proper person to be the Mufti after consultation with the Majlis. In 1967, Mohamed Sanusi Mahmood was appointed as Singapore's first Mufti. He was succeeded by Syed Isa Semait in 1972.

====Legal Committee====

The President of Singapore also appoints the members of the Legal Committee (also known as the Fatwa Committee). The relevant provision relating to the Legal Committee is section 31 which states:

(1) There shall be a Legal Committee of the Majlis, consisting of —

(a) the Mufti;

(b) 2 other fit and proper members of the Majlis; and

(c) not more than 2 other fit and proper Muslims who are not members of the Majlis.

(2) The members of the Legal Committee, other than the Mufti, shall be appointed by the President of Singapore on the advice of the Majlis for such period as he thinks fit.

(3) A notification of every such appointment shall be published in the Gazette.

(4) The Mufti shall be chairman of the Legal Committee.

Under section 33, the Legal Committee is authorised to follow the tenets of the Shafi'i school of thought. It states:

(1) Subject to this section, the Majlis and the Legal Committee in issuing any ruling shall ordinarily follow the tenets of the Shafi’i school of law.

(2) If the Majlis or the Legal Committee considers that the following of the tenets of the Shafi"i school of law will be opposed to the public interest, the Majlis may follow the tenets of any of the other accepted schools of Muslim law as may be considered appropriate, but in any such ruling the provisions and principles to be followed shall be set out in full detail and with all necessary explanations.

(3) In any case where the ruling or opinion of the Majlis or the Legal Committee is requested in relation to the tenets of a particular school of Muslim law, the Majlis or the Legal Committee shall give its ruling or opinion in accordance with the tenets of that particular school of Muslim law.

===Syariah Court===

In 1880, the British colonial authorities introduced the Mahomedan Marriage Ordinance which officially recognised the status of Muslim personal law in Singapore.

In 1958, pursuant to the 1957 Muslim Ordinance, a [[Syariah]] Court with jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorce cases was established.

The Court replaced a set of government-licensed but otherwise unsupervised ''[[Qadi|qadhi]]'' (Muslim judges) who had previously decided on questions of divorce and inheritance, following either the traditions of particular ethnic groups or their own interpretations of Muslim law.

Today, the Syariah Court continues to exist as a court of competent jurisdiction with power and jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes defined by AMLA.

===Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM)===

The ROMM registers marriages when the couple are both Muslims. In the case of mixed-religion marriages, the marriage is registered at the Registry of Marriages.

Previously, the registration of Muslim marriages as well as divorces were conducted under one unit, which is the Syariah Court.

It was first located in a bungalow at Fort Canning and later moved to Canning Rise in 1983.

Appeals on decisions of the Syariah Court and the ROMM are heard and determined by the Appeal Board.

Unlike Muis, the Syariah Court and ROMM are not statutory boards but constitute a part of MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development).

==Muslim organisations==

===Ahmadiyya===
{{main article|Ahmadiyya in Singapore}}
[[Ahmadiyya]] is a small branch of Islam in Singapore. The Community was established during the era of the [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Second Caliphate]], shortly before the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Ghulam Ahsan Ayyaz was the first missionary to the country, who under the directive of the caliph arrived in 1935, in a period when the territory was part of the [[Straits Settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Review of Religions | url=http://reviewofreligions.org/10192/a-messenger-of-peace-in-the-lion-city-khalifah-of-the-promised-messiahas-visits-singapore/ | title=A Messenger of Peace in the Lion City – Khalifah of the Promised Messiahas Visits Singapore | date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the Community had roughly 200 followers, represented by 1-2% of the Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVO2RR6ymjoC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Muslim Puritans: Reformist Psychology in Southeast Asian Islam | page=147 | author=James L. Peacock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay-Muslim organisations===

Apart from these key Muslim institutions, there are also community self-help groups, voluntary welfare organisations and civic groups like the [[Young Women Muslim Association of Singapore]] (YWMA), Association of Muslim Professionals, [[Yayasan Mendaki]], Muslim Missionary Society (Jamiyah), PERDAUS, Singapore Islamic Scholars and Islamic Teachers Association (PERGAS), Muhammadiyah and Islamic Theological Association of Singapore (Pertapis).

===Indian-Muslim organisations===

There are also many Indian-Muslim organisations in Singapore e.g. Federation of Indian Muslims, Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League, Singapore Tenkasi Muslim Welfare Society, Thiruvithancode Muslim Union, and United Indian Muslim Association.

===Religio-cultural groups===

There are also religio-cultural groups like Al Usrah Al Dandaraweyah, formed in the structure of a family.

Others are like the Tariqah group at-Tariqah al-Ahmadiah al-Idrisiah ar-Rasyidiah, and Naqshbandi Haqqani Singapore.

This first established religio-cultural group; of Qadriah, Chistia, Naqshabandiyah, Sanusiyyah, Suharwadiyah; is now named as Khanqah Khairiyyah which was formed in 1971 and they have since been at the same location in Siglap Road Singapore.

===Shi'ite organisations===

The Shi'ite community consists of Twelver Shi'ites, Ismailis and Dawoodi Bohras.

In Singapore, the history of the Twelver Shi'ites began with the immigration of the Khoja community from India. A member of Khoja community spearheaded the founding of the Jaafari Muslim Association.

During the 1980s, Malays from the Muslim Youth Assembly (Himpunan Belia Islam) joined the Shi'ite community. A centre known as Hussainiyah Azzahra was later established.

The Jaafari Muslim Association and Muslim Youth Assembly cater to the Twelver Shi'ites.

The spiritual leader (Da'i al-Mutlaq) of the Dawoodi Bohras is Mohammed Burhanuddin, who represents the twenty-first imam. The Anjuman-E-Burhani caters to the Dawoodi Bohra community in Singapore. Bohra traders started settling in Singapore in the 1820s. The mosque for the Bohra community is the Burhani Mosque which was established in 1829. It has since been rebuilt and is now an 11-storey complex comprising prayer halls, function halls, meeting rooms and offices.

The Ismailis are followers of Aga Khan. The Aga Khan has decided to establish an Ismaili Centre and regional representative office of the Aga Khan Development Network in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,11948, Jan 20, 2009, The Straits Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218212103/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,11948, |date=2012-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanafi Muslim Community===
There is also a significant proportion of the Sunni [[Hanafi]] Muslims in Singapore. Generally most [[Pakistanis in Singapore]] are Hanafi. While they often inter-mix with the Malay who follow the [[Shafi'i]] madhab, Indian mosques in Singapore such as Angullia Mosque cater for the needs of the Hanafi Muslim in Singapore.

== Dawah Organisations ==

===Hikmah Times===
In Singapore there is a significant impact of the Islamic Dawah (Invitation/conversion) movement. There are many local/international organisations (e.g., Hikmah Times).

===Converts===

The Muslim Converts' Association of Singapore (also known as Darul Arqam) provides support for converts.

==Mosques==
{{see also|List of mosques in Singapore}}
There are 75 mosques in Singapore. With the exception of Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim (which is administered by the State of Johor), all the mosques in Singapore are administered by Muis. Twenty-three mosques were built using the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF). Masjid Al-Mawaddah, the twenty-third MBMF mosque, was officially opened in May 2009.
The speakers for broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer was turned inwards to broadcast towards the interior of the mosques as part of a noise abatement campaign in 1974.&lt;ref name="Lysloff, René T. A 2003. pg. 113"&gt;Lysloff, René T. A. Music and technoculture.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madrasahs==

{{main article|Madrasahs in Singapore}}
[[File:Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah Students In A Lecture.jpg|thumb|Students of Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah in [[Singapore]]]]
In Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by [[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura]] (MUIS, ''Islamic Religious Council of Singapore''). There are six full-time madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and [[Junior college (Singapore)|junior college]] equivalent, or "Pre-U", at several schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contrasting views of madrasahs in multi-ethnic Singapore|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090219-123165.html|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|date=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background of Madrasahs|url=http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/services/Madrasah_sub.aspx?id=204|publisher=[[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|muis.gov.sg]]|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] curriculum subjects and sit for the [[Primary School Leaving Examination|PSLE]] and [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level|GCE 'O' Levels]] like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the "Joint Madrasah System" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ''ukhrawi'', or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About JMS|url=http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/JMS/subpage.aspx?id=17539|publisher=[[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|muis.gov.sg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JMS aims to introduce the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JMS Timeline|url=http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/JMS/subpage.aspx?id=17587|publisher=[[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|muis.gov.sg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the [[songkok]] for boys and [[tudong]] for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the ''madrasah'' instead of enrolling full-time.

{{Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] has been present in [[Maharashtra]] since ancient times. The famous [[Ellora Caves]] demonstrate that Jainism was part of a thriving religious culture in Maharashtra in premodern times.

==History==
The Marathi Jainism is basically originated from Maharashtra and flourished here.

The oldest inscription in Maharashtra is a 2nd-century BC Jain inscription in a cave near Pale village in the [[Pune District]]. It was written in the [[Jain Prakrit]] and includes the [[Navkar Mantra]].

The first Marathi inscription known is at [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Karnataka]] near the left foot of the statue of [[Bahubali]], dated 981 CE.

Maharashtra had many Jain rulers such as the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] and the [[Shilahara]]s. Many of forts were built by kings from these dynasties and thus [[derasar|Jain temples]] or their remains are found in them. Texts such as the ''Shankardigvijaya'' and ''Shivlilamruta'' suggest that a large number of [[Marathi people|Maharashtrians]] were Jains in the ancient period.

==Modern Maharashtrian Jain communities==
The native Jains of Maharashtra today are endogamous communities and generally do not intermarry with the Jains who have arrived from [[North India]]. They are all [[Digambar]]as and are divided into four large communities:

* [[Saitwal]], originally Tailors and Cloth Merchants
* [[Chaturtha]], originally agriculturists, now engaged in various professions
* [[Panchama]], various professions
*  Kasar, traditionally coppersmiths

In addition there are several smaller native Maharashtrian Jain communities.

* [[Upajjhaya]]
* [[Kumbhoj|Kamboja]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BsBEgVa804IC&amp;pg=PA910&amp;ots=0k-6i0b5Mn&amp;dq=Kambhoja&amp;sig=cjvbpQ_AE8D_1d-h0u9fvHIyziE |title=People of India: Maharashtra - Kumar Suresh Singh, Anthropological Survey of India - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYSd-3yL9h0C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;ots=aBqkEjZ6JS&amp;dq=Kambhoja+desh+features&amp;sig=pbU8jeev6YHSf6WV3gL-BNzfDhc |title=The Castes and Tribes of H.E.H. the Nizam's Dominions - Syed Siraj Ul Hassan - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harada
*Jabade, Jain community in Maharshtra
* [[Dhakad]] A small Jain community found primarily in Western Vidarbha districts of Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Amravati.

Each of the four major communities led by its own spiritual leader ([[Bhattaraka]]), who heads a [[Matha]].

Immigrant Jains have a large population in Maharashtra. Majority of them are from [[Jainism in Rajasthan|Rajasthan]] and [[Jainism in Gujarat|Gujarat]]. Some of them are from [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Some of these communities have been in Maharashtra for centuries, and are now indistinguishable from the native residents of Maharashtra. They are divided in following large groups:
* [[Agrawal]]
* [[Oswal]]
* [[Sarawagi]]
* [[Jaiswal Jain|Jaiswal]]
* [[Shrimal]]i
* [[Humad]]
* [[Bagherwal]]
* Palliwal
* [[Porwad]]
* Ban. And   Parmar  etc.

==Religious organizations==
{{main|Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha}}
The [[Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha]] is a religious and social service organization of the [[Jainism|Jain]]s of South India. The organization is headquartered at [[Kolhapur]], Maharashtra, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmBjoAFMfjoC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=dakshina+bharat+jain+sabha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zKoIUYORPIm69gSfroBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dakshina%20bharat%20jain%20sabha&amp;f=false |title=People of India: Maharashtra - Kumar Suresh Singh - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is credited with being one of the first Jain associations to start reform movements among the Jains in modern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LW8czr_HzzwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=South+Indian+Jain+Association&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kc0IUYLKJIzvqQHbx4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=South%20Indian%20Jain%20Association&amp;f=false |title=The Assembly of Listeners: Jains in Society - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdNNz1jcN9cC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=South+Indian+Jain+Association&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kc0IUYLKJIzvqQHbx4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=South%20Indian%20Jain%20Association&amp;f=false |title=A World Religions Reader - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization mainly seeks to represent the interests of the native Jains of Maharashtra ([[Marathi Jains]]) and Karnataka ([[Kannada Jains]]).

'''Jarno Sebastian Elg''' (born 1975) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Satanism|Satanist]] (portrayed as [[Theistic Satanism|Devil worshipper]] by medias), who was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] for murdering a 23-year-old man, [[cannibalism|eating some of the body parts]] and instigating others to participate in a [[ritual]] that included [[torture|torturing]] the victim while listening to songs from ''[[The Cainian Chronicle]]'' album by the Norwegian [[black metal]] band [[Ancient (band)|Ancient]]&lt;ref name="musicmight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/norway/eidsvaagneset/ancient|title=Ancient biography on MusicMight|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|publisher=[[MusicMight]]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 21, 1998, in [[Hyvinkää]]. Elg's partners were 17-year-old Terhi Johanna Tervashonka from [[Järvenpää]], a 20-year-old man from [[Mäntsälä]] and a 16-year-old boy from [[Kerava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1437943|title=Paloittelusurmaajalle 9 vuotta vesuritaposta|date=19 September 2007|publisher=Ilta-Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarno Elg was tracked by the police and sentenced to life in prison. The Hyvinkää District Court in southern Finland sentenced accomplices Terhi Johanna Tervashonka, to eight years and six months in prison and Mika Kristian Riska, to two years and eight months. It was said that the three people "were strongly influenced by Satanism". The court declared most of the details of the case sealed for 40 years. For this reason, only a limited amount of information is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2012/03/04/top-20-human-cannibals-by-country/|title=Top 20 Human Cannibals by Country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal investigation started when a leg was found from a [[dump site]],&lt;ref name=worshiphim&gt;''Worship Him!''. In: [[Metalion|Jon Kristiansen]]: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 466f.&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving the name "dump site murder" to the case. The case was generally described as the most gruesome homicide in Finnish history.&lt;ref name=worshiphim/&gt;&lt;ref name=metalion&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sentences, the media "tried to raise up Black Metal as a scapegoat for the happenings in Hyvinkää". Demonos Sova of [[Barathrum]] "tried his very best not to involve Black Metal and Satanism with the murder" and called the murderers "some nutcases", whereas the ''I Return to Darkness'' [[fanzine]] "fully supports the murder of Hyvinkää and would like to hail in honour all those who participated in it". An article printed by the Norwegian ''[[Slayer (fanzine)|Slayer]]'' fanzine stated that "[i]t's amazing how Satanists are always so full of strength and never forget to remind us that the week must be weeded out.,&lt;!-- Don't edit that, there is really a full stop followed by a comma in the original text. --&gt; yet when someone does actually weed out some weak hypocrite - they are the first to mourn in public to save their precious Satanism from the terrible Devil Worshippers who ruin the whole name and essence of [[Satan]] which actions that, of course, don't have anything to do with 'real' Satanism", and told Sova to "[f]uck off and die". The article also questions why some people within the scene were "so fucking protective concerning Black Metal's 'good reputation'" although "Black Metal was the only form of 'music' where the music itself doesn't come as the first priority", whereas musicians now would seem to "care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon".&lt;ref name=worshiphim/&gt; In ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries'', the fanzine's author [[Metalion]] stated that it was a "stupid article" and people gave him "lots of shit for printing the article, especially because the point of view tended to support the attackers".&lt;ref name=metalion/&gt;

In an interview given in 2000, Tervashonka explained that the case was not murder in her opinion. She said that a totally drunken group had tied and silenced their member who had become noisy by using a duct tape without understanding that he would die of suffocation as a consequence. After they found that the person was dead they had cut the corpse (while still being totally drunken) and also afterwards for the purpose of hiding it. Tervashonka denied that the case had been related to devil worshiping.&lt;ref&gt;Alibi magazine, issue 8 of year 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Helsinki]] [[Hovrätt|Court of Appeal]] granted Elg a parole in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1419302353481|title=Hyvinkään paloittelusurmaaja pääsee ehdonalaiseen|date=2014-12-23|publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|language=Finnish|accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judaism|culture}}

'''Jewish education''' ({{lang-he-n|חינוך}}, ''Chinukh'') is the transmission of the tenets, principles and religious laws of [[Judaism]]. Known as "People of the Book", Jews value education. The emphasis and value of education is strongly embedded in Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/183260/a-jewish-fight-for-public-education/?p=all |title=A Jewish Fight for Public Education |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/jewishamericans/jewish_life/education_and_philanthropy.html |title=The Jewish Americans |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism places a heavy emphasis on [[Torah study]]. Throughout Jewish history, the tradition of Jewish education began with the Old Testament during biblical times. The bible describes the purpose of Jewish education. The main purpose in the bible is to know how to worship God. Therefore, Jewish parents needed to teach their children about some basic prayers and what the Torah forbids at their young ages. Parents should have transmitted Jewish morals, faith, and values to their children. The bible’s teachings have important impact on Jewish education. Because of this, Jewish education is rooted in the Torah. Nathan H. Winter wrote, “Torah has also been described as that dealing with the whole existence of the human being; that which touches life at every point. Torah also connotes learning, instruction, and guidance. Jewish education was concerned with the transmission of this cultural heritage to the individual Jew.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Education in a Pluralist Society: Samson Benderly and Jewish Education in the United States|last=Nathan H. Winter|first=|publisher=New York University Press|date=January 1, 1966|isbn=978-0814704486|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jewish education has been valued since the birth of [[Judaism]]. [[Abraham]] is lauded for instructing his offspring in [[God|God's]] ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm|title=Bible|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Genesis 18:19|quote=For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the basic duties of Jewish parents is to provide for the instruction of their children as set forth in the first paragraph of the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer: “Take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day. Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and your gates” (Deut. 6:6-9). Additionally, children are advised to seek the instruction of their parents: "Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee" (Deut. 32:7). The [[Book of Proverbs]] also contains many verses related to education: “My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your mind retain my commandments; For they will bestow on you length of days, years of life and well-being“ (Prov. 3:1-2).

Elementary school learning was regarded as compulsory by [[Simeon ben Shetah]] as early as 75 BCE and [[Joshua ben Gamla]] in 64 CE. The education of older boys and men in a [[beit midrash]] goes back to the [[Second Temple]] period. The importance of education is stressed in the [[Talmud]], which states that children should begin school at six. The rabbis stated that they should not be beaten with a stick or cane, that older students should help those who were younger, and that children should not be kept from their lessons by other duties. 

According to Judah ben Tema, “At five years the age is reached for studying [[Tanakh|Mikra]], at ten for studying the Mishnah, at thirteen for fulfilling the mitzvoth, at fifteen for studying Talmud” (Avot 5:21). Mikra refers to the [[Tanakh|written Torah]], Mishnah refers to the complementary [[oral Torah]] (the concise and precise laws dictating how the written Torah's commandments are achieved) and Talmud refers to comprehension of the oral and written law's unity and contemplation of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mishne Torah|last=Moses ben Maimon|first=Maimonides|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Laws of Torah Study 1:13|location=|pages=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Talmud" used here is a method of study and is not to be confused by the [[Talmud|later compilations]] by the same name. In keeping with this tradition, Jews established their own schools or hired private tutors for their children until the end of the 18th century. Schools were housed in annexes or separate buildings close to the synagogue.

[[Rabbi]] [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] (in his Meshech Chochma) observes that God's statement "[Abraham is blessed because] he will instruct his children and his house after him to follow in God's ways to perform righteousness and justice" (Genesis 18:19) is an implicit ''mitzvah'' to teach Judaism.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

== Formal Jewish education ==

=== Sex segregation ===
[[Sex segregation]] in education has traditionally been the norm. As of 2012, education in the Haredi community was strictly segregated by sex. The education for boys was primarily focused on the study of Jewish scriptures, such as the [[Tanakh|Torah]] and [[Talmud]], while girls obtained studies both in Jewish education as well as broader secular subjects.

=== Primary schooling ===
The Talmud (Tractate Bava Bathra 21a) attributes the institution of formal Jewish education to the first century sage [[Joshua ben Gamla]]. Prior to this, parents taught their children informally. Ben Gamla instituted schools in every town and made education compulsory from the age of 6 or 7. The Talmud attaches great importance to the "''Tinokot shel beth Rabban''" (the children [who study] at the Rabbi's house), stating that the world continues to exist for their learning and that even for the rebuilding of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, classes are not to be interrupted (Tractate Shabbat 119b).

=== The yeshiva ===
In [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] and Talmudic times young men were attached to a ''[[beth din]]'' (court of Jewish law), where they sat in three rows and progressed as their fellow students were elevated to sit on the court.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

After the formal court system was abolished, ''[[Yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' became the main places for Torah study. The Talmud itself was composed largely in the ''yeshivot'' of [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]] in [[Babylonia]], and the leading sages of the generation taught there. Yeshivot have remained of central importance in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] community to this day. Until the 19th century, young men generally studied under the local [[rabbi]], who was allocated funds by the Jewish community to maintain a number of students. The [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] masters and the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]] both founded centralised ''yeshivot''.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

In the 21st century, critics in both the United States and Israel, such as [[Naftuli Moster]], have protested that some yeshivas are teaching religious studies to the exclusion of secular subjects such as mathematics and science. They are promoting the adoption of national or state standards on secular subjects by the yeshivas.Israel's Ministry of Education’s statistics from 2014 show that only about 22 percent of Haredi students take matriculation exams, since Orthodox yeshivot mostly ignore core subjects. About 8 percent of Haredi students pass the exam. [[Miriam Ben-Peretz]], professor emeritus of education at the [[University of Haifa]], and winner of the 2006 [[Israel Prize]] notes: “More and more Israeli students don’t have any foundation of knowledge, any basics — not in math, not in English, not in general...things have to change."Some Israelis who have been educated in Haredi yeshivas have established Leaving for Change (LFC), an organization seeking to sue the government for alleged failure to enforce Israel's law for compulsory education.

=== Jewish schools ===
Cheder in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]], 1912

The phenomenon of the "Jewish Day School" is of relatively common origin. Until the 19th and 20th century, boys attended the [[Cheder]] (literally "room," since it was in the synagogue, which historically was a building with a [[Bet Midrash]] being the only room) or [[Talmud Torah]] where they were taught by a ''[[Melamed]] tinokos' (children's teacher).''

The first Jewish day schools developed in [[Germany]], largely in response to the higher emphasis in general on secular studies. In the past, an apprenticeship was sufficient to learn a profession, or alternatively several years in a ''gymnasium'' could prepare one adequately for [[university]]. Rabbis who pioneered Jewish day schools included [[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimson Raphael Hirsch]], whose ''Realschule'' in [[Frankfurt am Main]] served as a model for numerous similar institutions. Jews have also been disproportionately engaged in the building of academic institutions of education and in promoting teaching as a professional career. Three of the past four presidents of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] have been Jews: starting with [[Albert Shanker]], her successor [[Sandra Feldman]], all the way to current AFT president, [[Randi Weingarten]].

Today, there are over 750 day schools in the United States and 205,000 students in those schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.theicenter.org/sites/default/files/knowledge_base/Recent_Trends_in_Supplementary_Jewish_Education.pdf|title=Recent Trends in Supplementary Jewish Education|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|publisher=The AVI CHAI Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond those students, hundreds of thousands (~250,000) of Jewish children attend supplementary religious, Hebrew, and congregational schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Girls' education ===
It was also in the 19th and early 20th century, with the advent of public education for all, that an emphasis was first placed on [[girls' education]]. Before this, particularly in Eastern Europe, girls received their Jewish and Hebrew education at home, and were often illiterate in Hebrew. In the 19th century, public education was made compulsory in most of Europe, and in order to maintain educational control over the Jewish children, Jewish schools became a reality. It was as a result of the initiative of [[Sarah Schenirer]], that the first Jewish girls' [[Bais Yaakov]] school opened in [[Kraków]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.553831|title=The ultra-Orthodox Seamstress Who Determined the Fate of Jewish Women|last=Chizhik-Goldschmidt|first=Avital|date=October 22, 2013|work=Haaretz|access-date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls in the United States at this time were often educated at public schools together with boys, and they received their Jewish education through programs at synagogues and Sunday schools, because Jewish day schools were less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4xFlPXSdAAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Libbie+Suchoff+Berkson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VUF0z27Vkp&amp;sig=ecv3WHjNouILtAW379PeYMVjztE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLibTutsDSAhWo34MKHSs2DN4Q6AEINDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20understood%20that%20Jewish%20day%20schools%20were%20not%20an%20option&amp;f=false|title=The Women Who Reconstructed American Jewish Education, 1910-1965|last=Ingall|first=Carol|last2=|publisher=University Press of New England|year=2010|isbn=9781584658559|location=|pages=7|quote="They understood that Jewish day schools were not an option, being more appropriate for the Old World and the ghetto.

In the Jewish society, women were not allowed to participate in most synagogue prayer, and they only allowed to engage in communal prayer. During the nineteenth century, women could only read Yiddish. Parents should have sent their sons to the primary school, so that their sons could have learned the Hebrew language and the Torah text. Some wealthier parents even employed private tutors for their sons at home. However, some girls in the wealth family may be given the opportunity to learn Jewish vernacular and Hebrew as well. Many girls remained illiterate during the old times. Women stayed home with their family or worked jobs such as maids and seamstresses. After the World War II began, more and more women were used as spies, couriers, nurses, and some even became soldiers. Until the end of World War II, women had transformed into Jewish studies research and teaching in the twenty-first century. The balance of women and men made great strides in equality in Jewish schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Jewish Education|last=Miller Helena Grant D.

== Informal Jewish education ==

=== Youth groups ===
Recent&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Chronological items|when?]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; studies estimate a population of 650,000 Jewish middle and high school students.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Link rot|dead link]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Most of these attend Jewish youth groups or participate in activities funded by Jewish youth organizations [[List of Jewish youth organizations|Jewish youth organizations]]. Many of these are [[Zionist youth movement]]s. The various organizations differ in political ideology, [[Jewish denominations|religious affiliation]], and leadership structure, although they all tend to be characterized by a focus on youth [[leadership]].

The Conservative movement has USY - [[United Synagogue Youth]]. The Modern Orthodox movement has [[NCSY|NCSY - formerly National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]. [[BBYO]] is a non-denominational group, though most Jews associate it with the Conservative or Reform movements. The [[North American Federation of Temple Youth]], known as NFTY, is the organized youth movement of Reform Judaism in North America. Funded and supported by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], NFTY exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members.

=== Summer camps ===
Jewish summer camps are a tool for creating ties with a particular denomination of Judaism and/or orientation to Israel. Camps are sponsored by the Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform movement, by Jewish community centers, and by Zionist movements such as [[Young Judaea]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]] and [[B'nei Akiva]]. Over 70,000 campers participate in over 150 non-profit Jewish [[summer camp]]s, especially in the [[United States]]. In addition, the [[Foundation for Jewish Camp]] estimates that these camps are staffed by over 8,500 Jewish college-aged counselors. American-style Jewish summer camps can also be found in other countries, such as [[Camp Kimama]] in [[Israel]]. Outside the United States, similar camps are generally organized by various philanthropic organizations and local Jewish youth movements. 

The [[Camp Ramah]] network, affiliated with [[Conservative Judaism]] runs camps in North America where youngsters experience traditional ''[[Shabbat]]'' observance, study [[Hebrew]] and observe the laws of [[kashrut]].

The [[Union for Reform Judaism]] runs the largest Jewish camping system in the world, the URJ Camp &amp; Israel Programs. They operate 13 summer camps across North America, including a sports specialty camp, teen leadership institute and programs for youth with special needs, as well as a number of Israel travel programs. Participants in these programs observe ''[[Shabbat]]'', engage in programming about Jewish values and history, and partake in typical summer camp activities including athletics, creative arts and color war.

=== Student organizations ===
Much informal Jewish education is organized on university campuses. This is often supported by national organizations, such as [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] (United States) or the [[UJS|Union of Jewish Students]] (United Kingdom), or by international organizations such as the [[WUJS|World Union of Jewish Students]] and the [[European Union of Jewish Students]].

The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] in partnership with The [[Chabad on Campus International Foundation]], manages the Sinai Scholars Society, an integrated fellowship program for college campus students comprising Torah study, social activities, and national networking opportunities.

|}

=== Drama-based education ===
One of the earliest examples of drama-based Jewish education is the theatrical works of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzatto ([[Ramchal]] 1707-1746, b. Italy), who wrote plays with multiple characters on Jewish themes. While the use of such plays was probably rare in traditional Jewish education, the Etz Chaim school of Jerusalem reportedly staged plays in the 1930s. One such play put [[King David]]'s general [[Joab]] on trial for his various crimes. The students and faculty played the roles of judge, advocates and a jury, all based on extensive Biblical and Talmudic research.

In more recent times, drama is being further developed as an educational tool [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/education/krug-1.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. For example, Detroit, MI has an ensemble theater devoted to education and outreach.[http://www.thisisfederation.org/alliance/trg/jet.asp &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. Programs such as Jewish Crossroads by Shlomo Horwitz provide educational theater in schools and synagogues in various English-speaking countries [http://jewishcrossroads.org/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[5]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. The Lookstein Center at Bar Ilan, a think tank geared to Jewish educators in the Diaspora, lists many drama-related programs on their website for use of teachers in the classroom [http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/lookstein?q=drama&amp;sa.x=14&amp;sa.y=13 &lt;nowiki&gt;[6]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

=== Sports-based education ===
Sports is another vehicle to connect Jewish youth to Judaism and Israel. Bring It In - Israel offers a sports volunteering program in Israel that cultivates a cadre of young leaders who return to their communities to promote interest in Israel and Judaism. The perceived role of sports as a historical avenue was crucial for Jewish people to overcome social, religious and cultural obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially in Europe and the United States).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3963">'''Yarchei Kallah''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''ירחי כלה''') is the name of a teachers' convention that was held twice a year in [[Jews of Babylonia|Babylonian]] Academies, by the Jews then in captivity in Babylon, after the beginning of the [[amoraic]] period, in the two months [[Adar]] and [[Elul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=60&amp;letter=K&amp;search=kallah |title=KALLAH |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For each year's convention of the Kallah, a treatise of the [[Mishnah]] was written forming the subject of explanation and discussion at the convention, according to [[Ta'anit]] 10b (see [[R. Hananeel]] in Kohut, l.c. iv. 227b). {{Harvtxt|Rabbinowitz|1965}} cites opinions attributing authorship to either [[Jehudai Gaon]] (8th century) or to [[Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]] (c.100 CE) with later additions and redaction.

The regular Kallah conventions concerned issues related to marriage, chastity, and moral purity.  The subject matter was largely taken from the [[Babylonian Talmud]].

In the [[land of Israel]] there was no Kallah.  A. Schwarz (''Jahrbuch für Jüdische Gesch. und Litteratur,'' 1899, ii. 102) claims that this cannot be asserted with certainty, but available historical records show that the Kallah was purely an institution practiced in the [[Babylone]]'s [[diaspora]].

== Origins of Yarchei Kallah==

The Mishnaic Hebrew word Yarchei (sing. Yareiach) means "months." The word literally is translated as "moons." The source for this common Mishnaic term is the fact that Jewish months are based on the lunar cycle. (Note that there is a similar relationship between the English words ''moon'' and ''month''.)

The word Kallah is always written with ה as in כלה, the Hebrew word for "bride"; but the manner in which this meaning has been connected with a convention of teachers (Levy, ''Neuhebr. Wörterbuch,'' ii. 321) has not been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps the word is merely another form of the Aramaic כללא = "totality," although this word never occurs in traditional literature as a designation for a collection or assembly of people. It may be connected also with the Aramaic כלילא = "garland," the assembly of teachers being thought of as a garland adorning the academy (comp. "Ḥazi ha-Goren" and "Kerem" as designations of the circle which the Sanhedrin formed). In [[Latin language|Latin]], also, "corona" means "circle," "assembly." Kohut (''Aruch Completum,'' iv. 428a) has a similar explanation, although he adds an incorrect comparison with a [[Persian language|Persian]] word.

The importance of the Kallah Convention (referred to under another name) is extolled in the [[Midrash Tanḥuma]] ([[Noach (parsha)|Noaḥ]], § 3): "God has appointed the two academies ["[[yeshibot]]"] for the good of Israel. In them day and night are devoted to the study of the [[Torah]]; and thither come the scholars from all places twice a year, in [[Adar]] and [[Elul]], and associate with one another in discussions on the Torah." The greater the attendance at the convention, the greater was the renown of the academy. Hence [[Abaye]] says ([[Berakhot (Talmud)|Ber.]] 6b): "The most important part of the Kallah is a crowd." There was a saying in [[Babylonia]] that whoever dreamed of going into a forest would become president of the Kallah (the Kallah being likened to a forest).

'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.

Their main project was the creation of ''Lumonics'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/asu0053/id/54074/rec/3|title='Lumonics' A Completely New Art Form|last=Robbins|first=Dave|date=18 September 1970|work=The Miami Hurricane Student Newspaper of the University of Miami|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=18 September 1970|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of their light sculptures, live projection, video, electronics and music as a total [[Installation art|art installation]].  Author and art historian, [[Michael Betancourt]] described this conceptual art as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] in his book, ''The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel &amp; Dorothy Tanner,'' published in 2004''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel and Dorothy Tanner|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|publisher=Wildside Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8095-1193-2|location=Maryland, United States|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education  ==
Dorothy Tanner studied [[Wood carving|woodcarving]] with [[Chaim Gross]] at the [[The Educational Alliance|Educational Alliance]], [[sculpture]] with [https://americanart.si.edu/artist/aaron-j-goodelman-1865 Aaron Goodleman] at the [[Jefferson School of Social Science]],  [[Figure drawing|life drawing]] with [[Gabor Peterdi]] and sculpture with [[Milton Hebald]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum Art School|Brooklyn Museum School of Art]]. She met Mel Tanner  while they were both students at the Brooklyn Museum School, and married in 1951. 

Mel Tanner was a [[World War II]] veteran and attended art school under the [[G.I. Bill|Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]], better known as the [[G.I. Bill]]. He first attended [[Pratt Institute]] and then the Brooklyn Museum School, studying painting with instructors including [[Max Beckmann]], [[John Ferren]], and [[Reuben Tam]]. When Dorothy first visited Mel Tanner's basement studio in Brooklyn in 1950, he painted in a [[pointillist]] style, using a palette knife rather than a brush, and mixing paint with beeswax to give the paintings texture and dimensionality. He later painted on raw [[canvas]], creating big loose shapes in the [[action painting]] style.

== Career in art (1951-1969) ==
The Tanners moved to Syracuse, New York in 1951 and founded the Syracuse Art Workshop where Dorothy taught sculpture and Mel taught painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Blow Torch her 'Brush'|last=Keegan|first=Alice F.|date=27 August 1961|work=The Post-Standard|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They taught art to children in a summer program at [[Syracuse University]]. The residence in Syracuse had a [[carriage house]] in the rear where Dorothy set up her studio, working with materials including [[wood]], [[clay]], [[plaster]], and [[polyester]], and the high ceilings enabled her to build large [[metal]] sculptures. She exhibited her new metal sculptures in a solo show at the Key Gallery in New York City in 1962, and Mel Tanner exhibited his new paintings which combined [[calligraphy]] and geometric shapes at Key that same year. Their exhibitions stimulated them to return to Manhattan.
Decades later, Ms.Tanner reflected on her view of the New York art of the early 1960s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The art scene in New York was in turmoil. [[Abstract expressionism]] was in the late days of its heyday. [[Op art|Op]] and [[pop art]] were coming up strong, and [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimalism]] was just around the corner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lumonics Theatre: The Art of Mel and Dorothy Tanner|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|publisher=Wildside Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8095-1193-2|location=Maryland, United States|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1963, the Tanners returned to New York City, where they founded Granite Gallery, an [[artist cooperative]]. They formed the Granite Art Association, which organized seminars, forums, and exhibitions, including ''The New Face in Art'' ''Forum'' ''and Exhibition'' in 1964 which took place at the Loeb Student Center at New York University.&lt;ref name="NYUa"&gt;{{cite web | title=WSP10.gif | website=NYU | url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/bobst/washsq/tour/tour_blg/large/WSP10.html | access-date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included artists [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Red Grooms]], Norman Carton, and art critic Gordon Brown.&lt;ref name="Akston Brown 1971"&gt;{{cite book | last=Akston | first=J.J. | last2=Brown | first2=G. | title=Beginning of the beginning: an unfolding story of how nature and life evolved on our planet | publisher=H.

The Tanners returned to the U.S. in 1966, and on their way to San Francisco, they stopped in Miami to visit family members. Weary of traveling, they opened an art studio that they named Grove Studio. This was the same time period as the [[Light and Space]] movement in Los Angeles that included [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin,]] [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], and [[James Turrell]], who were experimenting with light as an art form. The Light and Space movement had affiliation with art schools and industry, whereas the Tanners were very isolated from the art world in Miami at that time. Yet it provided them with freedom to develop their art form. 

Their new medium became [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]], an industrial material that they first began to use in sculptures when living in New York and that were commissioned by corporations including [[Air Products &amp; Chemicals|Air Products and Chemicals Inc]]., [[Raytheon|Raytheon Corporation]], and [[General Electric]] in 1963 and 1964.

Intrigued by acrylic's light transmitting qualities and color, the Tanners made cubes and pedestals that were internally lighted at their studio in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Let There Be Light|last=Murphy|first=Kay|date=26 May 1968|work=Tropic Magazine, Miami Herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first exhibition of the new work was at Hi-Fi Associates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Decor You Can Get With|last=Von Maurer|first=Bill|date=23 May 1969|work=Miami News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Miami in the spring of 1969 when high-end [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] components were being introduced to the public. The announcement referred to it as a "new direction in sound, new directions in environment, and a new direction in art."&lt;ref&gt;Brochure printed by Hi-Fi Associates: "a new direction in sound, new directions in environment, a new direction in art"  20 March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lumonics (1969-present) ==
The light sculptures became their main focus and collaboration. In 1969, they converted the studio into a theater, and acquired the technology (a [[color organ]]) that made it possible to synchronize the light sculptures with music. [[Slide projector]]s using their hand-painted slides, [[overhead projector]]s, [[strobe light]]s, and the color organ were their new artistic toolbox. Blow-up furniture, [[Waterbed|water beds]], [[mylar]] (a reflective material) on the walls, and the [[Light art|light sculptures]] created a powerful setting. [[Lumia art]] was part of the projection as well as an element in several of the light sculptures. The three main elements of lumia, defined by light art pioneer, [[Thomas Wilfred]] (1889–1968), are [[Lumia art|"form, color, and motion in a dark space."]] The Tanners were not familiar with the Wilfred art work, yet began their lumia art in the time period when Wilfred died in 1968. Originally called Afterimage, the name ''Lumonics'' was originated by Dave Robbins in his review, ‘''Lumonics’ A Completely New Art Form'' in the September 18, 1970 edition of the University of Miami student newspaper, ''The Hurricane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/asu0053/id/54074/rec/3|title='Lumonics' A Completely New Art Form|last=Robbins|first=Dave|date=18 September 1970|work=The Miami Hurricane Student Newspaper of the University of Miami|access-date=|archive-url=http://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/asu0053/id/54074/rec/3|archive-date=18 September 1970|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4484">The '''normative principle of worship''' is a [[Christian]] [[theology|theological]] principle that teaches that [[Christian worship|worship in the Church]] can include those elements that are not prohibited by [[Scripture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Smith |authorlink=Christian Smith (sociologist) |year=2011 |chapter=God-Honoring Worship |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAdAQm8mhJQC&amp;pg=PA34 |pages=34–6 |title=The Bible Made Impossible: Why Biblicism Is Not a Truly Evangelical Reading of Scripture |publisher=Brazos Press |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-1-58743-303-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normative principle teaches that whatever is not prohibited in Scripture is permitted in worship, as long as it is agreeable to the peace and unity of the Church. In short, there must be agreement with the general practice of the Church and no prohibition in Scripture for whatever is done in worship.

The normative principle is often contrasted with the [[regulative principle of worship]], which teaches that only those practices or elements which are specifically commanded or modelled in Scripture are to be permitted in worship services.

An example of the difference between these two principles of worship (normative and regulative) can be illustrated by the example of announcing notices in church (i.e. news, upcoming events, and other information). The normative principle holds that since such activity is not prohibited in the New Testament, and since announcing notices may well be beneficial for the congregation and their involvement in the activities of the church, then this practice should be permitted. On the other hand, the regulative principle would ban such activity from taking place in the church service, because no example of announcing notices at the church gathering can be found in the New Testament.

Historically, the definition of the normative principle concerned replicating scriptural patterns, i.e. norms.  Dr. Peter Masters of the [[Metropolitan Tabernacle]] wrote an article on this subject [http://www.reformedbaptist.co.uk/Normative.htm] and explained that the historic distinction is different to the one above.  Historically, regulative meant simply obeying direct instructions, whereas normative meant not just the requirements of the regulative principle, but also replicating patterns established by the scriptures.  One example of this concerns [[congregationalist polity]] in respect of church government: - proponents of this polity point to the biblical norm of churches being individually autonomous.

'''Operation Sundown''' was codename of a covert plan of India's secret service [[Research &amp; Analysis Wing]] (RAW), in which Special Group of RAW's armed units was to abduct Sikh extrimist leader [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] from Guru Nanak Niwas in the [[Golden Temple]] complex, [[Amritsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unnithan|first=Sandeep|title=Indira Gandhi considered secret commando raid before Operation Bluestar|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indira-gandhi-commando-raid-operation-bluestar-indian-army-golden-temple-jarnail-singh-bhindranwale-raw-officials/1/341065.html|publisher=India Today|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A RAW unit was formed to rehearse Operation Sundown in the [[Sarsawa Air Force Base]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]].

The rehearsals for the operation were carried out in the base. But, the operation was never started due to the then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]]’s rejection. She did not wanted to hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs by carrying out the operation. In addition there was a risk of numerous casualties as a [[collateral damage]] of the operation. Golden Temple was one of the highly respected and most visited sites in Punjab. Civilian deaths within such a sacred place was unavoidable. Gandhi denied the approval to initiate Operation Sundown.&lt;ref name="gill2017punjab"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gill |first1=K.P.S. and Khosla, S |title=Punjab: The Enemies Within : Travails of a Wounded Land Riddled with Toxins |date=2017 |publisher=Bookwise (India) Pvt.

Other options such as negotiations were opted for instead. The negotiations failed and the law and order situation in Punjab continued to deteriorate. In April 1984, [[A.S.

Operation Sundown was revealed almost after three decades in January 2014 by [[India Today]] Magazine through investigation of UK's declassified Top Secret documents.

'''Paolo Ferrari''' (1822&amp;ndash;1889), [[Italy|Italian]] dramatist, was born at [[Modena]]. His numerous works, chiefly comedies, and all marked by a fresh and piquant style, are the finest product of the modern Italian drama. After producing some minor pieces, in 1852 he made his reputation as a playwright with ''Goldoni e le sue Sedici Commedie''. Among numerous later plays his comedy ''Parini e la Satira'' (1857) had considerable success. Ferrari may be regarded as a follower of [[Carlo Goldoni]], modelling himself on the French theatrical methods. in 1860 he was appointed professor of History at Modena and afterwards at Milan. His collected plays were published in 1877&amp;ndash;1880 in 14 volumes.

Despite its small size, the population of [[Jersey]] is made of people with a diverse range of religions and beliefs. Traditionally seen as a [[Christianity|Christian]] island, Jersey's [[State religion|established church]] is the [[Church of England]], and Anglicanism and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] are practised on the island in roughly equal numbers. Together, these religions account for around half the population of Jersey. Other denominations of Christianity and other religions such as Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, and Buddhism account for handfuls of people on the island. In recent years, [[irreligion]] has been an increasing force in Jersey, with two fifths of the population identifying as having no religion. This number rises to 52% for Jersey people under 35.&lt;ref name=JASS15/&gt;

== History ==

=== Before Christianity ===
[[Image:La Hougue Bie entrance and chapel, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Restored entrance to the Neolithic tomb (with a mediaeval chapel on the mound) at La Hougue Bie.]]
In the [[Neolithic]] period religious activity in the settled communities is marked by the building of ritual burial sites known as [[dolmen]]s, from which food and personal items such as [[Jewellery|jewelry]], [[spindle whorl]]s, [[pottery]], tools and animal bones have been excavated at La Hougue Bie (a ritual site used around 3500 [[Anno Domini|BC]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseyheritagetrust.org/collections/faith/neo.html Faith - Neolithic], [[Jersey Heritage Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These finds indicate that Neolithic settlers possibly believed in an [[afterlife]] much like many modern religions, the burial of the dead with their belongings showing similarities to the burial process in the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian religion]].  However recent excavations at [[La Hougue Bie]] by archaeologist Mark Patton, together with consideration of solar alignments, suggest that the [[Jersey Dolmens]] functioned more as centres of worship like cathedrals or churches, where burials are incidental to the main function.

=== Christianity ===

==== Celtic Christianity ====

There is some evidence from parish names of Celtic missions to the islands, notably Saint [[Brelade]] in Jersey and Saint Samson in Guernsey. Apart from place names and one note in the Life of Samson no documentary evidence is available.

====Pre-Reformation Church====
[[Image:Hermitage St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|The Hermitage of [[Saint Helier]] lies in the bay off Saint Helier, Jersey and is accessible on foot at low tide.]]
Sometime between 535 and 545, [[Helier]], who was to become Jersey's [[patron saint]], went to the island bringing the [[gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/geraint/helier/ Saint Helier - Saint Hélyi - Saint Hélier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311231037/http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/geraint/helier/ |date=March 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The island of Jersey remained part of the Duchy of [[Normandy]] until 1204 when King [[Philip II Augustus]] of [[France]] conquered the duchy from King [[John of England]]. The islands remained in the personal possession of the king and were described as being a Peculiar of the Crown. However, the island continued to be part of the Norman [[diocese of Coutances]] and was reluctant to come under the wing of the English church because it had many cultural ties with Normandy.

The island embraced the French Calvinist form of [[Protestantism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and orders were received to remove all signs of the Papal Church in 1547.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/deanmabon.htm The Image at Hougue Bie: Catholic Deceit or Protestant Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 and 1551 church property was sold for the benefit of the crown. The island remained under the diocese of Coutances until 1569.

====Catholic Church====
{{main|Catholic Church in Jersey}}
There were several waves of Catholic immigration, notably in the 1790s during the [[French Revolution]], in the 1830s and 1840s with the influx of Irish labourers and towards the end of the 19th century with the settlement of Catholic [[religious institute]]s.{{clear left}}

====Protestantism====
[[Image:Common Prayer French language Liturgie.jpg|thumb|The [[Book of Common Prayer]] was translated into [[French language|French]] by Jerseyman Jean Durel, later Dean of Windsor, and published for use in the Channel Islands in 1663 as Anglicanism was established as the state religion after the Stuart Restoration.]]

=====French Calvinism=====

Islanders embraced Calvinism during the Reformation, especially under the influence of French language pamphlets and books from [[Geneva]], [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]].

The reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and [[Philip II of Spain#King of England and Ireland|King Philip]] was especially significant. Important Protestant religious leaders in Jersey and Guernsey fled to [[Geneva]], and when they returned after Mary's death, they had taken on much of the severe form of Calvinism formulated there by Calvin, and set up [[Consistory Court]]s. Another factor was a reaction against the burning of heretics in the islands. In neighbouring Guernsey, Foxe records the remarkable death of the Protestant Perotine Massey, one of the [[Guernsey Martyrs]], who gave birth while being [[burnt at the stake]]. Her newborn child was returned to the flames by the Catholic Bailiff.

There also was a sudden influx from France of [[Huguenot]]s — the name given to French Calvinists — as [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, effectively depriving them of the freedom to practice their religion by brutal methods : (in accordance of catholic hierarchy):prosecutions : prisons, galley slaves, no property rights, "dragonnades"etc, etc  
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseyheritage.org/media/PDFs/Faith_faith.pdf], Jersey Heritage Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of worship was resolutely [[Calvinist]]. [[Queen Elizabeth I]] left Jersey and Guernsey more or less in charge of their own affairs, because of political expedience: Protestant islanders would be in opposition to Catholic France.

===== Church of England =====

Although Jersey was transferred to the [[Diocese of Winchester]] in 1569, it was not until the Governorship of [[John Peyton (soldier)|Sir John Peyton]] in 1603, under [[James I of England|James I]], that the forms of the Anglican church were restored to Jersey.  In 1620 [[David Bandinel]] was appointed the first [[Dean of Jersey]] since the Reformation.  Anglicanism then became and remained the official religion of the island. In 2014 the Diocese changed, after 500 years, to the [[Diocese of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-30726781 |title=Channel Islands and Winchester diocese split details released |publisher=BBC |date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodism=====
[[Image:Methodism plaque Jersey Jean de Quetteville.jpg|thumb|left|Jean de Quetteville (1761-1843), a [[Saint Martin, Jersey|Saint Martinais]], was converted by the first missionary sent to Jersey by John Wesley. This plaque, erected to commemorate the centenary of Methodism in the Channel Islands, describes him as the "apostle of the Channel Islands"]]
In 1774 Pierre Le Sueur and Jean Tentin returned to Jersey from [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and started to preach Methodism to which they had been converted while engaged in the Newfoundland fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseyheritagetrust.org/collections/faith/meth.html Faith - Methodism], Jersey Heritage Trust&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Huguenot]]s were drawn to the ideas of Methodism similar to those of Calvinism.

Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend Militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1787, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]] in 1809.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Chînm'tchiéthe, Mont à l'Abbé, Saint Hélyi, Jèrri, Juîn 2009 12.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish cemetery in [[Saint Helier]].]]
{{Main|History of the Jews in Jersey}}
Jews first established a synagogue in Saint Helier in 1843.

There were only a small number of foreign and British Jews in Jersey before the start of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands]] in the Second World War. Most of the Jewish population of Jersey evacuated to safety in June 1940 to the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom did not permit foreign Nationals, including Jews, to leave for the United Kingdom, leaving them trapped in Jersey. 12 Jews were registered under the laws imposed by the Germans and administered by the Jersey authorities&lt;ref name=Cruickshank&gt;Cruickshank, Charles G. (1975) ''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', The Guernsey Press, {{ISBN|0-902550-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a higher number concealed their Jewish identity or were helped to conceal their identity by resisters in the bureaucracy).&lt;ref name=Saunders /&gt; However, the anti-Jewish repressions were not carried out systematically. Jews of British citizenship were less likely to be persecuted than foreigners.

'''Religious male circumcision''' generally occurs shortly after [[birth]], during childhood or around puberty as part of a [[rite of passage]]. [[Circumcision]] is most prevalent in the religions of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch26/&gt; and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean Orthodox Church]].

Many countries with majorities of Christian adherents have low circumcision rates (as in Europe and South America), while both religious and non-religious circumcision is common in some predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] countries such as the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Mary G.

Male circumcision practised as a religious rite is found in texts of the [[Hebrew Bible]], as part of the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|Abrahamic covenant]], such as in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}}, and is therefore practised by Jews, Muslims, and some Christians, who constitute the [[Abrahamic religions#Circumcision|Abrahamic religions]]. Some rabbinical sources indicate that even before the covenant of Abraham, the [[aposthia]] of [[Shem]] may have been an inspiration for circumcision; although the aposthia of Shem is not specifically mentioned in the Genesis text.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13541-shem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3494220 | pmid=23193511 | volume=41 | title=Aposthia-a motive of circumcision origin | year=2012 | journal=Iran.

According to ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law), ritual circumcision of male children is a commandment from God that Jews are obligated to follow, and is only postponed or abrogated in the case of threat to the life or health of the child.&lt;ref name="GlassJM"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Jews do not believe that non-Jews are obligated to follow this commandment; only the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] apply to non-Jews.

====In the Hebrew Bible====
{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Circumcision of Abraham (Bible of Jean de Sy).jpg|thumb|Abraham circumcises his own penis - Circumcision of Abraham, from the Bible of Jean de Sy, ca. 1355-1357]]
{{see also|Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant}}
There are numerous references to circumcision in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Circumcision was enjoined upon the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], his descendants and their slaves as "a token of the covenant" concluded with him by [[God]] for all generations, an "everlasting covenant" ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:13|HE}}), thus it is commonly observed by two (Judaism and Islam) of the [[Abrahamic religions]].

The penalty of non-observance was ''[[kareth]]'' (Hebrew: "cutting off") from the people ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:10-14|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|21:4|HE}}; {{Bibleverse||Lev|12:3|HE}}). Non-Israelites had to undergo circumcision before they could be allowed to take part in the feast of [[Passover]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Mosaic Law directed at non-Jews]] and [[Conversion to Judaism]].

It was "a reproach" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ({{Bibleverse||Josh|5:9|HE}}) The name ''arelim'' (uncircumcised) became an opprobrious term, especially a pejorative name for the [[Philistines]], who might have been of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, in the context of the fierce wars recounted in the [[Book of Samuel]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|14:6|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Sam|31:4|HE}}). When the general (and future king) [[David]] wanted to marry [[King Saul]]'s daughter, the King required a grisly "[[dowry]]" of a hundred Philistine [[foreskins]]. David went further: "and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife".({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|18:25|HE}})

"Uncircumcised" is used in conjunction with ''tame'' (unpure) for heathen ({{Bibleverse||Isa|52:1|HE}}). The word 'arel' (uncircumcised) is also employed for "impermeable" (Lev. 26:41, "their uncircumcised hearts"; compare Jer. 9:25; Ezek. xliv. 7, 9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ({{Bibleverse||Lev|19:23|HE}}). "The Philistines, more than any other nation, are regularly&lt;ref&gt;Judges 14:3, 15:8, Samuel I 14:6, 17:26,36, 31:14, Samuel II 1:20&lt;/ref&gt; called uncircumised"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel I 13:6 commentary, The Rubin Edition, {{ISBN|1-57819-333-8}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after [[the exodus]] from Egypt apparently did not carry out the practice of circumcision. According to {{Bibleverse||Josh|5:2-9|HE}}, "all the people that came out" of Egypt were circumcised, but those "born in the wilderness" were not. In any case, we are told that [[Joshua]], before the celebration of the Passover, had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]].

The Bible contains several narratives in which circumcision is mentioned. There is the circumcision and massacre of the [[Shechem]]ites ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|34:1-35:5|HE}}), the hundred foreskin dowry ({{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:25-27|HE}}) and the story of the Lord threatening to kill Moses, and being placated by Zipporah's circumcision of their son ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:24-26|HE}}), and the circumcision at Gilgal of {{Bibleverse||Joshua|5|HE}}.

There is another sense in which the term "circumcise" is used in the Bible. {{Bibleverse||Deut|10:16|HE}} says: "''Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,''" (also quoted in {{Bibleverse||Jer|4:4}}, [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translates as: "Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts") along with {{Bibleverse||Jer|6:10|HE}}: ''To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: ...'' (New JPS translates: "Their ears are blocked"). {{Bibleverse||Jer|9:25-26|HE}} says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for "all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart." The New JPS translation adds the note: "''uncircumcised of heart'': I.e., their minds are blocked to God's commandments." Non-Jewish tribes that practiced circumcision were described as being "circumcised in uncircumcision."({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|9:24|HE}})

====In rabbinic literature====
During the [[Babylon]]ian exile, [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] and circumcision became the characteristic symbols of the Jewish people. However, the [[Talmud]] orders that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers, from the same mother as him, who have died as a result of their circumcisions;&lt;ref name="JewEncMor"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Morbidity|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=763&amp;letter=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; this may be due to a concern about [[haemophilia]].&lt;ref name="JewEncMor" /&gt;

Contact with Greek polytheistic culture, especially at the games of the arena, made this distinction obnoxious to [[Hellenistic Judaism|Jewish Hellenists]] seeking to [[Hellenization|assimilate into Greek culture]]. The consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; {{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:15|NRSV}}; Josephus, [http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/ant12.html Ant. xii] 5, § 1; [[Assumption of Moses]], viii.; {{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}};, Tosef.; Talmud tractes Shabbat xv. 9; Yevamot 72a, b; Yerushalmi Peah i. 16b; Yevamot viii. 9a). {{Bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}} records that after [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|King Antiochus]] effectively banned traditional Jewish religious practice, including circumcision, the [[Maccabean#The revolt|Maccabean rebels]] "forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel." Circumcision was again banned by Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138 CE). His anti-circumcision law is considered by many to be one of the main causes of the Jewish [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132-135).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Around 140 CE [[Rabbinic Judaism]] made its circumcision requirements stricter.&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1&gt;{{cite book |author=Gollaher D |title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1–30 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02653-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=imcpl1111&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R3&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX2587504318&amp;&amp;docId=GALE | title = Encyclopedia Judaica - Circumcision |year = 2007 |editors= Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik.

Isaac stated in the name of Rab: The commandment of uncovering the corona at circumcision was not given to Abraham; for it is said, At that time the Lord said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint etc.' But is it not possible [that this applied to] those who were not previously circumcised; for it is written, For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born etc.? — If so, why the expression. 'Again!' Consequently it must apply to the uncovering of the corona.&lt;/ref&gt; and without it the [[mitzvah]] isn't performed at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]], Tractate ''Shabbos'', 19:6, and The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] there.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the editors of the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', note that ''periah'' was probably added by the rabbis, in order to "prevent the possibility of obliterating the traces of circumcision".&lt;ref&gt;Werblowsky, R.J. Zwi &amp; Wigoder, Geoffrey (1997) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish law states that circumcision is a ''[[613 commandments|mitzva aseh]]'' ("positive commandment" to perform an act) and is obligatory for Jewish-born males and for non-circumcised Jewish male converts. It is only postponed or abrogated in the case of threat to the life or health of the child.&lt;ref name=GlassJM /&gt; It is usually performed by a ''[[mohel]]'' on the eighth day of life in a ceremony called a ''brit milah'' (or ''bris milah'', colloquially simply ''bris''), which means "Covenant of circumcision" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. According to Jewish law, the foreskin should be buried after a ''brit milah''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'', 265:10.&lt;/ref&gt; The rite is considered of such importance that in Orthodox communities, the body of an uncircumcised Jewish male will sometimes be circumcised before burial.&lt;ref name = "MLamm"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lamm |first1=Maurice|title=The Jewish way in death and mourning |year=2000 |origyear= 1969|publisher= Jonathan David Publishers, Inc.|location=[[Middle Village, Queens|Middle Village]], New York |isbn=0-8246-0423-7 |lccn=99088942 |pages=215–216 |chapter=6: Special Situations |quote=The custom is to circumcise male infants who have not undergone circumcision until then, usually during ''taharah''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 19th century [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] leaders described it as "barbaric", the practice of circumcision "remained a central rite"&lt;ref name="origin-reform"&gt;{{Cite web

The circumcision consists of three procedures, the first being the cutting of the foreskin. The second is the ''priah'', or peeling back of the epithelium after the foreskin has been amputated. According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, in Why Aren't Jewish Women Circumcised?: Gender and Covenant in Judaism, pg 25, the Torah only commands circumcision (milah).&lt;ref name="Cohen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaye J. D.

The book ''Abot De-Rabbi Natan'' (''The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan'') contains a list of persons from the Israelite Scriptures that were born circumcised:
Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, the wicked Balaam, Samuel, David, Jeremiah and Zerubbabel.&lt;ref&gt;The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, Translated from the Hebrew by Judah Goldin, Yale Judaica Series 10, Chapter 2, p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; To be [[Aposthia|born without a foreskin]] was regarded as the privilege of the most saintly of people, from [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], "who was made in the image of God," and [[Moses]] to [[Zerubbabel]] (see Midrash Ab. R. N., ed. Schechter, p.&amp;nbsp;153; and Talmud, Sotah 12a). Uncircumcision being considered a blemish, circumcision was to remove it, and to render Abraham and his descendants "perfect" (Talmud Ned. 31b; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.)

Rabbinic literature holds that one who removes his circumcision has no portion in [[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]] (Mishnah Ab. iii. 17; Midrash Sifre, Num. xv. 31; Talmud Sanhedrin 99).

According to the Midrash Pirke R. El. xxix., it was [[Shem]] who circumcised [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] on the [[Day of Atonement]]; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before God on that day to serve as an atoning power. According to the same midrash, [[Pharaoh]] prevented the Hebrew slaves from performing the rite, but when the [[Passover]] time came and brought them deliverance, they underwent circumcision, and mingled the blood of the paschal lamb with that of the Abrahamic covenant, wherefore (Ezek. xvi. 6) God repeats the words: "In thy blood live!"

====Converts to Judaism====
According to the Hebrew Bible, [[conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites necessitated circumcision ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). In the 1st century CE, there was a controversy between the [[Shammai]]tes and the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]] regarding a convert born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood of the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.

[[Flavius Josephus]] in [[Jewish Antiquities]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214906/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/josephus/ant-20.htm book 20], chapter 2 recorded the story of [[Izates bar Monobaz|King Izates]] of [[Adiabene]] who decided to follow the [[Torah|Law of Moses]] at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision ([[Robert Eisenman]] in ''James the Brother of Jesus'' claims that Ananias is [[Paul the Apostle]] who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.

On the other hand, the emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138) forbade circumcision. His successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161) upheld the decree, but around 140 included an exemption for Jews who circumcised their sons, although not their servants, slaves, or converts.&lt;ref name="Hodges F. M."/&gt; Even before that, in 95 CE, [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Flavius Clemens]], a nephew of the emperors [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]], suffered the penalty of death for undergoing circumcision, and embracing the Jewish faith with his wife Domitilla (see Grätz, "Gesch." iv. 403 et seq., 702).

It can be thus understood why during [[Early Christian]] times there existed groups of [[God-fearers]], who were gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another, but refused to circumcise, and were not recognized as Jews. It is possible that the view of them is echoed in the [[Midrash]]: "If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], they shall not enter the [[Promised Land|land of promise]]" (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.). "The Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised are intruders, and deserve punishment," (Midrash Deut. Rabbah i.)

The uncompromising Jewish stance that the seal of circumcision might not find its substitute in "the seal of [[baptism]]" &amp;mdash; led the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] to urge the latter in opposition to the former ({{Bibleverse||Romans|2:25-29}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Romans|4:11-12}}, and elsewhere), just as he was led to adopt the [[antinomianism|antinomistic]] or [[Anti-Zionism|antinational]] view, which had its exponents in [[Alexandria]].

Currently, the issue of circumcising converts remains controversial in Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism &lt;ref name="Glickman"&gt;{{cite web

====Normative position====
Subject to overriding medical considerations, the circumcision must take place eight days after the birth of the child, even when this falls on ''Shabbat''.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Shabbat. xix. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The child must be medically fit for a circumcision to be performed, and Jewish law prohibits parents having their son circumcised if medical doctors hold that the procedure may unduly threaten the child's health (e.g. because of [[hemophilia]]). If by reason of the child's debility or sickness the ceremony is postponed, it cannot take place on ''Shabbat''.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Shabbat 137a.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the duty of the father to have his child circumcised; and if he fails in this, the [[beth din]] of the city must see that the rite is performed.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Kid. 29a.&lt;/ref&gt; According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a grown free Jewish male expert, a woman, a slave, or a child, that has the required skills, is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she or he is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Avodah Zarah 27a; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, ii. 1; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, 264:1&lt;/ref&gt; However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female [[mohel]]s, called ''mohalot'' ({{lang-he|מוֹהֲלוֹת}}, plural of {{lang|he|מוֹהֶלֶת}} ''mohelet'', feminine of ''mohel''), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131007073323/http://beritmila.org/ Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism] Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

However important it may be, circumcision is not a [[sacrament]], unlike a Christian baptism. Circumcision does not affect a Jew's Jewish status. A Jew by birth is a full Jew, even if not circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Hul. 4b; Avodah Zarah 27a; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, 264, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the punishment for not being circumcised in rabbinic Judaism is believed to be "Karet", being cut off; meaning premature death at the hand of G-d (Mo'ed Katan 28a) and a severe spiritual punishment, the "soul's being cut off," and not being granted a share in the world to come (Hilchot Teshuvah 8:1,5).

===The Intertestamental period===
{{see also|Intertestamental period|Hellenistic Judaism}}

The [[deuterocanonical books]] and [[biblical apocrypha]] reveal the cultural clash between [[Jews]] and [[Greeks]], and between [[Judaizers]] and [[Hellenization|Hellenizers]]. Greeks valued the foreskin, and when they took part in athletic sports, they did it in the nude.&lt;ref name="Hodges F. M."/&gt; They insisted that the [[glans penis|glans]] remained covered, and they did not approve of the Jewish custom of circumcision. The [[Books of the Maccabees]] reveal that some Jewish men chose to undergo ''epispasm'', [[foreskin restoration]] by stretching the residual skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Robert G.|title=Epispasm: Circumcision in Reverse|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/hall1/ |journal=[[Bible Review]]|publisher=[[Biblical Archaeology Society]]|date=August 1992|volume=8|issue=4|pages=52-57|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they could conform to Greek culture and take part in these sports. ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:11-15|NRSV}}). Some also left their sons uncircumcised ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). This relatively peaceful period came to an end when [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] attacked first Egypt and then sacked and looted Jerusalem ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:16-64|NRSV}}). Epiphanes determined to force everyone to [[Hellenization|live the Greek way]] and abandon the [[Judaizing|Jewish way]]. Among other things, he banned circumcision.

Although many were prepared to conform to Greek culture, observant Jews saw circumcision as a mark of Jewish loyalty and many who kept to the [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]] defied the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:48|NRSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|1:60|NRSV}}, and {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons. "For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. They publicly paraded them around the city, with their babies hanging at their breasts, and then hurled them down headlong from the wall ({{Bibleverse|2|Macc|6:10|NRSV}})." At the same time, the Zealots forcibly circumcised the uncircumcised boys within the borders of Israel ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}).

In the upshot, the Jewish Zealots defeated the Greeks and they retained the right to circumcise.

The [[Book of Jubilees]], part of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]][[biblical canon]],  written in the time of [[John Hyrcanus]], reveals the hostility directed against those who abandoned circumcision (xv. 26–27): "Whosoever is uncircumcised belongs to 'the sons of [[Belial]],' to 'the children of doom and eternal perdition'; for all the [[angels of the Presence]] and of the Glorification have been so from the day of their creation, and God's anger will be kindled against the children of the covenant if they make the members of their body appear like those of the [[Gentiles]], and they will be expelled and exterminated from the earth".

According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] saying 53, [[Jesus]] says:
{{quote|His disciples said to him, "is circumcision useful or not?" He said to them, "If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect." SV [https://web.archive.org/web/20070813204310/http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm]}}

Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul's {{Bibleverse||Romans|2:29}}, {{Bibleverse||Philippians|3:3}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}}, {{Bibleverse||Gal|6:15}}, and {{Bibleverse||Col|2:11-12}}.

The ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the article "Gentiles", section "Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah", states:
{{quote|[[Rabbi Emden|R. Emden]], in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to 'Seder 'Olam' (pp. 32b–34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law—which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [laws of Moses and the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 "Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah". ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christianity===
{{See also|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about biblical male circumcision, neither requiring it nor forbidding it.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2018}} [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision was controversial during the period of Early Christianity]] (before 325) and the [[Council of Jerusalem|first Church Council in Jerusalem]] (c.50), which declared that circumcision was not necessary for new [[gentile]] converts (a record of the council is found in {{bibleverse||Acts|15}}). But it is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
* "The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians—two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity—retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since [[Circumcision of Jesus|Jesus was circumcised]] and the Bible teaches the practice."
* "The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{Bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is still practiced by Coptic Christians."

While [[Circumcision of Jesus|Jesus' circumcision]] was recorded as having been performed in accordance with [[Torah]] requirements in {{Bibleverse||Luke|2:21}}, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], chapter 15, the leaders of the Christian Church at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] rejected circumcision as a requirement for [[Gentile]] [[Conversion to Christianity|converts]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|15:1-2|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Acts|15:6-10|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Gal|5:2-3|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Gal|5:6-12|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Gal|6:12-15|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Phil|3:2-3|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|1 Cor|7:17-21|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Rom|2:17-29|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Rom|3:9-28|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse|Rom|5:1-11|RSV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the first act of [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiation of Early Christianity from its Jewish roots]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a 'seal' (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems," 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition."&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[list of events in early Christianity]]). The rite of circumcision was especially execrable in [[Classical civilization]]&lt;ref name="Hodges 2001"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature]: "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved [[nudity]]], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer.

All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons."; {{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2018-02-06| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was the custom to spend an hour a day or so exercising [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male nudity|nude]] in the ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]'' and in [[Thermae|Roman baths]], therefore Jewish men did not want to be seen in public deprived of their foreskins.&lt;ref name="Hodges 2001" /&gt; [[Hellenistic culture|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman culture]] both found circumcision to be cruel and repulsive.&lt;ref name="Hodges 2001" /&gt;

The Apostle Paul , who called himself ''Apostle to the Gentiles'', attacked the practice, but not consistently; for example in one case he personally circumcised [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] "because of the Jews" that were in town (Timothy had a [[Jewish Christian]] mother but a Greek father {{Bibleverse||Acts|16:1–3}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/acts.ch16.html McGarvey on Acts 16]: "Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this 'on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.'"&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared to praise its value in {{Bibleverse||Rom|3:1–2}}, hence the topic of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] is still debated. Paul argued that circumcision no longer meant the physical, but a spiritual practice ({{Bibleverse||Rom|2:25–29}}). And in that sense, he wrote {{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}}: "Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised"—probably a reference to the practice of [[epispasm]].&lt;ref&gt;"making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18;, Tosef.; Talmud tractes Shabbat xv. 9; Yevamot 72a, b; Yerushalmi Peah i. 16b; Yevamot viii. 9a; [http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/rubin/]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Circumcision]: "To this epispastic operation performed on the athletes to conceal the marks of circumcision St. Paul alludes, me epispastho ({{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}})."&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was already circumcised ("on the eighth day", {{Bibleverse||Phil|3:4–5}}) when he was [[Conversion of Paul|"called"]]. He added: "Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised", and went on to argue that circumcision did not matter: "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts" ({{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}}).

Later he more explicitly denounced the practice, rejecting and condemning [[Judaizers|those who promoted circumcision to Gentile Christians]].&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; He accused Galatian Christians who [[Circumcision advocacy|advocated circumcision]] of turning from the Spirit to the flesh.&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; And in {{Bibleverse||Gal|3:3}} says "Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?" He accused circumcision advocates of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh {{Bibleverse||Gal|6:12}} and of glorying or boasting of the flesh {{Bibleverse||Gal|6:13}}.The [[Pauline epistles]] fiercely criticized the Judaizers that [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|demanded circumcision for gentile converts]], and opposed them;&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; he stressed instead that [[Justification (theology)#Paul|faith]] in [[Christ]] constituted a "[[New Covenant]]" with God,&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] which essentially provides a "[[free gift]]" of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] from the harsh edicts of the [[Mosaic Law]] for Gentiles that didn't require circumcision.&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt;

The Catholic Encyclopedia's entry on Judaizers notes: "Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required ({{Bibleverse|1|Cor|9:20}}). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy ({{Bibleverse||Acts|16:1–3}}), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ({{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:26}} sqq.)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Judaizers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Peter]], who for Catholic Christians is the first [[Pope]], condemned circumcision for converts according to {{Bibleverse||Acts|15}}. Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, charged that the advocates of circumcision were "false brothers" ({{Bibleverse||Gal|2:4}}). Some Biblical scholars think that the [[Epistle to Titus]], generally attributed to Paul, may state that circumcision should be discouraged among Christians ({{Bibleverse||Titus|1:10–16}}), although others believe this is merely a reference to Jews. Circumcision was so closely associated with Jewish men that Jewish Christians were referred to as "those of the circumcision" ({{Bibleverse||Col|3:20}}) [http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass1/] or conversely Christians who were circumcised were referred to as Jewish Christians or [[Judaizers]]. These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean [[Jew]]s and [[Greeks]], who were predominate, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century [[Iudaea Province]] also had some Jews who no longer circumcised (see [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), and some Greeks (see [[proselytes]] or [[Judaizers]]) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did.

In the Gospel of {{Bibleverse||John|7:23}} Jesus is reported as giving this response to those who criticized him for healing on the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]: "If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?" This passage has been seen as a comment on the Rabbinic belief that circumcision heals the penis (Jerusalem Bible, note to {{Bibleverse||John|7:23}}) or as a criticism of circumcision. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass1/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek Orthodox Church celebrates the [[Circumcision of Christ]] on 1 January,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/calendar.asp?Y=2007&amp;M=1 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese calendar of Holy Days] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213044716/http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/calendar.asp?Y=2007&amp;M=1 |date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Orthodox churches following the [[Julian calendar]] celebrate it on 14 January. All Orthodox churches consider it a "Great Feast".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/los/January/01-01.htm Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarchate of Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; In much of [[Western Christianity]], the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]] has been replaced by other commemorations,&lt;ref&gt;For example, "The Calendar of the Church Year" in The (Online) Book of Common Prayer (Episcopal Church in the United States of America), http://www.bcponline.org/ retrieved 11 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

There are strands of study and research (see P Whelan,&lt;ref&gt;Whelan. Male dyspareunia due to short frenulum: an indication for adult circumcision. ''BMJ'' 1977; 24-31: 1633-4&lt;/ref&gt; F Grewel &lt;ref&gt;F Grewel – The Frenum Praeputti and Defloration of the Human Male – Folia Psychiatrica, Neurologica et Neurochirurgica Neerlandica 61(2) p 123-126 1958&lt;/ref&gt; and E Douglas&lt;ref name="Douglas E"&gt;{{cite web |author=Douglas E |title=JQuad |url=http://jquad.org/edvard-munchs-the-scream/}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which show that certain foreskin conditions ([[paraphimosis]] and [[frenulum breve]]) when left unacknowledged, and therefore untreated, cause psychosexual problems - especially when mixed with courtship and other individual and environmental factors from childhood - wracking with self-doubt, and leading ultimately to psychosis. Once having successfully overcome the condition(s), however, the effect of the traumas can recur on the birth of a son, and later. This is a dangerous situation and liable to cause much confusion and disturbance, or worse, and provides an explanation of the story of Abraham, covenant of circumcision and the binding of Isaac, i.e. psychosis and foreskin management intention and, ultimately, the saving nature of faith. The conclusions in Acts 15, when logically interpreted (see E Douglas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Douglas E |title=JQuad |url=http://jquad.org/acts-15-discussion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), raises understanding of these adverse anatomical conditions: paraphimosis (symptom: strangling the head of the penis); and slender frenulum breve (symptom: blood from rupture of frenulum blood vessels), and advises avoidance of them. It raises awareness of the issues but carefully refrains from being prescriptive as to the means of management. This allows room for modern methods of management, e.g. frenuloplasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dockray J, Finlayson A, Muir GH |title=Penile frenuloplasty: a simple and effective treatment for frenular pain or scarring |journal=BJU International |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=1546–50 |date=May 2012  |pmid=22176714 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10678.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.&lt;ref name="Douglas E"/&gt;

==== Catholic Church ====
Historically, the [[Catholic Church]] denounced religious circumcision for its members in the ''Cantate Domino'', written during the 11th [[Council of Florence]] in 1442.&lt;ref name = "CoF"&gt;{{cite book| last = Eugenius IV| first = Pope| authorlink = Pope Eugene IV| editor = Norman P.

Whoever, after the Passion, places his hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself to them as necessary for salvation and as if faith in Christ without them could not save, sins mortally.

But it asserts that after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be observed without loss of eternal salvation. Therefore it denounces all who after that time observe circumcision, the [Jewish] sabbath and other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these errors.

Some Catholic scholars, such as Fr. John J. Dietzen, a retired priest and columnist, have argued that [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629225324/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/fifth.html#PERSONS paragraph number 2297 from the Catholic Catechism (Respect for bodily integrity)] makes the practice of elective and neonatal circumcision immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Father John J. Dietzen. The Morality of Circumcision. ''The Tablet'', Brooklyn, N.Y., 30 October 2004, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul Slosar and Daniel O'Brien, however, argue that the therapeutic benefits of neonatal circumcision are inconclusive, but that recent findings that circumcision may prevent disease puts the practice outside the realm of paragraph 2297.&lt;ref name="Slosar"/&gt; They also argue that statements regarding mutilation and amputation in the "Respect for bodily integrity" paragraph are made within the context of kidnapping, hostage taking or torture, and that if circumcision is defined as an amputation, any removal of tissue or follicle, regardless of its effect on functional integrity, could be considered a violation of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]].&lt;ref name=Slosar/&gt; The proportionality of harm versus benefit of medical procedures, as defined by Directives 29 and 33 of the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services ([[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/bishops/directives.shtml |title=Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services |edition=Fourth |accessdate=2008-04-11 |year=2001 |publisher=U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops |quote= '''Directive 29''' All persons served by Catholic health care have the right and duty to protect and preserve their bodily and functional integrity.

These arguments represent the conscience of the individual writers, and not the official stance of the Church. The most recent statement from the Church was that of [[Pope]] Emeritus [[Benedict XVI]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Church of Antioch sent Barnabas on a mission with Paul, which became known as the Apostle's first missionary journey . . . Together with Paul, he then went to the so-called Council of Jerusalem where after a profound examination of the question, the Apostles with the Elders decided to discontinue the practice of circumcision so that it was no longer a feature of the Christian identity (cf. Acts 15: 1-35). It was only in this way that, in the end, they officially made possible the Church of the Gentiles, a Church without circumcision; we are children of Abraham simply through faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20070131_en.html General Audience], Wednesday, 31, January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the exception of the commemoration of the circumcision of Jesus in accordance with ''Jewish'' practice, circumcision has not been part of Catholic practice. According to an epistle of [[Cyprian of Carthage]], circumcision of the flesh was replaced by circumcision of the spirit.{{clarify|post-text=(what is "circumcision of the spirit?")|date=September 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Robert Ernest Wallis.

Passages from scriptures connected with the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] ([[Mormons]]) explain that the "law of circumcision is done away" by Christ and thus unnecessary from a religious standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Moroni 8:8 and Doctrine and Covenants Section 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon Student Manual, (2009), 395–400 ''[https://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-student-manual/chapter-55-moroni-8-9?lang=eng]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main article|Khitan (circumcision)}}
The origin of circumcision in [[Islam]] is a matter of religious and scholarly debate. It is mentioned in some ''[[hadith]]'', but not in the [[Quran]]. Some ''[[fiqh]]'' scholars state that circumcision is recommended (''[[sunnah]]''), others that it is obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Some have quoted the ''hadith'' to argue that the requirement of circumcision is based on the [[Covenant (Biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|covenant with Abraham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, in Islam there is no fixed age for circumcision. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim-majority countries, circumcision is performed on Muslim boys after they have learned to recite the whole Quran from start to finish.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml   |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Malaysia]] and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a [[Rite of passage|puberty rite]], serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult.&lt;ref name="circlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |title=Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision&amp;mdash;Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of This Faith |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.&lt;ref name="circlist" /&gt;

There is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in a clinic or hospital. The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The position of the scar is usually neither fully "low" nor fully "high", and the skin left is rather loose. However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in the Muslim world, the "styles" of the Islamic circumcision vary on every individual, and change in the light on new medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="circlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |title=Style choices in relation to Religious Beliefs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515075416/http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |archivedate=2014-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
{{Main|Circumcision in Africa}}
In West Africa, infant circumcision had religious significance as a rite of passage or otherwise in the past; today in some non-Muslim Nigerian societies it is medicalised and is simply a cultural norm.&lt;ref&gt;Ajuwon et al., "Indigenous surgical practices in rural southwestern Nigeria: Implications for disease," Health Educ. Res..1995; 10: 379-384 Health Educ. Res..1995; 10: 379-384. Retrieved 3 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In many West African traditional societies circumcision has become medicalised and is simply performed in infancy without ado or any particular conscious cultural significance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Among the Urhobo of southern Nigeria it is symbolic of a boy entering into manhood. The ritual expression, ''Omo te Oshare'' ("the boy is now man"), constitutes a rite of passage from one age set to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In East Africa, specifically in [[Kenya]] among various so-classified [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic]] peoples, such as the [[Maragoli]] and [[Idakho]] of the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] super-ethnic group, the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]], circumcision is a rite of passage observed collectively by a number of boys every few years, and boys circumcised at the same time are taken to be members of a single [[age set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority derives from the age-group and the age-set. Prior to circumcision a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group through a series of rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai youths are not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the [[Luhya people|Luhya]], boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live apart from the rest of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.

The Xhosa Tribe from the Eastern Cape in South Africa has a circumcision ritual. The ceremony is part of a transition to manhood. It is called the Abakwetha - "A Group Learning". A group of normally five aged between 16-20 go off for three months and live in a special hut (sutu). The circumcision is the climax of the ritual. Nelson Mandela describes his experiences undergoing this ritual in his biography - "The Long Walk to Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ancient Egypt==
[[File:Circumcision Precinct of Mut.png|thumb|right|250px|Ancient Egyptian carved scene of circumcision, from the inner northern wall of the Temple of [[Khonspekhrod]] at the [[Precinct of Mut]], [[Luxor]], Egypt. [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], [[Amenhotep III]], c. 1360 BC.]]
[[Sixth Dynasty]] (2345 - 2181 BC) tomb artwork in Egypt is thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a [[bas-relief]] from the [[necropolis]] at [[Saqqara]] (ca. 2400 B.C) with the inscription reading "Hold him and do not allow him to faint". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century B.C, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: "When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men...there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched."&lt;ref&gt;Gollaher, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision in ancient Egypt was thought to be a mark of passage from childhood to adulthood. The alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision was supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the old Hebrew classic, Midrash Rabba (Exodus Rabba 30:9), where Aquila of Sinope said to Hadrian the king, "I wish to become a proselyte." When the king retorted, "Go and study their Divine Law, but do not be circumcised." Aquila then said to him,"Even the wisest man in your kingdom, and an elder who is aged one-hundred, cannot study their Divine Law if he isn’t circumcised, for thus is it written: 'He makes known his words unto Jacob, even his precepts and judgments unto Israel. He has not done the like of which to any other nation' (Ps. 147:19-20). Unto whom, then, [has he done it]? Unto the sons of Israel!”&lt;/ref&gt; The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]]. [[The Egyptian Book of the Dead]], for example, tells of the [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Ra]] performing a [[self-circumcision]], whose blood created two minor guardian deities. Circumcisions were performed by priests in a public ceremony, using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among the upper echelons of the society, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order are known to have had the procedure done.&lt;ref&gt;Gollaher, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007 it was announced that rural aidpost orderlies in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea are to undergo training in the circumcision of men and boys of all ages with a view to introducing the procedure as a means of prophylaxis against HIV/AIDS, which is becoming a significant problem in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Circumcision is widely practiced by the [[Druze]]. The procedure is practiced as a cultural tradition, and has no religious significance in the Druze faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Druze.html Druze]&lt;/ref&gt; Male Druze infants are usually circumcised shortly after birth.

==Criticism and opposition to circumcision==
===Opposition within Judaism===
{{See also|Brit milah#The anti-circumcision movement and Brit shalom|Circumcision controversies}}

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries many [[Haskalah|Jewish reformers]], doctors, and [[physician]]s in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proposed to replace circumcision with a symbolic ceremony, while others sought to ban or abolish circumcision entirely,&lt;ref name="Yivo"&gt;{{cquote|In the first half of the nineteenth century, various European governments considered regulating, if not banning, ''berit milah'' on the grounds that it posed potential medical dangers. In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.

Veniamin Portugalov, who—alone among Russian Jewish physicians—called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation. Ritual circumcision, he claimed, stood as a self-imposed obstacle to the Jews’ [[Jewish emancipation|attainment of true equality with the other peoples of Europe]].|author=Epstein, Lisa|source=[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Circumcision "Circumcision"], ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', [[Yale University Press]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was perceived as a dangerous, barbaric and pagan ritual of [[genital mutilation]]&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; that could [[Infectious disease#Transmission|transmit infectious diseases]] to newborns.&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; The first formal objection to circumcision within Judaism occurred in 1843 in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gollaher2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gollaher|first=David|author-link=David Gollaher|title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1–30 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-465-02653-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for the Friends of Reform, a group that criticized traditional Jewish practices, said that [[brit milah]] was not a [[mitzvah]] but an outworn legacy from [[Israelites|Israel]]'s earlier phases, an obsolete throwback to primitive religion.&lt;ref name="Gollaher2001" /&gt; With the expanding role of medicine came further opposition; certain aspects of Jewish circumcision such as ''periah'' and ''metzitzah'' (drawing the blood from the circumcision wound through sucking or a cloth) were deemed unhygienic and dangerous for the newborns.&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gollaher2001" /&gt; Later evidence that [[syphilis]] and [[tuberculosis]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; two of the most feared infectious diseases in the 19th century&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; were spread by mohels,&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; caused various [[rabbis]] to advocate ''metzitzah'' to be done using a sponge or a tube.&lt;ref name="Gollaher2001" /&gt; Among the secular, non-observant Jews that chose to not circumcise their sons and keep them intact there was also [[Theodor Herzl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishcircumcision.org/spectator.htm|title=Circumcision: A Source of Jewish Pain|accessdate=2018-07-28|last=Goldman|first=Ronald|date=1997|website=Jewish Circumcision Resource Center|publisher=Jewish Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early British opponent of circumcision was Herbert Snow, who wrote a short book called ''The barbarity of circumcision as a remedy for congenital abnormality'' in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=45#dow |title=The barbarity of circumcision, 1890.

The first serious questioning of the practice did not occur until late 1949, when the [[paediatrician]] [[Douglas Gairdner]], D. M., published ''The Fate of the Foreskin'' in the [[British Medical Journal]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gairdner |first1=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Gairdner |title=The Fate of the Foreskin: A Study of Circumcision | journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |date=24 December 1949 |volume=2 |issue=4642 |pages=1433–7 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/general/gairdner/ |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.4642.1433| pmid=15408299 |pmc= 2051968

Protest rallies have been held in the US and other areas. NOCIRC have consistently criticised the American medical community's circumcision guidelines.&lt;ref name="Milos1992"/&gt; According to Milos and Donna Macris, "The need to defend the baby's right to a peaceful beginning was brought to light by Dr. Frederick Leboyer in his landmark work, ''Birth Without Violence''".&lt;ref name="Milos1992"/&gt;

This period also saw the formation of anti-circumcision organizations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.

The ordinary worshipper rarely entered the cella, and most public ceremonies were performed outside, on the portico, with a crowd gathered in the temple precinct.

The most common architectural plan had a rectangular temple raised on a high [[podium]], with a clear front with a [[portico]] at the top of steps, and a triangular [[pediment]] above columns.  The sides and rear of the building had much less architectural emphasis, and typically no entrances. There were also circular plans, generally with columns all round, and outside Italy there were many compromises with traditional local styles.  The Roman form of temple developed initially from [[Etruscan temple]]s, themselves influenced by the Greeks, with subsequent heavy direct influence from Greece.

Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors, and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|Sacrifices]], chiefly [[animal sacrifice|of animals]], would take place at an open-air altar within the ''templum''; often on one of the narrow extensions of the podium to the side of the steps.  Especially under the Empire, exotic foreign cults gained followers in Rome, and were the local religions in large parts of the expanded Empire. These often had very different practices, some preferring underground places of worship, while others, like [[Early Christians]], worshipped in houses.&lt;ref name="Sear"&gt;Sear&lt;/ref&gt;

Some remains of many Roman temples survive, above all in Rome itself, but the relatively few near-complete examples were nearly all converted to Christian churches (and sometimes subsequently to [[mosque]]s), usually a considerable time after the initial [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|triumph of Christianity under Constantine]].  The [[Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|decline of Roman religion]] was relatively slow, and the temples themselves were not appropriated by the government until a decree of the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 415.  [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]], in the [[Roman Forum]], originally the Temple of [[Romulus]], was not dedicated as a church until 527.  The best known is the [[Pantheon, Rome]], which is however highly untypical, being a very large circular temple with a magnificent concrete roof, behind a conventional portico front.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 104–106; Sear&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The English word "temple" derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]]'', which was originally not the building itself, but a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] always uses the word ''templum'' to refer to the sacred precinct, and not to the building. The more common Latin words for a temple or shrine were ''[[sacellum]]'' (a small shrine or chapel), ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'', ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#delubrum|delubrum]]'', and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fanum|fanum]]'' (in this article, the English word "temple" refers to any of these buildings, and the Latin ''templum'' to the sacred precinct).

==Architecture==
The form of the Roman temple was mainly derived from the [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] model, but in the late Republic there was a switch to using Greek classical and Hellenistic styles, without much change in the key features of the form.  The Etruscans were a people of northern Italy, whose civilization was at its peak in the seventh century BC. The Etruscans were already influenced by early [[Greek architecture]], so Roman temples were distinctive but with both Etruscan and Greek features.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | title=Roman Art and Architecture – from Augustus to Constantine | publisher=Pearson Education New Zealand | last=Campbell | first=Jonathan | isbn=978-0-582-73984-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 255; Henig, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Surviving temples (both Greek and Roman) lack the extensive painted statuary that decorated the rooflines, and the elaborate revetments and [[antefix]]es, in colourful terracotta in earlier examples, that enlivened the [[entablature]].

Etruscan and Roman temples emphasised the front of the building, which followed [[Greek temple]] models and typically consisted of wide steps leading to a [[portico]] with columns, a [[pronaos]], and usually a triangular [[pediment]] above, which was filled with statuary in the most grand examples; this was as often in [[terracotta]] as stone, and no examples have survived except as fragments.  Especially in the earlier periods, further statuary might be placed on the roof, and the [[entablature]]  decorated with [[antefix]]es and other elements, all of this being brightly painted.  However, unlike the Greek models, which generally gave equal treatment to all sides of the temple, which could be viewed and approached from all directions, the side and rear walls of Roman temples might be largely undecorated (as in the [[Pantheon, Rome]] and [[Roman temple of Vic|Vic]]), inaccessible by steps (as in the [[Maison Carrée]] and Vic), and even back on to other buildings. As in the Maison Carrée, columns at the side might be half-columns, emerging from ("engaged with" in architectural terminology) the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 89; Henig, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform on which the temple sat was typically raised higher in Etruscan and Roman examples than Greek, with up to ten, twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the [[Temple of Claudius]] was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that.  It might or might not be possible to walk around the temple exterior inside ([[Temple of Hadrian]]) or outside the [[colonnade]], or at least down the sides.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 56, Wheeler, 89&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the Greek models used here is a generalization of classical Greek ideals, and later Hellenistic buildings often do not reflect them.  For example, the "Temple of Dionysus" on the terrace by the theatre at [[Pergamon]] (Ionic, 2nd century BC, on a hillside), had many steps in front, and no columns beyond the portico.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Manuel Cook|Cook, R.M.]], ''Greek Art'', plate 86 and caption, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), {{ISBN|0140218661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Parthenon]], also approached up a hill, probably had many wide steps at the approach to the main front, followed by a flat area before the final few steps.&lt;ref&gt;16 in a reconstruction drawing by G. Stephens, p. 38 in ''The Acropolis: Monuments and Museum'', by G. Papathanassopoulos, Krene Editions, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

After the eclipse of the Etruscan models, the Greek [[classical order]]s in all their details were closely followed in the façades of Roman temples, as in other prestigious buildings, with the direct adoption of Greek models apparently beginning around 200 BC, under the late Republic.  But the distinctive differences in the general arrangement of temples between the Etruscan-Roman style and the Greek, as outlined above, were retained.  However the idealized proportions between the different elements in the orders set out by the only significant Roman writer on architecture to survive, [[Vitruvius]], and subsequent [[Italian Renaissance]] writers, do not reflect actual Roman practice, which could be very variable, though always aiming at balance and harmony.  Following a [[Hellenistic]] trend, the [[Corinthian order]] and its variant the [[Composite order]] were most common in surviving Roman temples, but for small temples like [[Roman temple of Alcántara|that at Alcántara]], a simple [[Tuscan order]] could be used.  Vitruvius does not recognise the Composite or Tuscan orders in his writings, which Renaissance writers formalized from observing surviving buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), 8–13&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - Gaspa - Dendara, mammisi romano (7).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Small stone building surrounded by half-walls and columns with elaborate capitals.|A Roman [[mammisi]] or chapel added to [[Dendera Temple]], using the traditional [[Egyptian temple]] style.]]

The front of the temple typically carried an inscription saying who had built it, cut into the stone with a "V" section.  This was filled with brightly coloured paint, usually scarlet or [[vermilion]].  In major imperial monuments the letters were cast in [[lead (metal)|lead]] and held in by pegs, then also painted or [[gilding|gilded]]. These have usually long vanished, but archaeologists can generally reconstruct them from the peg-holes, and some have been re-created and set in place.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable local variation in style, as Roman architects often tried to incorporate elements the population expected in its [[sacred architecture]]. This was especially the case in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] and the [[Near East]], where different traditions of large stone temples were already millennia old.  The [[Romano-Celtic temple]] was a simple style, usually with little use of stone, for small temples found in the [[Western Empire]], and by far the most common type in [[Roman Britain]], where they were usually square, with an [[ambulatory]].  It often lacked any of the distinctive classical features, and may have had considerable continuity with pre-Roman temples of the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 56–57;  Wheeler, 100–104: Sear&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circular plans==
[[File:The round temple (Temple of Venus), Baalbek, Holy Land, (i.e., Ba'labakk, Lebanon)-LCCN2002724962.tif|thumb|"Temple of Venus", [[Baalbek]], from the rear]]
Romano-Celtic temples were often circular, and circular temples of various kinds were built by the Romans.  Greek models were available in ''[[tholos (building)|tholos]]'' shrines and some [[Tholos (Ancient Rome)|other buildings]], as assembly halls and various other functions.  Temples of the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], which were usually small, typically had this shape, as in those at Rome and Tivoli (see list), which survive in part.  Like the [[Temple of Hercules Victor]] in Rome, which was perhaps by a Greek architect, these survivors had an unbroken colonnade encircling the building, and a low, Greek-style podium.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 100–104; Sear&lt;/ref&gt;

Different formulae were followed in the [[Pantheon, Rome]] and a small temple at [[Baalbek]] (usually called the "Temple of Venus"), where the door is behind a full portico, though very different ways of doing this are used.  In the Pantheon only the portico has columns, and the "thoroughly uncomfortable" exterior meeting of the portico and circular cella are often criticised.  At Baalbek a wide portico with a [[broken pediment]] is matched by four other columns round the building, with the [[architrave]] in scooped curving sections, each ending in a projection supported by a column.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 97–106, 105 quoted.  Originally the "uncomfortable" junction was screened by a wall, and less apparent.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Praeneste]] (modern Palestrina) near Rome, a huge pilgrimage complex of the 1st century BC led visitors up several levels with large buildings on a steep hillside, before they eventually reached the sanctuary itself, a much smaller circular building.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caesareum==
[[File:Vienne (avril 2009) 036.jpg|thumb|left|Temple of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] at  [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], from behind]]
A ''caesareum'' was a temple devoted to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]. Caesarea were located throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and often funded by the imperial government, tending to replace state spending on new temples to other gods, and becoming the main or only large temple in new Roman towns in the provinces.  This was the case at [[Roman Temple of Évora|Évora]], [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] and [[Nîmes]], which were all expanded by the Romans as [[Colonia (Roman)|''coloniae'']]  from Celtic [[oppidum|oppida]] soon after their conquest.  Imperial temples paid for by the government usually used conventional Roman styles all over the empire, regardless of the local styles seen in smaller temples.  In newly planned Roman cities the temple was normally centrally placed at one end of the forum, often facing the basilica at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 55; Sear&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of Rome, a caesareum was located within the religious precinct of the [[Arval Brothers]]. In 1570, it was documented as still containing nine statues of [[Roman emperor]]s in architectural niches.&lt;ref&gt;The statues are all lost, but the base for the statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] survives, and the inscriptions of seven of the nine are recorded in volume 6 of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]. Jane Fejfer, ''Roman Portraits in Context'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2008), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the earlier emperors had their own very large temples in Rome,&lt;ref name="Sear"/&gt; but a faltering economy meant that the building of new imperial temples mostly ceased after the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (d. 180), though the [[Temple of Romulus]] on the Roman Forum was built and dedicated by the Emperor [[Maxentius]] to his son [[Valerius Romulus]], who died in childhood in 309 and was deified.

One of the earliest and most prominent of the caesarea was the [[Caesareum of Alexandria]], located on the harbor. It was begun by [[Cleopatra VII]] of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], the last [[pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]], to honour her dead lover [[Julius Caesar]], then converted by Augustus to his own cult. During the 4th century, after the Empire had come under Christian rule, it was converted to a church.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, "Archaeology and the 'Arian Controversy' in the Fourth Century," in ''Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity'' (Brill, 2010), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London (1720), [[James Gibbs]]]]
The Etruscan-Roman adaptation of the Greek temple model to place the main emphasis on the front façade and let the other sides of the building harmonize with it only as much as circumstances and budget allow has generally been adopted in [[Neoclassical architecture]], and other classically derived styles.  In these temple fronts with columns and a pediment are very common for the main entrance of grand buildings, but often flanked by large wings or set in courtyards.  This flexibility has allowed the Roman temple front to be used in buildings made for a wide variety of purposes.  The colonnade may no longer be pushed forward with a pronaus porch, and it may not be raised above the ground, but the essential shape remains the same. Among thousands of examples are the [[White House]], [[Buckingham Palace]], and [[St Peters, Rome]]; in recent years the temple front has become fashionable in China.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, Edwin, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4c5aed54-6618-11e2-bb67-00144feab49a.html Review of ''Original Copies: Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China'', by Bianca Bosker, University of Hawaii Press], ''[[The Financial Times]]'', January 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance and later architects worked out ways of harmoniously adding high raised domes, towers and spires above a colonnaded temple portico front, something the Romans would have found odd.  The Roman temple front remains a familiar feature of subsequent [[Early Modern]] architecture in the Western tradition, but although very commonly used for churches, it has lost the specific association with religion that it had for the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W Most, Salvatore Settis, eds., ''The Classical Tradition'', 927, 2010, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0674035720}}, 9780674035720, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;pg=PA927 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, later adaptions lack the colour of the original, and though there may be sculpture filling the pediment in grand examples, the full Roman complement of sculpture above the roofline is rarely emulated.

Variations on the theme, mostly Italian in origin, include: [[San Andrea, Mantua]], 1462 by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], which took a four-columned Roman [[triumphal arch]] and added a pediment above; [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice]], begun 1566, by [[Andrea Palladio]], which has two superimposed temple fronts, one low and wide, the other tall and narrow; the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa Rotunda]], 1567 on, also by Palladio, with four isolated temple fronts on each side of a rectangle, with a large central dome.  In [[Baroque architecture]] two temple fronts, often of different orders, superimposed one above the other, became extremely common for Catholic churches, often with the uppermost one supported by huge [[volute]]s to each side. This can be seen developing in the [[Church of the Gesù|Gesù, Rome]] (1584), [[Santa Susanna]], Rome (1597), [[Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi]] (1646) and [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]], Paris (1645 on).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), captions to illustrations 21, 41, 42, 72–75&lt;/ref&gt;

An archetypical pattern for churches in [[Georgian architecture]] was set by [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London (1720), by [[James Gibbs]], who boldly added to the classical temple façade at the west end a large steeple on top of a tower, set back slightly from the main frontage. This formula shocked purists and foreigners, but became accepted and was very widely copied, at home and in the colonies,&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1988), 64–70&lt;/ref&gt; for example at [[St Andrew's Church, Chennai]] in India and [[St. Paul's Chapel]] in New York City (1766).
[[File:Madeleine Paris.jpg|thumb|left|[[La Madeleine, Paris]] (1807), now a church]]

Examples of modern buildings that stick more faithfully to the ancient rectangular temple form are only found from the 18th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Summerson 1980, 25"/&gt; Versions of the Roman temple as a discrete block include [[La Madeleine, Paris]] (1807), now a church but built by Napoleon as a ''Temple de la Gloire de la Grande Armée'' ("Temple to the Glory of the Great Army"), the [[Virginia State Capitol]] as originally built in 1785–88, and [[Birmingham Town Hall]] (1832–34).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), 28. The Virginia State Capitol is specifically based on the Maison carre, but in a cheaper Ionic rather than Corinthian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Roman circular temples with colonnades have often been used as models, either for single buildings, large or small, or elements such as domes raised on drums, in buildings on another plan such as [[St Peters, Rome]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London and the [[United States Capitol]].  The great progenitor of these is the [[Tempietto]] of [[Donato Bramante]] in the courtyard of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] in Rome, c. 1502, which has been widely admired ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), 25, 41–42, 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional portico front, is "unique" in Roman architecture, it has been copied many times by modern architects.  Versions include the church of Santa Maria Assunta in [[Ariccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1664), which followed his work restoring the Roman original,&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), 38–39, 38 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belle Isle (Windermere)|Belle Isle House]] (1774) in England, and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s library at the [[University of Virginia]], [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]] (1817–26).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson (1980), 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pantheon was much the largest and most accessible complete classical temple front known to the Italian Renaissance, and was the standard exemplar when these were revived.

==Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus==
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|right|[[Relief]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]] sacrificing at the 4th temple (left)]]
The [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]] was the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to the [[Capitoline Triad]] consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]], and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome.  It was destroyed by fire three times, and rapidly rebuilt in contemporary styles.  The first building, traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; has been claimed to have been almost {{convert|60|×|60|m|abbr=on}}, much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after, although its size is heavily disputed by specialists.  Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2.  Stamper is a leading protagonist of a smaller size, rejecting the larger size proposed by the late [[Einar Gjerstad]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The same may have been true for the later rebuildings, though here the influence is harder to trace.

For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive [[terracotta]] elements of the [[entablature]] or upper parts, such as [[antefix]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  But for the second building they were summoned from Greece.  Rebuildings after destruction by fire were completed in 69 BC, 75 AD, and in the 80s AD, under [[Domitian]] – the third building only lasted five years before burning down again.  After a major sacking by [[Vandals]] in 455, and comprehensive removal of stone in the Renaissance, only foundations can now be seen, in the basement of the [[Capitoline Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 14–15, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2; [[Joseph Rykwert|Rykwert, Joseph]], ''The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture'', 357–360, 1998, MIT Press, {{ISBN|0262681013}}, 9780262681018, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3IKoh75RI38C&amp;pg=PA357 google books]; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Jovis_Capitolini.html Entry on "Aedes Iovis Optimi Maximi Capitolini"] from ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', by Samuel Ball Platner (as completed and revised by Thomas Ashby), Oxford University Press, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptor [[Flaminio Vacca]] (d 1605) claimed that the life-size [[Medici lions|Medici lion]] he carved to match a Roman survival, now in [[Florence]], was made from a single capital from the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the best survivals had been converted to churches (and sometimes later mosques), which some remain.  Often the porticos were walled in between the columns, and the original cella front and side walls largely removed to create a large single space in the interior.  Rural areas in the Islamic world have some good remains, which had been left largely undisturbed. In Spain some remarkable discoveries (Vic, Cordoba, Barcelona) were made in the 19th century when old buildings being reconstructed or demolished were found to contain major remains encased in later buildings. In Rome, Pula, and elsewhere some walls incorporated in later buildings have always been evident.  The squared-off blocks of temple walls have always been attractive for later builders to reuse, while the large pieces of massive columns were less easy to remove and make use of; hence the podium, minus facing, and some columns are often all that remain.  In most cases loose pieces of stone have been removed from the site, and some such as capitals may be found in local museums, along with non-architectural items excavated, such as terracotta [[votive]] statuettes or amulets, which are often found in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Michael, ''Ancient Rome'', Preface, 1989, Elsevier-Phaidon; Henig, 191–199&lt;/ref&gt;  Very little indeed survives in place from the significant quantities of large sculpture that originally decorated temples.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Old Orthodox Church''' ({{lang-ru|Русская Древлеправославная Церковь}}) is an  [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of the [[Old Believers]] tradition, born of a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (''[[raskol]]'') during the 17th century (Old Believers). This jurisdiction incorporated those Old Believer groups which refused to accept the authority of [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]], est. 1846  (see [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]]). It was also known as '''Novozybkov Hierarchy''' (by the name of the city where its chief hierarch resided in 1963&amp;ndash;2000). It is considered to be independent of the Eastern Orthodox Communion i.e. it is not recognised by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], nor by any of the Orthodox churches in communion with the Patriarch.

From 1963 until 2002, the official title of its chief hierarch was ''Archbishop of Novozybkov, Moscow and all Russia''. In 2000, with the move of the Archbishop's residence to [[Moscow]], the [[toponym]] [[Novozybkov]] was dropped from the title. Since March 2003, the official title of the church leader is ''Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia''.  The current head of the Church is Patriarch Alexander (Kalinin; since 9 May 2000, Patriarch since 3 March 2003) [http://ancient-orthodoxy.narod.ru/patriarh.htm].

== History ==
The Russian Old Orthodox Church was formed from the groups of Old Believers who insisted on preserving the traditional church structure and hierarchy (as opposed to [[Bespopovtsy]] groups), but refused to accept the authority of Metropolitan Amvrosii (Popovitch) who converted in 1846 and founded the [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]], due to some canonical problems with his conversion and the ordination of its second bishop, Kiril (Amvrosii ordained him alone, which was against canons).  
These Old Believers groups continued to exist without a [[bishop]] until 1923 when they created their own hierarchy, by receiving the [[Renovationists|Renovationist]] Archbishop Nikola (Pozdnev) of Saratov (1853&amp;ndash;1934). He was received (like Amvrosii in 1846) by [[chrismation]] on November 4, 1923 and given a title ''Archbishop of Moscow, Saratov and all old Orthodox Christians of Russia''.  Some problems with Nikola's installation and with the 'validity' of this jurisdiction in general was that the Renovationist Church was a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and archbishop Nikola, together with other Renovationist clergy was officially suspended from all priestly functions by the Council of Bishops under [[Patriarch Tikhon]] (Bellavin) in 1923. Also, some Old Believers had doubts whether Nikola was baptized by infusion rather than triple immersion (see [[Baptism]]). These doubts were rejected by the Moscow Council of the Old-Orthodox Church in May 1924.

In order to avoid the same "error" which they thought the leaders of the [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]] had made, Archbishop Nikola did not ordain any new bishops single handedly – not until the conversion of another bishop from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Stephan (Rastorguev), in September 1929. Four more bishops were ordained in subsequent years. Like many other Christian Churches in Soviet Russia, the Old-Orthodox Church suffered heavy persecution from atheistic authorities.  One of the outcomes of these conditions was the frequent migration of the see of its first hierarch: Moscow (1924–1955); Kuibyshev – now [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] (1955–1963); Novozybkov (in [[Bryansk]] region) (1963–2000). In 2000, the residence was moved back to Moscow.

In the 1990s, several bishops separated from the central administration of the Russian Old-Orthodox Church, forming two schismatic ecclesiastical bodies:
* '''''Slavo-Georgian (Iberian) Old-Orthodox Church''''' (''Славяно-Грузинская Иверская Древлеправославная Церковь'') was created in the beginning of the 1990s by two schismatic bishops (Leonty of [[Perm]] and Flavian of [[Moscow]]). This church has three bishops and a couple of parishes in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and in [[Russia]]. Its distinctive feature is that liturgical services are held in both [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] and [[Georgian language|Old Georgian]], using pre-18th century Old Georgian [[liturgical book]]s.
* '''''Old Orthodox Church of Russia''''' (''Древлеправославная Церковь России'') was formed in 1999 in response to the alleged "Renovationist" policies of the church's central administration. It currently has three bishops and 12 parishes in Russia and [[Romania]].
Since the 1990s, some of these schismatic bishops restored communion with the Russian Old-Orthodox Church, but the two churches these schisms created still exist.

In 2003, in a highly controversial move, the leaders of the Old-Orthodox Church resolved to "restore" the [[patriarchate]] in the "Russian Church", thus setting up a rival Patriarchate of Moscow in opposition to the Patriarch [[Aleksy II]] (Ridiger), the head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This act was bound to complicate the relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church and another Old Believer Church claiming to be the authentic Russian hierarchy – the [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]] or [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]], and until this day, these three churches are officially not in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with each other.

== Organisation ==

The '''Holy Council''' is the highest legislative body, which elects the Patriarch and the members of the Chief Ecclesiastical Council. Today, the Old-Orthodox Church has six hierarchs and about more than 10 parishes on the former Soviet Union territory and four parishes in Romania (as of 1996).

[[File:Vila by Andy Paciorek.jpg|thumb|Vila by Andy Paciorek]]
'''Samodivas''', '''Samovilas''' or '''Vilas''' are woodland [[Fairy|fairies]] or [[Nymph|nymphs]] found in [[South Slavs|South]] and [[West Slavs|West]] [[Slavic folklore]]. In [[Romania]], they are known as [[Iele]]. 

==Etymology==
The words ''samodiva'' and ''samovila'' have [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] roots meaning "divinity", "rave", "wild", or "rage".

==Appearance==
Samodivas are commonly depicted as ethereal maidens with long, loose hair, and in some cases, wings. They are typically dressed in free-flowing, feathered white gowns, which give them the power of flight. Samodivas are often described as blonde, tall, slender women with pale, glowing skin and fiery eyes.

==Habitat==
According to folklore, Samodivas can live inside trees or abandoned shacks or dark caves, or near rivers, ponds and wells. Mountains linked to the Samodivas include Vitosha, Belasitsa, Pirin, Rila, Rodopi, the Balkan Mountains in Bulgaria and Rudina mountains. However, mountain Pirin is their traditional favorite. Samodivas enter the human world during the spring, staying until autumn. During the winter, they live in the mythical village of Zmajkovo.

==Abilities and habits==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2018}}
Samodivas are believed to be very beautiful women with an affinity for fire. They have the power to bring about drought, burn a farmer's crops, or make cattle die of high fever. It is said that, when angered, a Samodiva can change her appearance and turn into a monstrous bird, capable of throwing fire at her enemies. This, with the power of their seductive voices, makes them somewhat similar to [[Harpy|Harpies]] in [[Greek mythology]]. Their vindictive nature also complements this notion. 

They are usually hostile and dangerous to people. Men who gaze upon a Samodiva fall instantly in [[love]] (or at least in [[lust]]), and women take their own lives at the sight of such beauty. Sometimes a Samodiva would seduce a man, commonly a shepherd or a trespasser in her forest, and take him for her lover. However, in doing so, she would take all of his life energy. The man would then become obsessed with the Samodiva and chase her relentlessly, unable to think of anything else. The Samodiva, fueled by the energy stolen from her admirer, would then proceed to torture the man until he died of exhaustion.

Another important aspect of the myths surrounding Samodivas is their dance. Beginning at midnight and finishing at dawn, their dance symbolized the raw energy of both nature and the supernatural world. Accompanied and following only the rhythm of the wind and their own singing, their dance was said to have been often witnessed by lost or late travelers, some of them choosing to join it, seduced by the beauty of their song and visage, only to die of exhaustion at dawn, when the Samodivas finally disappeared.

Much like the [[Vila (fairy)|Vila]] in [[Slavic folklore]], a Samodiva's power is believed to come mostly from her long (usually blond) hair. A Samodiva would sometimes give a small portion of it to her lover to strengthen her control over him via its magical effects. However, if her hair is damaged in some way, she will either disappear entirely or be stripped of her powers and beauty.

In [[Bulgarian customs|Bulgarian folklore]], a Samodiva's close connection to the forest makes her knowledgeable about magical herbs and cures for all illnesses. It is said that if a person managed to eavesdrop on a gathering of Samodivas he could also gain knowledge of these remedies. In many stories, this is exactly what the hero is forced to do to save a loved one, as a Samodiva would never share her secrets willingly.  

Balkan mythology holds that Samodivas were the daughters of [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]]. This, combined with their mostly nocturnal nature, leads to them being considered negative, or at best neutral in their nature.

==History==
Earliest written evidence of Samodivas dates back to the 13th century, where they presumably developed from [[Balkan]] traditions and myths.  Researchers have also found influences from other [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] folklore. It is widely believed that the image of the Samodiva and their behavior is actually based on ancient [[Thracian]] legends, especially those connected to the [[Orpheus|Cult of Orpheus]], which included songs and dances performed by fire-priestesses.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Vila Samodiva==
In Bulgarian and Serbian folklore, "Vila Samodiva" (or "Vila Samovila") is used to describe the Samodiva maiden who leads the others in their dances. She is usually the active participant of the contact between the protagonist of folktales and the mystical world, serving as a guide or giving the hero a task to test his valour and resolve.

In one folk tale, Vila found [[Prince Marko]] as an infant and brought him up as a foster mother. As Marko grew on Samodiva milk, he acquired supernatural powers.

==In poetry==
In the 19th century, Bulgarian poet and revolutionary [[Hristo Botev]] mentioned Samodivas in a poem praising the late [[Voivoda]] [[Hadzhi Dimitar]]. The Samodivas provide comfort to the dying man in the last moments of his life, symbolizing bravery. They also appear to symbolize the union between him and the land he sacrificed himself to protect.  Still, the Samodivas and the reaction of Hadzhi Dimitar to their presence is connected to the mischievous and seductive role they often play in mythology.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Siddhashila''' is an area in [[Jain cosmology]] at the apex of the universe, which is where the [[Jainism|Jains]] believe people who have become ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]s'', or people with infinite knowledge, go after they die and attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]''.

'''Sikhism in [[Bangladesh]]''' dates back to 1503 but has declined after the partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2012/07/01/heritage.htm|title=Prayers from Punjab|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Sikhs in the country are officials of Indian High Commission or pilgrims. There were eighteen historical [[Gurdwara|Gurdwaras]] in Bangladesh but now only seven are left.

== History ==
Sikhism first emerged in Bengal when [[Guru Nanak]] visited Bangladesh in 1504 and established a number of Gurdwaras.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; [[Gurdwara Nanak Shahi]] (Bengali: গুরুদুয়ারা নানকশাহী) is the principal [[Sikh]] Gurdwara (prayer hall) in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh. It is located at the campus of the [[University of Dhaka]] and considered to be the biggest of the 7 Gurdwaras in the country. After the Partition of [[India]], the Sikh community left for India.&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sikhs,_The|title=Sikhs, The - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Indian Sikh soldiers helped renovate the Gudwaras left in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Gurdwaras_in_Bangladesh|title=Gurdwaras in Bangladesh - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky Tonia Ferreira''' (born July 8, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, model, and actress. As a teenager, Ferreira began uploading videos on [[Myspace]] of herself singing songs she had written, which led to her discovery by producers [[Bloodshy &amp; Avant]] and an eventual recording contract with [[Parlophone]] in 2009. She released her first [[extended play]], ''[[As If! (EP)|As If!]]'', in 2011, which combined elements of [[electropop]] and [[dance music]]. Ferreira's second extended play ''[[Ghost (Sky Ferreira EP)|Ghost]]'' (2012), however, incorporated pop with more stripped-down song structures and featured collaborations with [[Jon Brion]] and [[Shirley Manson]], as well as the critically acclaimed track "[[Everything Is Embarrassing]]", which she composed with [[Dev Hynes]].

After multiple delays and disputes with her record label, Ferreira's debut [[studio album]] ''[[Night Time, My Time]]'' was released on October 29, 2013, and marked a departure from her former style, incorporating more experimental [[indie rock]] with [[synth-pop]] elements. The album was preceded by its lead single "[[You're Not the One]]". That year, she ventured into the film industry after appearing in [[Eli Roth]]'s ''[[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]]'' and garnered media attention after being arrested for [[drug possession]]. She was exposed to a mainstream audience after having been announced as an opening act for the international [[Bangerz Tour]], headlined by [[Miley Cyrus]], which began on February 14, 2014.

Ferreira's earlier work incorporated elements of [[dance-pop]], while her recent projects experiment with [[acoustic music|acoustic]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and primarily [[indie rock]] musical styles. Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance, and has since evolved to discuss personal insecurities and more mature romantic themes. Outside her work in the entertainment industry, she has modeled for several brands and magazines, including serving as the spokeswoman for the hair care brand [[Redken]] in 2014.

Ferreira was largely raised by her grandmother, who had been [[Michael Jackson]]'s personal hairstylist for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman|first=Darrell|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201303/sky-ferreira-everything-is-embarrassing|title=Q&amp;A: Sky Ferreira|work=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|date=March 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented, saying: "I was raised around him, I always saw him [and] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11010080|title=Sky Ferreira on being friends with Michael Jackson|author1=Oli Wilson|author2=Kirstie Andrews|work=[[Newsbeat]]|date=August 18, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/9952318/Sky-Ferreira-New-Faces.html|title=Sky Ferreira – New Faces|author=James Lachno|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira has stated that she was [[sexually assaulted]] in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home.&lt;ref name="rookie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gevinson|first=Tavi|authorlink=Tavi Gevinson|url=http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/02/sky-ferreira/|title=American Dream: An Interview With Sky Ferreira|work=[[Rookie (magazine)|Rookie]]|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Rookie (magazine)|Rookie]]'', Ferreira said: "I've never said anything [about this publicly] because I don't want it to define me, but I feel like it's appropriate to say something [here]. People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are."&lt;ref name="rookie"/&gt; Ferreira dropped out of high school after completing her sophomore year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/08/20/sky-ferreira-everything-is-embarrassing/|title=Sky Ferreira: Everything Is Embarrassing|author=Lizzy Goodman|work=[[The Fader]]|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferreira later began maintaining a [[Myspace]] profile where she uploaded demo versions of self-written tracks. Shortly before her 15th birthday, she wrote a letter to producers [[Bloodshy &amp; Avant]] requesting that they offer a recording contract to her, which she says happened "kind of right off the bat" after they came across her profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/almost-famous-person-sky-ferreira-calls-famous-people-drag/|title=Almost Famous Person Sky Ferreira Calls Famous People a Drag|author=Adam Mrlik|work=[[BlackBook (magazine)|BlackBook]]|date=June 29, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she was signed to [[Parlophone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelynxnewspaper.com/2013/11/sky-ferreiras-night-time-my-time/|title=Sky Ferreira's Night Time, My Time|author=Jeffrey Butler III|newspaper=The Lynx|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began finalizing the debut studio album that she says was first begun when she was 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a261074/sky-ferreira.html|title=Sky Ferreira|author=Nick Levine|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 14, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she ventured into the film and modelling industries after starring in the independent film ''[[Putty Hill]]''&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Jon|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sky-ferreira-mn0002363198/biography|title=Sky Ferreira {{!}} Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appearing in the magazines ''[[Dazed]]'' and ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/6290/1/dazed-confused-february-issue|title=Dazed &amp; Confused: February Issue|work=[[Dazed]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rachel|first=T.

Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance; Andrew Unterberger from Popdust opined that "17" plays the girl-gone-wild tale as a near-horror story, clearly meant to shock and upset", while noting that "One" "instead features a robo'd out Sky bemoaning the breakdown of connection in a relationship, and her own inability to feel anything as a result."&lt;ref name="Popdust" /&gt; As her career progressed, Ferreira more frequently experimented with elements of [[indie rock]], which were commonly heard in her first album ''[[Night Time, My Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/night-time-my-time-mw0002554864|title=Night Time, My Time – Sky Ferreira|author=Heather Phares|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira's vocal range has been described as that of a [[contralto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-sky-ferreira-everything-is-embarrassing/|work=Pitchfork|title="Everything Is Embarrassing"|date=August 31, 2012|author=St. Asaph, Katherine|accessdate= November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julianne Escobedo Shepberd from ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that Ferreira's "songs are catchy, but they're also thickly glazed with fuzz and synths, evoking influences like [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[Siouxsie Sioux]] and the krautrock group [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Escobedo Shepberd, Julianne |title=Encounter: Sky Ferreira |url=http://www.rollingstoneme.com/music/encounter-sky-ferreira |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karolina Ramos from ''[[The GW Hatchet]]'' compared Ferreira to New Zealand recording artist [[Lorde]], both of whom she felt "tackle contemporary love, desire and insecurity with depth, composure and frankness." She compared her musical style to 1980s [[pop music]], and noted that "her throaty, sultry vocals call to mind [[Lana del Rey]], abandoning brightness and vivacity for a colder tone. Still, Ferreira can drop the edge, with gentler tracks like "Sad Dream" showcasing her vocal range and seldom-observed softness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2013/11/11/district-sound-not-your-average-month-for-indie-pop/?mode=print|title=District Sound: Not your average month for indie pop|author=Karolina Ramos|work=[[The GW Hatchet]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Unterberger stated that "through a variety of singles, EPs, guest features and live appearances, Sky has proven herself one of the most talented singers, creative songwriters and savvy collaborators currently working in the genre", but blamed "bad marketing, label disputes and her own perfectionism" for the extended delay of ''Night Time, My Time''; he also stated that the repeated renaming of the record itself "should give you some idea of the musical identity issues she's suffered over the years."&lt;ref name="Popdust" /&gt;

After establishing a friendship with singer [[Miley Cyrus]] in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the ''[[New York Post]]'' noted that the media and general public would continue "following her every move". Ferreira commented that "[Miley's] obviously way bigger and all eyes [are] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's trying to say that we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for ''Night Time, My Time'', to which she responded "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/19/sky-ferreiras-the-most-wicked-woman-in-pop/|title=Sky Ferreira: Sex, drugs and Miley Cyrus|author=Gregory E.

'''''The Binding of Isaac''''' is an [[indie game|indie]] [[roguelike]] video game designed by [[Edmund McMillen]] and Florian Himsl, initially released in 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]]; the game was later ported for [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] operating systems. The game's title and plot are inspired by the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of the [[Binding of Isaac]]. In the game, Isaac's mother receives a message from [[God]] demanding the life of her son as proof of her [[faith]], and Isaac flees into the monster-filled basement of their home where he must fight to survive. Players control Isaac or one of six other unlockable characters through a [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] dungeon in a roguelike manner, fashioned after those of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', defeating monsters in real-time combat while collecting items and power-ups to defeat [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] and eventually Isaac's mother.

The game was the result of a week-long game jam between McMillen and Himsl to develop a ''The Legend of Zelda''-inspired roguelike that allowed McMillen to showcase his feelings about both positive and negative aspects of religion that he had come to discover from conflicts between his Catholic and [[born again]] Christian family members while growing up. McMillen had considered the title a risk but one he could take after the financial success of ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'', and released it without much fanfare to [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in September 2011, not expecting many sales. The game soon gained popularity partially as a result of various [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos showcasing the title. McMillen and Himsl released an expansion "Wrath of the Lamb" in May 2012, but were limited from further expansion due to limitations with the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] platform. They had started working with [[Nintendo]] in 2012 to release a [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] version, but Nintendo later backed out of the deal, citing controversy over the game's religious themes.

Developer [[Nicalis]] worked with McMillen in 2014 to complete a remake of the game, ''[[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth]]'', bringing additional features that McMillen had planned that exceeded Flash's limitation, as well as to improve the game's graphics and enable ports for other systems beyond personal computers, including [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita|Vita]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and the [[Nintendo Switch]]. McMillen is working with James Id to develop ''[[The Legend of Bum-bo]]'', which will serve as a [[prequel]] to ''The Binding of Isaac''.

''The Binding of Isaac'' has been well-received, with critics praising the game's roguelike nature to encourage repeated playthroughs. By July 2014, McMillen reported over 3 million copies had been sold. The game has been said to contribute to renewed interest in the roguelike genre from both players and developers.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:The Binding of Isaac screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''The Binding of Isaac'', showing Isaac attacking (center) and two enemies (top left and top right)]]

''The Binding of Isaac'' is a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] [[dungeon crawl]]er game, presented using [[Sprite (computer graphics)|two-dimensional sprites]], in which the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to the dungeons of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', while incorporating random, [[procedural generation|procedurally-generated]] levels in the manner of a [[roguelike]] game.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/09/binding-of-isaac/ |title = Nightmarish Indie The Binding of Isaac Shooting Up Steam Next Week | date = September 19, 2011 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | first = Jason | last = Scheirer | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a [[shoot 'em up|twin-stick shooter]], but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains [[power-up]]s, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or [[Tarot]] cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-binding-of-isaac-review/ | title = The Binding of Isaac Review | first = Chris | last = Thursten | date = December 17, 2011 | accessdate = April 25, 2016 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a room is cleared of monsters, it will remain clear, allowing the player to re-trace their way through the level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in [[permanent death|permadeath]] and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a [[boss (video game)|boss]] which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level.&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"/&gt; On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, [[Sheol]] contains the boss [[Satan]]. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;

== Plot ==
''The Binding of Isaac''{{'}}s plot is very loosely inspired by the [[Binding of Isaac|biblical story of the same name]].&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Isaac, a child, and his mother live in a small house on a hill, both happily keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing pictures and playing with his toys, and his mother watching Christian broadcasts on television. Isaac's mother then hears "a voice from above", stating her son is corrupted with sin, and needs to be saved. It asks her to remove all that was evil from Isaac, in an attempt to save him. His mother obliges, taking away his toys, drawings, and even his clothes.

The voice once again speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must be cut off from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still questions her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen and walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.

During the game's loading points, Isaac is shown curled up in a ball, crying. His thoughts are visible, ranging among rejection from his mother and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.

== Development and release ==
''The Binding of Isaac'' was developed following the release of ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'', which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When ''Super Meat Boy'' was released to both critical praise and strong sales, he felt that he no longer had to worry about the consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered he could take further risk with the concept.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

''The Binding of Isaac''{{'}}s main concept was the result of a weeklong game jam that McMillen had with Florian Himsl; at the time, his co-contributor on ''Super Meat Boy'', Tommy Refenes, was on vacation. The concept McMillen had was two-fold: to develop a [[roguelike]] title based on the first ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' game's dungeon structure, and to develop a game that addressed McMillen's thoughts on religion.&lt;ref name="postmortem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gamasutra.com/view/feature/182380/postmortem_mcmillen_and_himsls_.php | title = Postmortem: McMillen and Himsl's The Binding of Isaac | first = Edmund | last = McMillen | date = November 28, 2012 | accessdate = December 20, 2015 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; McMillen had been inspired by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the designer of the original ''Zelda'' games.&lt;ref name="goodtimes"/&gt;

Random rooms were created for each floor of the dungeon by selecting ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room.&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt; In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of ''Zelda''{{'}}s dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical ''Zelda'' dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in ''Isaac'' included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within ''Isaac'', mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original ''Zelda'' game.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtoid july2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.com/2011/09/progression.html | title = Progression? | first = Edmund | last = McMillen | date = September 17, 2011 | accessdate = April 25, 2016 | publisher = [[Blogspot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the story side, McMillen explained that the religious tone is based on his own experiences with his family, split between Catholics and born-again Christians.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; McMillen noted that while both sides born out faith from the same Bible, their attitudes were different; he found some of the Catholic rituals his family performed inspiring, while other beliefs they had were condemning of several pastimes McMillen had participated in like ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; He took inspiration from that duality to create ''Isaac''{{'}}s narrative, showing how religion can both instill harmful feelings while also bringing about dark creativity.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; McMillen also considered the scare tactics used by the [[Christian right]] to condemn popular media of the 1980s, such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and video games.&lt;ref name="dtoid july2011"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.destructoid.com/how-a-killer-christian-shmup-roguelike-came-to-steam-206601.phtml | title = How a killer Christian shmup roguelike came to Steam | work = [[Destructoid]] | first = Jonathan | last = Holmes | date = July 21, 2011 | accessdate = April 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McMillen noted how many of the propaganda films from this period features satanic cults that would sacrifice children, and he noted how many Biblical stories mirrored these concepts, subsequently building the story around that.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/community/2011/09/02/interview-with-team-meats-edmund-mcmillen/ | title = The Binding of Isaac: Interview with Team Meat’s Edmund McMillen | first = Rachel | last = Jagielski | date = September 2, 2011 | accessdate = April 25, 2016 | work = [[VentureBeat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he also tended to like "really weird stuff" relating to [[Toilet humour|toilet humor]] and similar types of [[off-color humor]] that did not sit well with his family and which he had explored in previous games before ''Super Meat Boy''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-06-29-the-binding-of-edmund-mcmillen | title = The Binding of Edmund McMillen | date = June 26, 2012 | accessdate = December 20, 2015 | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Super Meat Boy'' helped to make his reputation (including being one of the featured developers in ''[[Indie Game: The Movie]]''), he felt it was a "safe" game considering his preferred type of humor, and used ''Isaac'' to return to this form, considering that the game could easily be "career suicide" but would make a statement about what he really wanted to do.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;

Within the week, they had a working game written in [[Adobe Flash]]'s [[ActionScript]] 2. The two agreed to complete it out as a game they could release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the size and scope of both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an [[ESRB]] rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a [[game demo|demo]] version via the website ''[[Newgrounds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Binding-Isaac-Demo-Released-Big-Update-Way-35870.html | title = The Binding Of Isaac Demo Released, Big Update On The Way | first = Pete | last = Haas | date = October 9, 2011 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | work = Cinema Blend }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-binding-of-isaac-gets-a-grotesque-retail-edition-220544.phtml | title = The Binding of Isaac gets a grotesque retail edition | first = Fraser | last = Brown | date = January 28, 2012 | accessdate = May 10, 2016 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soundtrack ===
Danny Baranowsky, the game's composer and who previously worked with McMillen on ''Super Meat Boy'', was involved early on with the project shortly after the completion of the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to ''The Binding of Isaac'' as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/binding-isaac-cave-story-3d-and-crying-poop-interview-composer-danny-b/ | title = The Binding of Isaac, Cave Story 3D, and crying at poop: an interview with composer Danny B | first = Hollander | last = Cooper | date = October 24, 2011 | accessdate = April 25, 2016 | work = [[Games Radar]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]] for the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series.&lt;ref name="kotaku soundtrack"/&gt; Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.&lt;ref name="kotaku soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5870347/the-best-game-music-of-2011-the-binding-of-isaac | title = The Best Game Music of 2011: The Binding of Isaac | first = Kirk | last = Hamilton | date = December 22, 2011 | accessdate = May 10, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancelled Nintendo 3DS port ===
In January 2012, as the game has surpassed 450,000 units sold, McMillen stated that he was approached by a publisher that had interest in bringing the title to the [[Nintendo 3DS]] as a downloadable title through the [[Nintendo eShop]], though McMillen had reservations given Nintendo's reputation for less risque content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/article/71868/the-binding-of-isaac-mega-expansion-incoming | title = The Binding of Isaac 'mega expansion' incoming |  first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date = January 6, 2012 | accessdate =  December 23, 2015 | work = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late February, McMillen stated that Nintendo had rejected the game because of "questionable religious content". He believed this stemmed from Germany's classification board rating the existing Windows version of the game as "age 16+" due to potentially [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] content, the first such time a game was rated in that manner in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 16er-Einstufung wegen...

He also noted that he was approached about his willingness to make some changes to the game to make it more suitable for the 3DS, but never was given a list of specific changes. McMillen speculated that Nintendo was worried about its reputation; because of the game's resemblance to ''The Legend of Zelda'', an unknowing child could potentially have downloaded the title and been shocked by the content, which would have reflected poorly on Nintendo.&lt;ref name="mcmillen nintendo"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/binding-of-isaac-creator-nintendo-rejection-shows-internal-divisions-over-companys-image/ | title = Binding of Isaac creator: Nintendo rejection shows internal divisions over company’s image | first= Kyle | last= Orland | date = March 6, 2012 | accessdate = May 10, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several game websites were outraged at Nintendo's decision.&lt;ref name="3dsdestructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech 3ds"/&gt; Though disappointed with Nintendo's decision, McMillen did not think the loss of the 3DS port was a major issue, and saw a brief sales burst on Steam as the news was covered in gaming website.&lt;ref name="mcmillen nintendo"/&gt; McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain [[ESRB]] ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.&lt;ref name="3dsdestructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech 3ds"/&gt;

Nintendo would later allow the ''Rebirth'' remake to be released on both the New Nintendo 3DS and the [[Wii U]] in 2015; this came in part for three executives within Nintendo—Steve Singer, the vice president of licensing; Mark Griffin, a senior manager in licensing, and Dan Adelman, the head of indie development—that championed support for ''The Binding of Isaac''.&lt;ref name="polygon new3ds"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/3/8341137/how-a-love-of-nintendo-finally-opened-the-door-for-the-binding-of | title=  How a love of Nintendo opened the door for The Binding of Isaac and why it's only coming to New 3DS | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = April 3, 2015 | accessdate = February 7, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Wrath of the Lamb'' ===
{{Redirect|Wrath of the Lamb|the religious apocalypse|Book of Revelation}}

An expansion to the game, entitled ''Wrath of the Lamb'', was released through Steam on May 28, 2012.&lt;ref name="dlcdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/05/07/the-binding-of-isaacs-wrath-of-the-lamb-begins-may-28/|title=The Binding of Isaac's Wrath of the Lamb begins May 28|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|first=JC|last=Fletcher|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMillen was inspired to create the expansion not only due to the success of the base game, but because his wife Danielle had fully completed the base game, the first game he had written in which she had shown significant interest.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; The expansion adds 70% more content to the original, and contains more than 10 bosses, over 100 items, over 40 unlocks, two additional endings, and two additional optional levels.&lt;ref name="GIdlc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/05/07/huge-binding-of-isaac-expansion-coming-in-may.aspx|title=The Binding of Isaac Expansion Dated|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|first=Jeff|last=Marchiafava|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion added new "alternate" floors, which can replace the normal floors, creating an alternate route through the game. These floors contain harder enemies, and a different set of bosses.  Other features include a new item type, Trinkets, which have a variety of passive or triggered effects when carried, as well as new room types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://gamasutra.com/view/news/129312/McMillen_details_The_Wrath_Of_The_Lamb_as_Binding_Of_Isaac_sells_450k.php | title = McMillen details The Wrath Of The Lamb, as Binding Of Isaac sells 450k | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date =January 30, 2012 | accessdate = April 14, 2016 | first = Lewie | last = Proctor }}&lt;/ref&gt; McMillen had plans to release a second expansion beyond ''Wrath of the Lamb'', but was constrained by the limits of Flash at this point.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

=== ''The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth'' ===
{{Main|The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth}}

Sometime in 2012 after ''Isaac''{{'}} release, McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of [[Nicalis]] who asked if McMillen was interested in bringing the game to consoles. McMillen was interested, but insisted that they would have to reprogram the game to get around the limitations of Flash as to include "Wrath of Lamb" and the second planned expansion, remaking the game's graphics in 16-bit instead of vector-based Flash graphics. Further, McMillen had wanted nothing to do with the business aspects of the game, having recounted the difficulties he had in handling this for ''Super Meat Boy''.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Nicalis agreed to these, and began work in 2012 on what would become ''[[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth]]'', an improved version of the title.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; It was released on November 4, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[PlayStation Vita]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2014/11/04/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-out-now-on-steam-psn/ | title = The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth out now on Steam, PSN | first = Brenna | last = Hillier | date = November 4, 2014 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; with versions for the [[Wii U]], [[New Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Xbox One]] released on July 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2015/07/sacrilegious-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-finally-launches-on-nintendo-systems/ | title = Sacrilegious Binding of Isaac: Rebirth finally launches on Nintendo systems | first = Sam | last = Machkovech | work = [[Ars Technica]] | date = July 23, 2015 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game introduced numerous new playable characters, items, enemies, bosses, challenges, and room layout seeds for floors. A content pack, entitled "Afterbirth" was released for ''Rebirth'' starting October 2015, adding new alternate chapters, characters and items, as well as wave-based Greed mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-08-the-binding-of-isaacs-meaty-afterbirth-expansion-pushes-out-a-release-date | title=The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's meaty Afterbirth expansion pushes out a release date | work=[[Eurogamer]] | publisher=Gamer Network | first=Tom | last=Phillips | date=September 8, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second update, "Afterbirth+", added further additional content and support for user-created [[mod (video gaming)|modifications]], and was released on January 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-08-the-binding-of-isaac-to-receive-mod-tools-dlc | title = The Binding of Isaac to receive mod tools DLC | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = December 8, 2015 | accessdate = December 8, 2015 | work =[[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other games ===
McMillen is currently working with James Id to develop ''[[The Legend of Bum-bo]]'', which McMillen expects to release between December of 2018 or first half of 2019. ''Bum-bo'' is described as a prequel to ''Isaac'', and Isaac and [[Gish (video game)|Gish]] will appear as characters in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/binding-of-isaac-prequel-on-target-for-a-2017-release-459165.phtml | title = Binding of Isaac prequel on target for a 2017 release | first = Kevin | last = Mersereau | date = September 5, 2017 | accessdate = September 5, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac also appears as a playable character in the fighting game ''[[Blade Strangers]]'' and the puzzle game ''[[Crystal Crisis]]''.

On June 27th, 2018, Edmund McMillen announced a card game adaptation in cooperation with [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|Studio 71]] titled ''[[The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1011368569332887553|title=The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Announcement|website=Twitter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''The Binding of Isaac'' received generally favorable reviews from game critics. On [[Metacritic]], the game has an average of 84 out of 100 based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac|title=The Binding of Isaac for PC Metacritic Score|accessdate=November 3, 2011|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Binding of Isaac'' has been received by reviewers as a game with high replayability with the extensive range and combinations of power-ups that the player can encounter during a run-through, while providing an accessible ''Zelda''-inspired framework that most video game players would recognize and easily come to understand.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtoid review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspy review"/&gt; John Teti for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' praised the game for its replayability through the randomization aspects, calling it "the most accessible exploration of the roguelike idea" that he had seen.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-07-the-binding-of-isaac-review|title=The Binding of Isaac Review|first=John|last=Teti|accessdate=November 3, 2011|date=October 7, 2011|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''{{'}}s similarly commented on the lure to replay the game due to its short playthrough time, calling it "an imaginative and quick-witted arcade experience that manages to be both depraved and strangely sweet by turn".&lt;ref name="edge review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.next-gen.biz/reviews/binding-isaac-review | title = The Binding of Isaac Review | date = October 7, 2011 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008084139/http://www.next-gen.biz/reviews/binding-isaac-review | archivedate = October 8, 2011 | accessdate = April 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Maxwell McGee stated that the game smartly has removed extraneous features such that "what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions".&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-binding-of-isaac-review/1900-6346463/ | title = The Binding of Isaac Review | first = Maxwell | last = McGee | date = November 21, 2011 | accessdate = April 14, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the game is considered to be accessible to new players, reviewers found the game to be a difficult challenge, often set by the randomness of what power-ups the player happened to acquire during a single run.&lt;ref name="dtoid review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gspy review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gi review"/&gt; Writers for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated the game an A on a grading scale, and favorably compared the title to McMillen's ''Super Meat Boy'', requiring the player to have "masochistic patience in the face of terrible odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/october-10-2011-63022 | title = Sawbuck Gamer,  October 10, 2011 | work = [[The A.V.

''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Adam Biessener noted that while ''The Binding of Isaac'' had a number of software bugs on release that may briefly detract from the experience, "McMillen’s vision shines through" in the game's playability, art style, and story.&lt;ref name="gi review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_binding_of_isaac/b/pc/archive/2011/10/03/equal-parts-gross-disturbing-and-fun.aspx|title=Equal Parts Gross, Disturbing, And Fun&amp;nbsp;– The Binding of Isaac&amp;nbsp;– PC| work = [[Game Informer]] |date=October 3, 2011|accessdate= November 3, 2011|first=Adam|last=Biessener}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neilie Johnson for ''[[IGN]]'' found that some players may be put off by the game's crudeness but otherwise "it's totally random, highly creative and brutally unforgiving".&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web|first=Neilie|last=Johnson|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/119/1199423p1.html|title=The Binding of Isaac Review&amp;nbsp;– PC Review at IGN|publisher=IGN Entertainment|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 11, 2011|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Nathan Muenier for ''[[GameSpy]]'' noted the game had some shock value that one must work past, but otherwise was " imaginative" and "utterly absorbing".&lt;ref name="gspy review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/1197645p1.html|title=GameSpy: The Binding of Isaac Review&amp;nbsp;– Page 1|publisher=IGN Entertainment|work=[[GameSpy]]|date=September 30, 2011|accessdate=November 3, 2011|first=Nathan|last=Meunier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Jordan Devore for ''[[Destructoid]]'' considered the visual style of the game one of its "biggest selling points", following from McMillen's past style of [[dark comedy]] from ''Super Meat Boy''.&lt;ref name="dtoid review"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/review-the-binding-of-isaac-212806.phtml | title = Review: The Binding of Isaac | work = [[Destructoid]] | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = October 2, 2011 | accessdate = May 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baranowsky's soundtrack was found by reviewers to well-suit the themes of the game, and used appropriately to avoid extensive repetition during a playthrough.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtoid review"/&gt; Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' called the soundtrack as the combination of several genres and the musical styles of [[Danny Elfman]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], and ''[[Music of Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy]]'' that created something "dark and unique".&lt;ref name="kotaku soundtrack"/&gt;

''The Binding of Isaac'' was nominated in the Best Independent Game category at the 2011 [[Spike Video Game Awards]], but lost to ''[[Minecraft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/2011-spike-vga-nominees-announced-zelda-become-first-hall-famer/ | title = 2011 Spike VGA nominees announced, Zelda to become first Hall of Famer | first = Matt | last = Bradford | date = November 17, 2011 | accessdate = May 10, 2016 | work = [[GamesRadar]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMillen had only expected the game to sell a few hundred copies when he released it on Steam. For the first few months of its release, sales were roughly a few hundred per day, but shortly thereafter, McMillen found sales suddenly were boosted, a fact he attributed to numerous [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos that had been published by players to showcase the game and drove sales.&lt;ref name="pcgamer end"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/how-mods-made-the-binding-of-isaac-a-phenomenon-and-why-edmund-mcmillens-laying-it-to-rest/ | title = How mods made The Binding of Isaac a phenomenon, and why Edmund McMillen's laying it to rest | first = Anthony | last=  McGlynn | date = June 5, 2018 | accessdate = June 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity also drew interest by players that wanted to create [[Mod (video gaming)|custom mods]] for the game, which would become a factor in the design of the sequel to better support modding.&lt;ref name="pcgamer end"/&gt; 

By November 2012, the game sold over one million copies, with at least one-quarter of those having purchased the "Wrath of the Lamb" extension.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; As of July 2014, the game has sold over 3 million copies.&lt;ref name="ign roguelike"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/04/roguelikes-the-rebirth-of-the-counterculture | title = Roguelikes: The Rebirth of the Counterculter | first = Mike | last = Mahardy | date = July 4, 2014 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015, following the release of ''Rebirth'', the combined games had over 5 million units sold.&lt;ref name="goodtimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/6746-the-binding-of-edmund-mcmillen.html | title = The Binding of Edmund McMillen | first = Sam | last = Working  | publisher = [[Good Times (newspaper)|Good Times]] | date = July 22, 2015 | accessdate = February 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Binding of Isaac'' is said to be a contributing factor towards the growth of the [[roguelike]] genre since around 2010, with its success paving the way for later games that used the roguelike formula, such as ''[[FTL: Faster Than Light]]'' and ''[[Don't Starve]]''.&lt;ref name="ign roguelike"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/before-spelunky-and-ftl-there-was-only-ascii.html | title = Before Spelunky and FTL, There Was Only ASCII | first = Mark | last = Johnson | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] | date = July 22, 2015 | accessdate = April 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], '''Tjinimin''' is the ancestor of the [[Australian Aborigine|Australian people]]s.  He is associated with the [[bat]] and with Kunmanggur the [[rainbow serpent]].

One story of Tjinimin tells of an argument between him and the Great [[Rainbow Serpent]] where Tjinimin wanted to have sex with Great Rainbow Serpent's consorts, the Green Parrot-Girls.  Upon losing Tjinimin hung upside down in a tree and admired the stars, vowing to never have sex again.  Soon after, his nose falls off, supposedly explaining to the native culture why [[bat]]s in the region have such short noses.

It is the largest cemetery in the world.&lt;ref name="FattahCaso2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hala Mundhir Fattah|author2=Frank Caso|title=A brief history of Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_-hrXU-mWYC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=18 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-5767-2|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery covers {{convert|1485.5|acre|ha sqkm sqmi|2|lk=on}} and contains tens of millions of bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_08/004514.php HOW BIG IS WADI-US-SALAAM CEMETERY?], washingtonmonthly.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It also attracts millions of pilgrims annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Ham|title=Middle East|date=15 Sep 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203591|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery is located near the [[Imam Ali Mosque|shrine]] of [[Imam]] [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Sunni]] Caliph and the first [[Shia]] Imam.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"/&gt; Thus, many Shi'ites in Iraq request that they be buried in this cemetery.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"/&gt; As a result of improved transportation methods, Shi'ites from across the globe are (or seek to be) buried in the cemetery. However, burial at the cemetery "means being placed in one of the cemetery’s many [[catacombs]]."&lt;ref name="Al-Akhbar English"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Qassem Fayyad|title=Wadi al-Salam: A Cemetery to Cleanse Sins|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/wadi-al-salam-cemetery-cleanse-sins#comment-41087|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Al-Akhbar English|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an [[undertaker]] at the cemetery, each [[crypt]] can hold up to 50 bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasser Tabbaa|author2=Sabrina Mervin|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231000287|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial plots are controlled by [[Marja']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Farag|title=Diaspora and Transitional Administration: Shiite Iraqi Diaspora and the Administration of Post-Saddam Hussein Iraq|date=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549410034|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shia traditions==
[[File:Masjid Iraq.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Maqam al-Mahdi in Wadi-us-salam]]
Shia tradition holds that [[Abraham]] bought land in Wadi-us-Salaam and that Ali said the Wadi Al-Salaam was a part of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Dumper|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Stanley|editor2-first=Bruce E.|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079195|page=269|edition=illustrated|quote=There is also the tradition that Abraham bought land in the Wadi as-Salaam (Valley of Peace) that runs through the present city, predicting that it would be from here that 70,000 of those buried in the valley would be guaranteed entrance into paradise and would then be able to intercede with Allah for others. Imam Ali is reported to have said that Wadi as-Salaam was a part of heaven.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia also widely believe that Ali has the power to intercede for the deceased—lessening their suffering—during the passage of their soul from the worldly life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasser Tabbaa|author2=Sabrina Mervin|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231000287|pages=162–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if they are buried there "they will be raised from the dead on judgment day with their spiritual leader."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=MARIA ABI-HABIB|title=In Iraq, War Strains World's Largest Cemetery|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraq-insurgency-puts-strains-on-massive-cemetery-1404868672|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shia are encouraged to bury their dead at the location through religious edicts&lt;ref name="Al-Akhbar English"/&gt; and the cemetery's expansion is also seen as being a result of Shi'isms "more permissive attitude than Sunnism with regard to the commemoration of the dead and the erection of mausoleums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasser Tabbaa|author2=Sabrina Mervin|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231000287|page=162|quote=In addition to historical precedence, there are at least two main factors that have contributed to the expansion of cemeteries around Najaf, and specifically in Wadi al-Salam. First, Shi'ism has developed a somewhat more permissive attitude than Sunnism with regard to the commemoration of the dead and the erection of mausoleums...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rituals carried out before burial in the cemetery include: the body is washed and wrapped at the cemetery, the funeral prayers are conducted in the Imam Ali shrine, the deceased is carried around the shrine three times, and some Quranic verses are recited at the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Farag|title=Diaspora and Transitional Administration: Shiite Iraqi Diaspora and the Administration of Post-Saddam Hussein Iraq|date=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549410034|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Daily burials have been on going for over 1,400 years and the site is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Iraq#Tentative list|Tentative List of UNESCO's World Heritage sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5578/ Wadi Al-Salam Cemetery in Najaf], unesco.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Burials in Najaf have been documented as early as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] eras and ancient [[Mesopotamian]] cities often had similar cemeteries, where there was an accumulation of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasser Tabbaa|author2=Sabrina Mervin|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231000287|page=162|quote=Such burial sites are quite common in ancient Mesopotamian cities, where the accumulation of tombs has created mounds on the outskirts of these early settlements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that during the [[Iraq War]] about 200 to 250 corpses were buried there daily; however, in 2010 this number had decreased to less than 100.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-25-cemetery-iraq_N.htm Najaf cemetery witness to Iraq's tragic history], usatoday.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 500,000 new bodies are interred in the cemetery annually from across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's biggest cemetery: 1,400-year-old Iraqi burial site contains over FIVE MILLION bodies and - as the country descends into new chaos - counting . . .|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2697547/Worlds-biggest-cemetery-1-400-year-old-Iraqi-burial-site-contains-five-million-bodies-counting.html|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=DAILY MAIL|date=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is an increase on the approximately 20,000 bodies, primarily from Iran, that used to be interred annually in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yasser Tabbaa|author2=Sabrina Mervin|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231000287|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Iraqi and many Iranian Shi'ites have a relative buried in the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fair|editor1-first=C.

As of 2014—coinciding with conflict against [[ISIL]]—it has been reported that burial plots are running out, resulting in many being stolen, illegally resold or improvised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCOPRESS|title=A new UNESCO publication pays tribute to Iraqi cultural heritage|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/a_new_unesco_publication_pays_tribute_to_iraqi_cultural_heritage/#.VRiesvyUeSo|accessdate=30 March 2015|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one gravedigger: “I’ve never had it so busy. Not even [[Iraq War|after 2003]] or 2006 [the height of [[Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)|Iraq’s civil war]]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic State: The pushback|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21646752-sustaining-caliphate-turns-out-be-much-harder-declaring-one-islamic-state-not|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=21 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yazidis in Germany''' may refer to people born in or residing in [[Germany]] of full or partial [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] origin.

There is a large Yazidi community in Germany, estimated to be numbering around 60,000 people.&lt;ref name="deutschewelle"/&gt; This makes the German Yazidi community one of the largest Yazidi communities in the Yazidi diaspora.

==Immigration history==
Many Yazidis fled to Germany during the 1990s fearing religious persecution in [[Turkey]]. The Yazidi population of Germany was around 20,000 in 1998.&lt;ref name="adherents"/&gt; Many Yazidi intellectuals also fled during this time and now play a prominent role in Yazidi diaspora affairs and maintain connections with Yazidis in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

==Political activism==
In August, 2014, German Yazidis held protests against the [[persecution of Yazidis by ISIL]]. Between 5,000 and 10,000 people attended the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="deutschewelle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/germany-1000s-protest-yazidi-persecution-iraq-160416354.html |title=Germany: 1000s protest Yazidi persecution in Iraq |publisher=[[Yahoo!

'''Yechiel Fishel Eisenbach''' (1925 &amp;ndash; 4 September 2008) was a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbi and long-time [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] in [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="frum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefrumnews.blogspot.com/2008/09/petirah-of-rav-yechiel-fishel-eisenbach.html |title=Petira of Rav Yechiel Fishel Eisenbach, zt"l |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |publisher=Frum News Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an expert in the writings of the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal]] and the ''[[siddur]]'' of the [[Shalom Sharabi|Rashash]].&lt;ref name="hamodia"&gt;"HaRav Yechiel Fishel Eisenbach". ''[[Hamodia]]'', Israel News, September 11, 2008, p. A23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zchusavos.blogspot.com/2010/08/elul-yartzeits.html |title=Elul Yahrtzeits |publisher=Zchus Avos Yogen Aleinu |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in Jerusalem to Rabbi Yosef Eisenbach, a ''[[sofer]]'' (scribe), and studied in the [[Talmud Torah]] and [[yeshiva]] of Shomrei HaChomot. He was also one of the first students of Yeshivat Beit Avraham-Slonim, which was then led by Rabbi [[Sholom Noach Berezovsky]], the Rebbe of [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]].&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;
 
After his marriage in 1944 to the daughter of Rabbi [[Asher Zelig Margolios]], a noted kabbalist,&lt;ref name="frum"/&gt; Rabbi Eisenbach studied at the [[Pressburg Yeshiva (Jerusalem)|Pressburg Yeshiva]] under Rabbi [[Akiva Sofer]] (the Daas Sofer); the [[Toras Emes]] ([[Chabad]]) yeshiva; and Kollel Shomrei HaChomot. He was well known for his 18-hour day of learning, as well as his humility. Occasionally he gave [[Shiur (Torah)|shiurim]] (lectures) on Torah and fear of God to unmarried students. At different times, he served as [[mashgiach ruchani]] for the Slonim Yeshiva, and as ''[[maggid shiur]]'' (lecturer) for an elite group of students at Toras Emes.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;

==Rosh yeshiva==
In 1973, Rabbi [[Refoel Dovid Auerbach]] of Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva asked Rabbi Eisenbach to assume the mantle of rosh yeshiva after the passing of Rabbi [[Aharon Slotkin]]. Rabbi Eisenbach's proficiency in kabbalah was well known. He knew all the writings of the Arizal and the siddur of the Rashash by heart, and was an expert in [[Jewish services|davening]] with the ''kavannot'' (mystical intentions) of these kabbalistic masters. Over the next 35 years, he taught thousands of students of kabbalah at the yeshiva, as well as began a new study of the ''kavannot'' of the Rashash.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;

==Illness and death==
His health progressively worsened in the two years before his death at the age of 83. ''Hespedim'' (eulogies) were delivered at his yeshiva by Rabbi [[Gamliel Rabinowitz]], a fellow rosh yeshiva of Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva; Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]], yeshiva president; Rabbi Reuven Gross; Rabbi [[Yaakov Hillel]]; and Rabbi Eisenbach's son-in-law, Rabbi [[Moshe Uri Eisenstein]], a rabbi from the [[Givat Shaul]] neighborhood of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt; He was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]].&lt;ref name="frum"/&gt;

Rabbi Eisenbach is survived by two sons, Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Eisenbach and Rabbi Yechezkel Eisenbach, and three sons-in-law: Rabbi Moshe Uri Eisenstein (Rav of the [[Givat Shaul]] neighborhood of Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="frum"/&gt; Rabbi Tovia Miller, and Rabbi Chanina Karpman, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="hamodia"/&gt;
