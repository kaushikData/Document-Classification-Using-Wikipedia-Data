The '''Ambassy Club''' was the first [[private club]] established in [[Shanghai]] since the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]].{{fact|date=September 2013}} It is located on Central [[Huaihai Road]] across from the [[United States]] Consulate, the Consulate of [[Iran]], and near the [[Shanghai Library]].

Although it has many local members, the Ambassy Club has a large number of American and European members. The managers are required to know English.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

The club has several restaurants, each offering a different type of cuisine. There are two upscale restaurants. One offers Japanese cuisine prepared and served in traditional methods. The other offers gourmet Chinese cuisine.  There is also a café-type restaurant, which serves American and European style food, as well as snacks, desserts, pastries, and coffee.  The club also has a unique “piano” bar, which has an exclusive, jazz-club feel.  There is live music nightly, plus a selection of some of the finest liquors and cigars available in China.

The club has both an indoor and an outdoor pool. The outdoor pool has a unique waterslide, and a deck for sunbathing.  A rock-climbing wall, basketball court, and children’s’ playground are also located on the grounds. 

Located within The Ambassy Club is Ambassy Court, a condominium complex of three medium height buildings, and underground parking.  Owners of condominiums also have membership at the club, and access to the Club’s “guest house,” where out of town guests can stay in hotel-like accommodations (complete with housekeeping) on the grounds of the club. &lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ambassyclub.com.cn/pageshow.aspx?id=p3x027&amp;panelid=b3x038&amp;language=EN Ambassy Club - Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013928/http://www.ambassyclub.com.cn/pageshow.aspx?id=p3x027&amp;panelid=b3x038&amp;language=EN |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Ambassy Club comes from an alternate spelling of Embassy, and refers to the proximity of the club to the U.S. and Iranian Consulates. The Chinese name for the club is ''Hong Yi''.

Sometimes, the Bride is implied by calling [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] a Bridegroom. For over 1500 years, the [[Christian Church|Church]] was identified as the bride betrothed to [[Christ]]. However, there are instances of the interpretation of the usage varying from church to church. Most believe that it always refers to the church.

== Christ as a bridegroom ==
In the [[Gospel of John]], [[John the Baptist]] speaks of Jesus Christ as the bridegroom and mentions the bride.

{{quotation| He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: thus my joy therefore is fulfilled.{{Bibleref2c|John|3:29|KJV;NIV1984}}|sign=|source=}}

That is the only place in the Gospels that the bride is mentioned, but because a bridegroom must have a bride, all other mentions of the bridegroom imply the bride.

In the Gospels, when Jesus is asked why his disciples do not fast, but the followers of John and the Pharisees do, Jesus answers: 
{{quotation|And Jesus said unto them, Can the friends of the bridegroom fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.{{Bibleref2c|Mark|2:19|KJV;NIV1984}}}}

In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|9:15}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|2:19}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:34}}, the [[Apostles]] are referred to as the friends, guests, or children depending on the translation, of the Bridegroom commonly accepted to be Jesus Christ.

The Bridegroom is also mentioned in the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt|25:1-13}}
{{quotation|"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."}}

== Mentions of the bride ==

=== Appearance ===
The Book of Revelation repeatedly mentions the appearance of the Bride.

{{quotation|And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
... And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,{{Bibleref2c|Revelation|21:2,9-10|KJV;NIV1984}}}}

In the above passages, [[John the Presbyter|John]], the author of the [[Book of Revelation]], speaks of seeing the bride revealed and refers to her as the [[New Jerusalem]], first mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Revelation|3:12|KJV;NIV1984}}.

{{quotation|And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let him that heareth say, "Come." And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.{{Bibleref2c|Revelation|22:17|NIV1984}}}}

Note - The Greek word for bride is νύμφη (nymfi) as in Revelation 21:2. This word, νύμφη (nymfi), is more specific than that used in chapter 19. Revelation 19:7 which has γυνὴ (gune) means "wife" or "woman". The context of Revelation 19:7 is marriage so this should inform the reader why numerous Bible translations are consistent with the Greek in translating γυνὴ as "bride". She is simply a "woman" getting married - a bride. Bride is the word chosen in translations such as NIV, NLT, ESV, NASB, ISV etc., {{Bibleref2c|Revelation|21:2|KJV;NIV1984}}

== Comparing church to a bride ==

In {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22-33}}, Paul compares the union of husband and wife to that of Christ and the church.&lt;ref name="Osiek"&gt;Osiek, Carolyn. "The Bride of Christ: a problematic wedding - Ephesians 5:22-33." ''Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2002.'' Web: 20 Oct 2010. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LAL/is_1_32/ai_94331936]{dead-link}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of the whole Ephesians letter is reconciliation of the alienated within the unity of the church.&lt;ref name="Osiek" /&gt; {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5}} begins by calling on Christians to imitate God and Christ, who gave himself up for them with love.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph|5:2}} {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1-21}} contains a rather strong warning against foolishness and letting down one's guard against evil. Rather, the author encourages the readers to constantly give thanks with song in their hearts because of what God has done for all in Christ. That prelude to the subject's text takes up again the theme of loving submission that began with the example of Christ in {{Bibleref2-nb|Eph|5:2}}: "Be submissive to one another out of reverence for Christ."{{Bibleref2-nb|Eph|5:21}} It implies that the "Bride" is the body of believers that comprise the universal Christian [[Ecclesia (Church)|''Ekklēsia'' (Church)]] (lit. "called-out ones").

The ''ekklēsia'' is never explicitly called "the bride of Christ" in the New Testament. That is approached in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22-33}}. A major analogy is that of the body. Just as husband and wife are to be "one flesh",{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:31}} this analogy for the writer describes the relationship of Christ and ''ekklēsia''.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:32}} Husbands were exhorted to love their wives "just as Christ loved the ''ekklēsia'' and gave himself for it.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:25}} When Christ nourishes and cherishes the ''ekklēsia,'' he nourishes and cherishes his own flesh. Just as the husband, when he loves his wife is loving his own flesh.{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:28||Eph. 5:28}} Members of the ''ekklēsia'' are "members of his own body" because it is written in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:4}} "and the two shall become one flesh". In {{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:31||Eph. 5:31}} Paul quotes the Genesis passage as what has been called a "divine postscript".&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Broadman, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing to the Church of Corinth in {{Bibleref2|2Cor|||2&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 11}} Paul writes to warn the community of false teachers who would teach of another Christ, and to confess his concern that they will believe someone who teaches a false Christ, other than Christ Jesus of Nazareth whom he preached; Paul referred to the Church in Corinth as being espoused to Christ. "For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have '''espoused you to one husband''', that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him".{{Bibleref2c|2cor|11:2-4||2 Cor. 11:2-4}}

In the writing to the Church in Rome, Paul writes, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should '''be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead''', that we should bring forth fruit unto God" (''emphasis added'').{{Bibleref2c|Romans|7}} Here, Paul seems to suggest that the Church is to be married to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was raised from the dead.

== Other interpretations ==

While the most commonly accepted interpretation of the bride of Christ is the Church, there are other, uncommon interpretations.

=== 144,000 anointed ===
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that the 144,000 are the only ones who will enter the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] and as such believe the Bride is another term among many to refer to the 144,000 who will be allowed to enter.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Old Testament===
The earliest Christian tradition identifies Old Testament texts as symbolic of the divine love of God and people. The love poems of the [[Song of Songs]] and the Latter prophet [[Hosea]] have many references to the sexual correspondence of God and his people.&lt;ref&gt;May, Herbert G. and Metzger, Bruce M. editors. (1977). "The Song of Solomon." The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. Expanded Edition. Revised Standard Version. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 815&lt;/ref&gt; The Prophet Hosea notes his bride in chapter 2, verses 16 and following. The theme of bridal love is central in the dramatic marriage of Hosea.{{Hosea 1:2|date=April 2018}}

'''[[Bulgarians]]''' ({{lang-hu|bolgárok}}) are one of the thirteen officially recognized ethnic minorities in '''[[Hungary]]''' ({{lang-bg|Унгария}}, ''Ungaria''; old name Маджарско, ''Madzharsko'') since the ''Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities Act'' was enacted by the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] on 7 July 1993.&lt;ref name="RelationsProject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.per-usa.org/self_gov.htm |title=Self-government in Hungary: the Romani/Gypsy experience and prospects for the future |accessdate=2007-02-18 |work=Project on ethnic relations |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927105513/http://www.per-usa.org/self_gov.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They number 2,316 and amount to 0.02% of the country's total population according to the 2001 census,&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepszamlalas.hu/eng/volumes/24/tables/load1_1.html |title=1.1  Factors influencing the ethnic affiliation of the population, 2001 |publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office |accessdate=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are estimated between 2,000 and 7,000 according to different authors.&lt;ref name=fakta&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=54&amp;WorkID=1021&amp;Level=1 |chapterurl=http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=54&amp;WorkID=1021&amp;Level=3 |title=Корените и короната |chapter=Няколко опорни исторически факта |publisher=Словото |language=Bulgarian |last=Ватова |first=Пенка |accessdate=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], much of modern Hungary was often under the rule of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. The popular Bulgarian ruler [[Krum of Bulgaria|Krum]] may have been born in [[Pannonia]],&lt;ref name=fine&gt;{{cite book |last=Fine |first=John Van Antwerp |title =The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth century |publisher=University of Michigan Press |date =1983 |pages=94 |isbn =0-472-08149-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bulgarian dukes like [[Salan]], [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], [[Ahtum]], [[Sermon (ruler)|Sermon]] and [[Menumorut]] are mentioned as the lords of [[Syrmia]], [[Banat]], [[Bačka]] and parts of [[Transylvania]] proper in the 9th-11th centuries according to the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''.

The northern Hungarian town of [[Szentendre]] and the surrounding villages were inhabited by Bulgarians since the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 18th century, Szentendre had a Bulgarian neighbourhood of settlers from [[Chiprovtsi]] and a "Chiprovtsi church", indicating refugees from the time of the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]]. A village near [[Visegrád]] was called ''Bolgár falu'' ("Bulgarian village") in the 16th century; Bulgarian refugees fleeing the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule are first mentioned as inhabitants of this area on 30 December 1428. Gradually, however, these Bulgarians were assimilated into the Magyar population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Čiprovecer in Ungarn |language=German |year=2002 |last=Király |first=Péter |publisher=ELTE Szláv Intézet |location=Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Roman Catholicism in Bulgaria|Roman Catholic]] [[Banat Bulgarians]] settled in what is today Hungary as a secondary migration,&lt;ref name=parvite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolgarok.hu/index.php?id=364&amp;L=1 |title=Първите |last=Ченгова-Менхарт |first=Пенка |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2007-02-17 |publisher=Website of the Bulgarian community in Hungary }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing an early and small Banat Bulgarian community in Hungary. In Bulgarian interwar publications, their number is rounded and possibly overestimated at 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Банатските българи |last=Нягулов |first=Благовест |year=1999 |location=Sofia |publisher=Paradigma |language=Bulgarian |chapter=Българите в Банат под властта на държавите-наследнички |isbn=954-9536-13-0 |pages=82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Bulgarian ethnic community is largely descended from [[gardener]]s and other professionals who migrated to [[Austria-Hungary]] in large groups in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries,&lt;ref name=parvite/&gt; prior to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=fakta/&gt; In 1857, Bulgarians in [[Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun]] (not counting [[Pest (city)|Pest]], [[Buda]] and [[Kecskemét]]) numbered 2,815, and their population had not changed significantly in 1870.&lt;ref name=parvite/&gt;

The oldest Bulgarian organization in Hungary, the Association of Bulgarians in Hungary, was founded in 1914 on the initiative of Lazar Ivanov from [[Teteven]]. The Bulgarian Church Community was founded in 1916 and the first Bulgarian school in 1918.&lt;ref name=bolgarok&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolgarok.hu/index.php?id=20&amp;L=1 |title=Дружеството на българите в Унгария |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2007-02-17 |publisher=Website of the Bulgarian community in Hungary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Bulgarian community has diversified to a great extent.&lt;ref name=fakta/&gt;

The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox]] church of Ss. [[Cyril and Methodius]] in [[Ferencváros]], [[Budapest]] was constructed in 1932.&lt;ref name=church&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolgarok.hu/index.php?id=17&amp;L=1 |title=Българска православна църква |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2007-02-17 |publisher=Website of the Bulgarian community in Hungary }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bulgarian newspaper, ''Balgarski vesti'', and a Bulgarian magazine, ''Hemus'', are published by the Bulgarian community, as well as various books. There exist a number of folk dance groups, a theatre, several orchestras, a Bulgarian school for the native language and a Bulgarian-Hungarian secondary school for languages named after [[Hristo Botev]].

==Studies==
Victor Moses had his spiritual formation&lt;ref name="Prabhu"/&gt; at the [[Protestant]] [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad]], a Seminary affiliated to India's first University, the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]], a Section 2(f) University within the meaning of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]].  The [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society under the aegis of its President, [[S. W. Schmitthenner]] was instrumental in sending Victor Moses for spiritual formation at the [[Protestant]] Seminary&lt;ref name="Daiva"/&gt; where Victor Moses had developed interest in the [[Sacred Scriptures]], especially the [[Old Testament]] after being groomed by [[Victor Premasagar]] and G. Babu Rao, then [[Old Testament]] Scholars at the [[Protestant]] Seminary.  Other Spiritual Formators at the [[Protestant]] Seminary where Victor Moses studied included [[Ravela Joseph]] and [[M. Victor Paul]].

Subsequently, Victor Moses was assigned pastoral roles in the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society.  Later, the Church Society sent Victor Moses in 1986&lt;ref name="Directory"&gt;[[Gnana Robinson]] (Edited), Directory of the United Theological College, Bangalore, 1910-1997, Bangalore, 1997, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] where Victor Moses undertook postgraduate studies specializing in [[Old Testament]] under [[Theodore N. Swanson]] and [[E. C. John]]&lt;ref name="Directory"/&gt; and [[D. N. Premnath]]&lt;ref name="Directory"/&gt;  working out a dissertation entitled ''The concept of remnant in the prophetical books of the Old Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Victor Moses, ''The concept of remnant in the prophetical books of the Old Testament'' in ''Thesis Titles'', [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], Bangalore, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988,&lt;ref name="Directory"/&gt; Victor Moses returned to take up ecclesiastical duties with the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society.

==Teaching and academics==
The [[Gurukul Lutheran Theological College]], affiliated to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] invited&lt;ref name="Prabhu"/&gt; Victor Moses to teach [[Old Testament]].

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3663292.stm Mali's human sacrifice - myth or reality?], BBC News Africa (September 20, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the harmful practice of removing body parts, blood or tissue from a child who is still alive.&lt;ref name="wvi.org"&gt;Nkimba, K. (2015). [http://www.wvi.org/sites/default/files/Community%20Amber-Alert%20against%20child%20sacrifice.pdf "Impact Stories: Testimonies of Change CAACS Project"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and context ==
=== Issue ===
Rural districts near [[Kampala]], Uganda's capital, have been badly affected by kidnappings of vulnerable people, children in particular, for sacrificial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sseppuuya David, “Christians Unite against Human Sacrifice”, The New Vision (Uganda) Tuesday, February 24, 2009, P.12&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modern phenomenon that is pretending to be part of the country's old custom, through the use of traditional medicine, which roughly 80% of people rely on.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasilo, O., &amp; Trapsida, J. M. (n.d.) [http://www.aho.afro.who.int/sites/default/files/ahm/reports/34/ahm-13-special-issue-pages-25to31.pdf "Regulation of Traditional Medicine in the WHO African Region | African Health Observatory"]&lt;/ref&gt; Villages have been left gripped by fear and bewilderment from such activities. In exposed communities’, roadsides posters, workshops, and alert systems have been erected to warn children and their families of the danger posed by [[Witch Doctor]]s abducting for the purpose of child sacrifice.&lt;ref name="wvi.org"/&gt;

=== Motive ===
Witchdoctors, who also identify as traditional healers, will consult the spirits for anyone who can pay their fee.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The spirits will communicate via them the kind of sacrifice for appeasement that they want.  Often these sacrifices are chickens or goats, but when such sacrifices fail to make the client prosper instantly, ‘the spirits' will demand human sacrifices.&lt;ref name=rogers&gt;Rogers, C (2011). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15255357#story_continues_1 "Where child sacrifice is a business"] BBC News Africa (11 October).&lt;/ref&gt;

The witchdoctors themselves may believe that this is indeed a powerful magical ritual, but in other cases, it is a strategy used to give the client an impossible task so that the witchdoctor does not appear to have failed. The witchdoctor is able to gain a lot of wealth by facilitating and carrying out human sacrifices as the fee charged is normally very high.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;
The desire for instant wealth on the part of the client and greed on the part of the witchdoctor has created a ready market for children to be bought and sold at a price. Children have become a commodity of exchange and child sacrifice is more than a religious or cultural issue, it has become a commercial business.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

=== Causes ===
Children are often victims of sacrifice for various reasons, the most common being they are relatively easy to abduct.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The vulnerability of a child in comparison to an adult is much higher, children are more easily lured in or unable to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, Ann-Charlotte. (2013). [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=Aj-OAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Children and youth in armed conflict"] 2 vols. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill. P 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reason children are abducted is that spiritually they are seen as more ‘pure’; a sacrifice that is “pure” or “unblemished” is believed to bring better results.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Smitheram, E. (2014, March 4). [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/04/child-sacrifice-uganda-mutilation-witch-doctor#comments "How one charity is working to prevent child sacrifice in Uganda"]. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaawa-Mafigiri&gt;Kawaawa-Mafigiri, D., &amp; Walakira, E. (2009). [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=PRX1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=protection+from+sacrifice+uganda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRmZbI7JTWAhUCE7wKHZotAWAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Child Abuse and Neglect in Uganda"] (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt; If a child has been circumcised, scarred or has had their ears pricked this represents disfigurement or impurity and they may be spared from sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Kawaawa-Mafigiri"/&gt; Some parents have marked their children in these ways to protect them.&lt;ref name="Kawaawa-Mafigiri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;
In other cases children are given to witchdoctors by relatives out of desperation for money; a child's' life is worth a high price and it provides instant money for struggling families.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;
Another cause for children being abducted is the belief that children represent new growing life, and offering them as a sacrifice will bring prosperity and growth to the one procuring the sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Mbogoni, L. E. (2014).[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=szgMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Human+sacrifice+and+the+supernatural+in+African+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o9aaqx0vF1&amp;sig=23NeuEMN1sn8LAc8Qn2zZ9EyDfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj78vS885TWAhWHTLwKHWAVAooQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Human sacrifice and the supernatural in African History"]. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: Mkuki na Nyota Pub. P. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
Generally, a witchdoctor will try other methods first to bring about change of a person’s misfortunes or desires using herbal remedies or animal sacrifices.&lt;ref name="kidsrights.org"&gt;KidsRights Foundation. (2014). [https://kidsrights.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/No%20Small%20Sacrifice%20-%20Child%20Sacrifice%20in%20Uganda%2C%20in%20a%20global%20context%20of%20cultural%20violence_0.pdf "No Small Sacrifice Child Sacrifice in Uganda, in a global context of cultural violence"]&lt;/ref&gt;
When change is not successful, resorting to child sacrifice is proposed because it is believed to be the most powerful.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;
When a child is sacrificed, the witch doctor and his accomplices will generally undertake the whole process.&lt;ref name=Jubilee&gt;Jubilee Campaign and Kyampisi Childcare Ministries. (2011) [http://www.jubileecampaign.co.uk/child-sacrifice-report "Child Sacrifice in Uganda - report"]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes: the [[Witch-hunt]], the abduction, followed by the removal of certain body parts, the making of a potion and lastly if required the discarding of the child's body.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The removal of body parts depends on the type of outcome desired, most commonly heads, limbs, tongues, genitals, eyes, teeth, and organs are removed.&lt;ref name="kidsrights.org"/&gt;
The child is usually alive during the removal process, but figures suggest only a very small proportion of children survive.&lt;ref name="charismanews.com"&gt;Thomas, G. (2017, March 24). [https://www.charismanews.com/world/63830-the-country-where-sacrificing-children-is-a-thriving-business "The Country Where Sacrificing Children Is a Thriving Business"]&lt;/ref&gt;
One type of sacrifice is the removal of blood, it is then used in medicines or mixed with herbs.&lt;ref name="kidsrights.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; It will be used in the place where success, healing or wealth is desired. In other cases a child is buried under foundation either dead or alive or only hands, feet and genitals to bring good luck to the new building.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;

=== Effects === 
A child that survives sacrifice is left with traumatizing consequences for the rest of their lives. Most commonly survivors are left with large scars across their body, head and neck in particular.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; Genital mutilation is also common. Survivors are left with urinary issues and distorted puberty development.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The psychological damage to children affects their entire development; victims can struggle to develop ‘normal’ relationships after such an attack.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; Families are also affected as parents often bear the financial burden of covering short-term or long-term treatment.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

== Perpetrators ==
=== Background ===
A study of the Ugandan context shows great disparity between the rich elite and the average Ugandan who struggles to make ends meet. It is almost impossible for someone born in a poor family to climb up on the social ladder.  The gap between the rich and the poor combined with discontent with the political status quo, endemic corruption and general feeling that the country has lost direction breeds a lot of discontent and frustration. It is in such an environment that the witchdoctors thrive, promising desperate people a miraculous way to bridge the gap from have-not to have, from failure to success and from poverty to wealth.&lt;ref name=whewell&gt;Whewell, T (2010).[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8441813.stm "A BBC investigation into human sacrifice in Uganda"] BBC News. Newsnight. (7 January).&lt;/ref&gt;

The small elite who gained wealth in a relatively short time during Uganda’s economic boom in the early 21st century is an example promoted by witchdoctors for their successful profession. They claim that they have aided many of the nouveau riche to gain their wealth. According to the head of the country's Anti-Human Sacrifice Taskforce, the child sacrifice is directly linked to rising levels of development and prosperity, and an increasing belief that witchcraft can help people get rich quickly.&lt;ref name="whewell"/&gt;

=== Witchdoctors and Traditional Healers === 
All witchdoctors identify as traditional healers but not all traditional healers are witchdoctors and most do not perform child sacrifice.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Jubilee Campaign and Kyampisi Childcare Ministries. (2011)[http://www.jubileecampaign.co.uk/child-sacrifice-report "Child Sacrifice in Uganda - report"]&lt;/ref&gt; This identification has caused witchcraft to be associated with the healing practices of the indigenous culture; generating a rise in fascination with witchcraft.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;  This has resulted in a damaged reputation of those traditional healers and herbalists who do not use human flesh but are still blamed for these crimes.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

=== Rationale ===
Mike Chibata the top law enforcer of Uganda said the growing appeal is due to superstition and a desire to get rich quick that people buy into; witchdoctors tell them that child sacrifice is the best spell and that it is needed.&lt;ref name="charismanews.com"/&gt;  
It is thought that child sacrifice increases the power of a witchdoctors magic because it makes the charms, amulets or talismans that are given to clients, stronger.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; For this reason, witchdoctors stay practicing, along with great financial benefit. Witchdoctors are now in a difficult place. They have the fear that if they continue they will be sentenced or that if they stop the spirits will go against them and kill them.&lt;ref name="Uganda Child Sacrifice"&gt;Angela, P. (2010, January 16). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc02G1rht7g "Uganda Child Sacrifice"] Interview by T. Whewell. In Our World Documentary. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased risk === 
There is an increased risk of child sacrifice and increased work for witchdoctors around the elections. This is because high-profile Ugandans have brought into the practice by being convinced they need to sacrifice a child to win a seat as an MP.&lt;ref&gt;AFP. (2015, June 15). [http://jrnl.ie/2162022 "If they're told to win a seat as an MP 'You must sacrifice a child', they'll do it"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case Studies ==

=== Survivor ===
BBC news investigated a seven-year-old boy called Allan Ssembatya.&lt;ref name=S&gt;Ssembatya, A. (2010, January 16). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc02G1rht7g "Uganda Child Sacrifice"] Interview by T. Whewell. In Our World Documentary. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;  
He was attacked by a local witchdoctor and two acquaintances on his way home from school while walking with friends.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;  
In the witchdoctor's shrine he was struck on the neck, across the shoulders, and in the head with a machete.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;  
One of his testicles was removed and he was left for dead in a bush, he survived, but was in a coma for a month.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;  The local witchdoctor admitted to this but the case is still pending due to slow investigation and allegation of corruption. Allan’s family had to move homes and jobs to get through the ordeal and there are still adverse effects to this day.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

=== Killed victim === 
Steven (Emmanuel) Kironde was killed at the age of six in 2009.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;Akbar, J. (2016, June 17). [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3126758/Snatched-way-school-castrated-decapitated-Horrifying-rise-child-human-sacrifice-Uganda-hands-witch-doctors.html "Snatched on their way to school then castrated or decapitated: Horrifying rise in child human sacrifice in Uganda at the hands of witch doctors"]&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the care of his grandmother, who left the family home briefly for an errand, when he was abducted.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; His body was found the next morning decapitated behind the house.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The witchdoctor was arrested but three weeks later the police offered a pay out to the grandmother to drop the case.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; This was declined and further developments have not been made.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  There are several cases like this in the court system.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

=== Former witchdoctor ===
Polino Angela gave up this work in 1990 since then he has dedicated his time to converting 2,400 other witchdoctors.&lt;ref name="Uganda Child Sacrifice"/&gt;  He admitted to killing seventy children including his own ten-year-old son in his past.&lt;ref name="Uganda Child Sacrifice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whewell"/&gt; James Nsaba Buturo, the Minister of Ethics and Integrity agreed with Polino’s approach stating persuading change is better than retrospective punishment, which would cause a problem for justice.&lt;ref name="whewell"/&gt;

== Statistics == 
Statistics of child sacrifice can be hard to accurately gauge in Uganda.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;
The Uganda Human Rights Commission published a report in 2014 that warned of an underestimation of cases.&lt;ref name=u&gt;Uganda Human Rights Commission. (2014). "Child sacrifice in Uganda and its human rights implications: A research study"&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was based on late claims and tampering of crime scenes.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;
Over 2007 and 2008 there was an 800% rise in the number of reported ritual sacrifice cases.&lt;ref&gt;Bienvenu, M. (2010). [http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ppe/Events/uniconf_2011/documents/Bienvenu.Mathilde.FinalPaper.pdf "Child Sacrifice in Uganda"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Abuse and Neglect (ANPPCAN) reported that almost 3000 children disappear from their homes every year.&lt;ref&gt;ANPPCAN. (2016). [http://www.anppcan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Annual-Report_ANPPCAN-2016.pdf/uploads/2014/11/Annual-Report_ANPPCAN-2016.pdf "The African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child Abuse and Neglect"]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not close to the reported number. A UNICEF report stated 13 cases of child sacrifice were reported in 2014 and 2015 and six of the 2015 ones were related to elections.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

== Current Law ==

=== Legislation === 
There are three pieces of legislation currently governing child sacrifice in Uganda. The most recent of these was the October 2009 Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, this contained relevant sections on trafficking for the use of body parts.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic of Uganda. (2009). [https://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2015/7 "The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this there was only the Witchcraft Act of 1957 and the Children’s Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic of Uganda. (1957). [https://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/124 "The Witchcraft Act"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Republic of Uganda. (1997). [https://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/59 "Children Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; Child sacrifice through witchcraft has been allowed because the authorities did not implement the Witchcraft Act on the ground.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The Act itself is hard to try anyone under because of its vague expression.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; Child sacrifice is not specifically mentioned in it.  This means that giving a maximum sentence for the murder of a child by sacrifice is extremely difficult and the courts rarely use it.
&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; 
In 2016 an amendment to the Children’s Act was passed. Under clause 10 it protects children from violence and provides a right to access child protection services.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic of Uganda. (2016.)[https://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2016/2016/Children%20%28Amendment%29%20Act%202016.pdf "The Children (Amendment) Act"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uni&gt;Unicef. (2016). [https://www.unicef.org/uganda/UGTheChildrenAmendmentActFinalWeb.pdf "The Children Act Amendment 2016"]&lt;/ref&gt;  This development for Uganda specifically prohibits child sacrifice, trafficking, sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation.&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt; It also ensures a service for children who have been victims and sets a mandatory structure for reporting abuse.&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt;

=== Anti-Human Sacrifice and Trafficking Task Force ===
This force was created in 2009 along with the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act. The government established the force with the intention that they would to oversee and coordinate investigations, collect statistics and work with the general public to stop this practice.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; The Force are covering more cases than before its establishment, but there is still a struggle to gain adequate evidence for convictions.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;

The task force consists of an officer with a motorcycle and it works without a proper budget.&lt;ref name="marco"/&gt; Consequently, many Ugandans believe that the gesture of the Ugandan government is more a matter of window dressing to avert local and international criticism than a genuine attempt.

=== International Obligations === 
Uganda is obliged under multiple treaties to protect the rights of children. The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child requires Uganda to act in the best interest of the countries children by ensuring they all have basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1989) [http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/crc.pdf "Convention on the Rights of the Child"]&lt;/ref&gt; Uganda also ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.&lt;ref name="achpr.org"&gt;African Unity. (1987) [http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/ "The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights"]&lt;/ref&gt; Several articles within this charter set out clear obligations to protect human rights. In particular Article 4 and 5 protect everyone's right to life and freedom from bad and cruel treatment.&lt;ref name="achpr.org"/&gt; Article 18 specifically identifies the protection for children.&lt;ref name="achpr.org"/&gt; This international instrument works to promote and protect basic human freedoms and human rights throughout [[Africa]]. Uganda is obliged to fulfill these expectations by continuously establishing state mechanisms to prevent tragedies like child sacrifice.

== Awareness ==
{{POV section|date=February 2014}}
The issue of child sacrifice in Uganda has been highlighted in the media over the past three years with ABC (Australia) and BBC producing compelling reports and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;ABC 2009.  [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-23/men-severed-albino-boys-legs-in-ritual -killing/1439848 "Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing"] ABC News. (23 September).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;; BBC 2010. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/uganda/6944292/Human-sacrifices-on-the-rise-in-Uganda-as-witch-doctors-admit-to-rituals.html "Human sacrifices 'on the rise in Uganda' as witch doctors admit to rituals"] BBC Investigation quoted in the Telegraph (7 January).&lt;/ref&gt; 
The media attention coincided with media campaigns by Ugandan NGOs such as RACHO, ANPPCAN-Uganda, faith-based organisations such as Kyampisi Childcare Ministries (KCM) and Rose's Journey—a collective effort of Ugandans and friends of Uganda to end child sacrifice.&lt;ref name=marco&gt;Vernaschi, Marco 2010. Child Sacrifice in Uganda. Pulitzer center (April 16): http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/uganda-child-sacrifice-not-cultural-issue&lt;/ref&gt;

The media attention has put the government of Uganda under pressure to be seen as doing something about the issue of child sacrifice. This resulted in the formation of the official government task force, the new bill, and the 2016 amendment.

== Future development ==
There was previously an issue with the application and implementation of relevant legislation on the ground and in court.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt; To make this change in legislation successful its effects will need to be taught properly to the Task Force, where change can start from the ground. 
The second area of concern is within the court systems. Cases on child sacrifice currently go straight into the general court system.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;
Cases get held up easily and take a long time to actually go through.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;  
A department of court set up to specifically tackle child sacrifice cases would provide a suitable structure for victims and their families. This has been supported by local authorities because it will help simplify the monitoring of activities.&lt;ref name="Jubilee"/&gt;

Many sites more or less participatory have emerged since then, such as [[Rue89]], [[The Huffington Post]], [[Mediapart]] and [[Atlantico]]. It can be compared to the Korean site [[OhmyNews]].

In January, 2013, near 8000 volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcom.biz/partenaires/95-c4n-le-media-participatif |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507045949/http://www.globalcom.biz/partenaires/95-c4n-le-media-participatif |archivedate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enrolled as editors on the French website. They are 10525 reporters today. At that time, the site had more than a thousand of volunteer moderators. Many categories have emerged since the launching of Come4News : Politics, environment, Education, Healthcare, Economics, Sports...

This article is about the '''[[demographics|demographic]] features of Argentina''', including population density, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Economy of Argentina|economic status]] and other aspects of the population.

In the {{census-ar|2001}}, [[Argentina]] had a population of 36,260,130 inhabitants, and preliminary results from the {{census-ar|2010}} census were of 40,091,359 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="pop2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/proyecciones_provinciales_vol31.pdf |title=Proyecciones provinciales de población por sexo y grupos de edad 2001–2015 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |work=Gustavo Pérez |format=pdf |publisher=[[INDEC]] |page=16 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706084227/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/proyecciones_provinciales_vol31.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censo2010.indec.gov.ar/ Censo 2010: Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina ranks third in South America in total population and 33rd globally. Population density is of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area, well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2008 was estimated to be 0.92% annually, with a birth rate of 16.32 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.54 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.

The proportion of people under 15, at 24.6%, is somewhat below the world average (28%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 10.8%. The percentage of [[senior citizens]] in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 7%.

Argentina's population has long had one of Latin America's lowest birth rates and [[population growth rate]]s (recently, about 1% a year), but it enjoys a comparatively low [[infant mortality rate]]. The median age is approximately 30 years and [[life expectancy]] at birth is of 76 years. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 8.3% speak Portuguese&lt;ref name="p12-cc"&gt;Página/12, 27 December 2006. [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-78287-2006-12-27.html Los idiomas de los argentinos]&lt;/ref&gt; and 6.9% speak Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/AR|title=Argentina|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities==
{{See also|List of cities in Argentina by population}}
Argentina is highly urbanized,&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] metropolitan area totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.&lt;ref name=majorcities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1484 |title=Major Cities |publisher=Government of Argentina |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919212817/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1484 |archivedate=19 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolitan areas of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] have around 1.3&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants each,&lt;ref name=majorcities/&gt; and six other cities ([[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], [[La Plata]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]] and [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]])&lt;ref name=majorcities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turismo.municipalidad-salta.gov.ar:8081/ubicacion.aspx |title=Ubicacion |publisher=Directorate-General of Tourism, Municipality of the City of Salta |accessdate=2009-09-03 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117032939/http://turismo.municipalidad-salta.gov.ar:8081/ubicacion.aspx |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; have at least half a million people each.

The population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with about 60% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in [[Buenos Aires Province]], and 3 million each in [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba Province]], [[Santa Fe Province]] and the [[Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]]. Seven other provinces each have about one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Entre Ríos, Salta, Chaco, Corrientes and Misiones. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 60 inhabitants/km², the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has less than 1 inhabitant/km².

In the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the [[Near East|Near]] and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigration receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 June 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 June 2007|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |title=European Immigration into Latin America, 1870–1930 |last=Sánchez-Alonso |first=Blanca |publisher=Universidad San Pablo-CEU |location=Madrid |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |archivedate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.&lt;ref name=rock&gt;Rock, David. ''Argentina, 1516–1982.'' University of California Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|redevelopment of Paris]]. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish [[urban planning|grid style]], centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a ''damero'', meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by [[Pedro Benoit]], combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edelap.com.ar/120/llego.htm |title=EDELAP – 120 años de alumbrado público |publisher=Edelap.com.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513053936/http://www.edelap.com.ar/120/llego.htm |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vital statistics==
The table below gives an overview of the number of birth and deaths in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to construct the table.&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Mitchell. International historical statistics: the Americas, 1750–2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001|title=Demographic Yearbook System|website=Unstats.un.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deis.msal.gov.ar/index.php/serie-5-estadisticas-vitales/ |title=Serie 5 – Estadísticas Vitales |accessdate=2018-10-08 }} Dirección de Estadística e Información de Salud&lt;/ref&gt; The number of births in 2010 (756,176) was the highest number ever recorded. The number of deaths in 2010 also was the highest ever record. However, as the population of Argentina showed a sixfold increase during the past century, the birth and death rates in 2010 (18.7 and 7.9, respectively) were rather low in a historical perspective.

==Other demographics statistics==
Between the 18th and 19th centuries, Argentina received more than 6.6 million immigrants, second only to the United States, which helped the country's population double every 20 years.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Most Argentines are descended from several European ethnic groups, with more than 55% having Italian origins. The second-most common ethnic origin is Spanish. About 17% have French origins, and about 8% are descended from German immigrants. Argentina today has a large Arab population, most of whom are from Syria and Lebanon.There are also about 180,000 Asian people, mostly of Chinese and Korean origins.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

The Argentine government estimates there are 750,000 residents without official documents, many of whom immigrated from Paraguay, Peru, and Bolivia.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Argentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s and then becoming more gradual.&lt;ref name = "cia.gov1"/&gt;

Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor.&lt;ref name = "cia.gov1"/&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
{{main article|Argentine Amerindians}}
[[File:AborigenesDistribucion.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina]]
According to the data of [[INDEC]]'s Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the [[Mapuche]]s, who live mostly in the south, the [[Qulla people|Kollas]] and [[Wichí people|Wichís]], from the northwest, and the [[Guaraní people|Guarani]]s and [[Qom people|Qom]], who live mostly in the northeast.&lt;ref name=encuesta/&gt;
In the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.

===Immigration to Argentina===
{{main article|Immigration to Argentina}}

====European settlement====
As with other areas of new settlement such as [[Demography of Canada|Canada]], [[Demography of Australia|Australia]], the [[Demography of the United States|United States]], [[Demography of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Demography of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Demography of the united kingdom|The United Kingdom]], [[Demographics of the United Arab Emirates|The United Arab Emirates]] and [[Demographics of Singapore|Singapore]], Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669|title=About Argentina|publisher=Government of Argentina|accessdate=2009-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919230812/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669|archivedate=19 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27&amp;nbsp;million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the [[immigration to Argentina]] becomes evident.

In the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians&lt;ref name=encuesta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina]]|title=Encuesta Complementaria de Pueblos Indígenas 2004–2005|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 6.2&amp;nbsp;million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.
[[File:Non-native population in Argentina.png|thumb|250px|Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)]]
The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.

Italian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between [[Piedmont]], Veneto and [[Lombardy]], later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feditalia.org.ar/arg/federaciones/feditalia_org_fed_regionales.html |title=Federaciones Regionales |publisher=Feditalia.org.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Argentines have the gentilic of an Italian city, place, street or occupation of the immigrant as last name, many of them were not necessarily born Italians, but once they did the roles of immigration in Italy the name usually changed. [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] immigrants were mainly [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Basque Argentine|Basques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdtradition.net/historical-references.php |title=Historical references |publisher=Cdtradition.net |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108073617/http://www.cdtradition.net/historical-references.php |archivedate=8 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos14/gallegos/gallegos.shtml |title=Monografías |publisher=Monografias.com |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thousands of immigrants also came from [[French Argentine|France]] (notably [[Béarn]] and the [[Northern Basque Country]]), [[German Argentine|Germany]], though most to Mexico.

[[Illegal immigration]] has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador. 
The Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called ''Patria Grande'' ("Greater Homeland")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriagrande.gov.ar |title=Patria Grande |publisher=Patriagrande.gov.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2007/07/21/noticia_0035.html |title=Alientan la mudanza de extranjeros hacia el interior – Sociedad – |publisher=Perfil.com |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main article|Languages of Argentina}}

The [[official language]] of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the '''River Plate Spanish''' ({{Lang-es|link=no|Castellano Rioplatense}}), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the [[Río de la Plata]] basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread [[voseo]], the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'' for the [[You|second person singular]].

===Non-indigenous minority languages===
Many Argentines also speak other [[languages of Europe|European]] languages (Italian, Portuguese, French, [[Welsh language|Welsh]], German, [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] and [[Croatian Language|Croatian]], as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|ar|Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).&lt;ref name="p12-cc"/&gt;

[[Standard German]] is spoken by around 500,000&lt;ref name="LAR"&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AR Online version: Languages of Argentina], Retrieved on 2007-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WorldLanguage [http://www.worldlanguage.com/Italian/Countries/Argentina.htm website]. Retrieved on 2007-01-29&lt;/ref&gt; Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/spa/swissinfo.html?siteSect=43&amp;sid=7080052|title=Rápida recuperación económica tras la grave crisis|website=Swissinfo.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.

There are sources of around one million [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers in Argentina,&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.
More than 30000 Argentinian citizens speak [[Albanian language|Albanian]], due to the great Albanian community living in the country since decades.

There is a prosperous community of Argentine [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speakers of approximately 25,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AR |title=Language of Argentina |accessdate=2008-08-21 |author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International |quote=Welsh (25,000) }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], in the [[Patagonia]] region, who descend from [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|19th century immigrants]].

The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but until 1994 the President and Vice President had to be Catholic. The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.

Estimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;Marita Carballo. ''Valores good food here al cambio del milenio'' {{ISBN|950-794-064-2}}.

[[Image:Belize-demography.png|thumb|400px|Belize's population, 1961-2003.]]

[[Belize]] is the most sparsely populated nation in [[Central America]]. It is larger than [[El Salvador]]. Slightly more than half of the people live in rural areas. About one-fourth live in [[Belize City]], the principal port, commercial centre,&lt;!--Not center please as it was a British colony until 1981--&gt; and former capital. About 80% of the population are [[Christian]].

Most Belizeans are of multiracial descent. About 34% of the population is of mixed [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and [[Europe]]an descent ([[Mestizo]]), 35% are [[Belizean Kriol people|Kriol]]s, about 10.6% are Maya, and about 6.1% are Afro-Amerindian ([[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]).&lt;ref name="2000 Belize Census"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining population includes European, East Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, and North American groups. In the case of Europeans, most are descendants of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[British people|British]] colonial settlers, whether pure-blooded or mixed with each other. Most Spanish left the nation just after it was taken by the British colonists who, in the same way, left after independence. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[German people|German]] [[Mennonites]] settled in Belize, mostly in isolated areas.

==Population==
[[File:Belize Population Pyramid for 2010.svg|thumb|300px|[[Population pyramid]] for Belize (2010).]]
According to the 2015 revision of the CIA World Fact Book the estimated mid year population of 2016 is 347,369&lt;ref name="CIABELIZE"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html|title= Central America and Caribbean :: BELIZE|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with a census of the British Empire, census data was compiled for Belize in 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1946.  Belize conducted its own censuses in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1991 and in 2000.  None has been held since then.

==Ethnic groups==
Most Belizeans are of multiracial descent. About 52.9% are [[Mestizo]], 25.9% [[Creole peoples|Creole]], 11.3% [[Maya peoples|Maya]], 6.1.% [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], 3.9% [[Indo-Caribbean|East Indian]],  3.6% [[Mennonites]], 1.2% [[White people|White]], 1% [[Asians|Asian]], 1.2% Other and 0.3% Unknown.&lt;ref name="CIABELIZE"/&gt;

In the case of Europeans, most are descendants of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[British people|British]] colonial settlers, whether pure-blooded or mixed with each other. Most Spanish left the nation just after it was taken by the British colonists who, in the same way, left after independence. Beginning in 1958, [[German people|German]] [[Mennonites]] of [[Russian Mennonite|"Russian" Mennonite]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] heritage settled in Belize, mostly in isolated areas.

=== Maya ===
Because Belize's original Maya peoples were decimated by disease and wars, or fled to Mexico and Guatemala, many of the country's Maya today are descended from other groups. The current Maya population consists mainly of three language groups.  The Yucatec fled to Belize in the late 1840s to escape the [[Caste War]] in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Mexico]].  Their descendants live in the [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] and [[Corozal District|Corozal]] districts, which border on Mexico. Before the massive migration of Yucatec Maya from Mexico to Belize, a local Yucatec Maya group named the Iciache Maya already inhabited the land. Today most Yucatec Maya work in the sugar cane. In the 1870s-1880s, many [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] fled from Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, where their lands were being stolen for coffee plantations, which then enslaved them. They settled villages in the Toledo district.

Living near rivers and streams, they are primarily farmers, though many younger people now work in tourism, and on shrimp, banana and citrus plantations. The [[Mopan people|Mopan]]s originated in Belize, but most were driven out to [[Guatemala]] after the British displaced Spanish in a struggle that took most of the 18th century.  They returned to Belize in 1886, running from enslavement and taxation in [[Petén (department)|Petén]]. The Cayo district and San Antonio in the Toledo district are their homes now. Q'eqchi' and Mopan have intermarried, though the two languages remain distinct and mutually unintelligible.

==Languages==
{{Main|Languages of Belize}}
[[English language|English]] is the only official language of Belize due to being a former British colony. It is the main language used in government and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562789_2/Belize.html#s3 |title=Belize: Language and Religion |accessdate=2008-09-09 |work=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPxvQRn?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562789_2/Belize.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although only 5.6% of the population speaks it as the main language at home, 54% can speak it very well, and another 26% can speak some English. 37% of Belizeans consider their primary language to be [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]], an English-based [[Creole language|creole]] of words and syntax from various [[African languages]] (namely [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], and [[Twi language|Twi]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kriol.org.bz/&lt;/ref&gt; and other languages ([[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Caliche slang|Caliche]]). It is also a second or third language for another 40% of the multilingual country.

Kriol shares similarities with many [[Caribbean]] English Creoles as far as phonology and pronunciations are concerned. Also, many of its words and structures are both lexically and phonologically similar to English, its superstrate language. Because it is English-based, all Kriol speakers can understand English. A number of linguists classify Belizean Kriol as a separate language, while others consider it to be a [[dialect]] of English.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the mother tongue of Mestizo and Central American [[refugee]]s and is commonly spoken at home by 43% of the population. Maya dialects such as [[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']], [[Mopan language|Mopan]] and [[Yucatec language|Yucatec]] are spoken. [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] (which is [[Arawakan]]/[[Maipurean]] based, with elements of the [[Carib language|Carib]] language, French, and Spanish) and the [[Plautdietsch]] dialect of the Mennonites are spoken as well. Literacy currently stands at nearly 80%. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] declared the Garifuna language, dance, and music a "[[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]". English is the primary language of public education, with Spanish taught in primary and secondary school as well. Bilingualism is highly encouraged, and therefore, very common.

'''Earth Rangers''' is a Canadian environmental education and conservation non-profit aimed specifically at youth. The goal of the organization is to educate children and their families about [[biodiversity]], inspire them to adopt sustainable behaviours, and empower them to become directly involved in protecting animals and their habitats. Earth Rangers currently has more than 140,000 members across Canada, and visits 800 elementary schools every year with an educational live animal show.

==History==
Founded in 2004, Earth Rangers began as a local organization serving schools and community venues across the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. In 2011 the organization expanded across Canada, and since then has grown into a national organization of more than 40 staff and hundreds of volunteers.

== Membership ==
Earth Rangers is the largest conservation organization in Canada by membership, with more than 140,000 Earth Rangers Members in every province and territory.

Children can become an Earth Rangers Member by visiting the Earth Rangers website and registering for membership with parental permission. They are then sent a welcome package in the mail that includes their own personalized membership card, and gain access to online resources and environmentally-themed activities.

==Programs==

=== School Outreach ===
The Earth Rangers School Assembly is a presentation for Grades 1 to 6 that leverages the shared and innate connection children of all backgrounds have to animals. Through the power of live animal demonstrations, and positive, science-based information, the program educates students about the importance of protecting [[biodiversity]], while highlighting diverse [[Conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives across Canada. Throughout the show, students are introduced to four of the Earth Rangers Animal Ambassadors, such as Blue the [[Peregrine falcon|Peregrine Falcon]], Shelley the [[Painted turtle|Painted Turtle]], and Hudson the [[Eurasian lynx|Eurasian Lynx]]. The program visits more than 800 schools across Canada each year.

Earth Rangers also delivers hands-on, curriculum-linked Classroom Visits for Grades 3 to 6, which explore subjects like climate change, pollination, and wildlife habitats in more depth.

=== Bring Back the Wild ===
Each year, Earth Rangers works with conservation partners to identify Canadian species that are facing threats in the wild. The organization then develops tangible projects to protect those animals, ranging from conservation research, to land acquisition, to habitat stewardship. Earth Rangers Members are encouraged to select one of the animals and start a fundraising campaign to help them. Through the program, members learn about the full breadth and depth of conservation and are given the tools to make a meaningful contribution. Throughout the year, they are provided with updates on the project, ensuring that they know how their funds were used and what was accomplished with them and by them its was that they rescue animals.

=== Missions ===
Missions are fun, tangible activities Earth Rangers provides to members throughout the year that are designed to demonstrate the collective impact of working together to protect the environment. They address a wide range of issues and provide kids with ways to take action through things like conserving energy at home, organizing shoreline cleanups and planting pollinator gardens. Missions are also designed to be completed with the help of family and friends.The goal of this program is to educate and inspire children about biodiversity loss.

==Facility==
[[File:Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology.jpg|335px|thumb|Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable Technology]]The Earth Rangers Centre is an advanced green building, certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum for Existing Buildings and Gold for New species.

The Earth Rangers Centre is located in [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]], [[Ontario]] on the grounds of the [[Kortright Centre|Kortright Centre for Conservation]]. It is home to Earth Rangers’ staff and Animal Ambassadors, and is a showcase of leading edge sustainable building technology including energy metering, smart automation and controls, innovative water and wastewater management, [[solar generation]], [[green roof]], [[geothermal heating]] and cooling.

=== Ventiliation ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first buildings in Canada to use [[displacement ventilation]], and has the largest installation of earth tubes in North America. This ventilation system circulates air through diffusers located near the floor level and displaces the existing air into return ducts near the ceiling.

=== Data Centre ===
The Earth Rangers 9.3 square metre [[data centre]] was completed in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell’s processing [[Server (computing)|servers]], and virtual personal machines using [[VMware]] View software. Nortel’s [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE) switching facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/commercial/technical-info/newsletter.cfm?attr=20 Heads Up Energy Efficiency Newsletter - March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen’s Green4Good program which works to combat the environmental impact of end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelbuzz.ca/2010/10/new-asset-reuse-program-couples-environmental-and-charitable-benefits-236/#more-236 New asset reuse program couples environmental and charitable benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Electricity ===
The Earth Rangers Centre has two [[Photovoltaic|solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays]] in operation; both convert the sun’s rays into standard voltage to be used by the building’s systems. In the Earth Rangers Centre parking lot there is a 57.6&amp;nbsp;kWp dual-axis tracking array on six separate posts consisting of 54 Solgate 175&amp;nbsp;W panels, provided by Sentinel Power Systems. Each array follows the sun from east to west during the day, increasing output by up to 30 per cent over a fixed panel. Each panel has its own {{Not a typo|Enphase}} micro-inverter, further increasing the efficiency of the arrays and allowing real-time monitoring of the system on panel by panel basis. The second array is located on the aviary, a building that boasts a 28.08&amp;nbsp;kWp, designed and installed by Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviro-energytech.com/ Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; This offsets approximately 10% of the Earth Rangers Centre’s annual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnyportal.com/Templates/PublicPageOverview.aspx?page=c9886868-f2c1-414d-adc6-ff66465e0935&amp;plant=d75990bd-510f-4560-9ebc-a3c5a35aaac9 Earth Rangers Aviary 28.08kW Earth Rangers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heating and Cooling ===
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first 100% radiant heated and cooled buildings in North America. The building uses 22&amp;nbsp;km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/[[glycol]]) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the [[glycol]] is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.

==Animal ambassadors==
The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 animals that act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, including ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African servals, and American kestrels.

'''Esther Hobart Morris''' (8&amp;nbsp;August 1814 – 3&amp;nbsp;April 1902) was the first woman [[justice of the peace]] in the United States. A mother of three boys, she began her tenure as justice in [[South Pass City, Wyoming]], on 14&amp;nbsp;February 1870, serving a term of fewer than 9&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madeinwyoming.net/profiles/morris.php |title=Trailblazer: Wyoming's first female judge, Esther Hobart Morris was ahead of her time |first=Rena |last=Delbride |accessdate=2009-02-04 |work=Made in Wyoming, Our Legacy of Success |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426071329/http://www.madeinwyoming.net/profiles/morris.php |archivedate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]] Board of County Commissioners appointed Morris as justice of the peace after the previous justice, R.S.

Popular stories and historical accounts, as well as by state and federal public monuments, point to Morris as a leader in the passage of [[Wyoming]]'s suffrage amendment. However, Morris' leadership role in the legislation is disputed.&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBZiU_tmRmgC" |title=Lies across America: What our historic sites get wrong |isbn=9780743296298 |author1=Loewen |first1=James W. |date=2007-10-16 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007}}{{ISBN|0-7432-9629-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{citation |contribution=Grace Raymond Hebard: The Independent and Feminine Life; 1861–1936 |first=Virginia |last=Scharff |title=Lone Voyagers: Academic Women in Coeducational Universities. 1870–1937 |editor-first=Geraldine Joncich |editor-last=Clifford |publisher=The Feminist Press |location=The [[City University of New York]], New York, NY |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/canadian_review_of_american_studies/v036/36.1lamont.pdf |title=More than she deserves: Woman Suffrage memorials in the Equality State |first=Victoria |last=Lamont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris herself never claimed any credit, ascribing the bill entirely to William H.

==Early life==
Esther Hobart was born in [[Tioga County, New York]], on 8&amp;nbsp;August 1814. Orphaned at an early age,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=March 2016}} she apprenticed to a seamstress and ran a successful [[Hatmaking|millinery]] business out of her grandparents' home, "making hats, and buying and selling goods for women".&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt; Moreover, Hobart agitated as a young woman against slavery, reportedly during one incident countering efforts of slavery advocates who threatened to destroy a church that supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]].&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

Eight years into her millinery business, Hobart married Artemus Slack, a [[civil engineer]], in 1841. Three years later, just short of her 30th&amp;nbsp;birthday, her husband died. Morris subsequently moved to [[Illinois]], where her late husband had acquired property. She encountered legal roadblocks in settling her husband's affairs, because women were not allowed to own or inherit property.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt; Thereafter she moved to [[Peru, Illinois]], where in 1850 she married John Morris, a local merchant. In the spring of 1868 her husband, along with Esther's son from her previous marriage, Archibald "Archy" Slack, moved to a gold rush community at [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City, Wyoming Territory]], to open a saloon.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

In 1869, Morris and her two 18&amp;nbsp;year-old twin sons, Robert and Edward, ventured west to rejoin the rest of their family. They first traveled by train to a waystation on the newly completed [[transcontinental railroad]] at [[Point of Rocks, Wyoming|Point of Rocks]], 25&amp;nbsp;miles east of present-day [[Rock Springs, Wyoming]]. From there, Morris and her boys continued north by stagecoach. They crossed the Sand Dunes before ascending a gradual mountain pass to Mining District.

[[File:South pass city 6.jpg|thumb|right|300px|South Pass City in 2011]]
The dry, rocky landscape that confronted 55&amp;nbsp;year-old Morris as she stepped off the stage at South Pass City appeared startlingly different from the fertile landscape she had known in Illinois and New York. Instead, her new home at {{convert|7500|ft}} in elevation meant scratching out a living in a barren gulch at the mouth of canyon near the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]]. The Morrises settled into a 24&amp;nbsp;foot by 26&amp;nbsp;foot (7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;m) log cabin with a sod roof that Esther's oldest son had purchased.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

Winters were brutal. South Pass area residents, whose population swelled to nearly 4,000&amp;nbsp;residents, according to one estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wyoming, a Guide to Its History, Highways, and People |department=Writers' Program of the [[Work Projects Administration]] in the State of Wyoming |first=T.A. |last=Larson |series=Federal Writers' Project |editor-first=T.A. |editor-last=Larson |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1981 |ISBN=0-8032-6854-8}}. This estimate appears high compared to other references which describe the area population in the 1,500–3,000&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/ref&gt; either left the camp for the winter or faced extreme isolation during the long winters. Those who stayed on the mountain passed the battled sub-zero temperatures, high winds, and deep snow which might not retreat until June. Both John Morris and Archy purchased interest in mining properties soon after their arrival, including the Mountain Jack, Grand Turk, Golden State, and Nellie Morgan lodes, according to historian Michael A. Massie.&lt;ref name="Massie"/&gt;

Initially, prospects looked good in the midst of the gold rush, where the mines and adjoining businesses of South Pass City spurred employment for 2,000&amp;nbsp;workers during 1868 and 1869, according to a [[Stanford University]] study. But then came the bust. By 1870 most miners had left, leaving as few as 460&amp;nbsp;residents. By 1875 fewer than 100&amp;nbsp;remained.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

==Justice of the peace in South Pass City==
Esther Morris had hardly settled in her new home in South Pass City when District Court Judge John W. Kingman appointed her as [[justice of the peace]] in 1870. It took some "prodding" but Morris subsequently completed an application for the post and submitted a required $500&amp;nbsp;bond. The Sweetwater County Board of Commissioners in a vote of two to one approved her application on 14&amp;nbsp;February 1870.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

Subsequently, the county clerk telegraphed a press release announcing the historic event of the first woman justice of the peace. The Wyoming Territory's enfranchisement of women to vote in 1869 made Morris' unprecedented appointment possible. The clerk's telegraph to the world in part read:&lt;blockquote&gt;Wyoming, the youngest and one of the richest Territories in the United States, gave equal rights to women in actions as well as words.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morris' momentous appointment followed the resignation of Justice R. S. Barr, who quit in protest of the territorial legislature's passage of the women's suffrage amendment in December&amp;nbsp;1869. However, according to author [[Lynne Cheney]] writing in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', the county board appointed Morris to complete the term of Judge J.&amp;nbsp;W. Stillman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/it-all-began-wyoming?page=3 |title=It all began in Wyoming |department=American History Lives at American Heritage |website=www.americanheritage.com |language=en |access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris began her tenure as justice in South Pass City in 1870 by arresting Stillman, who refused to hand over his court docket.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt; Ultimately, Morris dismissed her own case with a ruling that she as an interested party did not have the authority to arrest Stillman, according to author Lynne Cheney. Morris began anew with her own docket, holding court sitting on a wood slab in the living room of her log cabin. Cheney notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;When the lawyers who appeared in her court tried to embarrass her with legal terms and technicalities, she admitted her lack of training but was quick to let them know just whose court they were in. One of the lawyers who practiced before her recalled that ''to pettifoggers, she showed no mercy.''&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morris looked to her sons for support in the courtroom. She appointed Archibald as district clerk and Robert as a part-time deputy clerk with the tasks of keeping court records and drawing up arrest warrants. Her husband John's support was not so forthcoming. John actively opposed his wife's appointment and reportedly made such a scene in her court that Esther had him jailed.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

Judge Morris ruled on 27&amp;nbsp;cases during her more than 8&amp;nbsp;months in office, including 9&amp;nbsp;criminal cases.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyospcr.state.wy.us/Stories/EstherHobartMorris.wmv |title=Esther Hobart Morris |publisher=Wyoming State Archives |department=State Parks and Cultural Resources |dead-url=yes}}{{dead link |date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; None were overturned according to records at the Wyoming State Archives, although a few cases were appealed but upheld by the appellate court.&lt;ref name="Cheney" /&gt; She held her justice of the peace post until the term that she had been appointed to fill expired on 6&amp;nbsp;December 1870. Morris sought reelection but failed to muster a nomination from either the [[Wyoming Republican Party|Republican]] or [[Wyoming Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

Morris' historic judgeship garnered favorable review upon the completion of her term in the ''South Pass News'', as her son Archy was the editor. However, the historical record reveals little fanfare in the remainder of Wyoming's press. The ''Wyoming Tribune'', published in Cheyenne, did note the comments of Territorial Secretary Lee: "the people of Sweetwater County had not the good sense and judgment to nominate and elect her for the ensuing term."&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

==The boom goes bust==
Esther Morris, as a working mother, held court over a camp of miners, gamblers, speculators, business owners, prostitutes, and rounders. Men outnumbered women 4 to 1 in the mountain community where she lived.&lt;ref name="Massie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyoarchives.state.wy.us/Research/pdf/WomanSuffrage.pdf |title=Reform is where you find it: The roots of woman suffrage in Wyoming |format=PDF |first=Michael A. |last=Massie |accessdate=2009-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000240/http://wyoarchives.state.wy.us/Research/pdf/WomanSuffrage.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-04|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges in the court dealing with a rough constituency were compounded by her husband, John, who had a reputation as "a brawler, an idler, and a drunk."&lt;ref name="Cheney" /&gt; Morris had him arrested, after her term in office was over, for assault and battery, according to the ''[[American Heritage Magazine]]''.

Troubles continued to mount for the family. An 1871 fire struck the South Pass City newspaper office owned and operated by Esther Morris' son, Archibald Slack, forcing him and his wife Sarah to move to [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] in [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany County]].&lt;ref name="Massie"/&gt; Perhaps it was case of cabin fever after being cooped up all season during a particularly bad winter of 1871–1872 that spurred Morris to action.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} She left the camp and her husband. Morris traveled to Laramie where she briefly lived with her son Archy, however the former judge remained unsettled. She moved to [[Albany, New York]], then to [[Springfield, Illinois]], where she spent her winters, according to Massie. Summers saw her returning to Wyoming, where she spent time with her sons. Morris' wandering ended in the 1880s when she returned to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] to live with her son Robert.

Morris had been but one of many in a long history of residents who saddled up and called it quits in South Pass City. Short-lived gold strikes in the 1880s, 1890s, and 1930s once again lured miners back to the mountains seeking their fortunes.&lt;ref name="Massie"/&gt;

==Life after the mines==
Wyoming's enactment of women's suffrage in 1869 prompted a surge forward for human rights in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Moreover, the territory's appointment of Morris as  the first woman justice of the peace in the United States in 1870, and the first woman to hold judicial office in the modern world, drew widespread national attention.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

Morris' involvement in women's causes also continued after she left the gold mines and South Pass City:
* February 1872: She participated in the American Woman Suffrage Association Convention in San Francisco.
* August 1873: Nominated by the Woman's Party of Wyoming as a candidate to the Wyoming Territorial Legislature, a nomination that Morris declined.&lt;ref name="bench" /&gt;
* 1876: Served as vice president, [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].
* July 1876: Addressed the National Suffrage Convention in [[Philadelphia]].
* July 1890: Presented the new Wyoming state flag to Governor Warren during the Wyoming statehood celebration.
* 1896: Attended as a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which nominated the [[William McKinley]]-[[Garret A. Hobart]] ticket. (She was not related to Vice President Hobart, who died in office in 1899.)

==Death and legacy==
Esther Hobart Morris died in Cheyenne on 3&amp;nbsp;April 1902, at age&amp;nbsp;87 (or&amp;nbsp;90). She is interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne, where a simple stone monument adorned only with her name marks her grave site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6653029 |title=Esther Hobart Morris |website=Find a Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1960, a [[Esther Hobart Morris (Fairbanks)|statue of her]] sculpted by [[Avard Fairbanks]] has been one of Wyoming's two statutes in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol]]. Another statue stands at the Wyoming State Capitol. In 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a belated obituary for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/obituaries/overlooked-esther-morris.html |title=Overlooked No More: She Followed a Trail to Wyoming. Then She Blazed One. - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in women's suffrage===
Evidence suggests that the public record celebrating Morris' role as a suffrage leader is exaggerated.&lt;ref name="lies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; Reports of Morris as suffragist in South Pass City, where she was said to have hosted a momentous tea party for the electors and candidates for Wyoming's first territorial legislature, are not supported by any contemporary accounts, and only appear nearly fifty years after the fact.&lt;ref name="Massie"/&gt;

For many years, Esther Hobart Morris has been celebrated as the "Mother of Woman Suffrage".&lt;ref name="bench"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://womenslegalhistory.stanford.edu/papers0203/mlkarin-MorrisF02.pdf |title=Esther Morris and her Equality State: From Council Bill&amp;nbsp;70 to Life on the Bench |first1=Marcy Lynn |last1=Karin |first2=Professor Barbara |last2=Babcock |first3=Erika |last3=Wayne |format=PDF |journal=Women in the Legal Profession |date=Fall 2002 |orig-year=28 February 2003 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation had been written a year before she became a justice of the peace, by [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran and South Pass City resident William H. Bright.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Uniting States: The Story of Statehood for the Fifty States |first=Benjamin F. |last=Shearer |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=June 2004 |ISBN=978-0-313-33107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Melville C. Brown's recollection of the 1889 Constitutional Convention
Some modern-day researchers have suggested that Morris' oldest son, who became editor of a Cheyenne newspaper, may have played a role in the origins of the story of his mother's role. Critics say that he "concocted it".&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book |series=Moon Handbooks |title=Wyoming |first=Don |last=Pitcher |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing |year=2006 |ISBN=1-56691-953-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research leads to Morris' friend Melville C. Brown, who was president of the 1889 Constitutional Convention in Cheyenne, who claimed that she had presented the suffrage bill to the legislature. Morris' son Archy Slack followed suit and subsequently referred to his mother in the ''Cheyenne Sun'' newspaper as the "Mother of Suffrage".&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt;

;H.G. Nickerson's recollection of a tea party
The tea party story might have faded quietly were it not for H.G. Nickerson. Nickerson, who had discovered and opened the Bullion Mine in 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Wyoming |first=I.S. |last=Bartlett |publisher=S.J. Clarke Publishing Co. |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; later served as a territorial legislator for [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]]. He wrote a letter published on 14&amp;nbsp;February 1919 in ''Wyoming State Journal'', in which he recounted the tea party and his attendance as a legislative candidate, some 50&amp;nbsp;years after the event had taken place. In a tip of the hat honoring Morris, Nickerson notes:&lt;blockquote&gt;To Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Esther Morris is due the credit and honor of advocating and originating woman's suffrage in the United States.&lt;ref name="Massie"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nickerson's story gained widespread prominence after his friend, Wyoming historian [[Grace Raymond Hebard]] (1861–1936) published the account in a 1920 pamphlet entitled "How Woman Suffrage Came to Wyoming (1869)".&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt; The pamphlet eventually became so widely distributed that students throughout the state's public schools read the story memorializing Morris's suffrage feats.&lt;ref name="bench"/&gt; Hebard spent many years advancing the claim,&lt;ref name="muse"/&gt; promoting Morris as an instigator and co-author of Wyoming's suffrage legislation.&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt;

===Statues at the capitol buildings in Cheyenne and Washington, D.C.===
[[Image:EstherHobartMorrisCheyenneW.jpg|thumb|right|Wyoming State Capitol Building in Cheyenne. State officials in 1960 presented a copy of this 1953 [[Esther Hobart Morris (Fairbanks)|bronze statue of Esther Hobart Morris]] for display at the [[U.S. Capitol|U.S. Capitol's]] [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in Washington, D.C.]]
In 1960, Wyoming further celebrated Morris as a key impetus of Wyoming suffrage by donating a life-sized [[Esther Hobart Morris (Fairbanks)|bronze statue of her]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the [[U.S. Capitol]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/morris.cfm |title=National Statuary Hall Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officiating at the Statuary Hall ceremony were [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] and Richard Arnold Mullens (1918–2010), the president at the time of the Wyoming State Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2010/09/19/obituaries/07obit_09-19-10.txt |title=Richard A. Mullens |department=Obituary |publisher=[[Wyoming Tribune Eagle]] |date=19 September 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Wyoming officials placed a replica of the same 9&amp;nbsp;foot sculpture at the state capitol building in Cheyenne. An inscription thereon hails Morris as the "Mother of Woman Suffrage". In 2006, the [[National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], inducted Morris, as a suffrage pathbreaker. The Cowgirl Hall of Fame claims that her "influential efforts made it possible for women to vote in the Wyoming Territory in 1869."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cowgirl.net/honorees/Esther_Hobart_Morris.aspx |title=Cowgirl Hall of Fame |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006124602/http://www.cowgirl.net/honorees/Esther_Hobart_Morris.aspx |archivedate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On ''Death Valley Days''===
In 1960, the actress [[Bethel Leslie]] played Morris in an episode of the [[Television syndication|syndicated television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]].

'''Ethnic groups in Nepal''' are a product of both the colonial and state-building eras of [[Nepal]]. The groups are delineated using language, ethnic identity or the [[caste system in Nepal]]. They are categorized by common [[culture]] and [[endogamy]]. Endogamy carves out ethnic groups in Nepal.

==Linguistic groups==
[[File:Dashain Tika 02.JPG|thumb|[[Khas people]] celebrating [[Dashain]] festival; Khas are the largest ethno-linguistic group in Nepal comprising [[Bahun]], [[Chhetri]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Damai]] and other [[Dalit]]s]]
Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and various [[indigenous language]] isolates. According to the 2001 national census, ninety two different living languages are spoken in Nepal (a ninety third category was "unspecified"). Based upon the 2011 census, the major languages spoken in Nepal are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Summary of Census |year=2011 |work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202145804/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nepali language|Nepali]] (derived from [[Khas]] language) is considered to be a member of Indo-European language and is written in [[Devanagari]] script. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] was the language of the house of Gorkhas in the late 18th century and became the official, national language that serves as the [[lingua franca]] among Nepalese of different ethnolinguistic groups. [[Maithili language|Maithili]]—along with regional dialects [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]]—are Indian languages and are spoken in the southern [[Terai Region]].

Nepalese in the government sector and in business, use [[English language|English]] as an official language. English is the language of the technical, medical, and scientific communities as well as for bankers, traders, and entrepreneurs. There has been a surge in the number and percentage of people who understand English. The majority of urban and a significant number of rural schools use English as a language of instruction. Higher education in technical, medical, scientific, and engineering fields are entirely in English.

[[Nepal Bhasa]], the mother-tongue of the Newars, is widely used and spoken in and around [[Kathmandu Valley]] and in major Newar trade towns across Nepal.

Other languages, particularly in the Inner Terai hill and mountain regions, are remnants of the country's pre-unification history of dozens of political entities isolated by topography. These languages typically are limited to an area spanning about one day's walk. Beyond that distance, dialects and languages lose [[mutual intelligibility]].

Since Nepal's unification, various indigenous languages have come under threat of extinction as the government of Nepal has marginalized their use through strict policies designed to promote Nepali as the official language. Indigenous languages which have gone extinct or are critically threatened include Byangsi, Chonkha, and Longaba. Since democracy was restored in 1990, however, the government has worked to improve the marginalization of these languages. Tribhuvan University began surveying and recording threatened languages in 2010 and the government intends to use this information to include more languages on the next Nepalese census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|year=2010|title=Marginalization of indigenous languages of Nepal|url=|journal=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|volume=37|pages=69|via=Expanded Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social status==
[[File:SunuwarMaleFemale.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sunuwar]], a division of [[Kirati people]]; one of the largest ethnic cluster in Eastern Nepal]]
The [[Kirati people]] of Eastern Nepal and [[Limbu people|Limbus]] together with the [[Rai people|Rais]], form one of the largest single ethnic groups in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Researches Into the History and Civilization of the Kirātas By G. P. Singh, Gyan Publishing House, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahari people|Pahari]] Hill Hindus of the [[Khas|Khas Gorkha]] tribe ([[Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] castes) and the [[Newar people|Newar ethnicity]] dominated the civil service, the judiciary and upper ranks of the army throughout the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Shah regime]] (1768–2008). Nepali was the national language and [[Sanskrit]] became a required school subject. Children who spoke Nepali natively and who were exposed to Sanskrit had much better chances of passing the national examinations at the end of high school, which meant they had better employment prospects and could continue into higher education.

On the other hand, children who natively spoke local languages of the [[Madhesh]] and [[Hill Region|Hills]], or Tibetan dialects prevailing in the high mountains were at a considerable disadvantage. This history of exclusion coupled with poor prospects for improvement created grievances that encouraged many in ethnic communities such as [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]], [[Tharu people|Tharu]] and [[Kham Magar]] to support the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and various other armed Maoist opposition groups such as the [[JTMM]] during and after the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. The negotiated end to this war forced King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] to abdicate in 2008.

Issues of ethnic and regional equity have tended to dominate the agenda of the new republican government and continue to be divisive. Today, even after the end of a 10-year-old Maoist conflict, the upper caste dominates every field in Nepal. Specifically, Brahmin and Chhetri (Indo-Aryan) have advantages. Although Newars are low in numbers, their urban living habitat gives them a competitive advantage. Thus, Newars are at the top of the Human Development Index. From a [[Gender inequality in Nepal|gender perspective]], Newari women are the most literate and lead in every sector. Brahmin and Chhetri women have experienced less social and economic mobility compared to Newari women. Specifically, Brahmin women experience less equality due to their predominately rural living conditions which deprives them of access to certain educational and healthcare benefits.&lt;ref name="OCHA1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 12 |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113112940/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCHA2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2E89F2121C2C57A24925733F000F4F21-Full_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 16 |date=July–August 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCHA3"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 30 |date=June–July 2008 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218090410/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Him-ext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&amp;NewsID=266104 |title=Body of murder victim found in Gulmi |publisher=The Himalayan Times online |location=Gulmi |first=Hari |last=Sharma |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525142109/http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&amp;NewsID=266104 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatlebakk07"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatlebakk |first=Magnus |year=2007 |title=Economic and social structures that may explain the recent conflicts in the Terai of Nepal |location=[[Kathmandu]] |publisher=Norwegian Embassy |url=http://www.norway.org.np/NR/rdonlyres/0993F5660B3548A98F819167B4FD596C/72944/http___wwwcmi.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahun and Chhetri castes form the historical topmost state elites' circle with the significant majority of leadership in executive, legislative, judicial, constitutional, local administrative bodies, [[bureaucracy]], [[political parties]] and social organizations. Hindu [[varna]] system highlights these castes as ''high castes'' and makes them favorable in higher social status due to favorable social norms, values, and laws.

'''Gaia''' (born 1988) is a Baltimore-based street artist, who is receiving significant museum showings and critical recognition.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/travel/09weekend.html|title=Weekend in New York: Street Art - To the Trained Eye, Museum Pieces Lurk Everywhere - Travel|first=Seth|last=Kugel|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-07-11/entertainment/bal-unmasked-gaia-the-street-artist-specializing-in-leatherclad-roosters-cradling-john-the-baptists-head-20110708_1_gaia-roosters-mica-student|title=Gaia unmasked: MICA-trained street artist identified by name on invitation for Poe House event|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[New York City]], his name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] designation for "[[earth goddess]]," and early in his career he used animal imagery to underscore his interest in bringing nature to urban landscapes.&lt;ref name="grist.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grist.org/cities/2011-10-11-street-artists-see-the-city-as-their-canvas|title=Street artists see the city as their canvas|date=12 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last several years he has been creating large-scale murals worldwide to engage the community where he works in a dialogue by using historical and sociological references to these neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-09/perth-street-art-festival/5377540|title=Urban artists transform blank walls around Perth|date=9 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
{{ external media

| video1 = You can watch a video of Gaia creating one of his art works    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFoBYkHYLq4 '''here''']}}

In 2007, while still in high school in New York, Gaia started wheat-pasting prints of his [[linoleum]] blocks in [[Bushwick]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/nyregion/26posters.html|title=A Battle, on Billboards, of Ads vs. Art|date=26 October 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His images included children, whose features gave them an other-worldly quality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
His animals included a [[horse]] and [[boar]],&lt;br /&gt; both endowed with human hands and torsos. He participated in several successful shows in Bushwick at Ad Hoc Art.

According to the artist himself, much of his early work was inspired by a sense of looming environmental calamity. In 2011, he stated that&lt;br /&gt; "I wanted to express this strange un-locatable feeling of fear about the end of the world - my generation’s [[zeitgeist]] of [[global warming]]."&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

==Baltimore==
After graduating from high school in June 2007, Gaia moved to [[Baltimore]] and studied for four years at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], where he broadened his iconography. For example, he included images of his grandfather, or a [[rooster]] holding the head of [[St. John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="urbanitebaltimore.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/the-oracle/Content?oid%3D1309311 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305195051/http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/the-oracle/Content?oid=1309311 |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

}}
Gaia also developed an interest in the evolution of urban neighborhoods. He began incorporating portraits of influential, and sometimes controversial urban developers: people such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Robert Moses]], [[Henry Flagler]], [[James Rouse]], [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]].

These men built highways, skyscrapers and [[housing projects]]. Collectively and irrevocably, they altered our perception of public space. For this reason, Gaia layered them into his urban murals.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/bs-ae-gaia-profile-20110521,0,747425.story|title=After graduation, street artist Gaia takes flight|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

==Career==
===2011===
In March 2011 Gaia had two solo exhibitions in [[Chicago]] co-organized by Maxwell-Colette Gallery and Pawnworks, which included a large-scale installation in the Art Loop at Adams and State.&lt;ref name="oururbantimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oururbantimes.com/arts/art-or-illegal-act-gaia-street-artist-crosses-chicagos-cultural-boundaries |title=Art or Illegal Act: Gaia, street artist, crosses Chicago's cultural boundaries |publisher=Our Urban Times |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Jonathan LeVine Gallery in New York City presented ''Succession,'' a solo exhibition of Gaia's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonathanlevinegallery.com/?method=Exhibit.ExhibitDescriptionPast&amp;ExhibitID=A2525750-0DC5-58DE-5B726610EC4E3314|title=GaiaSuccession - Jonathan Levine Gallery|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ external media
| align  = right
| video1 = You can watch a video of Gaia creating his Miami art works    [http://urbanartvideos.com/category/gaia/ '''here''']}}
In the summer, Gaia created an edition of a [[raven]] titled ''Forevermore'' and donated it to &lt;br /&gt;the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]] in Baltimore, which had lost its funding. &lt;br/&gt; The Poe House is located in an area which includes [[subsidized housing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/help-comes-tapping/Content?oid=1448633&lt;/ref&gt;

When a 50 foot-poster of Gaia’s image was wheat-pasted in the neighborhood, it became a [[photo-op]] location for local residents.&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt; The image was also hung at [http://www.casewerks.com/ Case[werks&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Showroom &amp; Gallery], for its own fundraising event.

In September 2011, Gaia was commissioned to create a mural for Wynwood Doors for Art Basel/Miami. He chose to do a portrait &lt;br/&gt; of Henry Flagler, a railroad magnate who established the historically black neighborhood [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]] in central [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-01-22/news/30653027_1_street-art-art-basel-murals/3|title=Wynwood Walls: A gallery for urban street art in midtown Miami|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia was one of the artists that took part in The Underbelly Project which exhibited at Art Basel/Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/arts/design/01underbelly.html|title=Street Art Way Below the Street|date=1 November 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/things-to-do/this-week-in-new-york/2565129/we-own-the-night-the-art-of-the-underbelly-project|title=Your ultimate guide to New York|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
Gaia curated Open Walls Baltimore (OWB) which was generously backed by the PNC Community Foundation and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/underground-upsurge/Content?oid%3D1470053 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627063042/http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/underground-upsurge/Content?oid=1470053 |archivedate=2012-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/open-walls-tags-baltimores-station-north-district-as-an-it-neighborhood/2012/05/17/gIQAmUyPYU_story.html|title=Open Walls tags Baltimore’s Station North district as an ‘it’ neighborhood|first=Maura|last=Judkis|date=17 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor of Baltimore, [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]], attended the March 6 launch party for the OWB project at The Windup Space.

Gaia created the first two murals for Open Walls Baltimore at the corner of Charles and North Avenue. [[Maya Hayuk]] created the third mural, and other artists who participated were [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], Chris Stain, [[MOMO (artist)|MOMO]], Freddy Sam, Jaz, Jetsonoarma, Overunder, Vhils, Nanook, Mata Ruda, Specter, Interesni Kaski, Ever, Doodles, John Ahearn and Sten &amp; Lex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.about.com/b/2012/03/06/open-walls-baltimore-will-spread-murals-across-station-north.htm|title=Try Some Crustaceans at These Top Crab Houses in Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, discussion events included Monica Campana of Living Walls and Jane Golden of Philadelphia Mural Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimorebrew.com/2012/03/06/can-big-bold-murals-bring-value-to-baltimores-vacants/|title=Can big, bold murals bring value to Baltimore’s many vacants?|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/open-walls-baltimore-street-art-to-revitalize-a-neighborhood/2012/04/03/gIQAkrjssS_blog.html|title=Open Walls Baltimore: Street art to revitalize a neighborhood|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These internationally renowned artists created public murals in the [[Station North Arts and Entertainment District]] as a quick pick-me-up for a transitional neighborhood that houses both young artists who attend the nearby Maryland Institute College of Art, and economically challenged long term residents. The mural project will be akin to one in Miami’s Wynwood district, going beyond the typical haphazard [[spray paint]] or [[wheatpaste]] to create an art destination.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

In September Gaia was invited to create a large installation at the Baltimore Museum of Art Contemporary Wing which reopened on November 17 after having been closed for several years for a major renovation. The project explored a recurring Gaia theme focusing on the residents of a neighborhood located near the BMA known as Remington. Eleven portraits of Remington residents float on a huge linoleum block print of rowhouses on one wall. On the opposite wall is another linoleum block print of rowhouses on which Gaia created a Gauguin-inspired portrait of a woman holding a mango.&lt;ref name="socialreader.com"&gt;http://socialreader.com/me/channels/76421/content/KbH45&lt;/ref&gt; Kristen Hileman, the museum's curator of contemporary art, said the museum sought to commission an installation by Gaia not only because of his artistic skills, but because of the social and political messages in his work and his mission to connect people in urban landscapes.&lt;ref name="socialreader.com"/&gt;

===2013===
South African street artist Freddy Sam hosted Gaia, Know Hope and Jaz in January to create murals in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Gaia was also invited to participate in mural festivals in Montreal, Bushwick, [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Rochester, Sheboygan and Vladivostok. Rice Gallery at Rice University, Houston, Texas which specializes in site-specific installations presented a solo exhibition titled Marshland for Gaia from September 26 through December 8 and commissioned a documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2013/09/12/new-installation-by-street-artist-gaia-opens-at-rice-gallery-sept-26/|title=New installation by street artist Gaia opens at Rice Gallery Sept. 26|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walleyfilms.wordpress.com/tag/street-art/|title=Street Art « Walley Films Blog|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houstonmuseumdistrict.org/events/4398/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416174243/http://houstonmuseumdistrict.org/events/4398/ |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
In February Gaia participated in the 2014 Pow Wow Hawaii mural festival in Honolulu. This was Pow Wow's fourth year and Gaia was invited to create a mural and a painting whose images referenced Hawaii's pre-colonial culture. Andrew Hosne of Thinkspace was enlisted by event director Jasper Wong to curate an exhibit for the participants'paintings at the Honolulu Museum of Art School, titled Pow! Wow! Exploring the New Contemporary Art Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/February-2014/Street-Art-In-A-Museum-Pow-Wow-Hawaii-Gets-Some-Respect/|title=Street Art In A Museum? Pow Wow Hawaii Artists Get Some Respect|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from Hawaii, Gaia immediately went to work on curating the second Open Walls Baltimore festival in the Station North Arts District where he created his own mural on the side of a Korean rice cake factory on N Charles Street. There was some controversy with regard to the community reception and the under representation of female artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bthesite/bs-ae-open-walls-baltimore-20140401-story.html|title=Open Walls Baltimore 2 sparks community dialogue|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Open Wall Baltimore 2 was underway, Gaia left for Perth, Australia to participate in a street art mural event called Public organized by the not for profit Form.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

After returning from Australia Gaia will be heading to Greenville, SC where he has been commissioned to create a mural for an event called Year of Altruism coinciding with the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht usually seen as the beginning of the Holocaust. The proposed design, with references to textile mills and a landscape with lilies, is meant to recognize the generosity of the altruistic people involved in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenvillenewssc.sc.newsmemory.com/publink.php?shareid=3b3500b15&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
It has been an especially busy year for Gaia and he's been receiving well-deserved recognition for his work. He was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Art &amp; Style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkl45ehmdj/gaia-26/|title=Gaia, 26 - pg.11|first=Susan|last=Adams|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/30under30/#/art-style|title=30 Under 30 2017|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned to create a mural installation at the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, GA focusing on the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown in response to how blacks are perceived in the media following the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsatl.com/2015/01/qa-gaia-street-art-authenticity-mural-center-civil-human-rights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911102747/http://www.artsatl.com/2015/01/qa-gaia-street-art-authenticity-mural-center-civil-human-rights/ |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantaplanit.com/events/event.php?eid=58947|title=Things to Do in Atlanta - Discover Atlanta Events! - Atlanta PlanIt|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The W Hotel DC commissioned Gaia to create murals inside their new restaurant Pinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchtwistdc.com/tag/street-art-by-gaia/|title=street art by gaia « French Twist D.C.|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia was invited to speak on the Evolution of Street Art on a panel at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://streetsdept.com/2015/06/05/new-gaia-mural-in-fishtown-asks-what-is-the-aesthetic-of-reinvestmentgentrification/|title=New Gaia Mural in Fishtown Asks, ‘What Is The Aesthetic of Reinvestment/Gentrification?’|date=5 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist will be curating and painting murals at the 2015 O+ Festival in Kington, NY on October 9–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opositivefestival.org/kingston/news/gaia-to-curate-murals-for-o-festival-in-kingston-ny/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628071808/http://opositivefestival.org/kingston/news/gaia-to-curate-murals-for-o-festival-in-kingston-ny/ |archivedate=2015-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the O+ Festival, Gaia will have an installation at York College of Pennsylvania Galleries titled Perspectives on Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ycp.edu/academics/academic-departments/communication-and-the-arts/division-of-art/york-college-galleries/calendar/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905081402/http://www.ycp.edu/academics/academic-departments/communication-and-the-arts/division-of-art/york-college-galleries/calendar/ |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist interviewed four local residents to create a video of each which will be shown in the center of the octagonal gallery with enlarged portraits of each painted on the perimeter walls. He will also participate in a panel discussion on October 14 with the curators prior to a reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/breaking/ci_28910682/artists-share-visions-peace-at-york-college |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003155828/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/breaking/ci_28910682/artists-share-visions-peace-at-york-college |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016-17===
Major commissions have sought out the talents of Gaia over the last year and a half. 999Contemporary secured a major mural commission for Gaia to execute at the Hotel Capannelle in Rome. The three murals titled "Mobility" cover the entire four story exterior of the hotel and depict a theme which couldn't possibly be more topical now than in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotelcapannelle.com/en/street-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful mural project at the W DC Hotel's Pinea Restaurant, the designers were trying to hire Gaia for another W project, but it took years to come together since Starwood was bought out by Marriott and the entire design team left. There was a W Hotel being built in Bellevue WA and Gaia signed the contract and began the work for a three story triptych soaring up a staircase from the hotel entrance making it the first impression a guest would see. After 18 days of working on the a scaffold, the murals were completed one week before the hotel's official June 15, 2017 grand opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatsupnw.com/2017/06/w-bellevue-hotel-to-open-june-15-2017/|title=W Bellevue Hotel to Open June 15, 2017|date=1 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia headed overseas again for the next project which was also monumental. The Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia in Bogotà was celebrating the 50th anniversary of publication of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel prize winning novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. Gaia collaborated on the mamoth five story interior triptych in the central hall with Guache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliotecanacional.gov.co/es-co/actividades/noticias/en-la-bnc/intervencion-guache-y-gaia-en-el-hall-central/|title=Noticias Guache y Gaia celebran los 50 años de 'Cien años de soledad' con un Mural en  la Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia|website=bibliotecanacional.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia's next international flight was back to Italy this time for the stART- Welcome to Pisa project. This was another 18 days of work on a scaffold. The mural covers the exterior wall of the Saint Gobain glass factory and depicts and reflects upon the history of labor in Italy (and the world) and the frightening effects of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pisatoday.it/video/porta-a-mare-welcome-to-pisa-festival-murales-gaia.html/|title=Porta a Mare: al via il 'Welcome to Pisa Festival' con il murale di Gaia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, Gaia was also part of a group of international contemporary street artists who were commissioned to pain New Delhi's streets in India. Gaia's paintings focused on Global Warming, and in particular the impact of low cost automobiles as well as container ships on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fsrn.org/2016/03/slideshow-delhi-street-art-festival-makes-its-mark-on-the-indian-capital/|title=Slideshow: Delhi Street Art Festival makes its mark on the Indian capital – FSRN|website=fsrn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between these grueling mural projects of epic proportions, a new hotel the Sagamore Pendry in Gaia's hometown (on those rare occasions when he's not traveling to some far-flung exotic destination) of Baltimore commissioned the muralist to create a painting on canvas for their posh lobby lounge. The 10' x 12' canvas titled "The Hardest Needle to Thread" that Gaia delivered now hangs in Kevin Plank's $60 million brainchild and depicts a piece of Baltimore history with the image of Francis Scott Key and the hands of two women (one white and the other black) sewing the flag which flew over Fort McHenry during the War of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/06/sagamore-pendry-hotel-brings-gritty-luxury-baltimore-kevin-planks-60m-project-provides-latest-escape-d-c-residents/|title=Peek Inside Kevin Plank's New Baltimore-Themed Hotel - Washingtonian|date=6 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Gaia has been an identified as a rising star in the art world, with solo exhibitions in New York City; [[Los Angeles]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; Chicago; [[San Francisco]]; Miami; Baltimore; and [[Seoul]], [[Korea]].

In 2008, [[The New York Times]] announced that "among the names you’ll see again and again these days is Gaia...he’s an artist-of-the-moment, and prints of his that were for sale at a recent exhibition at Ad Hoc Art in Bushwick sold out."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[The Baltimore Sun]] declared him a "critically acclaimed emerging artist with gallery shows in Chicago, New York and Washington and street art from [[Madrid]] to Seoul."&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt; ''The Baltimore Sun'' also noted that "Gaia never loses his playfulness or spontaneity," and hailed his "evolution into pieces that connect deeply to a defined city area. Even the transcendental figures take on new meaning."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Grist Magazine'' hailed Gaia’s arrival "into the inner sanctum of the art world. Galleries from Washington, D.C., to Chicago, San Francisco, and L.A. have exhibited his work. In September, he spent several weeks in Miami, contributing a mural to Wynwood Walls."&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

''Urbanite Magazine'' noted that Gaia's art can be found in cities from San Francisco to Seoul, Korea. He has had numerous gallery shows exhibiting both his street art and his studio work. His prolific pace and sophisticated execution have earned him a spot in a recent anthology titled ''Beyond the Street: The 100 Leading Figures in Urban Art.'' His success is such that he is now straddling the line between street artist and gallery art star."&lt;ref name="urbanitebaltimore.com"/&gt;

''Our Urban Times'' predicted that Gaia "will no doubt be part of the art establishment of tomorrow."&lt;ref name="oururbantimes.com"/&gt;

Kristen Hileman, curator of contemporary art at the Baltimore Museum of Art, said "This is an artist who wasn’t just tagging things and doing a quick hit in an urban site," Hileman says. "This is a person engaged with the health of the city as an ecosystem and wanting to see the abandoned buildings of Baltimore used for a better purpose than they were."&lt;ref name="socialreader.com"/&gt; She says that Gaia has the self-awareness to know that part of his role as an artist is to, like Gauguin, live in a culture that really isn't his own.&lt;ref name="socialreader.com"/&gt;

'''Gerda Hedwig Lerner''' (née '''Kronstein'''; April 30, 1920 – January 2, 2013) was an Austrian-born American historian and author. In addition to her numerous scholarly publications, she wrote poetry, fiction, theater pieces, screenplays, and an autobiography. She served as president of the [[Organization of American Historians]] in 1980–81. In 1980 she was appointed Robinson Edwards Professor of History at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where she taught until retiring in 1991.

Lerner was one of the founders of the academic field of [[women's history]]. In 1963, while still an undergraduate at the [[New School for Social Research]], she taught "Great Women in American History," which is considered to be the first regular college course on women's history offered anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Patricia|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerda-Lerner|title=Gerda Lerner &amp;#124; biography - Austrian-born American writer and educator|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught at [[Long Island University]] from 1965 to 1967. She played a key role in the development of women's history curricula and was involved in the development of degree programs in women's history at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] (where she taught from 1968 to 1979 and established the nation's first master's degree program in women's history) and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she launched the first Ph.D. program in women's history. She also worked at [[Duke University]] and [[Columbia University]], where she was a co-founder of the Seminar on Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01457|title=Lerner, Gerda, 1920–2013.

== Early life ==
She was born '''Gerda Hedwig Kronstein''' in [[Vienna]], Austria on April 30, 1920, the first child of [[Ilona Kronstein]] (née Neumann, 1897, Budapest{{ndash}}1948, Zürich)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Ilona-Kronstein/6000000014497188745 geni.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Kronstein (1888, Vienna{{ndash}}1952, Vaduz),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Wilhelm-Kronstein/6000000012765962469 geni.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in Austria|an affluent Jewish couple]]. Her family are originating and relating to [[Breslau]], [[Berlin]], {{illm|Léva|hu|display=1}} ({{lang-de|Lewenz}}, {{illm|Levice|sk|Levice (Slovensko)|display=1}}), {{illm|Turdossin|hu|display=1}} (''Turdos'', {{lang-de|Turdoschin}}, {{illm|Tvrdošín|sk|display=1}}) ([[Upper Hungary]]), ''Helishoy'' ({{lang-de|Holleschau}}, {{illm|Holešov|cs|display=1}}) ([[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]]), and Reichenberg ({{illm|Liberec|cs|display=1}}) ([[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]). Her father was a pharmacist, and her mother an artist, with whom Gerda, according to her autobiography, had a strained relationship as a child. As an adult, Gerda believed that her mother Ilona struggled because she did not fit in the role of a Viennese wife and mother.&lt;ref name="jhu"/&gt; Gerda had a younger sister, and they attended local schools and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].

Following the 1938 [[Anschluss]], Kronstein became involved with the [[Austrian Resistance|anti-Nazi resistance]]. She and her mother were jailed that year after her father had escaped to [[Liechtenstein]] and Switzerland, where he stayed during the war. Gerda Kronstein occupied a cell for six weeks with two Christian women held on political grounds. They shared their prison food with her because Jews received restricted rations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A historian looks back; Gerda Lerner examines a life lived in controversy--her own|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/268970711.html?dids=268970711:268970711&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+18%2C+2002&amp;author=Etelka+Lehoczky+Special+to+the+Tribune&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=A+historian+looks+back+%3B+Gerda+Lerner+examines+a+life+lived+in+controversy--her+own&amp;pqatl=google|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 18, 2002|accessdate=January 26, 2010|first=Etelka|last=Lehoczky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramde, Dinesh.

That year Gerda immigrated to the United States under the sponsorship of the family of Bobby Jensen, her socialist fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=Fireweed|year=2002|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|pages=151–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Settling in New York, Kronstein married Jensen. She worked in a variety of jobs as a waitress, salesperson, office clerk, and X-ray technician, while also writing fiction and poetry. She published two short stories featuring first-person accounts of the Nazi annexation of Austria.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Her marriage with Jensen was failing when she met [[Carl Lerner]] (1912–1973), a married theater director who was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]]. They both established temporary residence in Nevada and obtained  divorces in [[Reno]]; the state offered easier terms for divorce than did most others. Kronstein and Lerner married and moved to [[Hollywood]], where Carl pursued a career in film-making.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Making History Her Story, Too|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/20/books/making-history-her-story-too.html|work=The New York Times|author=Lee, Felicia R.|date=July 20, 2002|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Gerda Lerner helped found the Los Angeles chapter of the [[Congress of American Women]], a [[Communist front]] organization.  The Lerners engaged in CPUSA activities involving trade unionism, civil rights, and anti-militarism.  They suffered under the rise of [[McCarthyism]] in the 1950s, especially the [[Hollywood blacklist]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Lerners returned to New York. In 1951, Gerda Lerner collaborated with poet [[Eve Merriam]] on a musical, ''The Singing of Women.'' Lerner's novel ''No Farewell'' was published in 1955. Lerner returned to New York to study at the [[New School for Social Research]], where she received a bachelor's degree in 1963. She has said that her frequent status made her think about "people who did not have a voice in telling their own stories. Lerner's insights eventually influenced her decision to earn a Ph.D. in history and then to help establish women's history as a standard academic discipline."&lt;ref name="jhu"/&gt; In 1963, she offered the first regular college course in women's history, which at the time had no status as a field of study in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Debra Taczanowsky|url=http://www.tribdem.com/opinion/editorials/debra-taczanowsky-women-making-inroads-but-still-fighting-for-equality/article_1b89971a-a842-554c-8ba8-ff4f518e5f38.html|title=Debra Taczanowsky &amp;#124; Women making inroads, but still fighting for equality|publisher=Tribdem.com|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s Lerner and her husband coauthored the screenplay of the film ''[[Black Like Me (film)|Black Like Me]]'' (1964), based on [[Black Like Me|the book]] by white journalist [[John Howard Griffin]]. He had reported on six weeks of travel in small towns and cities of the [[Deep South]] passing as a black man. Carl Lerner directed the film, starring [[James Whitmore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=May 21, 1964|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerner continued with graduate studies at [[Columbia University]], where she earned both the M.A. (1965) and Ph.D. (1966). Her doctoral dissertation was published as ''The [[Grimké sisters|Grimke Sisters]] from South Carolina: Rebels Against Slavery'' (1967), a study of [[Sarah Moore Grimké]] and [[Angelina Grimké]], sisters from a slaveholding family who became [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in the North. Learning that their late brother had [[Treatment of slaves in the United States|mixed-race sons]], they helped pay to educate the boys.

In 1966, Lerner became a founding member of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), and she served as a local and national leader for a short period. In 1968, she received her first academic appointment at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. There Lerner developed a Master of Arts Program in Women's History, which Sarah Lawrence offered beginning in 1972; it was the first American graduate degree in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/womens-history|title=Master of Arts in Women's History &amp;#124; Sarah Lawrence College |publisher=Sarahlawrence.edu|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner also taught at [[Long Island University]] in Brooklyn.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Lerner published scholarly books and articles that helped establish women's history as a recognized field of study. Her 1969 article "The Lady and the Mill Girl: Changes in the Status of Women in the Age of Jackson", published in the journal ''[[American Studies (journal)|American Studies]],'' was an early and influential example of [[class analysis]] in women's history. She was among the first to bring a consciously feminist lens to the study of history.

Among her most important works are the documentary anthologies ''Black Women in White America'' (1972) and ''The Female Experience'' (1976), which she edited, along with her essay collection, ''The Majority Finds Its Past'' (1979).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1979, Lerner chaired The Women's History Institute, a fifteen-day conference (July 13–29) at Sarah Lawrence College, co-sponsored by the college, the [[Women's Action Alliance]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It was attended by leaders of national organizations for women and girls. When the Institute participants learned about the success of the Women's History Week celebrated in [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], California, they decided to initiate similar commemorations within their own organizations, communities, and school districts. They also agreed to support an effort to secure a "National Women's History Week."&lt;ref name=JWA&gt;[http://jwa.org/thisweek/jul/18/1979/gerda-lerner Jwa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=N&gt;[http://www.nwhp.org/whm/history.php Nqhp.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This helped lead to the national establishment of [[Women's History Month]].&lt;ref name=JWA/&gt;&lt;ref name=N/&gt;

In 1980, Lerner moved to the [[University of Wisconsin at Madison]], where she established the nation's first Ph.D. program in women's history. At this institution, she wrote ''The Creation of Patriarchy'' (1986), ''The Creation of Feminist Consciousness'' (1993), parts one and two of ''Women and History;'' ''Why History Matters'' (1997), and ''Fireweed: A Political Autobiography'' (2002).&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

From 1981-82 Lerner served as president of the [[Organization of American Historians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oah.org/about/pastofcrs.html#Anchor-President-43705 Oah.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006111218/http://www.oah.org/about/pastofcrs.html |date=2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educational director for the organization, she helped make women's history accessible to leaders of women's organizations and high school teachers.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/20/books/making-history-her-story-too.html|work=The New York Times|first=Felicia R.|last=Lee|title=Making History Her Story, Too|date=July 20, 2002|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected works==

Lerner edited ''Black Women in White America: A Documentary History'' (1972), which chronicles 350 years of black women's contributions to history, despite centuries of being enslaved and treated as property. It was one of the first books to detail the contributions of black women in history.

In ''The Creation of Patriarchy'' (1986), volume one of ''Women and History'', Lerner ventured into prehistory, attempting to trace the roots of patriarchal dominance. She concluded that patriarchy was part of archaic states forming in the 2nd millennium BCE. Lerner provides historical, archeological, literary, and artistic evidence for the idea that patriarchy is a cultural construct. She believed that the main strength of patriarchy was ideological and that in western societies it "severed the connection between women and the Divine."&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2166622?loggedin=true&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Judith M. Bennett, "Reviewed Work: 'The Creation of Feminist Consciousness: From the Middle Ages to Eighteen-Seventy' by Gerda Lerner"], ''The American Historical Review,'' Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), pp. 1193-1195, via JSTOR, accessed 16 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Creation of Feminist Consciousness: From the Middle Ages to 1870'' (1993) is her second volume of ''Women and History.'' In this book, she reviews European culture from the seventh century through the nineteenth centuries, showing the limitations imposed by a male-dominated culture. After the seventh century, more of women's writings began to survive, and Lerner uses these to show the development of what she defines as feminist thought. She demonstrates the numerous ways that women "have bypassed or redefined or undermined 'male thought'."&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt; She examines in detail the educational deprivation of women, their isolation from many of the traditions of their societies, and the expressive outlet many women have found through writing. Often beginning in religious or prophetic writing, this was a way for women to engage in what Lerner calls "ideological production," including defining alternative futures and "think themselves out of patriarchy."
&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt;

''Fireweed: A Political Autobiography'' (2003) is a detailed account of Lerner's life from her childhood in Vienna through war and emigration, to 1958. That year she began her formal studies at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York, an institution established by numerous European refugees from the Nazi persecution.&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/53226 K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1019">'''Gillette Syndrome''' is the [[social disruption]] that can occur in a [[community]] due to rapid [[population growth]].  Such disruptions usually include increased [[crime]], degraded [[mental health]], weakened social and community bonds, abnormally high [[cost of living|costs of living]], and other [[social problems]]. 

Gillette Syndrome is most relevant to [[boomtown]]s that are growing rapidly due to nearby natural resource extraction, such as [[coal mining]] or [[natural gas]] [[drilling rig|drilling]].   

[[Psychologist]] ElDean Kohrs coined the term "Gillette Syndrome" in an attempt to describe the social impacts of rapid coal mining development on the boomtown of [[Gillette, Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohrs, El Dean (1974), "Social Consequences of Boom Growth in Wyoming".

'''Guéré''' (Gere), also called '''Wè''' (Wee), is a [[Kru languages|Kru language]] spoken by over 300,000 people in the [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] and [[Moyen-Cavally]] regions of [[Ivory Coast]].

==Phonology==
The [[phonology]] of Guere (here the Zagna dialect of Central Guere / Southern Wè)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paradis|first=Carole|year=1983|title=Description phonologique du guéré|location=Abidjan|publisher=Institut de Linguistique Appliquée, Université d'Abidjan}}&lt;/ref&gt; is briefly sketched out below.

===Consonants===
The consonant phonemes are as follows:

Allophones of some of these phonemes include:
* {{IPA|[k͡m]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/k͡p/}} before nasal vowels
* {{IPA|[ŋ͡m]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/ɡ͡b/}} before nasal vowels
* {{IPA|[ŋʷ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/w/}} before nasal vowels
* {{IPA|[ɗ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} in word-initial position
* {{IPA|[r]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} after a [[coronal consonant]] (alveolar or palatal)
In addition, while the nasal consonants {{IPA|/m, n/}} and contrast with {{IPA|/ɓ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} before oral vowels, and are thus separate phonemes, before nasal vowels only the nasal consonants occur. {{IPA|/ɓ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} do not occur before nasal vowels, suggesting that historically a [[Phonemic differentiation|phonemic merger]] between these sounds and the nasals {{IPA|/m, n/}} may have occurred in this position.

===Vowels===
Like many [[West Africa]]n languages, Guere makes use of a contrast between [[vowel]]s with [[advanced tongue root]] and those with [[retracted tongue root]]. In addition, [[nasal vowel]]s contrast phonemically with [[oral vowel]]s.

===Tones===
Guere is a [[tonal language]] and contrasts ten [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s:

{|class=wikitable

|-
!Low
| &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|˩}} || {{IPA|ɡ͡ba˩}} ||"to scatter"

The '''Huon languages''' are a [[language family|family]] within the original [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea]] (TNG) proposal, and [[William A. Foley]] considers their TNG identity to be established. They share with the [[Finisterre languages]] verbs which are [[suppletion|suppletive]] depending on the person and number of the object, strong morphological evidence that they are related.

==Internal structure==
Huon and Finisterre, and then the connection between them, were identified by [[Kenneth McElhanon]] (1967, 1970). They are clearly valid language families. Huon contains two clear branches, Eastern and Western. The Western languages allow more consonants in syllable-final position (p, t, k, m, n, ŋ), while the Eastern languages have neutralized those distinctions to two, the glottal stop (written ''c'') and the velar nasal (McElhanon 1974: 17). Beyond that, classification is based on [[lexicostatistics]], which is generally unreliable.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2572">'''Igbide ''' is an [[Isoko people|Isoko]] clan located in the [[Isoko South]] Local Government Area of [[Delta State]], [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.gov.ng/deltaclans2.htm|title=Delta Clans: Local Government Councils, Clans, Ethnic Groups and Titles of Their Traditional Rulers|publisher=Delta State Government|accessdate=2009-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009134532/http://www.deltastate.gov.ng/deltaclans2.htm|archivedate=2007-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant occupation of the Igbide is fishing. This is done mainly in the [[Urie lake]], [[Owodokpokpo]]. In the first week of February the clan holds a festival on the Urie marking the start of the fishing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.gov.ng/igbide.htm|title=Urie Fishing Festival of Igbide|publisher=Delta State Government|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant cultivation|Cultivation]], mainly of [[cassava]] and [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], is also undertaken by the Igbide.

While popular folklore has it that the Igbide people originated from [[Mgbidi]] in the Eastern ([[Igbo people|Igbo]]) part of Nigeria, some more recent writers attribute their origins to Awka in present day Anambra state with a blend of later immigrants from Uvwie (Effurun) in Delta State .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/Organizations/Uhs/Debates/UrhoboBeninRelations/Omoigui.html|title=Reply to Peter Ekeh on Benin-Urhobo Relationships |author=Nowamagbe Omoigui, M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This affiliation to the Igbos can be observed in the dress and costume codes of the Igbides in festivals like ABAME.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYq0goVWkVs|title=Abame festival of the Igbide people of Isoko South L.G.A of Delta State, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the salutation sequence and chants as well as the mercantile nature of a typical Igbide man.
The Igbide people took early to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicandioceseofoleh.org/history-begining%20of%20our%20story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Owodokpokpo, a community in Igbide clan, is regarded as one of the main entry points of Christianity into Isoko land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/UrhoboCulture/Religion/Erivwo/HistoryOfChristianity/ChapterThree.html|title=History of Christianity In Nigeria The Urhobo, the Isoko, and the Itsekiri Chapter Three  C.M.S.

Igbide is also an oil producing community and host to [[Shell (company)|Shell]]'s Oroni oilfield.

This library is the largest of its kind worldwide, and has been operating since June 1983, in [[Blutenburg Castle]] in the Munich district Obermenzing, before this time the library was located in [[Schwabing]].

== Profile ==
[[File:Castle View.jpg|thumb|[[Blutenburg Castle]]]]
The International Youth Library is a center for International Child and Youth literature, offering reading sessions, workshops, podium discussions, developmental programs, exhibitions and through the assistance of other literary establishments, a forum for international child and youth literature.

Since 2010, The International Youth Library has been hosting the ''White Ravens Festival''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ijb.de/en/white-ravens-festival.html| title=White Ravens Festival 2014 | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Internationale Jungendbibliothek | language= | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for International Child and Youth literature, held every 2 years, and in 2013 the first [[James Krüss]] prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boersenblatt.net/621793/ | title="Ein frischer, respektloser und unbekümmerter Ton" | author= | date=14 May 2013 | website= | publisher=Börsenblatt | language=German | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for international child and youth literature, to be awarded every 2 years, was handed out allowing a new author to be discovered and recognized for his accomplishments.

The White Ravens recommendation list and the yearbook "Das Bücherschloss"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ijb.de/publikationen/single/article/das-buecherschloss/34.html | title=Das Bücherschloss | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Internationale Jugendbibliothek | language=German | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Castle of Books) assist in the discussions about international child and youth literature. With its "Arche Kinder Kalenders" (Arche Calendar for Children) the library broadens the cultural horizons for children.

Through readings, writing workshops and workshops for exhibitions, literature museums and children literary themes, the library has become a key partner for schools, and daycares. The children’s library contains over 30.000 books and electronic media in over 20 different languages that is available free to borrow.

== History ==
[[File:Aerial view of Blutenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Aireal View]]
The Munich library was founded in 1949 by the journalist and author [[Jella Lepman]]. The idea was a huge success because of the youth book exhibition in 1946, from which the exhibition material became the basis for the library's collection. On 14 September 1949, the international youth library opened with a collection of over 8000 volumes. Jella Lepman's idea to promote tolerance, reconciliation and understanding of other life forms and cultures with the help of international child and youth books as influential material, was received by the public with great interest. The international youth library serves as an archive of the valuable and rare collection, as well as a place for children’s gathering and interacting and to promote its objectives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ijb.de/en/about-us/iyl-history.html| title=History of the International Youth Library| author= | date= | website= | publisher=Internationale Jugendbibliothek | language= | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The international book inventories and historical collections of the library are one of a kind and made available to researchers in a scientific reading room for studies. A scholarship program for foreign scientists, financed by the Foreign Office, pursues the goal of supporting the research in the area of the international child and youth literature, supporting the illustration, and promoting scientific exchange and international co-operation.

The collection covers more than 600,000 child and youth books in 150 languages, including valuable collections of historical children's books. Also the library has more than 30,000 titles of international research literature as well as about 150 current technical periodicals in many languages. The library's catalog of books can be found over the Internet; also you can find other recommendations list there.

The collection is also expanding with the addition of estates from authors such as James Krüss or [[Hans Baumann (writer)|Hans Baumann]].

== Literature museums ==
The library in Schloss Blutenburg serves home to several literature museums: The [[Michael Ende|Michael-Ende]]-Museum (opened 1998), the [[James Krüss|James-Krüss]]-Tower, the [[Erich Kästner|Erich-Kästner]]-Room, and since July 2005 the Binette-Schroeder-Kabinett. Each showroom is filled with numerous books and illustrations and also letters, diaries and personal articles of the represented people.

== The White Ravens ==
The annually published catalog "The White Ravens" is a recommendation list for child and youth literature. From the large quantity of the review and donation copies, which the library receives from publishing houses, institutions, organizations and other friends of the library, the lectors select 200 new releases from over 40 countries in more than 30 languages. The titles are taken into consideration based on the interest of their universal topic and/or their innovative literary and picture-formative quality for a specialized international audience and if they will be well received. Each book listed in the catalog is briefly described with short annotations. Using identification symbols, the "special Mentions" are identified, as well as the books that are found to be a contribution to the communication between cultures and people, and easy-to-read texts, which also apply to the older readers. The catalog contains books from 81 countries and in 58 languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">The '''Johns Hopkins Club''' is a private club located on the grounds of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] Homewood Campus at 3400 North Charles Street in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].
[[File:Johns Hopkins Club.JPG|thumb|right|Johns Hopkins Club]]

==History==
The creation of the '''Johns Hopkins Club''' was inspired by [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] who, after a visit to the [[Yale University|Yale]] Graduates Club in [[New Haven]] wanted to provide a similar facility for Hopkins. The club was officially organized in December 1899, with 260 charter members.  One of the founders of the Club was [[Alfred Jenkins Shriver]], a member of the Johns Hopkins Class of 1891, for whom Shriver Hall is named on Hopkins' Homewood Campus.&lt;ref&gt;"Death Claims A. J. Shriver, Noted Lawyer: President of University Club Fails to Rally from Operation," Baltimore ''Sun'', September 4, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

The club includes a membership of both men and women, restricted to alumni, faculty, and full-time graduate students of Johns Hopkins University. The Club now is home to over 4,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1999/sep2799/27club.html Johns Hopkins Club celebrates a century of tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installations==
When the University moved to the Homewood campus, the Johns Hopkins Club moved with it, occupying the [[Homewood House]] until 1929, when it became a museum. In 1936, the university alumnus and trustee Theodore Marburg and his family provided the funds to construct the current building. It was designed by architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks, reinterpreting the style of Homewood House, continuing the tradition of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings on campus. It has a dramatic spiral staircase insider. Several additions have been made since then, including offices and additional dining and kitchen space, notably in 1956, 1981 and 1987.

{{History of Burma}}

The '''Konbaung dynasty''' ({{lang-my|ကုန်းဘောင်ခေတ်&lt;!--UNICODE ONLY, NO ZAWGYI--&gt;}}, {{IPA-my|kóʊɴbàʊɴ kʰɪʔ|pron}}), formerly known as the '''Alompra dynasty''', or '''Alaungpaya dynasty''', was the last dynasty that ruled [[Myanmar|Burma]]/[[Myanmar]] from 1752 to 1885. It created the second-largest empire in [[history of Myanmar|Burmese history]] and continued the administrative reforms begun by the [[Toungoo dynasty]], laying the foundations of the modern state of Burma. The reforms, however, proved insufficient to stem the advance of the [[British Empire|British]], who defeated the Burmese in all three [[Anglo-Burmese wars]] over a six-decade span (1824–1885) and ended the millennium-old Burmese monarchy in 1885.

An expansionist dynasty, the Konbaung kings waged campaigns against [[Manipur]], [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], [[Ahom kingdom|Assam]], the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom of [[Pegu]] and the [[Thai people|Siamese]] kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], thus establishing the {{nowrap|'''Third Burmese Empire'''}}. Subject to later wars and treaties with the British, the modern state of [[Burma]] can trace its current borders to these events.

Throughout the Konbaung dynasty, the [[Capital city|capital]] was relocated several times for religious, political and strategic reasons.

==History==

===Establishment===

The dynasty was heroically founded by a village chief, who later became known as [[Alaungpaya]], in 1752 to challenge the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] which had just toppled the [[Taungoo dynasty]]. By 1759, Alaungpaya's forces had reunited all of Burma (and [[Manipur]]) and driven out the [[French colonial empire|French]] and the British who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy.{{sfn|Phayre|1883|p=153}}

[[File:Lion throne, Amarapura Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Lion Throne in the throne hall of the royal palace of Amarapura (Painting by Colesworthy Grant, 1855.]]

Alaungpaya's second son, [[Hsinbyushin]], came to the throne after a short reign by his elder brother, [[Naungdawgyi]] (1760–1763). He continued his father's expansionist policy and finally took Ayutthaya in 1767, after seven years of fighting.

===Reforms===
Realising the need to modernise, the Konbaung rulers tried to enact various reforms with limited success. King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]] with his able brother Crown Prince [[Kanaung Mintha|Kanaung]] established state-owned factories to produce modern [[weapon]]ry and [[good (accounting)|goods]]; in the end, these factories proved more costly than effective in staving off foreign invasion and conquest.

Mindon also tried to reduce the tax burden by lowering the heavy [[income tax]] and created a [[property tax]], as well as [[duties]] on foreign exports. These policies had the reverse effect of increasing the tax burden, as the local elites used the opportunity to enact new taxes without lowering the old ones; they were able to do so as control from the centre was weak. In addition, the duties on foreign exports stifled the burgeoning trade and commerce.

Konbaung kings extended administrative reforms begun in the Restored Toungoo dynasty period (1599–1752), and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. They tightened control in the lowlands and reduced the hereditary privileges of [[Shan people|Shan]] [[saopha|chiefs]]. They also instituted commercial reforms that increased government income and rendered it more predictable. Money economy continued to gain ground. In 1857, the crown inaugurated a full-fledged system of cash taxes and salaries, assisted by the country's first standardised silver coinage.{{sfn|Lieberman|1996|p=184-187}}

Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001}}

===Relations with Siam===

In 1760, Burma began a series of wars with [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]] that would last well into the middle of the 19th century. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)|temporarily defeated Siam (1767)]], subdued much of [[Laos]] (1765) and defeated [[Sino–Burmese War (1765–1769)|four invasions]] by [[Qing China]] (1765–1769).{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=184–187}} With the Burmese preoccupied for another two decades by another impending invasion by the Chinese,{{sfn|Dai|2004|p=145–189}} the Siamese recovered their territories by 1770, and went on to [[Burmese–Siamese War (1775–76)|capture Lan Na by 1776]].{{sfn|Wyatt|2003|p=125}} Burma and Siam went to war until [[Burmese–Siamese War (1849–1855)|1855]] but after decades of war, the two countries exchanged Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Siam).

===Relations with China===

In the defence of its realm, the dynasty fought four wars successfully against the Qing dynasty of China which saw the threat of the expansion of Burmese power in the East. In 1770, despite his victory over the Chinese armies, King Hsinbyushin sued for peace with China and concluded a treaty to maintain bilateral trade with the Middle Kingdom which was very important for the dynasty at that time. The Qing dynasty then opened up its markets and restored trading with Burma in 1788 after reconciliation. Thenceforth peaceful and friendly relations prevailed between China and Burma for a long time.

===Relations with the British and downfall===

Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Siam in the east, [[Bodawpaya]] acquired western kingdoms of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] (1784), [[Manipur]] (1814) and [[Ahom kingdom|Assam]] (1817), leading to a long ill-defined border with [[British India]].{{sfn|Myint-U|2006|p=109}}

[[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to set up trading posts in the [[Irrawaddy delta]] region during this period. Konbaung tried to maintain its independence by balancing between the [[French colonial empire|French]] and the [[British Empire|British]]. In the end it failed, the British severed diplomatic relations in 1811, and the dynasty fought and lost three wars against the [[British Empire]], culminating in total annexation of Burma by the British.

[[File:Scene upon the terrace of the Great Dagon Pagoda at Rangoon.jpg|thumb|The [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–26)]]
The British decisively defeated the Burmese in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826). Burma was forced to cede Arakan, Manipur, Assam and [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]], and pay a large indemnity of one million [[pounds sterling|pounds]].

In 1837, King [[Bagyidaw]]'s brother, [[Tharrawaddy Min|Tharrawaddy]], seized the throne, put Bagyidaw under house arrest and executed the chief queen [[Me Nu]] and her brother.{{sfn|Buyers}} Tharrawaddy made no attempt to improve relations with Britain.

[[File:Thibaw Min 1885 crop.jpg|thumb|The last king, Thibaw Min (right), here with Queen Supayalat and her sister Princess Supayagyi, was forcibly deposed in a war with the British colonialists in 1885.]]

His son [[Pagan Min|Pagan]], who became king in 1846, executed thousands – some sources say as many as 6,000 – of his wealthier and more influential subjects on trumped-up charges.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.san.beck.org/20-8-BurmaMalaya1800-1950.html#a1|title=Burma, Malaya and Siam 1800–1950|author=Sanderson Beck|accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, relations with the British became increasingly strained. In 1852, the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] broke out. Pagan was succeeded by his younger brother, the progressive [[Mindon Min|Mindon]]. Mindon attempted to bring Burma into greater contact with the outside world, and hosted the [[Fifth Buddhist council|Fifth Great Buddhist Synod]] in 1872 at [[Mandalay]], gaining the respect of the British and the admiration of his own people.

Mindon avoided annexation in 1875 by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. He died before he could name a successor, and [[Thibaw Min|Thibaw]], a lesser prince, was manoeuvred onto the throne by Hsinbyumashin, one of Mindon's queens, together with her daughter, [[Supayalat]]. ([[Rudyard Kipling]] mentions her as Thibaw's queen, and borrows her name, in his poem "[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]") The new [[Thibaw Min|King Thibaw]] proceeded, under Supayalat's direction, to massacre all likely contenders to the throne. This massacre was conducted by the queen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

[[File:Saya Chone's "Abdication of King Thibaw".png|thumb|A traditional painting by Saya Chone depicts the abdication of King Thibaw.]]

The dynasty came to an end in 1885 with the forced abdication and exile of the king and the royal family to [[India]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885. The annexation was announced in the British parliament as a New Year gift to [[Queen Victoria]] on 1 January 1886.

Although the dynasty had conquered vast tracts of territory, its direct power was limited to its capital and the fertile plains of the [[Irrawaddy valley]]. The Konbaung rulers enacted harsh levies and had a difficult time fighting internal rebellions. At various times, the [[Shan people|Shan]] states paid tribute to the Konbaung Dynasty, but unlike the Mon lands, were never directly controlled by the Burmese.

==Government==
The Konbaung dynasty was an [[absolute monarchy]]. As in the rest of Southeast Asia, the traditional concept of kingship aspired to the ''[[Chakravartin]]'' (Universal Monarchs) creating their own ''[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]'' or field of power within the ''[[Jambudvipa|Jambudipa]]'' universe, along with the possession of the white elephant which allowed them to assume the title ''Hsinbyushin'' or ''Hsinbyumyashin'' (Lord of the White Elephants), played a significant role in their endeavours. Of more earthly importance was the historical threat of periodic raids and aiding of internal rebellions as well as invasion and imposition of overlordship from the neighbouring kingdoms of the Mon, Tai Shans and Manipuris.{{sfn|Surakiat|2006|p=8, 11, 25}}

===Administrative divisions===
The kingdom was divided into provinces called ''myo'' ({{my|ၿမိဳ႕}}).{{sfn|Bird|1897|p=104}}{{sfn|Seekins|2006|p=51}} These provinces were administered by ''Myosa'' ({{my|ၿမိဳ႕စား}}), who were members of the royal family or the highest-ranking officials of the Hluttaw.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=153}} They collected revenue for the royal government, payable to the Shwedaik (Royal Treasury) in fixed instalments and retained whatever was left over.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=153}} Each ''myo'' was subdivided into districts called ''taik'' ({{my|တိုက်}}), which contained collections of villages called ''ywa'' ({{my|ရွာ}}).{{sfn|Bird|1897|p=104}}

The kingdom's peripheral coastal provinces ([[Pegu]], [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]], [[Mottama|Martaban]] and [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]) were administered by a Viceroy called a ''Myowun'', who was appointed by the king and possessed civil, judicial, fiscal and military powers.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=153}} Provincial councils (''myoyon'') consisted of ''myo saye'' (town scribes), ''nakhandaw'' (receivers of royal orders), ''sitke'' (chiefs of war), ''htaunghmu'' (jailer), ''ayatgaung'' (head of the quarter), and ''dagahmu'' (warden of the gates).{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=154}} Each province was divided into districts called ''myo'', each led by a ''myo ok'' (if appointed), or by a ''myo thugyi'' (if the office was hereditary).{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=154}} The Viceroy of Pegu was assisted by several additional officials, including an ''akhunwun'' (revenue officer), ''akaukwun'' (customs collector), and a ''yewun'' (conservator of port).{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=154-155}}

The outlying tributary [[fiefdom]]s on the edges of the kingdom were autonomous in practice and nominally administered by the king.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=77}} These included the [[Shan language|Tai-speaking]] (what became the [[Shan States]] during British rule), Palaung, [[Kachin State|Kachin]] and [[Manipur]]i kingdoms. The tributary princes of these fiefdoms regularly pledged allegiance and offered tribute to the Konbaung kings (through rituals called ''[[gadaw|gadaw pwedaw]]''){{sfn|Philips|1951|p=117, 121}} and were accorded with royal privileges and designated ''[[sawbwa]]'' (from Shan saopha, 'lord of the sky'){{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=102}} In particular, the families of Shan ''sawbwa''s regularly intermarried into Burmese aristocracy and had close contact with the Konbaung court.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=77}}

===Royal court===

[[File:Saya Chone's "Royal Audience".png|thumb|"Royal Audience," a traditional painting by Saya Chone]]

Konbaung society was centred on the king, who took many wives and fathered numerous children, creating a huge extended royal family which formed the power base of the dynasty and competed over influence at the royal court. It also posed problems of succession at the same time often resulting in royal massacres.

The ''Lawka Byuha Kyan'' ({{my|လောကဗျူဟာကျမ်း}}), also known as the ''Inyon Sadan'' ({{my|အင်းယုံစာတန်း}}), is the earliest extant work on Burmese court protocols and customs.{{sfn| Working People's Daily|1988}} The work was written by the Inyon Wungyi Thiri Uzana, also known as the Inyon Ywaza, during the reign of [[Alaungpaya]], the founder of the Konbaung dynasty.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=70}}

Royal court life in the Konbaung dynasty consisted of both codified rituals and ceremonies and those that were innovated with the progression of the dynasty. Many ceremonies were composed of Hindu ideas localised and adapted to existing traditions, both Burmese and Buddhist in origin. These rituals were also used to legitimise the rule of Burmese kings, as the Konbaung monarchs claimed descent from [[Maha Sammata]] through the [[Shakya|Sakyan clan]] (of which [[Gotama Buddha]] was a member). Life in the royal court was closely regulated. [[Eunuchs]] ({{my|မိန်းမဆိုး}}) oversaw the ladies of the royal household and apartments.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=205}} Inferior queens and concubines could not reside in the main palace buildings.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=205}}

Brahmins, generally known as ''ponna'' ({{my|ပုဏ္ဏား}}) in Burmese, served as specialists for ritual ceremonies, astrology, and devotional rites to Hindu deities at the Konbaung court.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=160-161}} They played an essential role in king-making rituals, consecration and ablution ceremonies called ''[[abhiseka]]'' ({{my|ဗိဿိတ်}}).{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=159}} Court Brahmins ({{my|ပုရောဟိတ်}}, ''parohita'') were well embedded in daily life at the court, advising and consulting the king on various matters.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=168}} A social hierarchy among the Brahmins determined their respective duties and functions.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=168}} Astrologer Brahmins called ''huya'' ({{my|ဟူးရား}}) were responsible for determining astrological calculations, such as determining the auspicious moment for the foundation of a new capital, a new palace, pagoda, or assumption of the royal residence, announcing an appointment, leaving a place, visiting a pagoda or starting a military campaign.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=169}} They also established the religious calendar, prepared the almanac ({{my|သင်္ကြန်စာ}}), calculated upcoming solar and lunar eclipses, identified major festival days based on the lunar cycle, and communicated auspicious times and dates.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=169}} A special group of Brahmins who performed ''abhiseka'' rituals were also selected as ''pyinnya shi'' ({{my|ပညာရှိ}}), appointed royal counselors.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=177}}

===Royal rituals===

Lavish affairs were also organised around the life ceremonies of royal family members.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=57}} Brahmins presided over many of these auspicious ceremonies, including the construction of a new royal capital; consecration of the new palace, the royal ploughing ceremony; the naming, first rice feeding and cradling ceremonies; the ''abhiseka'' head anointing rituals, and the King's participation in [[Thingyan|Burmese New Year]] (Thingyan) celebrations.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}} During Thingyan, a group of 8 Brahmins sprinkled water blessed by a group of 8 Buddhist monks, throughout the palace grounds, at the [[Hluttaw]], various courts, the major city gates, and the 4 corners of the capital.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}} The king attended many of the ceremonies involving royal family members, from cradling ceremonies ({{my|ပုခက်မင်္ဂလာ}}) to ear-boring ceremonies, from marriages to funerals.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=57}}

Specific buildings in the royal palace served as the venue for various life ceremonies. For instance, the Great Audience Hall was where young princes underwent the ''[[shinbyu]]'' coming-of-age ceremony and were ordained as [[Pabbajja|monk novices]].{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} This was also the venue where young princes ceremonially had their hair tied in a topknot ({{my|{{my|သျှောင်ထုံး}}}}).{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} Elaborate Burmese New Year feasts took place at the Hmannandawgyi (Palace of Mirrors): on the third day of the New Year, the king and chief queen partook in Thingyan rice, cooked rice dipped in cold perfumed water, while seated on their throne.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=29}} Musical and dramatic performances and other feasts were also held in that complex.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=29}}

====Consecration ceremonies (''abhiseka'')====
[[File:Konbaung Dynasty Abhiseka.jpg|thumb|A nineteenth-century watercolor painting by royal painters depicts an Konbaung ''abhiseka'' ceremony. The king and queen are respectively seated in the pavilion, surrounded by a retinue of Brahmins.]]
The most significant court functions of a king's reign were the ''[[abhiseka]]'' or consecratory rituals, held at various times throughout a king's reign, to reinforce his place as the patron of religion ([[Sasana]]) and righteousness.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=57}} ''Abhiseka'' rituals all involved the pouring of water from a conch on the candidate's (usually the king's) head, instructing him what to do or not to do for the love of his people and warning him that if he failed to oblige, he might suffer certain miseries.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}} Ablution rituals were the responsibility of a group of 8 elite Brahmins uniquely qualified to perform the ritual.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}} They were to remain chaste before the ceremony.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}} Another group of Brahmins was responsible for the consecration of the Crown Prince.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}}

There were 14 types of ''abhiseka'' ceremonies in total:{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=175}}

====Coronation====

''Rajabhiseka'' ({{my|ရာဇဘိသိက်}}) - the Coronation of the king, which was presided over by Brahmins, was the most important ritual of the royal court.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=136}}{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=174}} The ceremony was typically held in the Burmese month of ''[[Kason]]'', but did not necessarily occur during the beginning of a reign.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=174}}{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=136}} The ''Sasanalinkaya'' states that [[Bodawphaya]], like his father, was crowned only after establishing control over the kingdom's administration and purifying the religious institutions.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=174}} The most important features of this ritual were: the fetching of the anointing water; the ceremonial bath; the anointment; and the king's oath.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=147}}

Elaborate preparations were made precisely for this ceremony. Three ceremonial pavilions (''Sihasana'' or Lion Throne; ''Gajasana'' or Elephant Throne; and the ''Marasana'' or Peacock Throne) were constructed in a specifically designated plot of land (called the "peacock garden") for this occasion.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=137}} Offerings were also made to deities and Buddhist ''[[paritta]]''s were chanted.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=136}} Specially designated individuals, usually the daughters of dignitaries including merchants and Brahmins, were tasked with procuring anointing water midstream from a river.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=137-138}} The water was placed in the respective pavilions.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=138}}

At an auspicious moment, the king was dressed in the costume of a [[Brahma]] and the queen in that of a queen from ''[[devaloka]]''.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=139}} The couple was escorted to the pavilions in procession, accompanied by a white horse or a white elephant.{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=325}}{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=139}} The king first bathed his body in the Morasana pavilion, then his head in the Gajasana pavilion.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=140}} He then entered the Sihasana pavilion to assume his seat at the coronation throne, crafted to resemble a blooming [[lotus (genus)|lotus]] flower, made of [[figwood]] and applied gold leaf.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=140}} Brahmins handed him the five articles of coronation regalia ({{my|မင်းမြောက်တန်ဆာ}}, ''Min Myauk Taza''):
# White umbrella ({{my|ထီးဖြူ}}, ''hti byu''){{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}}
# Crown, in the form of a crested headdress ({{my|မကိုဋ်}}, ''magaik''){{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}}
# Sceptre ({{my|သန်လျက်}}, ''thanlyet''){{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}}
# Sandals ({{my|ခြေနင်း}}, ''che nin''){{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}}
# [[Fly-whisk]], made of yak tail ({{my|သားမြီးယပ်}}, ''thamyi yat''){{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}}

At his throne, eight princesses anointed the king by pouring specially procured water atop his head, each using a conch bedazzled with gems white solemnly adjuring him in formulae to rule justly.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=140}}{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=325}} Brahmins then raised a [[white umbrella]] over the king's head.{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=325}} This anointment was repeated by eight pure-blooded Brahmins and eight merchants.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=141}} Afterward, the king repeated words ascribed to Buddha at birth: "I am foremost in all the world! I am most excellent in all the world! I am peerless in all the world!" and made invocation by pouring water from a golden ewer.{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=325}} The ritual ended with the king taking refuge in the [[Three Jewels]].{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=325}}

As part of the coronation, prisoners were released.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=141}} The king and his pageant returned to the Palace, and the ceremonial pavilions were dismantled and cast into the river.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=142}} Seven days after the ceremony, the king and members of the royal family made an inaugural procession, circling the city moat on a gilt state barge, amid festive music and spectators.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=450}}

During [[Suddhodana|King Suddhodana]]'s royal ploughing of the fields, the infant Buddha rose to stand, sat cross-legged and began to meditate, underneath the shade of a [[Syzygium jambos|rose apple]] tree.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=257-258}}

The ceremony was held at the beginning of June, at the break of the southwest monsoon.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=258}} For the ceremony, the king, clad in state robes (a ''[[paso]]'' with the peacock emblem (''daungyut'')), a long silk surcoat or tunic encrusted with jewels, a spire-like crown (''tharaphu''), and 24 strings of the ''[[salwe]]'' across his chest, and a gold plate or frontlet over his forehead) and his audience made a procession to the ''leya'' (royal fields).{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=259}} At the ''ledawgyi'', a specially designated plot of land, milk-white oxen were attached to royal ploughs covered with gold leaf, stood ready for ploughing by ministers, princes and the kings.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=260}} The oxen were decorated with gold and crimson bands, reins bedecked with rubies and diamonds, and heavy gold tassels hung from the gilded horns.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=260}} The king initiated the ploughing, and shared this duty among himself, ministers and the princes.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=261}} After the ceremonial ploughing of the ''ledawgyi'' was complete, festivities sprung up throughout the royal capital.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=261}}

====Head-washing ceremony====
At [[Thingyan]] and at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist lent]], the king's head was ceremonially washed with water from Gaungsay Gyun (lit. Head Washing Island) between Martaban and [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]], near the mouth of the [[Salween River]].{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=206}} After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] (which resulted in Gaungsay Gyun falling under British possession), purified water from [[Irrawaddy River]] was instead procured. This ceremony also preceded the earboring, headdressing, and marriage ceremonies of the royal family.{{sfn|Yi|1982|p=124}}

====Obeisance ceremony====
The [[Gadaw|Obeisance ceremony]] was a grand ceremony held at the Great Audience Hall thrice a year where tributary princes and courtiers laid tribute, paid homage to their benefactor, the Konbaung king, and swore their allegiance to the monarchy.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=205}} The ceremony was held 3 times a year:
# ''Hnit Thit Gadaw'' ({{my|နှစ်သစ်ကန်တော့}}){{sfn|Scott|1900|94}} - Beginning of the [[Thingyan|Burmese New Year]] (April){{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}
# ''Wa-win Gadaw'' ({{my|ဝါဝင်ကန်တော့}}){{sfn|Scott|1900|94}} - Beginning of the [[Vassa|Buddhist Lent]] (June or July) - required the attendance of princes, ministers and city officials{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}
# ''Wa-gyut Gadaw'' ({{my|ဝါကျွတ်ကန်တော့}}){{sfn|Scott|1900|94}} - [[Thadingyut|End of the Buddhist Lent]] (October) - required the attendance of provincial governors and tributary princes (''sawbwa''){{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}

During this ceremony, the king was seated at the Lion Throne, along with the chief queen, to his right.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} The Crown Prince was seated immediately before the throne in a cradle-like seat, followed by princes of the blood (min nyi min tha).{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} Constituting the audience were courtiers and dignitaries from vassal states, who were seated according to rank, known in Burmese as ''Neya Nga Thwe'' ({{my|နေရာငါးသွယ်}}):{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}
# ''Taw Neya'' ({{my|တော်နေရာ}});{{sfn|MLC|1993}}
# ''Du Neya'' ({{my|ဒူးနေရာ}});{{sfn|MLC|1993}}
# ''Sani'' ({{my|စနည်း}});{{sfn|MLC|1993}}
# ''Atwin Bawaw'' ({{my|အတွင်းဘဝေါ}});{{sfn|MLC|1993}}
# ''Apyin Bawaw'' ({{my|အပြင်ဘဝေါ}}){{sfn|MLC|1993}}

There, the audience paid obeisance to the monarch and renewed their allegiance to the monarch.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} Women, barring the chief queen, were not permitted to be seen during these ceremonies.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}} Lesser queens, ministers' wives and other officials were seated in a room behind the throne: the queens were seated in the centre within the railing surrounding the flight of steps, while the wives of ministers and others sat in the space without.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}

====Ancestor worship====
Throughout the Konbaung dynasty, the royal family performed [[ancestor worship|ancestral rites]] to honour their immediate ancestors. These rites were performed at the thrice a year at the Zetawunsaung ([[Jetavana]] Hall or "Hall of Victory"), which housed the Goose Throne ({{my|ဟင်္သာသနပလ္လင်}}), immediately preceding the Obeisance Ceremony.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=28}} On a platform in a room to the west of hall, the king and members of the royal family paid obeisance to images of monarchs and consorts of the Konbaung dynasty. Offerings and [[Pali]] prayers from a book of odes were also made to the images.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=28}} The images, which stood {{convert|6|to|24|in}} tall, were made of solid gold.{{sfn|Hall|1925|p=327-328}} Images were only made for Konbaung kings at their death (if he died on the throne) or for Konbaung queens (if she died while her consort was on throne), but not of a king who died after deposition or a queen who survived her husband.{{sfn|Hall|1925|p=327-328}} Items used by the deceased personage (e.g. sword, spear, betel box) were preserved along with the associated image.{{sfn|Hall|1925|p=327-328}} After the British conquest of [[Upper Burma]], 11 images fell into the hands of the Superintendent at the [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Governor's Residence, Bengal]], where they were melted down.{{sfn|Hall|1925|p=327-328}}

====Funerals====
{{see also|Konbaung tombs}}
[[File:King Mindon's Tomb, Mandalay.jpg|thumb|The tomb of King Mindon on the grounds of [[Mandalay Palace]] in 1903]]
When a king died, his royal white umbrella was broken and the great drum and gong at the palace's bell tower (at the eastern gate of the palace), was struck.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=204}} It was custom for members of the royal family, including the king, to be cremated: their ashes were put into a velvet bag and thrown into the river.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=23}} King [[Mindon Min]] was the first to break tradition; his remains were not cremated, but instead were buried intact, according to his wishes, at the place where his tomb now stands.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=23}} Before his burial, the King Mindon's body was laid in state before his throne at the Hmannandawgyi (Palace of Mirrors).{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=29}}{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=27}}

====Foundation sacrifice====
The Foundation Sacrifice was a Burmese practice whereby human victims known as ''myosade'' ({{my|မြို့စတေး}}) were ceremonially sacrificed by burial during the foundation of a royal capital, to propitiate and appease the [[Nat (spirit)|guardian spirits]]. to ensure impregnability of the capital city.{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=321}} The victims were crushed to death underneath a massive teak post erected near each gateway, and at the four corners of the city walls, to render the city secure and impregnable.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} Although this practice contradicted the fundamental tenets of Buddhism, it was in alignment with prevailing animistic beliefs, which dictated that the spirits of persons who suffered violent deaths became ''nat''s (spirits) and protective and possessive of their death sites.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} The preferred sites for such executions were the city's corners and the gates, the most vulnerable defence points.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}}

The Konbaung monarchs prescribed to ancient precedents and traditions to found the new royal city. Brahmins were tasked with planning these sacrificial ceremonies and determining the auspicious day according to astrological calculations and the signs of individuals best suited for sacrifice.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} Usually, victims were selected from a spectrum of social classes, or unfortuitiously apprehended against will during the day of the sacrifice.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} Women in the latter stages of pregnancy were preferred, as the sacrifice would yield two guardian spirits instead of one.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}}

Such sacrifices took place at the foundation of Wunbe In Palace in [[Innwa|Ava]] in 1676 and may have taken place at the foundation of Mandalay in 1857.{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=321}} Royal court officials at the time claimed that the tradition was dispensed altogether, with flowers and fruit offered in lieu of human victims.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} [[Burmese chronicles]] and contemporary records only make mention of large jars of oil buried at the identified locations, which was, by tradition, to ascertain whether the spirits would continue to protect the city (i.e., so long as the oil remained intact, the spirits were serving their duty).{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=19}} Shwe Yoe's ''The Burman'' describes 52 men, women and children buried, with 3 buried under the post near each of the twelve gates of the city walls, one at each corner of those walls, one at each corner of the teak stockade, one under each of the four entrances to the Palace, and four under the Lion Throne.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=482}} [[Taw Sein Ko]]'s ''Annual Report for 1902-03'' for the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] mentions only four victims buried at the corners of the city walls.

====Devotional rituals====
[[File:Four Guardian Kings in Burmese art.jpg|thumb|The Guardians of the Four Cardinal Directions (''[[Lokapala]]'') in Burmese depiction]]
Brahmins at the Konbaung court regularly performed a variety of grand devotional rituals to indigenous spirits (''nat'') and Hindu deities.{{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=57}} The following were the most important devotional cults:
* [[Ganesha]] (''Maha Peinne'' in Burmese) - During the Burmese month of [[Nadaw]] (November to December), a festival for Ganesha, the god of prudence and good policy, was held. Grain first reaped from the royal fields was sent to the [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]] as an offering to Ganesha, in three huge containers in the shape of a buffalo, bullock and prawn, in which paddy, millet, and bulrush millet were respectively placed.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=34}} Ganesha, mounted on a peacock, was placed on a ceremonial procession and was then brought before the king, who after paying homage, scattered pieces of silver and clothes among the poor.{{sfn|DAS|1963|p=34}}{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=103}} Ganesha occupied a prominent place in royal ceremonies, especially as he was considered a guardian deity of the elephants.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=171}} Offerings to Ganesha, made in the Burmese month of [[Tazaungmon]] were established during Bodawpaya's reign.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=173}}
* ''Phaya Ko Zu'' ({{my|ဘုရားကိုးဆူ}}, lit. "Nine Deities") - This was a devotional rite performmed by Khettara Brahmins. The deities referenced were either Buddhist: Buddha and the 8 [[arahat]]s, or non-Buddhist: 5 [[Hindu]] deities, including [[Chandi|Candi]] and Ganesha, and 4 ''nat''s).{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=170-171}}
* [[Skanda (Buddhism)|Skanda]] ({{my|Sakanta or Sakanta Tattika}}) - King [[Bodawpaya]] reformed the annual ceremonial procession to honour Ganesha to instead honour Skanda, the god of war (and a son of [[Shiva]] and Candi), following the advice of a Brahmin from [[Benares]].{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=172}}&lt;ref&gt;Said Brahmin had the following issue: by the Govinda-maharajinda-aggamahadhammarajaguru.&lt;/ref&gt; This procession was held in the Burmese month of [[Tabaung]].{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=173}} Skanda was closely linked with a deity called Citrabali-mara (Cittarapali-mar[a]), both of whom were connected to rituals mentioned in ''Rajamattan'', a standard reference for ceremonies at the royal court compiled during Bodawphaya's reign.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=173}}
* Hindu deities: Candi (Canni), [[Indra]] ([[Thagyamin]]), [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Asuras]] and the 4 [[Lokapala]] - These deities were placed at specific locations, at the entrances of the capital city, the royal palace, or in temples, to ward off evil.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=172}}
* Other spirits (''nat''): Planets, Sky, Sun, Moon, ''Hon'' (the fire spirit){{sfn|Leider|2005|p=173}}{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=170}}

==Society and culture==
[[File:Burmese Court Officials 1795.jpg|thumb|Burmese court officials in 1795]]

===Social classes===
During the Konbaung dynasty, Burmese society was highly stratified. Loosely modelled on the four [[Varna (Hinduism)|Hindu ''varna''s]], Konbaung society was divided into four general social classes ({{my|အမျိုးလေးပါး}}) by descent:{{sfn|MLC|1993}}
# Rulers ({{my|မင်းမျိုး}}) or ''[[Kshatriya|Khattiya]]'' ({{my|ခတ္တိယ}}){{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=31}}
# Ritualists ({{my|ပုဏ္ဏားမျိုး}}) or ''[[Brahmin|Brahmana]]'' ({{my|ဗြာဟ္မဏ}}){{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=31}}
# Merchants ({{my|သူဌေးမျိုး}}) or ''[[Vaishya|Vessa]]'' ({{my|ဝေဿ}}){{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=31}}
# Commoners ({{my|ဆင်းရဲသားမျိုး}}) or ''[[Shudra|Sudda]]'' ({{my|သုဒ္ဒ}}){{sfn|Myint-U|2001|p=31}}

Society also distinguished between the free and slaves ({{my|ကျွန်မျိုး}}), who were indebted persons or [[prisoners of war]] (including those brought back from military campaigns in [[Kingdom of Arakan|Arakan]], [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayuthaya]], and [[Manipur]]), but could belong to one of the four classes. There was also distinction between taxpayers and non-taxpayers. Tax-paying commoners were called ''athi'' ({{my|အသည်}}), whereas non-taxpaying individuals, usually affiliated to the royal court or under government service, were called ''ahmudan'' ({{my|အမှုထမ်း}}).

Outside of hereditary positions, there were two primary paths to influence: joining the military ({{my|မင်းမှုထမ်း}}) and joining the [[Buddhist]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] in the monasteries.

===Sumptuary laws===
[[Sumptuary law]]s called ''yazagaing'' dictated life and consumption for Burmese subjects in the Konbaung kingdom, everything from the style of one's house to clothing suitable to one’s social standing from regulations concerning funerary ceremonies and the coffin to be used to usage of various speech forms based on rank and social status.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=411}}{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=406-407}}{{sfn|Andrus|1947|p=x}} In particular, sumptuary laws in the royal capital were exceedingly strict and the most elaborate in character.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=406}}

For instance, sumptuary laws forbade ordinary Burmese subjects to build houses of stone or brick and dictated the number of tiers on the ornamental spired roof (called ''[[pyatthat]]'') allowed above one’s residence— the royal palace's Great Audience Hall and the 4 main gates of the royal capital, as well as monasteries, were allowed 9 tiers while those of the most powerful tributary princes (''sawbwa'') were permitted 7, at most.{{sfn|Nisbet|1901|p=15}}{{sfn|Cocks|1919|p=161}}

Sumptuary laws ordained 5 types of funerals and rites accorded to each: the king, royal family members, holders of ministerial offices, merchants and those who possessed titles, and peasants (who received no rites at death).{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=411-412}}

Sumptuary regulations regarding dress and ornamentation were carefully observed. Designs with the [[peacock]] insignia were strictly reserved for the royal family and long-tailed hip-length jackets ({{my|ထိုင်မသိမ်းအင်္ကျီ}}) and surcoats were reserved for officials.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=409}} [[Velvet]] sandals ({{my|ကတ္တီပါဖိနပ်}}) were worn exclusively by royals.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=409-10}} [[Gold]] anklets were worn only by the royal children. {{sfn|Scott|1882|p=411}} [[Silk]] cloth, [[brocade]]d with gold and silver flowers and animal figures were only permitted to be worn by members of the royal family and ministers’ wives. {{sfn|Scott|1882|p=411}} Adornment with jewels and precious stones was similarly regulated. Usage of ''hinthapada'' ({{my|ဟင်္သပဒါး}}), a [[vermilion]] dye made from [[cinnabar]] was regulated.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=411}}

===Demography===
[[File:Burmese equestrian sports.jpg|thumb|Konbaung era [[Myinkhin Thabin]]]]

Throughout the Konbaung dynasty, cultural integration continued. For the first time in history, the [[Burmese language]] and culture came to predominate the entire [[Irrawaddy river|Irrawaddy valley]], with the [[Mon language]] and [[Mon people|ethnicity]] completely eclipsed by 1830. The nearer Shan principalities adopted more lowland norms.

[[File:Manipuri horseman.jpg|thumb|An 1855 watercolour of a ''Kathe'' horseman from Manipur]]

Captives from various military campaigns in their hundreds and thousands were brought back to the kingdom and resettled as hereditary servants to royalty and nobility or dedicated to [[pagodas]] and temples; these captives added new knowledge and skills to Burmese society and enriched Burmese culture. They were encouraged to marry into the host community thus enriching the [[gene pool]] as well.{{sfn|Symes|1800}} Captives from [[Manipur]] formed the cavalry called ''Kathè myindat'' (Cassay Horse) and also ''Kathè a hmyauk tat'' (Cassay Artillery) in the royal Burmese army. Even captured French soldiers, led by [[Chevalier Milard]], were forced into the Burmese army.{{sfn|Findlay|O'Rourke|2007|p=277}} The incorporated French troops with their guns and muskets played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They became an elite corps, which was to play a role in the Burmese battles against the [[Thai people|Siamese]] (attacks and capture of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] from 1760 to 1765) and the [[Manchus]] (battles against the Chinese armies of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] from 1766 to 1769).{{sfn|Findlay|O'Rourke|2007|p=277}} [[Islam in Burma|Muslim]] eunuchs from [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] also served in the Konbaung court.{{sfn|Myint-U|2006|p=126}}{{sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}}{{sfn|MHRJ|2007|p=57}}{{sfn|Fleischmann|1981|p=49}}{{sfn|Peletz|2007|p=73}}

A small community of foreign scholars, missionaries and merchants also lived in Konbaung society. Besides [[mercenaries]] and adventurers who had offered their services since the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 16th century, a few Europeans served as ladies-in-waiting to the last queen [[Supayalat]] in [[Mandalay]], a missionary established a school attended by [[Mindon Min|Mindon's]] several sons including the last king [[Thibaw Min|Thibaw]], and an [[Armenians|Armenian]] had served as a king's minister at [[Amarapura]].

Among the most visible non-[[Burmans]] of the royal court were Brahmins. They typically originated from one of four locales:
* [[Manipur]] - acquired with the conquest of Manipur; perhaps from Bengal, since Manipur was Hinduised by Bengali Brahmins in the 1700s{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=178}}
* [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] - acquired with the conquest of Arakan in 1785 by King [[Bodawpaya]]'s son, [[Thado Minsaw]]{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=178}}
* [[Sagaing]] - long-established lines of Brahmins at Burman and Mon royal courts, who traced their origins to 9th century [[Sri Ksetra]] or 14th century Sagaing{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=178}}
* [[Benares]] - Indian Brahmins from Benares who arrived in upper Burma between the late 1700s to early 1800s.{{sfn|Leider|2005|p=182}}

===Literature and arts===
{{Expand section|date=October 2013}}

The evolution and growth of [[Burmese literature]] and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male [[literacy rate]] for the era (half of all males and 5% of females).{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=202–206}} Foreign observers such as [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]] remarked on widespread literacy among commoners, from peasants to [[Waterman (occupation)|watermen]].{{sfn|Symes|1800}}

The Siamese captives carried off from Ayutthaya as part of the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)]] went on to have an outsize influence on traditional Burmese theatre and dance. In 1789, a Burmese royal commission consisting of Princes and Ministers was charged with translating Siamese and Javanese dramas from Thai to Burmese. With the help of Siamese artists captured from Ayutthaya in 1767, the commission adapted two important epics from Thai to Burmese: the Siamese Ramayana and the Enao, the Siamese version of Javanese [[Panji (prince)|Panji]] tales into Burmese ''[[Yama Zatdaw|Yama Zattaw]]'' and ''Enaung Zattaw''.&lt;ref name=jbr-27&gt;Brandon, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; One classical Siamese dance, called ''Yodaya Aka'' (lit. Ayutthaya-style dance) is considered one of the most delicate of all traditional [[Burmese dance]]s.

Monastic and lay elites around the Konbaung kings, particularly from Bodawpaya's reign, also launched a major reformation of Burmese intellectual life and monastic organisation and practice known as the Sudhamma Reformation. It led to, amongst other things, Burma's first proper state histories.&lt;ref name=mwc-2006-96-107&gt;Charney 2006: 96–107&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lanoh''' are a group classified as "[[Orang Asli]]" ("original people") of the [[Semang]] branch by the government of [[Malaysia]]. They live in the [[Malay Peninsula]] and number around 390.&lt;ref name="MOP"/&gt; They are also known as '''Sabub'n''' or '''Lano'''. However, the Lanoh community in [[Gerik]] and [[Lenggong]], [[Perak]] would identify to themselves as '''Menik Semnam''' (meaning "Semnam people" or "''Orang Semnam''" in [[Malay language]]), a name that refers to the Lanoh people that lived at the Semnam River. Whereas the Malay community in Upper [[Perak]] would refer the Lanoh people as '''Sakai Jeram'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamid Mohd Isa|title=The Last Descendants of The Lanoh Hunter and Gatherers in Malaysia|year=2015|publisher=Penerbit USM|isbn=98-386-1948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lanoh were once nomadic; a lifestyle that carried into [[open marriage]] practices where one man would marry a woman and have children, and then move on to another place and marry another woman and have children and continues to do so as they move from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonkilling.org/pdf/nksocieties.pdf |title=Nonkilling Societies |editor=Joám Evans Pim |publisher=Center for Global Nonkilling |page=142 |date=2010 |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanoh women are also known to practice [[polyandry]], a practice that is not much known to other [[Semang]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=anthrotheses |title=Exploration into Human Polyandry: An Evolutionary Examination of the Non-Classical Cases |author=Kathrine E.

Following European contact, the Lanoh were [[hunter-gatherer]]s using caves, many within the state of [[Perak]], as shelters during hunting trips. Approximately 100 years ago, they made charcoal drawings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivor H Evan|title=The Last Descendants of The Lanoh Hunter and Gatherers in Malaysia|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113-6262-15-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the walls of caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamid Mohd Isa|title=The Last Descendants of The Lanoh Hunter and Gatherers in Malaysia|year=2015|publisher=Penerbit USM|isbn=983-8619-48-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The majority of Lanoh live in the jungle as hunter-gatherer, but other Lanoh reside in urban areas where they are engaged in employment, largely on tapping rubber&lt;ref name="FETI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Csilla Dallos|title=From Equality to Inequality: Social Change Among Newly Sedentary Lanoh Hunter-Gatherer Traders of Peninsular Malaysia|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=144-2661-71-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oil palm estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukm.my/geografia/images/upload/11x.geografia-okt14-MainRindam-edam.pdf |title=Analisis SWOT(C) prospek pembangunan ekotourism di petempatan Orang Asli Lanoh, Perak |author=Main Rindam &amp; Fatan Hamamah Yahaya|publisher=GEOGRAFIA Online Malaysian Journal of Society and Space |issn=2180-2491 |date=2014 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[British Malaya]], the Lanoh people were also regularly employed by British administrative officers as jungle rangers and porters, which suits to the lifestyle of the Lanoh people living in the jungle.&lt;ref name="FETI"/&gt; Traditionally, the Lanoh people boil [[Mitragyna speciosa|ketum]] roots and drink it to treat diabetes, and boiling [[Ataulfo (mango)]] roots to reduce high-blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/07/15/orang-asli-the-jungle-is-part-of-us/ |title=Don’t take away our bank, supermarket |author=K Pragalath |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lanoh believe that all living things, both plants and animals have their own spirit to a point where certain of these animals are considered poisonous and inedible, fearing of its negative effect.&lt;ref name="TUOAITLATTOLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2015/05/shsconf_icolass2014_04006.pdf |title=The Usage Of Animals In The Lives Of The Lanoh And Temiar Tribes Of Lenggong, Perak |author=Fatan Hamamah Yahaya |publisher=EDP Sciences |page=4 |date=2015 |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe people should be linked symbiotically with the other animals and plants.

In fact, there is a custom that is in quality of law in his village which is to hunt the animals trying not to cause to them any pain.&lt;ref name="M86"/&gt; The Lanoh and [[Temiar people]] utilize animals for dietary, medicine and for folktales.&lt;ref name="TUOAITLATTOLP"/&gt;

'''Lebanese people of Denmark''' are people from [[Lebanon]] or those of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese descent]] who live in the country of [[Denmark]]. The majority of Lebanese people came to Denmark in the 1970s and 1980s, either escaping the [[Lebanese Civil War]] or for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2014, Lebanon-born immigrants aged 30-64 in Denmark have an employment rate of approximately 31.9%. Lebanon-born individuals aged 16-64 also have a self-employment rate of around 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/contentassets/c00cb3b2ad3e49fc88f9008bdfaa8f3d/tab5e_2016.xlsx|title=Indvandrere i Danmark 2016|publisher=Statistics Denmark|pages=40, 43|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
According to the Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, in the 2012 [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), Lebanese pupils constituted 10% of the student population in Denmark. They obtained PISA scores of 421 in mathematics (''Matematik''), 428 in reading (''Læsning''), 401 in science (''Naturfag''), and 422 in problem-solving (''Problem-løsning''). Of the most frequent countries of origin for students examined by the PISA, these were among the lowest scores in all categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PISA Etnisk 2012|page=23|url=http://edu.au.dk/fileadmin/edu/Forskning/Internationale_undersoegelser/PISA/pisa_etnisk_2012.pdf|publisher=Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2015 PISA, Lebanese pupils represent 9% of Denmark’s student population. Their scores have decreased in each of the examined PISA categories except math, scoring 399 in science (399 when unadjusted for socioeconomic status), 404 in reading (405 unadjusted), and 434 in mathematics (434 unadjusted). These PISA scores are generally in the lower range of the most frequent countries of origin for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PISA Etnisk 2015|pages=20, 38, 49, 60|url=https://www.kora.dk/media/6977513/10599-pisa-etnisk-2015.pdf|publisher=Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 1947, Mirzali Khan, along with his allies including the [[Khudai Khidmatgars]] and members of the Provincial Assembly, declared the [[Bannu Resolution]]. The resolution demanded that the Pashtuns be given a third choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]], composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join only either India or Pakistan. The British refused to comply with the demand of this resolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no other group in British India was granted a third option.

== Early life ==
Mirzali Khan was born in 1901 at Shankai Kirta, a village near Khajuri in the [[Tochi Valley]] of [[North Waziristan]], present day [[Pakistan]] to Sheikh Arsala Khan.&lt;ref name="Alan Warren"&gt;{{cite book|title=Waziristan, the Faqir of Ipi, and the Indian Army: The North West Frontier Revolt of 1936-37|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195790160|page=84|author=Alan Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to the Torikhel branch of the [[Utmanzai (Wazir clan)|Utmanzai Wazir]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Rob Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Afghan Way of War: How and Why They Fight|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-979856-8|page=195|author=Rob Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was twelve. Mirzali Khan studied till fourth grade at a government school and later pursued religious studies at [[Bannu]]. He built a mosque and a house at Spalga, further south in North Waziristan agency in 1922. He went to perform [[Hajj]] at [[Mecca]] and later moved to Ipi in mid 1920s. He became a religious figure among the locals and was called "Haji Sahab". The British intelligence records regarded him an influential figure of the tribal agency who had a following of armed men. In 1933, Mirzali Khan went to [[Afghanistan]] to fight against the Afghan King at [[Khost]] that furthered him as a resistance leader.&lt;ref name="Alan Warren"/&gt;

== Battles ==
=== Battle against the Bannu Brigade in Khaisora ===
In 1936, a British Indian court ruled against the marriage of a Hindu-converted Muslim girl at [[Bannu]], after the girl's family filed case of abduction and forced conversion. The ruling was based on the fact that the girl was a minor and was asked to make her decision of conversion and marriage after she reaches the age of majority, till then she was asked to live with a third party.&lt;ref name="Yousef Aboul-Enein"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret War for the Middle East|year=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1612513096|page=153|author=Yousef Aboul-Enein|author2=Basil Aboul-Enein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict 'enraged' the Muslims - especially the [[Dawar (Pashtun tribe)|Dawar]] tribesmen, Mirzali Khan's kinsmen, the Dawar Maliks and mullahs left the Tochi far the Khaisora Valley to the south to rouse the Torikhel Waziris. The enraged tribesmen mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong and battled the [[Bannu Brigade]], with heavy casualties on both sides. Widespread lawlessness erupted as tribesmen blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. The British retaliated by sending two columns converging in the Khaisora river valley. They suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of the ringleaders, including that of Mirzali Khan. However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of Mirzali Khan's miraculous powers. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Tori Khel Wazirs, the Mahsuds and the Bhittannis. He cemented his position as religious leader by declaring a Jihad against the British. This move also helped rally support from Pashtun tribesman across the border.

=== Quagmire ===
Soon after the Khaisora campaign a general uprising broke out throughout [[Waziristan campaign (1936–1939)|Waziristan campaign]], realising the futility of confronting the British Army directly especially with their advantage of air power, tribesmen switched to guerrilla warfare. Squadrons of the two air forces ([[RAF]] and RIAF) tried many tactics including scorched earth retaliation involving the burning of standing crops with jerry can petrol bombs and the killing of cattle with strafing attacks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Both of Mirzali Khan's sons, Gulzar Ali and Mir Zaman, were killed fighting British forces.&lt;ref name="115th anniversary"/&gt;

== Death ==
Mirzali Khan died at night on April 16, 1960. A long term sufferer of asthma during his last days, he became so sick that it was not possible for him to walk for a few steps. People from far away often used to come and see him and ask for his blessing.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} His funeral prayers or Namaz-I-Janaza was held at [[Gurwek]] led by Maulavi Pir Rehman. Thousands of people came for his Namaz-I-Janaza.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} He was buried at Gurwek.

From its foundation on 6 December 1922 until 11 December 1936, the [[Irish Free State]] was in accordance with its [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|constitution]], governed formally under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]. The monarch exercised a number of important duties, including appointing the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|cabinet]], dissolving the legislature and promulgating laws. Nonetheless, by convention the monarch's role was largely ceremonial and exercised on his behalf by his official representative, the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general]]. The monarch's role and duties under the constitution were ended under a [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|constitutional amendment adopted in 1936]]. From that point, the monarch no longer played any role in appointing the cabinet, dissolving the legislature or promulgating laws. Nor was the monarch mentioned anywhere in the constitution. Under [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|separate legislation also adopted in 1936]] it was provided that Irish diplomatic representatives would be appointed on the authority of the cabinet alone and international agreements would be concluded with the authority of the cabinet alone. At the same time, that legislation also created a new role for the king in his capacity as the "symbol of [the] co-operation" of Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, and South Africa for so long as the Irish Free State was associated with those states. The new role of the king in that capacity alone was to act on behalf of the Irish government with respect to the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements when advised by the cabinet so to do. The role of the king in acting on behalf of the Irish government with respect to appointing diplomats was not ended until 1949&lt;ref&gt;In the words of {{cite journal|author=[[Mary E. Daly]]|date=January 2007|title=The Irish Free State/Éire/Republic of Ireland/Ireland: "A Country by Any Other Name"?|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=46|issue=1|pages=72–90|doi=10.1086/508399|jstor=10.1086/508399}}: "After the enactment of the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|1936 External Relations Act]] and the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]], Ireland's only remaining link with the crown had been the accreditation of diplomats. The president of Ireland was the head of state. When opposition deputies asked [[Éamon de Valera|de Valera]] whether Ireland was a republic—a favorite pastime in the mid-1940s—he tended to resort to dictionary definitions showing that Ireland had all the attributes of a republic."&lt;/ref&gt; and under United Kingdom law the king is regarded as having been the sovereign until that time but not under Irish law.

==Monarchical title==
[[File:Coat of arms of the United Kingdom (1837-1952).svg|right|200px|thumb|[[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]] used by George V, Edward VIII and George VI.]]
The monarch's title in the Irish Free State was exactly the same as it was elsewhere in the [[British Empire]], being
* 6 December 1922 – 13 May 1927 – ''By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''
* 13 May 1927 – 29 December 1937 – ''By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''

The reason the monarch's title changed in 1927 was because the term "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]" had been superseded by the establishment of the Irish Free State and the renaming of the UK as the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland". Rather than draw attention to the [[partition of Ireland]], the monarch's title simply referred to [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. This change did not mean the monarch adopted different crowns for different realms; that development did not formally occur until 1953.

==Duties and functions==

* '''Executive authority:''' The [[executive (government)|executive authority]] of the state was formally ''vested'' in the monarch but 'exercised' by the governor-general, on the 'advice' of the Executive Council.
* '''Appointment of the cabinet:''' The [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister) was appointed by governor-general after being selected by [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house of parliament). The remaining ministers were appointed on the nomination of the president, subject to a vote of consent in the Dáil.
* '''Convention and dissolution of the legislature''': The governor-general, on behalf of the monarch, convened and dissolved the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]] on the advice of the Executive Council.
* '''Signing bills into law:''' The monarch was formally, along with the Dáil and the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], one of three tiers of the Oireachtas. No bill could become law until it received the [[Royal Assent]], given by the governor-general on behalf of the monarch. The governor-general theoretically had the right to veto a bill or reserve it "for the signification of the King's pleasure", in effect postponing a decision on whether or not to enact the bill, for a maximum of one year. However neither of these two actions was ever taken.
* '''Representative of the state in foreign affairs:''' The monarch accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats; ministers signed international treaties in his name. The role of the monarch in the Free State's foreign affairs was the only function retained by him after the constitutional changes of 1936.
* '''Appointment of judges''': All judges were appointed by the governor-general, on the advice of the Executive Council.

==Oath of Allegiance==
{{main|Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)}}
Under the Free State constitution, members of the Oireachtas were required to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State with a promise of fidelity—but not allegiance—to the monarch before being permitted to assume their seats. This oath was strongly objected to by many [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] and was one of the causes of the [[Irish Civil War]]. The oath was eventually abolished in 1933. The Oath of Allegiance read as follows:

:''I ................ do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State as by law established, and that I will be faithful to H. M. King George V., his heirs and successors by law in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.''

==Diminished role==
[[Image:Leinster House - 1911.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leinster House]], decorated for the visit of King [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1911; within a decade, it became the seat of the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State]]]]
[[Fianna Fáil]] came to power after the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 election]] and reduced the role of the monarchy.  The [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|oath of fidelity to the king]] required of legislators and ministers was abolished. A compliant governor-general was appointed,  [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], who withdrew from all public and ceremonial roles, performing in a perfunctory manner the minimum duties required by the Constitution. No treaties requiring the assent of the king as head of state were signed from 1931 to 1937; two methods were used to circumvent this: bilateral treaties were concluded at government rather than head-of-state level; for multilateral treaties, the Free State chose, not to enrol at inauguration via the king's signature, but instead to accede a few months later via the signature of the [[Minister for External Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for External Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Stewart1938"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Robert B.|year=1938|title=Treaty-Making Procedure in the British Dominions|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=32|issue=3|pages=467–487: 480–485|issn=00029300|doi=10.2307/2191164 |jstor=138434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the  government of [[Éamon de Valera]] carried out a major revision of the constitution aimed at all but eliminating the role of the monarch in the Irish state. The parliament passed the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936]], which removed all explicit reference to the monarch from the constitution, abolished the office of governor-general, and shared all of the monarch's former functions amongst various other organs of government.

However, without mentioning him by name, the amendment also introduced a provision permitting the government to "avail of" the monarch as a "constitutional organ" for the "appointment of diplomatic and consular agents and the conclusion of international agreements". Thus, henceforth, the sovereign's role was restricted to diplomatic and foreign affairs, a standard head of state role. The monarch retained no other constitutional role internally in the life of the Irish state and was relegated in the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] to being an unnamed "organ" used by the state should it choose in [[statute law]] to do so. The role continued until the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], by which it was transferred to the [[President of Ireland]]. At that time, the new republic also ceased to be a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].

[[Major-General]]  '''Naseerullah Khan Babar''' ([[Urdu Language|Urdu]]: نصيرالله خان بابر; born 1928—10 January 2011) was [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Minister of Internal Security]] of [[Pakistan]].
He is also famous because of Operation against MQM in Karachi in 1994-95. He was a retired [[Two-star rank|2-star]] general officer in the [[Pakistan Army]], and later career military officer-turned statesman from, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]. In 1975, Babar took early voluntary retirement from the [[Pakistan Army]] to become Governor of NWFP (now Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa). He joined the Pakistan Peoples Party after Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government was dismissed in 1977. A leading member of the [[Pakistan People's Party]], Babar was born in [[Pirpiai]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[British Indian Empire]]. His family is from the [[Babar (tribe)|Babar]] tribe of [[Pakhtuns]] and hails from the village of Pirpiai in district [[Nowshera District|Nowshera]].

Having started his military career in 1948, Babar rose to become a Major General and led the [[Frontier Corps]] as its Commandant in 1974. During 1974, Babar was tasked to fund and train Afghan mujahidin, by the order of Bhutto, to suppress the government of [[Mohammad Daoud Khan|Davood Khan]], and disbandment of [[Pashtunistan]] policies led by the government of Davood Khan. This operation was a complete and ultimate success after which Babar proceeded to retire from the army, in order to start his career in politics. However, the operation took a new direction when he became Governor of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] from 1975 to 1977 under [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]'s government until the term was cut short due to ''[[Operation Fair Play]]''— a clandestine operation undertaken to remove Bhutto. In 1988, Babar was the "Special Advisor/Assistant on Internal Affairs" in Benazir Bhutto's first government and between 1993 and 1996, Babar was appointed and tenured as the [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Interior Minister]] during [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s second government where he supervised and successfully contended ''[[Operation Blue Fox]]''.

== Early education ==
Babar's early education was from [[Presentation Convent School, Peshawar]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]], [[British India]], between 1935 and 1939. From 1939 to 1941 he attended [[Burn Hall School]] then located at [[Srinagar]]. The school was subsequently shifted to [[Abbottabad]] after the [[Partition of India]] in 1947.  He then attended Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College from 1941-1947 in Dheradun and joined the Pakistan Army in 1948. He was part of the first PMA long course which graduated in 1950.

== Army career and Indo-Pakistani Wars ==
In his long career in the Army, Babar served in the [[Artillery]] Corps and pioneered the Army Aviation Corps. During the 1965 war with India, Babar single-handedly captured an entire Indian company of soldiers (over 70 POWs) and was awarded [[Sitara-e-Jurat]] for this action.

In the 1971 war, he commanded an artillery brigade supporting 23 Division and later commanded an infantry brigade until he was wounded and evacuated from the battlefield. He also had the distinction of having been awarded SJ &amp; Bar.  In 1972, he was appointed Inspector General [[Frontier Corps]]. He resigned from the Army in 1974 while commanding an infantry division and was appointed as Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

== Joining the PPP ==
Babar joined the Pakistan People's Party (the PPP) in 1977 after the arrest of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. He famously threw away his Hilal i Jurat (with bar) and other army medals at the presiding officer of a military tribunal, when Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the military regime of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1979.

== Interior Minister 1993–1996 ==

In 1988, Babar was a Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto and successfully ran the election for Begum [[Nusrat Bhutto]] from Chitral during the preceding elections.

Elected in the 1993 general election on a People's Party Ticket from Nowshera, he defeated [[Awami National Party]] President [[Ajmal Khattak]], with the PPP's victory in the election and was appointed Federal Minister for the Interior by Benazir Bhutto.

General Naseerullah Babar was one of the major proponents of backing what eventually became the [[Taliban]].

General Babar was also involved in a crackdown on [[MQM]]. He was believe to be involved in extra judicial killing of MQM militant wing in the 90's.

== 1997 and onwards ==

After the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's second government by Farooq Leghari, Babar contested the 1997 elections again from Nowshera as well as from Karachi. He was defeated in Nowshera by ANP candidate Wali Muhammad Khan and from Karachi by [[Nawaz Sharif]]'s nominee Ejaz Shafi.

Contesting again in the 2002&amp;nbsp;general elections he was defeated in the electoral sweep of the religio-political alliance the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, mainly due to Musharaff's goals of bringing Islamists in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to power.

In October 2007, he left the Pakistan Peoples Party due to his disagreement with Benazir Bhutto over her support for [[General Pervez Musharraf]]. This action was considered as a major blow for the Pakistan Peoples Party because he was their major political leader in the Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa.

== Death ==

On 19 August 2008, Naseerullah Babar suffered a mild stroke and was admitted to a hospital. He recovered and returned home in November 2008. Naseerullah Babar died on 10 January 2011.&lt;ref name=dawn /&gt;

The '''Nyangatom''' also known as '''Donyiro''' and pejoratively as '''Bumé''' are [[Nilotic]] agro-pastoralists inhabiting the border of southwestern [[Ethiopia]] and southeastern [[South Sudan]] and in the [[Ilemi Triangle]] with populations residing in both countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Tornay |first=Serge |author-link= |editor-last=Bender |editor-first=M.

==Overview==
The Nyangatom are members of the [[Ateker peoples|Ateker]] or Karamojong cluster that also contains the [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Toposa people|Toposa]], [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]], and [[Jie (Uganga)|Jie]] who speak closely related languages. They number approximately 30,000 &lt;ref name=2007-census&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=July 2010 |title= Population and Housing Census Report-Country - 2007 |url=http://www.csa.gov.et/newcsaweb/images/documents/surveys/Population%20and%20Housing%20census/ETH-pop-2007/survey0/data/Doc/Reports/National_Statistical.pdf |publisher=[[Central Statistical Agency]] |page=73 |docket= |access-date=2016-08-28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with populations in both South Sudan and Ethiopia. Many Nyangatom are nomadic, residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year. A substantial number of Nyangatom also reside in semi-permanent villages. It is common for individuals to move between mobile cattle camps and semi-permanent villages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Nyangatom have intermittent conflict with many of their neighbors, especially the [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Daasanach people|Dassanetch]], and [[Surma people|Suri]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ziviler-friedensdienst.org/sites/ziviler-friedensdienst.org/files/anhang/publikation/zfd-investigating-potential-peace-committees-ethiopia-4323.pdf|title=Investigating the Potential of Peace Committees in Ethiopia: A Needs Assessment in IGAD CEWARN's Karamoja and Somali Clusters|last=Glowacki|first=Luke|last2=Gönc|first2=Katja|date=|publisher=IAG InterAfrica Group|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=English|oclc=870747365|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government provides some military support to the Turkana in these conflicts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite the risk of intergroup conflict, many Nyangatom have bond friends with members of other groups and there are trade relationships between the Nyangatom and many of their neighbors.

Along with other groups in the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Lower Omo Valley]], the Nyangatom face challenges to their future subsistence and cultural traditions due to large-scale agricultural projects occurring in their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/06/18/what-will-happen-if-hunger-comes/abuses-against-indigenous-peoples-ethiopias-lower|title="What will happen if hunger comes?": abuses against the indigenous peoples of Ethiopia's Lower Omo Valley|last=Horne|first=Felix|last2=Bader|first2=Laetitia|last3=Human Rights Watch|date=2012-06-01|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=9781564329028|location=New York |pages=|language=English|oclc=803626105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/omovalley/gibedam|title=Omo Valley Tribes: Gibe III dam|last=International|first=Survival|website=www.survivalinternational.org|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pakistanis in Malaysia''' form the largest [[Pakistani diaspora]] community in southeast Asia and the tenth-largest in Asia as a whole.&lt;ref name="OPF"&gt;{{citation|title=Year Book, 2004–2005|publisher=Ministry of Labour, Manpower, and Overseas Pakistanis|publication-place=Islamabad|year=2005|url=|accessdate=http://www.opf.org.pk/opd/yearbk/YEARBK.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]] share strong Muslim identity. At the time of Malaysia's independence under the [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957]], there were more than two hundred thousand Pakistanis residing in Malaysia, rather than forming a separate group under the categorized system, at the suggestion of Malays themselves, Pakistanis immersed themselves into the Malay group, thus they became part of the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputra]] elite, enriched by social ties, intermarriage, and shared economic and political aspirations. They also took positions in the civil service administration and gradually rose to the upper echelons of government, by then inextricably intermixed with the Malay majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/total-assimilation-outcomes-migration-studies-253532 Total Assimilation Outcomes in Migration Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Many elite Malay families have at least one grandparent that was Pakistani. Diplomats, Judges, Legislators, and other government cadres include people with recognized Pakistani-Malay bloodlines.

The actual number of Pakistani people in Malaysia is generally understated, as the figure provided by the Pakistani Ministry of Labour merely assert that those who hold [[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani citizenship]]. An absolute number of Pakistanis people and their descendants are likely to exceed 100,000. This is heavily contributed to fact that the early settlers came from [[British Raj]] (which includes present-day Pakistan) during the colonial days have obtained [[Malaysian nationality law|Malaysian citizenship]]. Throughout the years, most of Pakistani-Malaysians and their descendants are partially or fully assimilated with the [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] majority due to their common Islamic background, high level of [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] and to receive state aid of [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|Malaysian affirmative action policy]] under [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]], thus registered themselves as [[Malay people|Malays]]. Nonetheless, they identified their ethnic roots as Pakistani. A vast majority of Pakistanis can be considered as having Central Asian racial ancestry, given their close roots to the Indo-Iranian people groups of the region. The primary languages spoken by Pakistanis in Malaysia are [[Urdu language|Urdu]], an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]] with considerable mixture of [[Turkic languages|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words as well as [[Malay language|Malay]].

==Employment==
Figures from Pakistan's [[Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development]] show 10,000 Pakistanis working in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="OPF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Airblue"&gt;{{citation|last=P.|first=Vijian|date=11 September 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008|title=Pakistan's Airblue To Launch KL Flight in 2009|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=358439|periodical=Bernama|publication-place=Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few sources have claimed many as 15,000 to 30,000 at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pakistan Still Safe Place For Investing|date=23 March 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008|periodical=Bernama|publication-place=Malaysia|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_world.php?id=322163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pakistan, Malaysia sign agreements in Banking, Communication Sectors|last=Kamal|first=Sarah|date=5 November 2006|accessdate=19 November 2008|periodical=Pakistan Times|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2006/11/05/top2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a 2005 agreement between Pakistan and Malaysia, as many as 100,000 Pakistanis may eventually work in Malaysia, especially in the manufacturing, construction, and plantation sectors; the Pakistani workers are intended to replace nearly 400,000 [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka who departed the country under an amnesty which ended in March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2005/03/20/national3.htm|periodical=Pakistan Times|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=19 November 2008|title=Malaysia to employ 100,000 Pakistanis to overcome labour shortage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. General [[Tahir Mahmud Qazi]], Pakistan's High Commissioner to Malaysia, expected that the number of Pakistanis in Malaysia would reach that figure of 100,000 by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=100,000 Pakistani labourers expected to work in Malaysia by end 2010|url=http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/119589|periodical=NewsTrack India/[[Asian News International]]|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Pakistani workers recruited by the unscrupulous employment agencies often live in bad conditions in Malaysia; after an inspection tour, Pakistani senators [[Fauzia Fakhru Zaman]] and [[Rukhsana Zuberi]] said they had seen many workers who were weak due to lack of proper food and requested to be taken home, while others were receiving only [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]]400 in monthly salary after having been promised nearly four times that much by recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pakistanis in Malaysia in miserable condition|periodical=Daily Times|publication-place=Pakistan|date=16 May 2006|accessdate=19 November 2008|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\05\16\story_16-5-2006_pg7_17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senators also blasted the Pakistani High Commission in Malaysia for taking no action on behalf of Pakistani workers there and for overcharging them for land purchases in Pakistan under the OPF Housing Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Senate body for taking action against HC officials in Malaysia|periodical=Pak Tribune|publication-place=Pakistan|date=9 March 2006|accessdate=19 November 2008|url=http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?136676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel==
In addition to the 10,000 Pakistanis working in Malaysia, the country receives as many as 50,000 visitors from Pakistan each year; Pakistan's [[Airblue]] plans to launch direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 2009 and ordered fourteen [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] planes to service the route.&lt;ref name="Airblue"/&gt;

==Notable people==
Almost all figures in the list of the notable people Pakistani descent in Malaysia are of mixed descent, particularly with the [[Malay people|ethnic Malays]]. Mixed-marriage is a pattern which is shared with most of Pakistani descent in Malaysia (excluding to the recently arrived migrants), after settling in the Malaysian soil after generations, assimilation process and the common Islamic background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12608">'''Proximity marketing''' is the localized [[wireless]] distribution of advertising content associated with a particular place.  Transmissions can be received by individuals in that location who wish to receive them and have the necessary equipment to do so.

Distribution may be via a traditional localized [[Broadcasting|broadcast]], or more commonly is specifically targeted to devices known to be in a particular area.

The location of a device may be determined by:
*A [[cellular phone]] being in a particular cell 
*A [[Bluetooth]] or [[WiFi]] device being within range of a transmitter. 
*An [[Internet]] enabled device with [[GPS]] enabling it to request localized content from [[Internet]] servers.
*A [[Near field communication|NFC]] enabled phone can read a [[RFID]] chip on a product or media and launch localized content from [[internet]] servers.

Communications may be further targeted to specific groups within a given location, for example content in tourist hot spots may only be distributed to devices registered outside the local area.

Communications may be both time and place specific, e.g. content at a conference venue may depend on the event in progress.

Uses of proximity marketing include distribution of media at concerts, information (weblinks on local facilities), gaming and social applications, and advertising.

==Bluetooth-based systems==
[[Bluetooth]], a short-range [[wireless]] system supported by many mobile devices, is one transmission medium used for proximity marketing. 
The process of Bluetooth based proximity marketing involves setting up Bluetooth "broadcasting" equipment at a particular location and then sending information which can be text, images, audio or video to Bluetooth enabled devices within range of the broadcast server. These devices are often referred to as beacons. Other standard data exchange formats such as [[vCard]] can also be used. This form of proximity marketing is also referred to as [[Close Range Marketing|close range marketing]].

It used to be the case that due to security fears, or a desire to save battery life, many users keep their Bluetooth devices in OFF mode, or ON but not set to be 'discoverable'.  Because of this, often regions where Bluetooth proximity marketing is in operation it is accompanied by advising via traditional media - such as posters, television screens or field marketing teams - suggesting people make their Bluetooth handsets 'discoverable' in order to receive free content - this is often referred to as a "Call-to-Action." A 'discoverable' Bluetooth device within range of the server is automatically sent a message asking if the user would like to receive the free content.

Current mobile phones usually have bluetooth switched ON by default,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/03/12/apple-keeps-turning-bluetooth-on-when-you-update-your-iphone/ Apple Keeps Turning Bluetooth On When You Update Your iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt; and some users leave bluetooth switched on for easy connection with car kits and headsets.

In the past some implementations of Bluetooth proximity marketing require users to run Java applications on their phones to enable them to receive content. This has the advantage that only those who choose to will receive content. Others require no handset-side software.

The diversity of mobile phones is huge. Screen sizes and supported file formats varies greatly. To obtain the optimal user experience with Bluetooth Marketing, the Bluetooth system must be able to automatically recognize phone models and deliver the proper content automatically. Some businesses choose to utilize multiple proximity marketing platforms to cater to different popular models of smart phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxibluetoothmarketing.com/index.php/2018/01/22/what-is-proximity-marketing/|title=What is proximity marketing? - Proxi Bluetooth Marketing|date=2018-01-22|work=Proxi Bluetooth Marketing|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Android devices, a notification can be sent without having an app installed using the Eddystone-URL. The Google Nearby is an in-built service that scans for beacon signals and displays the message tied to that signal. Apps that are compatible with Physical Web can also do the same. Chrome has since withdrawn support for the Physical Web. In regions where Google is banned, Samsung's browser Closeby does the same as Nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/beacons/|title=Beacons  {{!}}  Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On iOS devices, the relevant app needs to be installed that can then receive messages from nearby beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/BEACONS-What-They-Are-How-They-Work-And-Why-Theyre-Important/articleshow/27808938.cms|title=BEACONS: What They Are, How They Work, And Why They're Important|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wifi-based systems ==
There are systems capable of detecting certain signals periodically emitted by any electronic devices equipped with [[WiFi]] or [[Bluetooth]] technology, and the subsequent use of gathered information to detect the position or presence of, and/or flows of information to and from, said devices, in a statistical or aggregate form.

This technology is used in a manner equivalent to other systems, such as Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), which serve for locating devices within a controlled environment; it works in conjunction with signals from WiFi issuers (also called wireless tags) and receiving antennas, in different locations, so that the movements and presence of WiFi-equipped devices can be analyzed in terms of arrival time, length of visit per zone, paths of movement, general flows, etc.

The continuously increasing use of smartphones and tablets has fueled a boom in WiFi tracking technology, specially in the retail environment. Such technology can be used by managers of a physical business to ascertain how many devices are present in a given area, and to observe or optimize business marketing and management.

Technically, such technology is based on two main models:

1.    Re-use of standard [[Wireless access point|Access Point (AP)]] technologies with a  [[Captive portal|Captive Portal]], already deployed in numerous locations (airports, malls, shops, etc.). An example of this model is the Cisco [http://www.cisco.com &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] technology.

2.    Use of antennas for the detection of signals in the 2.4 or 5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency bands, positioning the detected devices within strategic areas, in order to obtain a unique identifier about every mobile device is detected in such locations, and with the corresponding  HTML5, iOS and Android SDKs integrated in any APP or Web, allowing interaction by proximity with the users through the mobile devices. An example of this model is the Seeketing [http://www.seeketing.com &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] technology.

The first option manifests weaker ability to detect and send messages to the public, because AP devices were created for purposes other than wireless tracking and operate by extracting information only from select devices (smartphones or tablets which have previously connected to the AP in question). In practice, and depending on the environment, as many as 10-20% of visitors access to the captive portal when they visit a point of sale

The second option is to analyze all signals detected within the bands used by the WiFi and Bluetooth technology, offering a higher detection ratio of total visitors (about 60%-70%) and extracting behavior patterns that allow the assignment of a unique identifier, each time a device is detected. Such identifiers are not linked to any data present on the device, nor to any information from the device manufacturer, so that relation to any particular user of the device cannot be made. Unlike in the above case, visitor security (in the sense of anonymity) is total.

Thanks to Seeketing SDKs for iOS, Android, and HTML5 APIs for Web pages, this model of technology allows retailers, or managers of any physical location, to send push notification to the smartphones with an APP installed, or to send SMS/WhatsAPP/Email messages to those users who previously was registered in a captive portal, even if they not are using the APs or Wifi connection to access internet.

Assignment of the same unique identifier to tracking information obtained by the antennas, APP and Webs APIs remains a challenge, and allows to have both online and offline beviour information to optimize proximity communication campaigns in a non-intrusive way.

==NFC-based systems==
[[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) [[NFC Tag|tag]]s are embedded in the NFC Smart Poster, Smart Product or Smart Book. The tag has a RFID chip with an embedded command. The command can be to open the mobile browser on a given page or offer. Any NFC-enabled phone can activate this tag by placing the device in close proximity. The information can be anything from product details, special accommodation deals, and information on local restaurants.

The German drugstore chain, Budnikowsky, launched the first NFC-enabled Smart Poster in October 2011 which allowed train commuters to tap their phones on the poster to shop and find more information. in November 2011, Atria Books/[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] launched the [[Impulse Economy]], the first NFC-enabled Smart Book.

In the UK NFC is being adopted by most of the outdoor poster contractors. Clear Channel have installed over 25,000 Adshel posters with NFC tags (and QR codes for Apple phones).

Retailers are also looking at NFC as it offers a cost effective method by which consumers can engage with brands but doesn't require integrating the technology into their IT systems - which is a barrier to many new technologies like BLE. A number of retailers have already started using NFC to enhance the shopping experience, Casino in France and Vic in Holland.

Proximity Marketing Strategy using NFC Technology has been widely adopted in Japan and uses 'pull' rather than 'push' marketing allowing the consumer the choice of where and when they receive marketing messages.

There are a number NFC-enabled phones entering the market spurred by NFC mobile wallet trials globally. NFC wallets include the [[Google Wallet]] and [[ISIS (mobile payment system)]]. While [[mobile payment]] is the driver for NFC, proximity marketing is an immediate beneficiary in-market.

Apple did not include this technology in their initial smartphone models. Apple added NFC to the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6 Plus]].

==GSM-based systems==
Proximity Marketing via SMS relies on GSM 03.41 which defines the Short Message Service - Cell Broadcast. SMS-CB allows messages (such as advertising or public information) to be broadcast to all mobile users in a specified geographical area. In the Philippines, GSM-based proximity broadcast systems are used by select Government Agencies for information dissemination on Government-run community-based programs to take advantage of its reach and popularity ([[Philippines]] has the world's highest traffic of SMS). It is also used for commercial service known as Proxima SMS. Bluewater, a super-regional shopping centre in the UK, has a GSM based system supplied by NTL to help its GSM coverage for calls, it also allows each customer with a mobile phone to be tracked though the centre which shops they go into and for how long. The system enables special offer texts to be sent to the phone.

'''The Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889''' (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c.69) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Ireland (as it was then). It is one of the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 1916.

The Act makes the active or passive bribery of a member, officer or servant of a public body a criminal offence. 

Specifically, the Act prohibits a person covered by the Act, whether by himself, or in conjunction with any other person, from corruptly soliciting or receiving, or agreeing to receive, for himself, or any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage whatever as an inducement to, or reward for, doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed, in which the public body is concerned. A person may also not corruptly promise, or offer, any gift, loan, fee, reward, or advantage whatsoever, to any person, whether for the benefit of that person, or of another person, as an inducement to or reward for doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed; in which the public body is concerned. 

In March 2006, the [[Metropolitan Police]] confirmed that, following complaints by the [[Scottish National Party]] and others, they were investigating possible breaches of the Act.  A total of £14 million in loans was given by wealthy individuals to Labour during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election campaign]] and four of these men were subsequently nominated for [[Life Peerage]]s. ''(see main article [[Cash for Peerages]])'' 

Offences under the Act require the consent of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] to proceed with a prosecution. In relation to offences created by the Act, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show (on the balance of probabilities) that the money, gift, or other consideration was not received corruptly.

The Act was entirely repealed by the coming into force of the [[Bribery Act 2010]].

A '''public auction''' is an [[auction]] held on behalf of a [[government]] in which the property to be auctioned is either property owned by the government, or property which is sold under the authority of a [[court of law]] or a government agency with similar authority.

When the term "[[government auctions|Government Auction]]" is used it generally means that specific auctioneers and agents are contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies.

==Sale of property owned by the government==

Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, [[abandoned property]] over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by [[escheat]], [[government land]], and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as [[Broadcasting|broadcast frequencies]] sold through a [[spectrum auction]].

Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the [[United States Navy]] [[cruiser]] [[USS Philadelphia (C-4)|''Philadelphia'']] was sold at such an auction at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in 1927.

==Sale of private property in a public auction==
Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a [[mortgage foreclosure]], [[tax lien]], or [[tax sale]]. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed - that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the [[United States]], public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the [[sheriff]] of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a '''Sheriff's sale'''.

[[Real property]] may be subject to a public auction in order to [[Partition (law)|partition]] the property between [[Concurrent estate|joint tenants]] who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An [[estate sale]] conducted at the direction of a [[probate court]] may also be conducted as a public auction.

There is a significant '''Russian population in Germany''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Deutsch-Russen'' or ''Russischsprachige in Deutschland''). The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 triggered mass immigration to the West, with [[Germany]] being the top destination, mostly for economic and ethnic reasons. Russians are the [[Demographics of Germany#Migrant background and foreign nationality|9th]] largest migrant group in Germany.

==Soviet and post-Soviet emigration from Russia==

# Russians [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|descended from German migrants to the East]] (known as ''Aussiedler'', ''Spätaussiedler'' and ''Russlanddeutsche'' ([[Russian Germans]], [[Germans from Russia]]))
# [[Russian Jews]]

Immigration to Germany surged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. According to the [[Global Commission on International Migration]] research, "In the 1990s ethnic Germans and Jews comprised the largest components of emigration, and the most attractive destinations were Germany, Israel and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Valery Tishkov, Zhanna Zayinchkovskaya, and Galina Vitkovskaya, "Migration in the countries of the former Soviet Union", Global Commission on International Migration, September 2005, 15. http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/rs/RS3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2000 Germany purportedly received 550,000 emigrants from Russia, 60% of the total amount emigrating to the three main destinations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic background==

===Aussiedler from Russia===
{{See also|Volga Germans}}

Earlier in history, particularly during the 17th century, a number of Germans migrated to [[Russia]]. Article 116 of [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law]], approved in 1949, provides individuals of German heritage with the [[right of return]] to Germany and the means to acquire German citizenship if they suffered persecution after the Second World War as a result of their German heritage.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Philip L.|title=Germany: Reluctant Land of Immigration|journal=German Issues|date=1998|issue=21|pages=24|url=http://www.aicgs.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/martin.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, roughly 3.6 million ethnic Germans moved to West Germany between 1950 and 1996.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; These German descendants increasingly petitioned to return to Germany under the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  According to historian [[John Glad]], by 1957 the petitioners, commonly known as [[Aussiedler#Germany|"''Aussiedler''"]] (singular and plural) or transferred settlers, filed over 100,000 applications a year to migrate to [[West Germany]]; several thousand returned in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Glad"&gt;John Glad, ''Russia Abroad: Writers, History, Politics'' (Tenafly, NJ: Hermitage Publishers, 1999), 415-416.&lt;/ref&gt; The flow of ''Aussiedler'' increased with the breakup of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Glad" /&gt; For instance, between 1992 and 2007, a total of 1,797,084 ethnic Germans from the former USSR emigrated to Germany. Of this total number 923,902 were from Kazakhstan, 693,348 were from Russia, 73,460 were from Kyrgyzstan, 40,560 from Ukraine, 27,035 from Uzbekistan, and 14,578 from Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Wolff, "German and German minorities in Europe," in ''Divided Nations and European Integration'', edited by Tristan James Mabry (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013). Also available at http://www.stefanwolff.com/research/germany-and-german-minorities-in-europe&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers peaked in 1994–213,214 ''Aussiedler''—and then gradually began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Anlage 4 zum Integrationsbericht LK-GF 2008-06-09 Aussiedlerstatistik seit 1950 - Bundesverwaltungsamt [German], accessed 25 June 2014, http://www.gifhorn.de/pics/medien/1_1222325613/Anlage_4_Aussiedlerstatistik_seit_1950.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of non-German relatives who emigrated along with them is not known, but many if not most are presumably members of Germany's ethnic Russian community (see below). The number of emigrated ''Aussiedler'' fluctuates as many retained housing in the Former Soviet Union—some are presumed to have returned to their residences in Former Soviet Republics.&lt;ref name="Glad" /&gt;

===Soviet Jews===
After the Second World War Germany's Jewish population was 15,000, a small percentage of the country's pre-war Jewish population of 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmila Isurin, ''Russian Diaspora: Culture, Identity, and Language Change'' (Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2011), 17. https://books.google.com/books?id=gcl9Zv-SuwYC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=third%20wave%20russian%20emigration&amp;pg=PA17#v=snippet&amp;q=Germany&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; That number grew to 30,000 by the late 1980s. Then between 1991 and 2005, more than 200,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union moved to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Latkes and vodka: Immigrants from the former Soviet Union are transforming Jewish life in Germany|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10424406|accessdate=24 June 2014|agency=The Economist|date=Jan 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the Berman Jewish DataBank estimates that over 225,000 Jews from the Former Soviet Union (Russia and various republics) immigrated to Germany between 1989 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Berman"&gt;Sergio DellaPergola. “World Jewish Population, 2013,” in Arnold Dashefsky and Ira M. Sheskin. (Editors) The American Jewish Year Book, 2013, Volume 113(2013) (Dordrecht: Springer) pp. 279-358. Available at http://jewishdatabank.org/Studies/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=3113&lt;/ref&gt; Many, speaking [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as well as Russian, picked up the German language easily. The Berman Jewish DataBank estimates "Germany's ''core'' Jewish population at 118,000 in 2013," of which all but about 5,000-6,000 are post-Soviet immigrants; the community numbers about 250,000 if non-Halachic-Jewish relatives are included."&lt;ref name="Berman" /&gt; Growth began to diminish in 2005 when the German government replaced the special quota immigration law (''Kontingentsflüchtlingsgesetz'') with more restrictive rules (''Zuwanderungsgesetz'')

===Other Russian speakers===
Other Russian speakers in Germany fall into a few different categories. The German ''Statistisches Bundesamt'' ([[Federal Statistical Office of Germany|Federal Statistical Office]]) reported the following figures for Russian speakers from the year 2000: legal aliens (365,415), [[Right of asylum|political asylees]] (20,000), students (7,431), family members of German citizens (10,000-15,000), special workers in fields of science and culture (5,000-10,000), and diplomatic corps (5,000).&lt;ref name=Polian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polian|first1=Pavel|title=Russkogovoriashchie v Germanii [Russian]|journal=Demoskop Weekly|date=20 December 2004 – 9 January 2005|issue=183-184|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2004/0183/analit04.php|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest percentage comes from the "legal alien" category.  The vast majority of the legal aliens, who are mainly ethnic Russians (with smaller numbers of [[Belarusians]], [[Ukrainians]], and other groups) are family members of returnees (''Aussiedler'' and Soviet Jews), but who have yet to receive German citizenship.&lt;ref name=Polian /&gt;

==Integration into German society==
Most Russian-Germans have assimilated and integrated well into German society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most other immigrant groups, there remain some contemporary issues. German authorities have been concerned that the high number of Russian immigrants self-segregating in certain neighborhoods hinders social integration.  This has led to restrictions on immigration from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Other issues have included crime, drugs, poverty and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote= But Germany wants to stop the influx, concerned that the new arrivals are living in self-created ghettoes. The kids here have typical immigration problems, arrival in a new country where everything is strange: the language, the laws, everything. There is a whole generation of kids uprooted from their homes as teenagers, alienated in Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aussiedler have raised many issues. Although they were expected to assimilate rapidly into German society, Aussiedler and their descendants are struggling with their identity, and most consider themselves Russian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Schäfer. "During the last 15 years far more than half a million children and youth have come from the countries of former Soviet Union to Germany. Lots of them got immediately German passports by descent but still feel as Russians."&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, due to outside pressure, they had become assimilated into Russian society, in most cases speaking Russian as their first or only language, and this has made their return difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong.&lt;/ref&gt; Native Germans typically consider them Russian, just as they consider [[German-Americans]] visiting Germany to be American, despite their German roots.

A 2006 study by the German Youth Institute revealed that Russian-Germans face high levels of prejudice and intolerance in Germany, ranging from low job opportunities, to problems in the real estate market.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer. "Although Germany has become an immigration country educational or pedagogical support for young migrants is not very developed. They have low knowledge and information about the background and the needs of young migrants. They are expected to assimilate with the German society and to feel and behave like Germans do."&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also found out that most Russian-Germans still identify as Russian, rather than German.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Early life==
Labelle grew up in rural [[Quebec]], near [[Châteauguay]].&lt;ref name="gazette-7apr2017" /&gt; She worked as an [[elementary school]] teacher, and was the camp co-ordinator for Gender Creative Kids Canada.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evfem" /&gt;

==Career==
Labelle writes and draws ''Assigned Male'', a webcomic and series of [[zine]]s addressing issues of [[Gender role|gender norms]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. It features the character of 11-year-old Stephie, a trans girl discovering and embracing her gender.&lt;ref name="evfem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="valley" /&gt; Labelle has said that while working with transgender children, she "noticed how negative everything we tell them about their own body is, so I wanted to create a character that could respond to all those horrible things trans kids hear all the time."&lt;ref name="valley" /&gt; She has made educational guides to go with the comics, to promote safer spaces for trans youth.&lt;ref name="valley" /&gt; The ''[[Washington Blade]]'' called the webcomic "hilarious" and said it shows transgender humour can be funny without being offensive.&lt;ref name="blade" /&gt; 

Labelle has written several books and zines about [[gender identity]] and expression, including ''The Genderific Coloring Book'', ''A Girl Like Any Other'', ''Ciel at Camp Fabulous'', and ''Gender Euphoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender-neutral coloring book helps kids understand stereotypes|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gender-neutral-coloring-book-helps-kids-understand-stereotypes040615/|website=[[Gay Star News]]|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author: Sophie Labelle|url=http://libcat.gaycity.org/authors/6071|website=Michael C.

In May 2017 Labelle released the comic book ''Dating Tips for Trans and Queer Weirdos''. A scheduled launch at the bookstore [[Venus Envy (sex shop)|Venus Envy]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] was cancelled after threats were made against both the store and Labelle. She received death threats, her home address was [[doxing|posted]] in online forums, and her web site and social media accounts were compromised (which she temporarily took offline).&lt;ref name="metro-18may2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=d'Entremont|first1=Yvette|title=Trans cartoonist forced to cancel Halifax book launch 'overwhelmed' by community support|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2017/05/18/trans-cartoonist-forced-cancel-book-launch-halifax.html|accessdate=May 19, 2017|newspaper=[[Metro International|Toronto Metro]]|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/transgender-cartoonist-sophie-labelle-hate-death-threats-book-launch-1.4123683|title=Threats force cancellation of trans cartoonist's Halifax book launch|last=Colley|first=Sherri Borden|date=May 19, 2017|work=CBC News|access-date=May 20, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the harassment, Labelle advocated for Canadian [[Bill C-16]] to protect gender identity and expression, and for stronger laws against [[cyberbullying]].&lt;ref name="vice-19may2017"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Beaumont|first1=Hilary|title=This Canadian cartoonist is just the latest target of anti-transgender trolls|url=https://news.vice.com/story/canadian-cartoonist-is-just-the-latest-target-of-anti-transgender-trolls|accessdate=May 20, 2017|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire''', or the '''Spanish–Aztec War''' (1519–21),&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Restall|Restall, Matthew]], ''When Montezuma Met Cortés''. Ecco 2018 p. xxix,&lt;/ref&gt; was the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] by the [[Spanish Empire]] within the context of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. It was one of the most significant and complex events in world history. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by [[Conquistador|Spanish conquerors]], their indigenous allies and the defeated [[Aztecs]]. It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the [[Mexica]] of [[Tenochtitlan]] over a two-year period. For the Spanish, the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.

The Spanish made landfall in Mexico in 1517. A Spanish settler in Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], led an expedition (''entrada'') to Mexico, landing in February 1519, following an earlier expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]] to [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] in 1517. Two years later Cortés and his retinue set sail, thus beginning the expedition of exploration and conquest.&lt;ref name="spanishwars.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishwars.net/16th-century-conquest-of-the-aztec-empire-partI.html|title=Conquest of the Aztec Empire Part I|website=www.spanishwars.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on August 13, 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcalan]] warriors led by Cortés and [[Xicotencatl II|Xicotencatl the Younger]] captured the emperor [[Cuauhtemoc]] and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec Empire]]. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of [[Mexico City]] on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.

Cortés made alliances with tributaries city-states (''[[altepetl]]'') of the [[Aztec Empire]] as well as their political rivals, particularly the [[Tlaxcalteca]] and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocans]], a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including [[:es:Huejotzinco|Huexotzinco]] and polities bordering [[Lake Texcoco]], the inland lake system of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) indigenous slave woman, known to the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as Doña Marina, and generally as [[La Malinche]]. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor [[Moctezuma II]] to his visit, Cortés arrived in [[Tenochtitlan]] on November 8, 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the [[Totonac people|Totonacs]] in [[Veracruz]], he took Moctezuma captive, along with [[Cuitláhuac]], his kinsman. Capturing the [[cacique]] or indigenous ruler was standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Moctezuma had considerable precedent, which might well have included those in Spain during the Christian reconquest of territory held by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|Lockhart, James]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]],''Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the expedition of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], sent to rein in Cortés's expedition that had exceeded its specified limits, Cortés's right-hand man [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was left in charge. Alvarado allowed a significant Aztec feast to be celebrated in Tenochtitlan and on the pattern of the earlier massacre in Cholula, closed off the square and [[Massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan|massacred the celebrating Aztec noblemen]]. The official biography of Cortés by [[Francisco López de Gómara]] contains a description of the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara, ''Cortés: The Life of the Conqueror by His Secretary,'' Berkeley: University of California Press 1964, pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alvarado massacre at the Main Temple of [[Tenochtitlan]] precipitated rebellion by the population of the city. Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who murdered him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views of the Conquest of Mexico|last=Schwartz|first=Stuart B.|publisher=Bedford/St Martin's|year=2000|isbn=978-0-312-39355-7|location=Boston|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, when Moctezuma, now seen by the population as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm the outraged populace, he was killed by a projectile.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al.

The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on August 13, 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic World|last=Egerton,|first=Douglas R., et al.|publisher=Harlan Davidson, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88295-245-1|location=Wheeling, Illinois|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before, including Cortés. A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'' (1983). See especially chapter 3, "From islands to mainland: the Caribbean phase and subsequent conquests."&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of the [[Spanish Empire]] overseas, with [[New Spain]], which later became [[Mexico]].

== Sources for the conquest of Central Mexico ==
[[File:Historia verdadera conquista Nueva España portada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|''True History of the Conquest of Mexico]]]]
The conquest of Mexico, the initial destruction of the great pre-Columbian civilizations, is a significant event in world history. The Conquest was well documented by a variety of sources with differing points of view, including indigenous accounts, by both allies and opponents. Accounts by the Spanish conquerors exist from the first landfall at [[Veracruz]], Mexico (on [[Good Friday]], April 22, 1519) to the final victory over the Mexica in Tenochtitlan on August 13, 1521. Notably, the accounts of the conquest, Spanish and indigenous alike, have biases and exaggerations. Some, though not all, Spanish accounts downplay the support of their indigenous allies. Conquerors' accounts exaggerate individual contributions to the Conquest at the expense of their comrades, while indigenous allies' accounts stress their loyalty and importance to victory for the Spanish. These accounts are similar to Spanish conquerors' accounts contained in petitions for rewards, known as ''b\enemérito'' petitions.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Conquest Narratives," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2001, vol. 1, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lengthy accounts from the defeated indigenous viewpoint were created under the direction of Spanish friars, Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and Dominican [[Diego Durán]], using indigenous informants.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' chapter 4, "Narratives of the Conquest." Pearson, 2003, pp. 73–96&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Spanish account of the conquest was written by lead conqueror [[Hernán Cortés]], who sent a series of letters to the Spanish monarch [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], giving a contemporary account of the conquest from his point of view, in which he justified his actions. These were almost immediately published in Spain and later in other parts of Europe. Much later, Spanish conqueror [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], a well-seasoned participant in the conquest of Central Mexico, wrote what he called [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|''The True History of the Conquest of New Spain'']], countering the account by Cortés's official biographer, [[Francisco López de Gómara]]. Bernal Díaz's account had begun as a ''benemérito'' petition for rewards but he expanded it to encompass a full history of his earlier expeditions in the Caribbean and [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]] and the conquest of the Aztec. A number of lower rank Spanish conquerors wrote ''benemérito'' petitions to the Spanish Crown, requesting rewards for their services in the conquest, including Juan Díaz, Andrés de Tapia, García del Pilar, and Fray [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia de Fuentes, ed. ''The Conquistadors: First-Person Accounts the Conquest of Mexico,'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1993. Previously published by Orion Press 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés's right-hand man, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] did not write at any length about his actions in the New World, and died as a man of action in the [[Mixtón War]] in 1542. Two letters to Cortés about Alvarado's campaigns in Guatemala are published in ''The Conquistadors''.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Letters of Pedro de Alvarado" in ''The Conquistadors,'' Patricia de Fuente, editor and translator. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1993, pp. 182–96&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicle of the so-called "Anonymous Conqueror" was written sometime in the sixteenth century, entitled in an early twentieth-century translation to English as [[Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan]] (i.e. Tenochtitlan). Rather than it being a petition for rewards for services, as many Spanish accounts were, the Anonymous Conqueror made observations about the indigenous situation at the time of the conquest. The account was used by eighteenth-century Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]] in his descriptions of the history of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cronicle of the Anonymous Conquistador" in ''The Conquistadors: First-person Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' Patricia de Fuente, (editor and trans). Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1993, pp. 165–81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Entrada_a_Chalco.jpg|thumb|Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish, showing their leaders, porters, as well as a Spanish warrior and a Spanish war dog. Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]
On the indigenous side, the allies of Cortés, particularly the Tlaxcalans, wrote extensively about their services to the Spanish Crown in the conquest, arguing for special privileges for themselves. The most important of these are the pictorial [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] and the ''Historia de Tlaxcala'' by [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]]. Less successfully, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] allies from Huexotzinco (or Huejotzinco) near Tlaxcala argued that their contributions had been overlooked by the Spanish. In a letter in [[Nahuatl]] to the Spanish Crown, the indigenous lords of Huexotzinco lay out their case in for their valorous service. The letter has been published in Nahuatl and English translation by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in ''We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''We People Here,'' University of California Press 1991, pp. 289–97&lt;/ref&gt; Texcoco patriot and member of a noble family there, Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, likewise petitioned the Spanish Crown, in Spanish, saying that [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] had not received sufficient rewards for their support of the conquistadors, particularly after the Spanish were forced out of Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitil, ''Ally of Cortés: Account 13 of the Coming of the Spaniards and the Beginning of the Evangelical Law.'' Douglass K. Ballentine, translator. El Paso: Texas Western Press 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known indigenous account of the conquest is Book 12 of [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]'s ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' and published as the [[Florentine Codex]], in parallel columns of [[Nahuatl]] and Spanish, with pictorials. Less well-known is [[Sahagún]]'s 1585 revision of the conquest account, which shifts from the indigenous viewpoint entirely and inserts at crucial junctures passages lauding the Spanish and in particular Hernán Cortés.&lt;ref&gt;Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, ''The Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision'' translated by Howard F. Cline, with an introduction by S.L. Cline. University of Utah Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Another indigenous account compiled by a Spanish friar is Dominican [[Diego Durán]]'s ''The History of the Indies of New Spain'', from 1581, with many color illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Fray Diego Durán, ''The History of the Indies of New Spain''[1581], Trans., annotated, and with an introduction by Doris Heyden. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A text from the Nahua point of view, the [[Anales de Tlatelolco]], an early indigenous account in Nahuatl, perhaps from 1540, remained in indigenous hands until it was published.{{when|date=October 2016}} An extract of this important manuscript was published in 1991 by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in Nahuatl transcription and English translation.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'', University of California Press 1991, pp. 256–73&lt;/ref&gt; A popular anthology in English for classroom use is [[Miguel León-Portilla]]'s, ''The Broken Spears: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' from 1992.&lt;ref name=Miguel&gt;León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, many publications and republications of sixteenth-century accounts of the conquest of Mexico appeared around 1992, the 500th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage, when scholarly and popular interest in first encounters surged.

A popular and enduring narrative of the Spanish campaign in central Mexico is by [[New England]]-born nineteenth-century historian [[William Hickling Prescott]]. His ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'', first published in 1843, remains an important unified narrative synthesis of the conquest. Prescott read and used all the formal writings from the sixteenth century, although few had been published by the mid-nineteenth century when he was writing. It is likely that a 1585 revision of Bernardino de Sahagún's account of the conquest survives today only in the form of a copy because it was made in Spain for Prescott's project from a now-lost original.&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline "Introduction," ''History of the Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision by Bernardino de Sahagún,'' Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars of the modern era point out its biases and shortcomings, "there is nowhere they can get as good a unified narrative of the main events, crises, and course of the Mexican conquest as Prescott's version."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|Lockhart, James]], "Introduction" to William Hickling Prescott, ''History of the Conquest of Mexico,'' New York: The Modern Library, 2001, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aztec omens for the conquest ===
[[File:Codex Duran, page 1.jpg|thumb|left|A comet seen by Moctezuma, interpreted as a sign of impending peril. [[Diego Durán]]'s account from indigenous informants.]]
In the sources recorded by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and Dominican [[Diego Durán]] in the mid to late sixteenth century, there are accounts of events that were interpreted as supernatural omens of the conquest. These two accounts are full-blown narratives from the viewpoint of the Spanish opponents. Most first-hand accounts about the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] were written by Spaniards: Hernán Cortés' letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the first-person narrative of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]''. The primary sources from the native people affected as a result of the conquest are seldom used, because they tend to reflect the views of a particular native group, such as the Tlaxcalans. Indigenous accounts were written in pictographs as early as 1525. Later accounts were written in the native tongue of the Aztec and other native peoples of central Mexico, [[Nahuatl]].

It is also important to note that the native texts of the defeated Mexica narrating their version of the conquest described eight omens that were believed to have occurred nine years prior to the arrival of the Spanish from the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' (The Florentine Codex). Book 12. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1510, Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II was visited by [[Nezahualpilli]], who had a reputation as a great seer, as well as being the ''tlatoani'' of Texcoco. Nezahualpilli warned Moctezuma that he must be on guard, for in a few years Aztec cities would be destroyed. Before leaving, he said that there would be omens for Moctezuma to know that what he has been told is true. Over the years, and especially after Nezhualpilli's death in 1515, several supernatural omens appeared.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moctezuma: Warlord of the Aztecs|last=Tsouras|first=Peter|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight bad omens or wonders:&lt;ref name="Miguel" /&gt;{{rp|3–11}}
[[File:Aztec Empire c 1519.png|thumb|300 px|Aztec empire on the eve of the Spanish Invasion]]

# A column of fire that appeared from midnight until dawn, and seemed to rain fire in the year 1517 (12-House)
# Fire consuming the temple of [[Huitzilopochtli]]
# A lightning bolt destroying the straw temple of [[Xiuhtecuhtli]]
# The appearance of fire, or comets, streaming across the sky in threes during the day
# The "boiling deep ," and water flooding, of a lake nearby Tenochtitlan
# A woman, [[Cihuatcoatl]], weeping in the middle of the night for them (the Aztecs) to "flee far away from this city"
# A two headed man, ''tlacantzolli'', running through the streets
# Montezuma II saw the stars of [[Taurus (constellation)|''mamalhuatztli]], and images of fighting men riding "on the backs of animals resembling deer", in a mirror on the crown of a bird caught by fishermen

Additionally, the [[Tlaxcala]] saw a "radiance that shone in the east every morning three hours before sunrise", and a "whirlwind of dust" from the volcano [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|Matlalcueye]].&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|11}} According to Diaz, "These ''Caciques'' also told us of a tradition they had heard from their ancestors, that one of the idols which they particularly worshipped had prophesied the coming of men from distant lands in the direction of the sunrise, who would conquer them and rule them."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|181}} Some accounts would claim that this idol, or deity was Quetzalcoatl, and that the Aztecs were defeated because they believed the Spanish were supernatural and didn't know how to react, although whether or not the Aztecs really believed that is debatable.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic World|last=Egerton|first=Douglas R., et al.|publisher=Harlan Davidson, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88295-245-1|location=Wheeling, Illinois|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omens were extremely important to the Aztecs, who believed that history repeated itself. A number of modern scholars cast doubt on whether such omens occurred or whether they were ''[[ex post facto]]'' (retrospective) creations to help the Mexica explain their defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Townsend, "Burying the White Gods: New Perspectives on the Conquest of Mexico" ''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 108, No. 3 (June 2003), pp. 659–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sources depicting omens and the return of old Aztec gods, including those supervised by Spanish priests, were written after the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Some ethnohistorians say that when the Spanish arrived native peoples and their leaders did not view them as supernatural in any sense but rather as simply another group of powerful outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some historians, Moctezuma responded rationally to the Spanish invasion. These historians believe this means that Moctezuma did not think the Spanish were supernatural.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many Spanish accounts incorporated omens to emphasize what they saw as the preordained nature of the conquest and their success as Spanish destiny. This means that native emphasis on omens and bewilderment in the face of invasion "may be a postconquest interpretation by informants who wished to please the Spaniards or who resented the failure of Montezuma and of the warriors of Tenochtitlan to provide leadership."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stuart B., ed. ''Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views of the Conquest of Mexico''. Boston: Bedforf, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Thomas concludes that Moctezuma was confused and ambivalent about whether Cortés was a god or the ambassador of a great king in another land.&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;192)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Spaniards arrived in 1519, Moctezuma knew this was the year of Ce Acatl, which is the year [[Quetzalcoatl]] was promised to return. Previously, during [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s expedition, Moctezuma believed that those men were heralds of Quetzalcoatl, as Moctezuma, as well as everyone else in the Aztec Empire, were to believe that eventually Quetzalcoatl will return. Moctezuma even had glass beads that were left behind by Grijalva brought to Tenochtitlan and they were regarded as sacred religious relics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Sara E.|date=March 1972|title=How the Aztecs Appraised Montezuma|url=|journal=The History Teacher|volume=5|pages=21–30|doi=10.2307/491417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish expeditions ==
The Spanish had established a permanent settlement on the island of [[Hispaniola]] in 1493 on the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]]. There were further Spanish explorations and settlements in the Caribbean and the [[Spanish Main]], seeking wealth in the form of gold and access to indigenous labor to mine gold and other manual labor. Twenty-five years after the first Spanish settlement in the [[New World]], expeditions of exploration were sent to the coast of Mexico.

==Early Spanish expeditions to Yucatán==
[[File:DiegoVelazquezCuellar.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Diego de Velázquez]], who commissioned Cortés's limited expedition of exploration in 1519]]
In 1517, Cuban governor Diego Velázquez commissioned a fleet of three ships under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to sail west and explore the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] peninsula. Córdoba reached the coast of Yucatán. The [[Mayans]] at Cape Catoche invited the Spanish to land, and the conquistadors read the [[Spanish Requirement of 1513|Requirement of 1513]] to them, which offered the natives the protection of the King of Spain, if they would submit to him. Córdoba took two prisoners, who adopted the baptized names of Melchor and Julián and became interpreters. Later, the two prisoners, being misled or misinterpreting the language with information given to the Spanish conquistadors that there was plenty of gold up for grabs.&lt;ref name="spanishwars.net"/&gt; On the western side of the Yucatán Peninsula, the Spanish were attacked at night by Maya chief Mochcouoh, a battle in which fifty men were killed. Córdoba was mortally wounded and only a remnant of his crew returned to Cuba.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, ''The Conquest of New Spain'', London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–26}}

At that time, Yucatán was briefly explored by the conquistadors, but the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] with its many independent city-state [[polity|polities]] of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] [[Maya civilization]] came many years after the Spaniards' and their indigenous allies' rapid conquest of Central Mexico (1519–21). With the help of tens of thousands of Xiu Mayan warriors, it would take more than 170 years for the Spanish to establish full control of the Maya homelands, which extended from northern Yucatán to the central lowlands region of [[El Petén]] and the southern Guatemalan highlands. The end of this latter campaign is generally marked by the downfall of the Maya state based at [[Tayasal]] in the Petén region, in 1697.

== Cortés's expedition ==

=== Commissioning the expedition ===
[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hernán Cortés in his later years; his coat of arms on the upper left corner. Painting reproduced in the book ''America'' (R. Cronau 19th century).]]
Even before [[Juan de Grijalva]] returned to Spain, Velázquez decided to send a third and even larger expedition to explore the Mexican coast.&lt;ref name=Hassig94&gt;Hassig, Ross, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman: London and New York, 1994. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hernán Cortés]], then one of Velázquez's favorites and brother-in-law, was named as the commander, which created envy and resentment among the Spanish contingent in the Spanish colony.&lt;ref name=Hassig94/&gt; Licenses for expeditions allowed the Crown to retain sovereignty over newly conquered lands while not risking its own assets in the enterprise. Anyone willing to make a financial contribution could potentially gain even more wealth and power. Men who brought horses, ''caballeros'', received two shares of the spoils, one for military service, another because of the horse.&lt;ref name="Ida Altman 2003, p. 54"&gt;Ida Altman, S.L. (Sarah) Cline, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés invested a considerable part of his personal fortune and probably went into debt to borrow additional funds. Velázquez may have personally contributed nearly half the cost of the expedition.

In an agreement signed on 23 October 1518, Governor Velázquez restricted the expedition led by Cortés to exploration and trade, so that conquest and settlement of the mainland might occur under his own command, once he had received the permission necessary to do so which he had already requested from the Crown. In this way, Velázquez sought to ensure title to the riches and laborers discovered.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Boruchoff, "Hernán Cortés," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd ed. (Detroit: Macmillan, 2008), vol. 2, pp. 146–49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, armed with the knowledge of Castilian law that he had likely gained as a notary in Valladolid, Cortés managed to free himself of Velázquez's authority by presenting Velázquez as a tyrant acting in his own self-interest, and not in the interest of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, "Hernán Cortés."&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés also contrived to have his men name him military leader and chief magistrate (judge) of the expedition.

=== Revoking the commission ===
[[File:Conquest mexico 1519 21.png|thumb|300px|Map depicting Cortés' conquest route]]
Velázquez himself must have been keenly aware that whoever conquered the mainland for Spain would gain fame, glory and fortune to eclipse anything that could be achieved in Cuba. Thus, as the preparations for departure drew to a close, the governor became suspicious that Cortés would be disloyal to him and try to commandeer the expedition for his own purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman: London and New York, 1994. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; namely to establish himself as governor of the colony, independent of Velázquez's control.

Therefore, Velázquez sent Luis de Medina with orders to replace Cortés. However, Cortés's brother-in-law allegedly had Medina intercepted and killed. The papers that Medina had been carrying were sent to Cortés. Thus warned, Cortés accelerated the organization and preparation of his expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortés, and the fall of Old Mexico'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Velázquez arrived at the dock in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in person, "he and Cortés again embraced, with a great exchange of compliments", before Cortes set sail for [[Trinidad, Cuba]]. Velázquez then sent orders for the fleet to be held and Cortés taken prisoner. Nevertheless, Cortés set sail, beginning his expedition with the legal status of a [[mutiny|mutineer]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|49, 51, 55–56}}

Cortés's contingent consisted of 11 ships carrying about 630 men (including 30 crossbowmen and 12 [[arquebusiers]], an early form of firearm), a doctor, several carpenters, at least eight women, a few hundred [[Arawak]]s from Cuba and some Africans, both freedmen and slaves. Although modern usage often calls the European participants "soldiers", the term was never used by these men themselves in any context, something that [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] realized when analyzing sixteenth-century legal records from conquest-era Peru.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''Spanish Peru, 1532–1560.'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cortés gains two translators ===
Cortés spent some time at the island of [[Cozumel]], on the east coast of Yucatán, trying to convert the locals to Christianity, something that provided mixed results. While at Cozumel, Cortés heard reports of other white men living in the Yucatán. Cortés sent messengers to these reported Spaniards, who turned out to be the survivors of a Spanish shipwreck that had occurred in 1511, [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].

Aguilar petitioned his Maya chieftain to be allowed to join his former countrymen, and he was released and made his way to Cortés's ships. 
Now quite fluent in [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]], as well as some other [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous languages]], proved to be a valuable asset for Cortés as a translator – a skill of particular significance to the later conquest of the Aztec Empire that was to be the end result of Cortés's expedition. According to Bernal Díaz, Aguilar relayed that before coming, he had attempted to convince Guerrero to leave as well. Guerrero declined on the basis that he was by now well-assimilated with the Maya culture, had a Maya wife and three children, and he was looked upon as a figure of rank within the Maya settlement of [[Chetumal]], where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero is reported to have responded, ''"Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children, and they look at me as a Cacique here, and a captain in time of war [...] But my face is tattooed and my ears are pierced. What would the Spaniards say if they saw me like this? And look how handsome these children of mine are!"'' (p. 60)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guerrero's later fate is somewhat uncertain, it appears that for some years he continued to fight alongside the Maya forces against Spanish incursions, providing military counsel and encouraging resistance; it is speculated that he may have been killed in a later battle.
[[Image:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|300px |left|[[Codex Azcatitlan]] depicting the Spanish-Tlaxcalan army, with Cortés and La Malinche, along with an African slave in front the meeting with Moctezuma. The facing page is no longer extant.]]

After leaving Cozumel, Cortés continued round the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula and landed at [[Potonchán]], where there was little gold. After defeating the local natives in two battles, discovered a far more valuable asset in the form of a woman whom Cortés would have christened Marina. She is often known as [[La Malinche]] and also sometimes called "[[Malintzin]]" or Malinalli, her native birth names. Later, the Aztecs would come to call Cortés "Malintzin" or La Malinche by dint of his close association with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortese/cortese_b00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] wrote in his account ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' that Marina was "truly a great princess." Later, the honorific Spanish title of Doña would be added to her baptized name.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;{{rp|80, 82}}

Cortés had stumbled upon one of the keys to realizing his ambitions. He would speak to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] in Spanish who would then translate into Mayan for Marina. She would then translate from Mayan to Nahuatl. With this pair of translators, Cortés could now communicate to the Aztecs.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|86–87}} How effectively is still a matter of speculation, since Marina did not speak the dialect of the Aztecs, nor was she familiar with the protocols of the Aztec nobility, who were renowned for their flowery, flattering talk. Doña Marina quickly learned Spanish, and became Cortés's primary interpreter, confidant, consort, cultural translator, and the mother of his first son, Martin.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|82}} Until Cortes's marriage to his second wife, a union which produced a legitimate son whom he also named Martin, Cortés's natural son with Marina was the heir of his envisaged fortunes.

Native speakers of Nahuatl would call her "Malintzin." This name is the closest phonetic approximation possible in Nahuatl to the sound of 'Marina' in Spanish. Over time, "[[La Malinche]]" (the modern Spanish cognate of 'Malintzin') became a term that describes a traitor to one's people. To this day, the word ''[[malinchista]]'' is used by Mexicans to denote one who apes the language and customs of another country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Karttunen|Karttunen, Frances]]. "Malinche and Malinchismo" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 777-78.

=== Foundation of Veracruz ===
[[File:VillaRicaCoatArmsDF.JPG|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of Villa Rica, Veracruz; the first town council founded by the Spanish. The tile mosaic is located in [[Federal District buildings|Mexico City]].]]
Cortés landed his expedition force on the coast of the modern day state of [[Veracruz]] in April 1519. During this same period, soon after he arrived, Cortés was welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II. Gifts were exchanged, and Cortés attempted to frighten the Aztec delegation with a display of his firepower.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|89–91}}

Faced with imprisonment or death for defying the governor, Cortés' only alternative was to continue his enterprise in the hope of redeeming himself with the Spanish Crown. To do this, he directed his men to establish a settlement called [[Veracruz (city)|La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz]], or "True Cross", since they arrived on [[Maundy Thursday]] and landed on [[Good Friday]]. The legally constituted "[[regidor|town council]] of Villa Rica" then promptly offered him the position of [[adelantado]], or Chief Justice and Captain-General.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|102}}

This strategy was not unique.&lt;ref&gt;See: Restall, Matthew. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest. Oxford University Press: Oxford and New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Velásquez had used this same legal mechanism to free himself from [[Diego Columbus]]' authority in Cuba. In being named ''adelantado'' by a duly constituted [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]], Cortés was able to free himself from Velásquez's authority and continue his expedition. To ensure the legality of this action, several members of his expedition, including [[Francisco Montejo]] and [[Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero]], returned to Spain to seek acceptance of the cabildo's declaration with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|127–28}}

Cortés learned of an indigenous settlement called [[Cempoala]] and marched his forces there. On their arrival in Cempoala, they were greeted by 20 dignitaries and cheering townsfolk.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|88, 107}} Cortés quickly persuaded the [[Totonac]] chiefs to rebel against the Aztecs, taking prisoner five of Moctezuma's tax collectors.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|111–13}} The Totonacs also helped Cortés build the town of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, which was the starting point for his attempt to conquer the Aztec Empire.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|114}}

Hearing of the rebellion, more ambassadors from the Aztec Emperor returned to see Cortés, bearing gifts of "gold and cloth", in thankfulness for Cortés freeing his tax collectors. Montezuma also told Cortés, he was certain the Spanish were of "his own race", and had arrived as "his ancestors had foretold". As Cortés told his men, the natives "think of us as gods, or godlike beings."&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|13, 21, 25, 33, 35}}&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|115–17}}

Although they attempted to dissuade Cortés from visiting Tenochtitlan, the lavish gifts and the polite, welcoming remarks only encouraged ''El [[Caudillo]]'' to continue his march towards the capital of the empire.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|96, 166}}

=== Scuttling the fleet and aftermath ===
[[File:ScuttleFleetNHMDF.JPG|thumb|left|Cortés scuttling fleet off Veracruz coast]]
Men still loyal to the governor of Cuba planned to seize a ship and escape to Cuba, but Cortés moved swiftly to squash their plans. Two leaders were condemned to be hanged; two were lashed, and one had his foot mutilated. To make sure such a mutiny did not happen again, he decided to [[scuttling|scuttle]] his ships.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|128–30}}

There is a popular misconception that the ships were burned rather than sunk. This misconception has been attributed to the reference made by [[Cervantes de Salazár]] in 1546, as to Cortés burning his ships.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Restall, "Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest", 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This may have also come from a mis-translation of the version of the story written in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html Cortés Burns His Boats] pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;

With all of his ships scuttled, Cortés effectively stranded the expedition in central Mexico. However, it did not completely end the aspirations of those members of his company who remained loyal to the governor of Cuba. Cortés then led his band inland towards Tenochtitlan.

In addition to the Spaniards, Cortés force now included 40 Cempoalan warrior chiefs and at least 200 other natives whose task was to drag the cannon and carry supplies.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|134}} The Cempoalans were accustomed to the hot climate of the coast, but they suffered immensely from the cold of the mountains, the rain, and the hail as they marched towards Tenochtitlan.

=== Alliance with Tlaxcala ===
[[File:Xicotencatl-Cortes.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Cortés and Xicotencatl]]
Cortés soon arrived at [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], a confederacy of about 200 towns and different tribes, but without central government.

The [[Otomi people|Otomi]] initially, and then the [[Tlaxcalans]] fought the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point Diaz remarked, "they surrounded us on every side". After Cortés continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Montezuma, [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], and [[Maxixcatzin]], persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, [[Xicotencatl the Younger]], that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|143–55, 171}}

The Tlaxcalans main city was Tlaxcala. After almost a century of fighting the [[Flower Wars]], a great deal of hatred and bitterness had developed between the Tlaxcalans and the Aztecs. The Aztecs had already conquered most of the territory around Tlaxcala, and waged war on them every year.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|154}} It has been suggested that the Aztecs left Tlaxcala independent so that they would have a constant supply of war captives to sacrifice to their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 1519, Cortés arrived in Tlaxcala and was greeted with joy by the rulers, who saw the Spanish as an ally against the Aztecs. Due to a commercial blockade by the Aztecs, Tlaxcala was poor, lacking, among other things, salt and cotton cloths, so they could only offer Cortés and his men food and slaves. Cortés stayed twenty days in Tlaxcala, giving his men time to recover from their wounds from the battles. Cortés seems to have won the true friendship and loyalty of the senior leaders of Tlaxcala, among them [[Maxixcatzin]] and [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], although he could not win the heart of [[Xicotencatl the Younger]]. The Spaniards agreed to respect parts of the city, like the temples, and reportedly took only the things that were offered to them freely.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|172–74}}

As before with other native groups, Cortés preached to the Tlaxcalan leaders about the benefits of Christianity. The ''Caciques'' gave Cortes "the most beautiful of their daughters and nieces". Xicotencatl the Elder's daughter was baptized as Doña Luisa, and Maxixcatzin's daughter as Doña Elvira. They were given by Cortés to [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and [[Juan Velázquez de León]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|176–78}}

Legends say that he convinced the four leaders of Tlaxcala to become baptized. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder, Citalpopocatzin and Temiloltecutl received the names of Don Lorenzo, Don Vicente, Don Bartolomé and Don Gonzalo. It is impossible to know if these leaders understood the Catholic faith. In any case, they apparently had no problems in adding the Christian "Dios" ([[God]] in Spanish), the lord of the heavens, to their already complex [[Aztec mythology|pantheon of gods]]. An exchange of gifts was made and thus began the highly significant and effective alliance between Cortés and Tlaxcala.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Tomas, ''The conquest of Mexico'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cortés marches to Cholula ===
Meanwhile, Moctezuma's ambassadors, who had been in the Spanish camp after the battles with the Tlaxcalans, continued to press Cortés to take the road to Mexico via [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], which was under Aztec control, rather than over [[:es:Huejoztinco|Huexotzinco]], which was an ally of Tlaxcala. They were surprised Cortés had stayed in [[Tlaxcala]] so long "among a poor and ill-bred people".&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|166, 185–86}}

Cholula was one of the most important cities of Mesoamerica, the second largest, and probably the most sacred.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Its huge pyramid (larger in volume than the great pyramids of Egypt)&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan Toby|title=Archaeology of ancient Mexico and Central America, an Encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc|location=New York &amp; London|pages=139–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it one of the most prestigious places of the [[Aztec religion]]. However, it appears that Cortés perceived Cholula more as a military threat to his rear guard than a religious center, as he marched to Tenochtitlan. He sent emissaries ahead to try a diplomatic solution to enter the city.

Cortés, who had not yet decided to start a war with the Aztec Empire, decided to offer a compromise. He accepted the gifts of the Aztec ambassadors, and at the same time accepted the offer of the Tlaxcalan allies to provide porters and 1000 warriors on his march to Cholula. He also sent two men, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], and Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia, directly to Tenochtitlan, as ambassadors and to scout for an appropriate route.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|186–88}}

=== Massacre of Cholula ===
[[File:Matanza de Cholula por conquistadores españoles Lienzo de Tlaxcala.jpg|thumb|The massacre of Cholula. Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]
[[File:Felix Parra Episodios de la conquista La matanza de Cholula.jpg|thumb|Cholula Massacre, by [[Felix Parra]], 1877.]]
There are contradictory reports about what happened at [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had apparently decided to resist with force the advance of Cortés and his troops, and it seems that Moctezuma ordered the leaders of Cholula to try to stop the Spanish. Cholula had a very small army, because as a sacred city they put their confidence in their prestige and their gods. According to the chronicles of the Tlaxcalteca, the priests of Cholula expected to use the power of Quetzalcoatl, their primary god, against the invaders.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|193, 199}}

Cortés and his men entered Cholula without active resistance. However, they were not met by the city leaders and were not given food and drink on the third day.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|192}} Cempoalans reported that fortifications were being constructed around the city and the Tlaxcalans were warning the Spaniards.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|193}} Finally, [[La Malinche]] informed Cortés, after talking to the wife of one of the lords of Cholula, that the locals planned to murder the Spanish in their sleep.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|196}} Although he did not know if the rumor was true or not, Cortés ordered a [[pre-emptive strike]], urged by the Tlaxcalans, the enemies of the Cholulans. Cortés confronted the city leaders in the main temple alleging that they were planning to attack his men. They admitted that they had been ordered to resist by Moctezuma, but they claimed they had not followed his orders. Regardless, on command, the Spaniards seized and killed many of the local nobles to serve as a lesson.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|199}}

They captured the Cholulan leaders [[Tlaquiach]] and [[Tlalchiac]] and then ordered the city to be set on fire. The troops started in the palace of [[Xacayatzin]], and then on to [[Chialinco]] and [[Yetzcoloc]]. In letters to his King, Cortés claimed that in three hours time his troops (helped by the Tlaxcalans) killed 3,000 people and had burned the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |title=Empires Past: Aztecs: Conquest |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061155/http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |archive-date=2 February 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness, Vázquez de Tapia, claimed the death toll was as high as 30,000. However, since the women and children, and many men, had already fled the city,&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|200–01}} it is unlikely that so many were killed. Regardless, the massacre of the nobility of Cholula was a notorious chapter in the conquest of Mexico.

The Azteca and Tlaxcalteca histories of the events leading up to the massacre vary; the Tlaxcalteca claimed that their ambassador Patlahuatzin was sent to Cholula and had been tortured by the Cholula. Thus, Cortés was avenging him by attacking Cholula.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|46–47}}(Historia de Tlaxcala, por Diego Muñoz Camargo, lib. II cap. V. 1550).
The Azteca version put the blame on the Tlaxcalteca, claiming that they resented Cortés going to Cholula instead of Huexotzingo.&lt;ref&gt;''Informantes de Sahagún: Códice Florentino'', lib. XII, cap. X.; Spanish version by Angel Ma. Garibay K.&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre had a chilling effect on the other city states and groups affiliated with the Aztecs, as well as the Aztecs themselves. Tales of the massacre convinced the other cities in the Aztec Empire to entertain seriously Cortés' proposals rather than risk the same fate.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|203}}

Cortés then sent emissaries to Moctezuma with the message that the people of Cholula had treated him with trickery and had therefore been punished.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|204}}

In one of his responses to Cortés, Moctezuma blamed the commanders of the local Aztec garrison for the resistance in Cholula, and recognizing that his long-standing attempts to dissuade Cortés from coming to Tenochtitlan with gifts of gold and silver had failed, Moctezuma finally invited the conquistadors to visit his capital city, according to Spanish sources, after feeling as though nothing else could be done.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|205–06}}

=== Entry into Tenochtitlan ===

On 8 November 1519, after the fall of Cholula, Cortés and his forces entered [[Tenochtitlan]], the island capital of the Mexica-Aztecs.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|219}} It is believed that the city was one of the largest in the world at that time, and the largest in the Americas up to that point.&lt;ref name="Russell 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Philip L.|title=The history of Mexico from pre-conquest to present|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9781136968280|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K5xdBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Size+of+Tenochtitlan#v=onepage&amp;q=Size%20of%20Tenochtitlan&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common estimates put the population at around 60,000 to over 300,000 people.&lt;ref name="Denevan"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Denevan|editor1-first=William M.|title=The Native population of the Americas in 1492|date=1992|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=9780299134334|pages=148–49|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J_wzOoGtYQoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=population+of+Tenochtitlan#v=onepage&amp;q=Tenochtitlan&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the population of Tenochtitlan was 250,000 in 1519, then Tenochtitlan would have been larger than every city in Europe except perhaps Naples and Constantinople, and four times the size of Seville.&lt;ref name="Russell 2011" /&gt;

To the Aztecs, Tenochtitlan was the "altar" for the Empire, as well as being the city that Quetzalcoatl would eventually return to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Return of Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire: Myths and Prophecies in the Aztec Tradition|last=Carrasco|first=David|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cortés welcomed by Moctezuma ====
Upon meeting, Hernan Cortés claimed to be the representative of the queen, Doña Juana of Castile, and her son, King Carlos I of Castile and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, all Spanish royalty, had then made an appearance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Francis J.|date=May 1995|title=Motecuzoma Xocoyotl, Hernán Cortés, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo: The Construction of an Arrest|url=|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=75. No. 2|pages=149–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sahagún reports that Moctezuma welcomed Cortés to Tenochtitlan on the Great Causeway, Xolac.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|216–17}} "The chiefs who accompanied Moctcuhzoma were: [[Cacama]], king of [[Texcoco (altepetl)]]; [[Tetlepanquetzal]]tin, king of [[Tlacopan]], Itzcuauhtzin the [[Tlacochcalcatl]], lord of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)]]; and Topantemoc, Motechzoma's treasurer in Tlatelolco."&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|65}} Moctezuma and his chiefs were adorned with blazing gold on their shoulders with feathers and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Conquest of Mexico|last=Prescott|first=William H.|publisher=J.B. Lippincott|year=|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the causeway where the two groups met, enormous numbers of people from Tenochtitlan watched the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic World|last=Egerton|first=Douglas R., et al.|publisher=Harlan Davidson, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88295-245-1|location=Wheeling, Illinois|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moctezuma went to greet Cortés with his brother, Cuitlahuac, and his nephew, Cacamatzin. Cortes strode ahead of his commanders and attempted to embrace Moctezuma, but was restrained by Cuitlahuac and Cacamatzin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cortés was not permitted to touch the emperor; no one was allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After greetings, Moctezuma personally dressed only Cortés in a priceless feather-work flower, a golden jewelry studded necklace and a garland of flowers. Moctezuma then brought Cortes to the shrine of the goddess Toci, where he gave him a more private greeting, in which he practically gave the Aztec Empire to Cortés,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as he reportedly said that it was his "desire to serve."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A fragment of the greetings of Moctezuma says: ''"My lord, you have become fatigued, you have become tired: to the land you have arrived. You have come to your city: Mexico, here you have come to sit on your place, on your throne. Oh, it has been reserved to you for a small time, it was conserved by those who have gone, your substitutes... This is what has been told by our rulers, those of whom governed this city, ruled this city. That you would come to ask for your throne, your place, that you would come here. Come to the land, come and rest: take possession of your royal houses, give food to your body."''&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|64}}&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous informants of Sahagún, Florentine Codex, book XII, chapter XVI, translation from Nahuatl by Angel Ma. Garibay&lt;/ref&gt;

Moctezuma had the royal palace of [[Axayacatl|Axayácatl]], Moctezuma's father, prepared for Cortés.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|218}} On the same day that the Spanish expedition and their allies entered Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma came to visit Cortés and his men. What happened in this second meeting remains controversial. According to several Spanish versions, some written years or decades later, Moctezuma first repeated his earlier, flowery welcome to Cortés on the Great Causeway, but then went on to explain his view of what the Spanish expedition represented in terms of Aztec tradition and lore, including the idea that Cortés and his men (pale, bearded men from the east) were the return of characters from Aztec legend.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|220–21}} At the end of this explanation, the Emperor pledged his loyalty to the King of Spain and accepted Cortés as the King's representative. According to Diaz, Moctezuma said to Cortes, "As for your great King, I am in his debt and will give him of what I possess."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|223}}

While in the Axayacatl palace, the conquistadors discovered the secret room where Moctezuma kept the treasure he had inherited from his father. The treasure consisted of a "quantity of golden objects – jewels and plates and ingots". Diaz noted, "The sight of all that wealth dumbfounded me."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|218, 242}}

Cortés later asked Moctezuma to allow him to erect a cross and an image of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] next to the two large idols of [[Huichilobos]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]], after climbing the one hundred and fourteen steps to the top of the [[Templo Mayor|main temple pyramid]], a central place for religious authority.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Elizabeth M.|date=1990|title=Review: Aztec Religion and Warfare: Past and Present Perspectives|url=|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=25 N.2|pages=248–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma and his ''papas'' were furious at the suggestion, with Moctezuma claiming his idols, "give us health and rain and crops and weather, and all the victories we desire."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|237}}

[[File:ROHM D201 The conquistadors enter tenochtitlan to the sounds of martial music.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Conquistadors and their [[Tlaxcalan]] allies enter Tenochtitlan]]
After Cortés' request surrounding the questioning of raising the cross and the image of the Virgin Mary, the Mexica then killed seven Spanish soldiers Cortés had left on the coast, including Cortes' Villa Rica Constable [[Juan de Escalante]], and many Totonacs. Cortés along with five of his captains and Doña Marina and Aguilar, convinced Moctezuma to "come quietly with us to our quarters, and make no protest...if you cry out, or raise any commotion, you will immediately be killed." Moctezuma was later implicated by [[Qualpopoca]] and his captains, who had killed the Spanish soldiers. Though these captains of Moctezuma were sentenced to be "burned to death", Moctezuma continued to remain a prisoner, fearing a "rebellion in his city" or that the Spanish may "try to set up another prince in his place." This, despite Moctezuma's chieftains, nephews and relations suggesting they should attack the Spanish.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|243–49}}

As of 14 November 1519, Moctezuma was Cortés' prisoner as insurance against any further resistance, until the end of May 1520, Moctezuma lived with Cortés in the palace of [[Axayacatl|Axayácatl]].

However, Moctezuma continued to act as Emperor, subject to Cortés' overall control.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|248}} During the period of his imprisonment, Moctezuma stated "he was glad to be a prisoner, since either our gods gave us power to confine him or [[Huichilobos]] permitted it." He would even play the game of ''[[totoloque]]'' with Cortés.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|252}} After the treason of [[Cacamatzin]], Moctezuma and his ''caciques'', were forced to take a more formal oath of allegiance to the King of Spain, though Moctezuma "could not restrain his tears".&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|265}} Moctezuma told his ''caciques'' that "their ancestral tradition, set down in their books of records, {{clarify|told?|date=October 2016}} that men would come from the direction of the sunrise to rule these lands" and that "He believed...we were these men."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|264}}

Cortés sent expeditions to investigate the Aztec sources of gold in the provinces of [[Zacatula]], [[Tuxtepec]], and the land of the [[Chinantec]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|265–69}} Moctezuma was then made to pay a tribute to the Spanish King, which included his father's treasure. These treasures, the Spaniards melted down to form gold bars stamped with an iron die.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|66–68}}&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|270–72}} Finally, Moctezuma let the Catholic conquistadors build an altar on their temple, next to the Aztec idols.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|277}}

Finally, the Aztec gods allegedly told the Mexican ''papas'', or priests, they would not stay unless the Spaniards were killed and driven back across the sea.{{clarify|into? towards?|date=October 2016}} Moctezuma warned Cortés to leave at once, as their lives were at risk.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|278–79}} Many of the nobility rallied around [[Cuitláhuac]],&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|294}} the brother of Moctezuma and his heir-apparent; however, most of them could take no overt action against the Spanish unless the order was given by the Emperor.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|247}}

==== Defeat of Narváez ====
In April 1520, Cortés was told by Moctezuma, that a much larger party of Spanish troops, consisting of nineteen ships and fourteen hundred soldiers under the command of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], had arrived. [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] had been sent by Governor Velázquez from Cuba to kill or capture Cortés, who had defied Velazquez's orders.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|281}}

Leaving his "least reliable soldiers" under the command of the headstrong [[Pedro de Alvarado]] to guard Moctezuma, Cortés set out against De Narváez, who had advanced onto Cempoala. Cortés surprised his antagonist with a night attack, during which his men wounded Narváez in the eye and took him prisoner. After Cortés permitted the defeated soldiers to settle in the country, they "passed with more or less willingness to Cortés' side." Hernán Cortés gained their support when he "promised to make them rich and give them commands [rewards]." Cortes then made a rapid return to Tenochtitlan, to relieve the besieged Alvarado and the other invaders.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|282–84}}{{clarify|from whom? what siege/battle?|date=October 2016}}

Cortés led his combined forces on an arduous trek back over the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], returning to Mexico on [[Midsummer|St. John's Day]] June 1520, with 1300 soldiers and 96 horses, plus 2000 Tlaxcalan warriors.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|284}}

==== The Aztec response ====
{{See also|Massacre in the Great Temple}}
When Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late May, he found that Alvarado and his men had attacked and killed many of the Aztec nobility in the [[Massacre in the Great Temple]], that happened during a religious festival organized by the Aztec. The Great Temple was central to the Aztec's cosmological views; the temple served as a burial ground for the offerings made to different gods, such as the gods of fertility, mountains, rain, and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagao|first=Debra|date=Winter 1990|title=Reviewed Work: The Great Temple of Tenochtitlan: Center and Periphery in the Aztec World by Johanna Broda, David Carrasco, Eduardo Matos Moctezuma|url=|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=37|pages=97–99|doi=10.2307/481953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the centrality and the importance of the Great Temple as a religious and cultural monument could potentially have influenced the decision to attack a location such as this. Alvarado's explanation to Cortés was that the Spaniards had learned that the Aztecs planned to attack the Spanish garrison in the city once the festival was complete, so he had launched a pre-emptive attack.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|286}}

Considerable doubt has been cast by different commentators on this explanation, which may have been self-serving rationalization on the part of Alvarado, who may have attacked out of fear (or greed) where no immediate threat existed.

====The Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan====
{{Main|La Noche Triste}}
[[File:The sad night.jpg|thumb|''La Noche Triste'' depicted in the 17th century]]
In any event, the population of the city rose ''en masse'' after the Spanish attack, which the Spanish did not expect.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic World|last=Egerton|first=Douglas R., et al|publisher=Harlan Davidson, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88295-245-1|location=Wheeling, Illinois|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|how? by additional Aztec warriors? From where?|date=October 2016}} Fierce fighting ensued, and the Aztec troops besieged the palace housing the Spaniards and Moctezuma. Alvarado and the rest of the Spanish were held hostage by the Aztecs for a month.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The nobility of Tenochtitlan chose [[Cuitláhuac]] as [[Huey Tlatoani]] (Emperor). Cortés ordered Moctezuma to speak to his people from a palace balcony and persuade them to let the Spanish return to the coast in peace. Moctezuma was jeered and stones were thrown at him, mortally wounding Moctezuma.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|287–94}} Aztec sources state the Spaniards killed him.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|90}}

Cortés had formed an alliance with Tlaxcala. This alliance had many victories, including the overtaking of the Aztec Capital [[Tenochtitlan]]. Their capital was used as a cosmic center, where they fed [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifices]] to the gods through both human bodies and bloodletting. The capital was also used for central and imperialistic governmental control. Preparations for war began in their capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memories of Conquest: Becoming Mexicano in Colonial Guatemala|last=Matthew|first=Laura E.|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4696-0179-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish and their allies, including the Tlaxcala, had to flee the central city, as the people of Tenochtitlan had risen against them. The Spanish's situation could only deteriorate. Because the Aztecs had removed the bridges over the gaps in the causeways that linked the city to the surrounding lands, Cortés' men constructed a portable bridge to cross the water of the lake. On the rainy night of 10 July 1520, the Spaniards and their allies set out for the mainland via the causeway to [[Tlacopan]]. They placed the portable bridge in the first gap, but at that moment their movement was detected and Aztec forces attacked, both along the causeway and by means of canoes on the lake. The Spanish were thus caught on a narrow road with water or buildings on both sides.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|297–99, 305}}

The retreat quickly turned into a rout. The Spanish discovered that they could not remove their portable bridge unit from the first gap, and so had no choice but to leave it behind. The bulk of the Spanish infantry, left behind by Cortés and the other horsemen, had to cut their way through the masses of Aztec warriors opposing them. Many of the Spaniards, weighed down by their armor and booty, drowned in the causeway gaps or were killed by the Aztecs. Much of the wealth the Spaniards had acquired in Tenochtitlan was lost. The bridge was later called "Alvarado's Leap".&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|299–300, 306}}

The channel is now a street in Mexico City, called "[[Puente de Alvarado]]" (Alvarado's Bridge), because it seemed Alvarado escaped across an invisible bridge. (He may have been walking on the bodies of those soldiers and attackers who had preceded him, given the shallowness of the lake.){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

It is said that Cortés, upon reaching the mainland at Tlacopan, wept over their losses. This episode is called "[[La Noche Triste]]" (The Night of Sorrows), and the old tree ("El árbol de la noche triste") where Cortés allegedly cried, is still a monument in Mexico City.

The Aztecs pursued and harassed the Spanish, who, guided by their Tlaxcalan allies, moved around Lake [[Zumpango]] towards a sanctuary in Tlaxcala. On July 14, 1520, the Aztecs attempted to destroy the Spanish for good at the [[Battle of Otumba]]. Although hard-pressed, the Spanish infantry was able to hold off the overwhelming numbers of enemy warriors, while the Spanish cavalry under the leadership of Cortés charged through the enemy ranks again and again. When Cortés and his men killed one of the Aztec leaders, the Aztecs broke off the battle and left the field.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|303–05}}

In this retreat, the Spaniards suffered heavy casualties, losing 860 soldiers, 72 other Spanish members of Cortes' group, including five women, and a thousand Tlaxcalan warriors. Several Aztec noblemen loyal to Cortés, including [[Cacamatzin]], and their families also perished, including Moctezuma's son and two daughters.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|302, 305–06}}

==== Spaniards find refuge in Tlaxcala ====
[[File:Temalacatitlan - batalla de Otumba.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'', showing a battle of Otumba.]]
The Spanish were able to complete their escape to Tlaxcala. There, they were given assistance, since all 440 of them were wounded, with only 20 horses left. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder and Chichimecatecle told Cortés's men: "Consider yourselves at home. Rest...do not think it a small thing that you have escaped with your lives from that strong city...if we thought of you as brave men before, we consider you much braver now."&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|306–07}}

Cortés got reinforcements when the [[Panuco River]] settlement was abandoned, and supply ships arrived from Cuba and Spain. Cortés also had built 13 brigantines then had them mounted with cannons, turning [[Lake Texcoco]] into a strategic body of water to assault Tenochtitlan. Xicotencatl the Younger, however, sought an alliance with the Mexicans, but was opposed.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|309–11}}

Cortés sent Diego de Ordaz, and the remnants of Navarez's men, on a ship to Spain, and [[Alonso de Ávila]] on a ship to [[Santo Domingo]] to represent his case in the Royal Courts.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|311}}

Cortés was able to pacify the country, after the indigenous realized the Spaniards put "an end to the rape and robbery that the Mexicans practised." Finally, Xicotencatl the Elder, baptized as Don Lorenzo de Vargas, agreed to support Cortés's expedition against [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. According to Bernal Diaz, he sent more than ten thousand warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle as Cortés marched on the day after Christmas 1520.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|309, 311–12}}

==== Siege and fall of Tenochtitlan ====
{{Main|Fall of Tenochtitlan#Siege of Tenochtitlan}}
[[File:LastDaysofTenochtitlanB.jpg|thumb|left|250px|left|"The Last Days of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Conquest of Mexico]] by Cortez", a 19th-century painting by [[William de Leftwich Dodge]].]]
The Aztecs were struck by a smallpox plague starting in September 1520, which lasted seventy days. Many were killed, including their new leader, the Emperor Cuitlahuac.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|92–93}}

The joint forces of Tlaxcala and Cortés proved to be formidable. One by one they took over most of the cities under Aztec control, some in battle, others by diplomacy. In the end, only Tenochtitlan and the neighboring city of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] remained unconquered or not allied with the Spaniards.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|326–52}}

Cortés then approached Tenochtitlan and mounted a siege of the city that involved cutting the causeways from the mainland and controlling the lake with armed [[brigantine]]s constructed by the Spanish and transported overland to the lake. The [[Siege of Tenochtitlan]] lasted eight months. The besiegers cut off the supply of food and destroyed the aqueduct carrying water to the city.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|359, 368}}

Despite the stubborn Aztec resistance organized by their new emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], the cousin of Moctezuma II, Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco fell on 13 August 1521, during which the Emperor was captured trying to escape the city in a canoe. The siege of the city and its defense had both been brutal. Largely because he wanted to present the city to his king and emperor, Cortés had made several attempts to end the siege through diplomacy, but all offers were rejected. During the battle, the defenders cut the beating hearts from seventy Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli, an act that infuriated the Spaniards.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|386–87, 391, 401–03}}

Cortés then ordered the idols of the Aztec gods in the temples to be taken down and replaced with icons of Christianity. He also announced that the temple would never again be used for human sacrifice. Human sacrifice and reports of cannibalism, common among the natives of the Aztec Empire, had been a major reason motivating Cortés and encouraging his soldiers to avoid surrender while fighting to the death.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;

Tenochtitlan had been almost totally destroyed using the manpower of the Tlaxcalans plus fire and cannon fire during the siege, and once it finally fell, the Spanish continued its destruction, as they soon began to establish the foundations of what would become [[History of Mexico City|Mexico City]] on the site. The surviving Aztec people were forbidden to live in Tenochtitlan and the surrounding isles, and were banished to live in Tlatelolco.

==Further Spanish Wars of Conquest ==
===Michoacan===
{{Main|Tarascan state|Tangaxuan II}}
[[File:Aztec Indians Mexico Tlaxcalan Cortez.jpg|thumb|[[Nuño de Guzmán]], a rival of [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]], led Spanish soldiers with [[Tlaxcala]]n allies in the conquest of Michoacan.]]
After hearing about the fall of the [[Aztec Empire]], Tarascan ruler (''Cazonci'') [[Tangaxuan II]] sent emissaries to the Spanish victors (the [[Tarascan state]] was contemporary with and an enemy of the [[Aztec Empire]]). A few Spaniards went with them to [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] where they were presented to the ruler and gifts were exchanged. They returned with samples of gold and Cortés' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened.

In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of [[Cristobal de Olid]] was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Gorenstein (1993, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt; Tangáxuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cortés and Tangáxuan considered themselves rulers of Michoacán for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both.

[[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]], then president of the first Audiencia decided, to march on northwestern Mexico with a force of 5,000–8,000 men in search for new populations to subdue, and when he arrived in [[Michoacán]] and found out that Tangaxuan was still ''de facto'' ruler of his empire he allied himself with a Tarascan noble Don Pedro Panza ''Cuinierángari'' against the ''Cazonci''. The ''Cazonci'' was tried with plotting a rebellion, withholding tribute, sodomy and heresy, and he was tortured and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Gorenstein (1993, xv).  According to some other sources Tangaxuan II was dragged behind a horse and then burned.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were thrown into the [[Lerma river]]. A period of violence and turbulence began. During the next decades, Tarascan puppet rulers were installed by the Spanish government.

===Conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula===
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Yucatán}}
The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] took almost 170 years. The whole process could have taken longer were it not for three separate [[epidemics]] that took a heavy toll on the Native Americans, causing the population to fall by half and weakening the traditional social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Marguerite Farriss|authorlink=Nancy Farriss|title=Maya Society Under Colonial Rule: The Collective Enterprise of Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yB10CFN-2bcC&amp;pg=PA58|year=1984|publisher=Princeton UP|pages=58–59|isbn=0691101582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chichimec Wars===
{{Main|Chichimeca War|Mixton War}}
[[File:Pedro de alvarado telleriano remensis.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pedro de Alvarado]]'s death in 1541, depicted in the indigenous [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]]. The glyph to the right of his head represents his [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name, ''Tonatiuh'' ("Sun").]]
After the Spanish conquest of central Mexico, expeditions were sent further northward in Mesoamerica, to the region known as [[La Gran Chichimeca]]. The expeditions under [[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] were particularly harsh on the [[Chichimeca]] population, causing them to rebel under the leadership of [[Tenamaxtli]] and thus launch the '''[[Mixton War]]'''.

In 1540, the Chichimecas fortified [[Mixtón]], [[Nochistlán]], and other mountain towns then besieged the Spanish settlement in [[Guadalajara]]. The famous conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]], coming to the aid of acting governor [[Cristóbal de Oñate]], led an attack on Nochistlán. However, the Chichimecas counter-attacked and Alvarado's forces were routed. Under the leadership of Viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the Spanish forces and their Indian allies ultimately succeeded in recapturing the towns and suppressing resistance. However, fighting did not completely come to a halt in the ensuing years.

In 1546, Spanish authorities discovered silver in the [[Zacatecas]] region and established mining settlements in Chichimeca territory which altered the terrain and the Chichimeca traditional way of life. The Chichimeca resisted the intrusions on their ancestral lands by attacking travelers and merchants along the "silver roads." The ensuing [[Chichimeca War]] (1550–1590) would become the longest and costliest conflict between Spanish forces and indigenous peoples in the Americas. The attacks intensified with each passing year. In 1554, the Chichimecas inflicted a great loss upon the Spanish when they attacked a train of sixty wagons and captured more than 30,000 pesos worth of valuables. By the 1580s, thousands had died and Spanish mining settlements in Chichimeca territory were continually under threat. In 1585, Don Alvaro Manrique de Zúñiga, Marquis of Villamanrique, was appointed viceroy. The viceroy was infuriated when he learned that some Spanish soldiers had begun supplementing their incomes by raiding the villages of peaceful Indians in order to sell them into slavery. With no military end to the conflict in sight, he was determined to restore peace to that region and launched a full-scale peace offensive by negotiating with Chichimeca leaders and providing them with lands, agricultural supplies, and other goods. This policy of "peace by purchase" finally brought an end to the Chichimeca War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somosprimos.com/schmal/schmal.htm |title=John P.

==The Aztecs under Spanish rule==
{{Main|History of New Spain|Nahuas#Colonial_Period_1521-1821}}
The [[Council of the Indies]] was constituted in 1524 and the first [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in 1527. In 1535, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (who was as the King of Spain known as Charles I), named the Spanish nobleman Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] the first Viceroy of [[New Spain]]. Mendoza was entirely loyal to the Spanish crown, unlike the conqueror of Mexico [[Hernán Cortés]], who had demonstrated that he was independent-minded and defied official orders when he threw off the authority of Governor Velázquez in Cuba. The name "[[New Spain]]" had been suggested by Cortés and was later confirmed officially by Mendoza.

The Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites, tribute paying commoners, and land holding and other economic structures largely intact. Two key works by historian [[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'', New Haven: Yale University Press 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and his monograph ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519–1810'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson]], ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico'', 1519–1810, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; were central in reshaping the historiography of the indigenous and their communities from the Spanish Conquest to the 1810 Mexican independence era.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Benjamin Keen in ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' Vol. 45, No. 3 (Aug. 1965), pp. 477–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars who were part of a branch of [[Mesoamerican]] [[ethnohistory]], more recently called the [[New Philology]] have, using indigenous texts in the indigenous languages, been able to examine in considerable detail how the indigenous lived during the era of Spanish colonial rule. A major work that utilizes colonial-era indigenous texts as its main source is [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]]'s ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.''&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology,'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to understanding how considerable continuity of pre-Conquest indigenous structures was possible was the Spanish colonial utilization of the indigenous nobility. In the colonial era, the indigenous nobility were largely recognized as nobles by the Spanish colonial regime, with privileges including the noble Spanish title ''don'' for noblemen and ''doña'' for noblewomen. To this day, the title of Duke of Moctezuma is held by a Spanish noble family. A few of the indigenous nobility learned Spanish. Spanish friars taught indigenous tribes to write their own languages in Latin letters, which soon became a self-perpetuating tradition at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Karttunen]], "Aztec Literacy," in George A. Coller et al., eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', pp. 395–417. New York: Academic Press 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Their surviving writings are crucial in our knowledge of colonial era [[Nahuas]].

The first [[mendicants]] in central Mexico, particularly the Franciscans and Dominicans learned the indigenous language of [[Nahuatl]], in order to evangelize to the indigenous people in their native tongue. Early mendicants created texts in order to forward the project of Christianization. Particularly important were the 1571 Spanish-Nahuatl dictionary compiled by the Franciscan Fray [[Alonso de Molina]],&lt;ref&gt;Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Vocabulario en lengua cstellana y mexicana y mexcana y castellana''(1571), Mexico: Editorial Porrúa, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1569 bilingual Nahuatl-Spanish confessional manual for priests.&lt;ref&gt;Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Confessionario mayor en la lengua castellana y mexicana'' (1569), With an introduction by Roberto Moreno. Mexico: Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicos, Instituto de Investigaciones Históricos, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.&lt;/ref&gt; A major project by the Franciscans in Mexico was the compilation of knowledge on Nahua religious beliefs and culture that friar [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] oversaw using indigenous informants, resulting in a number of important texts and culminating in a 12 volume text, ''The General History of the Things of New Spain'' published in English as the [[Florentine Codex]]. The Spanish crown via the [[Council of the Indies]] and the Franciscan order in the late sixteenth century became increasingly hostile to works in the indigenous languages written by priests and clerics, concerned that they were heretical and an impediment to the Indians' true conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Evolution of the Historia General" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'', ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 13, part 2, Howard F. Cline, volume editor, Austin: University of Texas Pres, 1973 p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reward Spaniards who participated in the conquest of what is now contemporary Mexico, the Spanish crown authorized grants of native labor, in particular the assignment of entire indigenous communities to labor via the [[Encomienda]] system. The indigenous were not slaves under this system, chattel bought and sold or removed from their home community, but the system was still one of forced labor. The indigenous people of Central Mexico had practices rendering labor and tribute products to their polity's elites and those elites to the Mexica overlords in Tenochtitlan, so the Spanish system of encomienda was built on pre-existing patterns of labor service.

The Spanish conquerors in Mexico during the early colonial era lived off the labor of the indigenous peoples. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the native peoples, Bishop [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] suggested importing black slaves to replace them. Las Casas later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn 1997: 136; Friede 1971: 165–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Calle 69 n53 -Av.6, Venustiano Carranza, Federal District, Mexico08.jpg|thumb|left|Evangelization of Mexico]]
The other discovery that perpetuated this system of indigenous forced labor were the extensive silver mines discovered at [[Potosí|Potosi]], in Higher Peru (now Bolivia) and other places in the Spanish empire in the New World that were worked for hundreds of years by forced native labor and contributed most of the wealth that flowed to Spain.

According to West, "slavery was a well-established institution among the Aztecs and their neighbors." "During the Conquest, Spaniards legally enslaved large numbers of natives – men, women and children – as booty of warfare, branding each individual on the cheek." In fact, "Cortes owned several hundred, used mainly in [[placer mining|gold placering]]." Indian slavery was abolished in 1542 but persisted until the 1550s.&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Robert. Early Silver Mining in New Spain, 1531–1555|editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum, Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain spent enormous amounts of this wealth hiring mercenaries to fight the [[Protestant Reformation]] and to halt the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Turkish invasions of Europe]]. The silver was used to purchase commercial goods abroad, as European manufactured goods were not in demand in Asia and the Middle East. The [[Manila Galleon]] brought in far more silver direct from South American mines to China than the overland Silk Road, or even European trade routes in the Indian Ocean could.

The Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education. Even some foods associated with Mesoamerican religious practice, such as [[amaranth]], were forbidden.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered American ports. They were joined by 450,000 in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |title= The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America |first= James |last= Axtell |journal= Humanities |date= September–October 1991 |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 12–18 |accessdate= 8 October 2008|postscript= . |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517052031/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the English-speaking colonists of North America, the majority of the Spanish colonists were single men who married or made concubines of the natives,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and were even encouraged to do so by [[Isabella of Castille|Queen Isabella]] during the earliest days of colonization. As a result of these unions, as well as concubinage {{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and secret mistresses, mixed race individuals known as [[mestizo]]s became the majority of the Mexican population in the centuries following the Spanish conquest.

==Cultural depictions of the Aztecs==
[[File:Lorenzo Ferrero - Scene from the opera La Conquista.jpg|thumb|230px|Scene from the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'', 2005]]
The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire is the subject of an opera, ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'' (2005) and of a set of six symphonic poems, ''[[La Nueva España (composition)|La Nueva España]]'' (1992–99) by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]].

Cortés's conquest has been depicted in numerous television documentaries. These include in an episode of [[Engineering an Empire]] as well as in the [[BBC]] series [[Heroes and Villains (TV series)|Heroes and Villains]], with Cortés being portrayed by [[Brian McCardie]].

[[Captain from Castile]] (1947) is about early Cortés and the Aztec.

The expedition was also partially included in the animated film [[The Road to El Dorado]] as the main characters Tulio and Miguel end up as stowaways on Hernán Cortés' fleet to Mexico. Here, Cortés is represented as a merciless and ambitious villain, leading a quest to find ''[[El Dorado]]'', the legendary city of gold in the New World. Hernán Cortés is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].

The aftermath of the Spanish conquest, including the Aztecs' struggle to preserve their cultural identity, is the subject of the Mexican feature film, [[The Other Conquest]], directed by [[Salvador Carrasco]].

Historian [[Daniele Bolelli]] did an in-depth coverage of the Spanish conquest over four episodes of his "History on Fire" podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/2017/5/25/episode-20-the-conquest-of-mexico-part-1-people-of-the-sun | title=The Conquest of Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{technical|date=October 2012}}
'''Spatial–temporal reasoning''' is an area of [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] which draws from the fields of [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. The theoretic goal—on the cognitive side—involves representing and reasoning spatial-temporal knowledge in mind. The applied goal—on the computing side—involves developing high-level control systems of robots for navigating and understanding time and space. 

== Influence from cognitive psychology ==
A convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. Internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows: (1) the connection relation is primitive; (2) an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation: you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides; (3) a distance relation is connection relations using a third object: you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as an object with the maximum extension of one meter can be connected with you and me simultaneously. 

== Fragmentary representations of temporal calculi ==
Without addressing internal relations among spatial relations, AI researchers contributed many fragmentary representations. Examples of temporal calculi include [[Allen's interval algebra]], and Vilain's &amp; Kautz's [[point algebra]]. The most prominent spatial calculi are [[Mereotopology|mereotopological calculi]], [[Andrew U. Frank|Frank]]'s [[cardinal direction calculus]], Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's [[9-intersection calculus|4- and 9-intersection calculi]], Ligozat's [[flip-flop calculus]], various [[region connection calculus|region connection calculi]] (RCC), and the [[Oriented Point Relation Algebra]]. Recently, spatio-temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information. For example, the [[spatiotemporal constraint calculus]] (STCC) by Gerevini and Nebel combines Allen's interval algebra with RCC-8. Moreover, the [[qualitative trajectory calculus]] (QTC) allows for reasoning about moving objects.

== Quantitative abstraction ==
An emphasis in the literature has been on [[Qualitative reasoning|qualitative]] spatial-temporal reasoning which is based on qualitative abstractions of temporal and spatial aspects of the common-sense background knowledge on which our human perspective of physical reality is based.  Methodologically, qualitative [[Constraint satisfaction|constraint]] calculi restrict the vocabulary of rich mathematical theories dealing with temporal or spatial entities such that specific aspects of these theories can be treated within [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] fragments with simple qualitative (non-[[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]) languages. Contrary to mathematical or physical theories about space and time, qualitative constraint calculi allow for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space and time.  For this reason, the limited expressiveness of qualitative representation formalism calculi is a benefit if such reasoning tasks need to be integrated in applications.  For example, some of these calculi may be implemented for handling spatial [[Geographic information system|GIS]] queries efficiently and some may be used for navigating, and communicating with, a mobile [[robot]].

== Relation algebra ==
Most of these calculi can be formalized as abstract [[relation algebra]]s, such that reasoning can be carried out at a symbolic level. For computing solutions of a [[constraint network]], the [[Local consistency#Path_consistency|path-consistency algorithm]] is an important tool.

== Software ==

The '''Supreme Council of Antiquities''' ('''SCA''') was a department within the [[Egypt]]ian [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]] from 1994 until January 2011, when it became an independent ministry, the [[Ministry of State for Antiquities]] (MSA).&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA History|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/sca_history.htm|website=Supreme Council of Antiquities|accessdate=23 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017043511/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SCA_History.htm|archivedate=17 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the government body responsible for the conservation, protection and regulation of all antiquities and archaeological excavations in [[Egypt]].

The SCA's origins go back to 1859, when the Department of Antiquities was established. In 1971, it was renamed the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Egyptian Antiquities Organization|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/21-2/The%20Egyptian.pdf|website=Penn Museum|accessdate=25 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907035955/http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/21-2/The%20Egyptian.pdf|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally renamed the Supreme Council of Antiquities by Presidential Decree No. 82 of [[Hosni Mubarak]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==SCA functions==
The SCA was responsible for defining the boundaries around archaeological sites and was also the only agent permitted to restore or preserve Egyptian monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/938//eg7.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Egypt &amp;#124; Hands off, and we mean it|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215234123/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/938/eg7.htm|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign archaeologists working in Egypt were required to report all discoveries and finds to the SCA before publication, a somewhat controversial rule that led to the expulsion of some archaeologists from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/931/he1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Heritage &amp;#124; Artefacts on show in nightclub|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129015105/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/931/he1.htm|archivedate=29 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement although controversial has reduced theft of archaeological finds dramatically and  allows authorities to plan security around new finds that would not be possible any other way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The SCA also oversaw the recovery of antiquities either stolen or illegally exported from Egypt, and between 2002 and 2008 retrieved 3,000 artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/904/he1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Heritage &amp;#124; Wrapping up smuggled goods|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|date=9 July 2008|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206161619/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/904/he1.htm|archivedate=6 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently embroiled in a dispute with the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] over the [[bust of Nefertiti]], which it claims was removed from the country by deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/646/her1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Heritage &amp;#124; Dig Days Tampering with Nefertiti|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|date=16 July 2003|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018112921/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/646/her1.htm|archivedate=18 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it has asked for the return of the [[Rosetta Stone]] from the [[British Museum]] and the [[Dendera zodiac|Dendara Zodiac]] from the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Egypt &amp;#124; Antiquities wish list|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|date=20 July 2005|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916194918/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm|archivedate=16 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early history "[[Gaston Maspero]] served as Director General of the Excavations and Antiquities of Egypt and his big achievement was his examination of the mummy of [[Ramses II]], found in 1884, in the presence of the khédive and other high dignitaries. The mummy of this great conqueror was well preserved, revealing a giant frame and a face expressive of sovereign majesty, indomitable will, and the pride of the Egyptian king of kings. He then unbandaged the mummy of Nofritari, wife of King Ahmosis I. of the eighteenth dynasty, beside which, in the same sarcophagus, had been discovered the mummy of [[Ramses III]]. The physiognomy of this monarch is more refined and intellectual than that of his warlike predecessor; nor was his frame built upon the same colossal plan. The height of the body was less, and the shoulders not so wide. In the same season Maspero also discovered an ancient Egyptian romance inscribed on limestone near the tomb of Sinûhît at Thebes. A fragment on papyrus had been preserved at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, but the whole romance was now decipherable."&lt;ref name="HistoryofEgypt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappoport|first1=S.|title=History Of Egypt From 330 B.C. To The Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12)|publisher=The Grolier Society Publishers, London|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17332/17332-h/17332-h.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095932/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17332/17332-h/17332-h.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Professor Maspero resigned his office of directorship on June 5, 1886, and was succeeded in the superintendency of excavations and Egyptian archeology by [[M. Eugene Grébault]]. In the same month Grébault started upon the work of unbandaging the mummy of the Theban King Sekenenra Ta-aken, of the eighteenth dynasty. It was under this monarch that a revolt against the Hyksôs, or Shepherd Kings, had originated, in the course of which the Asiatics were expelled from Egypt. The history of this king has always been considered legendary, but from the signs of wounds present in the mummy, it is certain that he had died in battle. In the same season the mummy of Seti I. was unbandaged, and also that of an anonymous prince."&lt;ref name="HistoryofEgypt" /&gt;

"The next season the work of clearing away the sand from around [[the Great Sphinx]] was vigorously prosecuted by Grébault. In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thûtmosis IV. was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx."&lt;ref name="HistoryofEgypt" /&gt; 

More than 100 years later, Sayed Tawfik was an Egyptologist who served from 1989&amp;ndash;1990, when the body was called the '''Egyptian Antiquities Organization'''. &lt;ref name="Tawfik"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sayed Tawfik, 54, Dies; Archeologist of Egypt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/24/obituaries/sayed-tawfik-54-dies-archeologist-of-egypt.html|accessdate=25 October 2016|agency=New York Times|date=December 24, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026081816/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/24/obituaries/sayed-tawfik-54-dies-archeologist-of-egypt.html|archivedate=26 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who directed it when its official name was '''Supreme Council of Antiquities''' are [[Zahi Hawass]] (2002&amp;ndash;2011), [[Mohamed Abdel Fattah (archaeologist)|Mohamed Abdel Fattah]] (July–September 2011)&lt;ref name="artclair 88038"/&gt; and [[Moustapha Amine]] (29 September 2011&amp;ndash;2013).&lt;ref name="artclair 89656"/&gt;

'''Swabian''' ({{Audio|Schwäbisch.ogg|''Schwäbisch''}}) is one of the dialect groups of [[Alemannic German]] that belong to the [[High German languages|High German]] dialect continuum. It is spoken in [[Swabia]], which covers much of  the southwestern German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], including its capital, [[Stuttgart]]. It is also spoken in the rural area known as the [[Swabian Alb]], and in the southwest of [[Bavarian Swabia]]. Swabian is also nominally spoken by the [[Danube Swabian]] population of [[Hungary]], the former [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]] and by the [[Caucasus Germans]].

== Description ==
Swabian is difficult to understand for speakers of [[Standard German]], not just because of its pronunciation but because it contains vocabulary that differs from Standard German. For example, "strawberry jam" in Standard German is ''Erdbeermarmelade'' while in Swabian it is ''Bräschdlingsgsälz''.&lt;ref name=cont/&gt;

In 2009, the word "[[Muggeseggele]]" (a Swabian [[idiom]]), meaning the [[scrotum]] of a [[housefly]], was voted in a readers' survey by [[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]], the largest newspaper in [[Stuttgart]], as ''the most beautiful Swabian word'', well ahead of any other term.&lt;ref name=cont&gt;[http://content.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/stn/page/1968288_0_9223_schoenstes-schwaebisches-wort-grosser-vorsprung-fuer-schwabens-kleinste-einheit.html Schönstes schwäbisches Wort,  Großer Vorsprung für Schwabens kleinste Einheit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927133628/http://content.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/stn/page/1968288_0_9223_schoenstes-schwaebisches-wort-grosser-vorsprung-fuer-schwabens-kleinste-einheit.html |date=2013-09-27 }}, Jan Sellner 09.03.2009, [[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression is used in an ironic way to describe a small unit of measure and is deemed appropriate to use in front of small children (compare [[Schupfnudel#Regional terms|Bubenspitzle]]). German broadcaster [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]'s children's website, ''Kindernetz'', explained the meaning of Muggeseggele in their ''Swabian dictionary'' in the Swabian-based TV series [[Ein Fall für B.A.R.Z.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindernetz.de/barz/infos/lexikon/-/id=64520/1navg22/ Swabian dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603160604/http://www.kindernetz.de/barz/infos/lexikon/-/id=64520/1navg22/ |date=2015-06-03 }} at website of [[Südwestrundfunk]] [[Ein Fall für B.A.R.Z.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
* The ending "-ad" is used for verbs in the first person plural. (For example, "we go" is ''mir gangad'' instead of Standard German's ''wir gehen''.)
* As in other [[Alemannic dialects]], the pronunciation of "s" before "t" and "p" is {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (For example, ''Fest'' ("party"), is pronounced as ''Feschd''.)
* The [[voice-onset time]] for [[plosive]]s is about halfway between where it would be expected for a clear contrast between voiced and unvoiced-aspirated stops. This difference is most noticeable on the unvoiced stops, rendering them extremely similar to or indistinguishable from voiced stops:

* One simple thing to look for is the addition of the diminutive "-le" suffix on many words in the German language. With the addition of this "-le" (pronounced {{IPA|/lə/}}), the [[Article (grammar)|article]] of the noun automatically becomes "das" in the [[German language]], as in [[Standard German]]. The Swabian "-le" is the same as standard German "-lein" or "-chen", but is used, arguably, more often in Swabian. A small house (German: Haus) is a ''Häuschen'' in Standard German, a ''Heisle'' in Swabian. In some regions "-la" for plural is used. (For example, ''Heisle'' may become ''Heisla'', ''Spätzle''  becomes ''Spätzla''.) Many surnames in Swabia are also made to end in "-le".

* Articles (der, die and das) are often pronounced as "dr", "d" and "s" ("s Haus" instead of "das Haus").

In many regions, the Swabian dialect is spoken with a unique [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] that is also present when Swabian native speakers talk in Standard German. Similarly, there is only one alveolar fricative phoneme {{IPA|/s/}}, a feature that is shared with most other southern dialects. Most Swabian speakers are unaware of the difference between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} and do not attempt to make it when speaking Standard German.

The voiced plosives, the post-alveolar fricative, and the frequent use of diminutives based on "l" suffixes gives the dialect a very "soft" or "mild" feel, often felt to be in sharp contrast to the harder varieties of German spoken in the North.

== Classification and variation ==
Swabian is categorized as an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect, which in turn is one of the two types of [[Upper German]] dialects (the other being [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]]). The [[ISO 639-3]] language code for Swabian is '''swg'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=swg Code for Swabian German (swg)]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wirkoennenalles.jpg|thumb|250px|A sticker that translates as: "We can do everything. Except [speak] [[standard German]]."]]

The Swabian dialect is composed of numerous sub-dialects, each of which has its own variations. These sub-dialects can be categorized by the difference in the formation of the past participle of 'sein' (to be) into ''gwäa'' and ''gsei.'' The Gsei group is nearer to other [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]], such as [[Swiss German]]. It can be divided into '''South-East Swabian''', '''West Swabian''' and '''Central Swabian'''.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Cecil A. M. (1983). ''Modern German dialects'' New York [u.a.], Lang, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition in mass media ==
[[File:D Kuhn 2012 8tiesbaby.jpg|thumb|D Kuhn 2012 8tiesbaby|Dominik Kuhn (2012)]]
The [[Baden-Württemberg]] [[chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] launched an advertising campaign with the slogan "Wir können alles. Außer Hochdeutsch." which means "We can [do] everything. Except [speak] Standard German" to boost Swabian pride for their dialect and industrial achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/Werbe-_und_Sympathiekampagne/124658.html Baden-Württemberg Chamber of Commerce] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110141009/http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/Werbe-_und_Sympathiekampagne/124658.html |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it failed to impress Northern Germans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/diskriminiteer-dialekt-armes-sueddeutsch-12724816.html Diskriminiteer Dialekt Armes Süddeutsch] FAZ 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and neighboring Baden.

Around seven '''Tanzanian sign languages''' were developed independently among deaf students in separate [[Tanzania]]n schools for the deaf starting in 1963, though use of several are forbidden by their schools. In 1984, a standardized Tanzanian Sign Language was proposed by the Tanzania Association for the Deaf, using common or similar signs where these exist in the schools which allowed research, but it has not been officially implemented, and there remains little influence between the languages. A dictionary has been produced.&lt;ref name="Muzale"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common Swahili name in Tanzania for these languages is ''Lugha ya Alama''. (The name ''Lugha ya Bubu'' is also used, but is reported by ''Ethnologue'' to be pejorative.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7438">[[File:Lefort.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Lefort, a member of the Synod]]
'''The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters'''&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;The group is also known by various similarly-phrased titles.&lt;/ref&gt; (1692&lt;ref name="Bushkovitch16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushkovitch|1990 |p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 1725)&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Robert K. Massie says, "The Drunken Synod, created when Peter was eighteen, continued its tipsy existence until the end of the Tsar's reign[.]" {{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |p=120}}&lt;br&gt;Peter died in 1725. {{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |p=845}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a club founded by [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]]. The group included many of Peter's closest friends, and its activities centered mostly around drinking and partying. The group was not without controversies; some of its parodies against the Church in particular were heavily criticized.

==The Jolly Company==
As a teenager and young adult, [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]] had a large group of friends and followers. Some were childhood friends who had been with him since throughout his stay at Preobrazhenskoye or before, such as [[Nikita Zotov]] and [[Fyodor Romodanovsky]]; others were older patriotic men from respected families, such as Prince [[Michael Cherkassky]], Prince [[Peter Prozorovsky]] and [[Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin|Fedor Golovin]]; and some others were foreigners like [[Patrick Gordon]] and [[Franz Lefort]] whose company Peter enjoyed. Together, the "cohesive group" often wandered the countryside and interrupted noblemen, asking for food and shelter for the night. Known as the "Jolly Company", there were anywhere from 80 to 200 followers within the "Company". In addition to the vast varieties of food, games, and events at the parties the "Jolly Company" held, there were also substantial amounts of [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref name="Massie117-118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, the Jolly Company held more and more parties within Moscow itself, often within the home of [[Franz Lefort]]. Lefort, however, had limited funds, and he could not often afford to host the Tsar. To assist Lefort, Peter first built Lefort a large dining hall, and when that grew to be too small, he built him a fully furnished stone mansion with a banquet hall that could hold 1,500 men. The hall would become "a kind of [[wikt:clubhouse|clubhouse]]" for the Jolly Company, even when Peter or Lefort were absent.&lt;ref name="Massie118-119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Transformation into the "Synod"==
The Jolly Company slowly "proceeded to more organized buffoonery and masquerades" as Peter gave many of the men titles that they addressed each other by, often for ridiculous reasons. For example, a boyar named Ivan Buturlin was forever known as "The Polish King" because he played the enemy in a mock battle at Preobrazhenskoye, while Fyodor Romodanovsky was first known as "King of Pressburg" and then as "Prince-Caesar". Many years later, Peter would address Romodanovsky as "Your Majesty" and even presented him as the Tsar to defeated military opponents.&lt;ref name=Massie119&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jolly Company eventually formed a group known as The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters, which had a "Prince-Pope", a college of cardinals, bishops, archimandrites, priests and deacons. Deacon Peter created several rituals, ceremonies, and commandments for the group, which involved primarily heavy drinking requirements,&lt;ref name="Massie119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the leader of the group, despite his lowly title.&lt;ref name="Cherniavsky34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherniavsky|1966 |p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group ended up including ''every'' man of power within the Tsar's government,&lt;ref name="Cherniavsky34" /&gt; and even real clergymen as well.&lt;ref name="Obolonskiĭ46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Obolonskiĭ|Ostrom|2003 |p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1695, just three years after the election of [[Nikita Zotov]] as "Prince-Pope", Peter refused to partake in a traditional Russian Orthodox ceremony of having holy water sprinkled over his head during the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany Ceremony]].&lt;ref name="Bushkovitch15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushkovitch|1990 |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Peter and the Synod celebrated their own version of the Russian folk custom of ''[[sviatki]]'', with partying, drinking, and even eroticism. Peter even specifically designed Zotov's election and the celebration to conflict with the traditional Church celebration.&lt;ref name="Bushkovitch16" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Mocking of the Church==
Peter's creation of this group was not without controversy, both at the time and in the eyes of historians. Peter formed the Drunken Synod when he was just eighteen and let it continue until the end of his life. The mock-Synod angered many [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Russians]]; many even believed because of it that Peter was the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Massie120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert K. Massie]] says that this quickly changed after "Peter quickly steered the parody to a safer mimicry of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]", which did not bother as many Russians.&lt;ref name="Massie121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massie|1981 |p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Milner-Gulland]] notes that the Synod has been seen in various lights&amp;nbsp;– as an imitation of [[Hellfire Club]]s, a physical manifestation of Peter's drive at modernizing Russia or of Peter's partial seizures, or simply as a way for Peter and his friends to enjoy themselves.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milner-Gulland|1997 |p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Torah Project''' is an annotated and illustrated [[Limited edition books|limited edition]] volume containing the Five Books of Moses. The project began in 2013, initiated by book publisher ACC Arte Scritta, and the handcrafted book was published in Italy in 2017.  Each copy includes a handwritten blessing by [[Pope Francis]].

==History==

At the end of 2013, Ricardo De La Fuente and Maria Cecilia Braschi, the founders of ACC Arte Scritta, came up with the idea, at the [[Guadalajara International Book Fair]], to create an illustrated edition of the [[Torah]] called 'The Torah Project', which would contain creative, and inspirational artworks of [[Jewish culture]].&lt;ref name=jewishjournal/&gt; Mexican Jewish art collector Dan Tartakovsky was the patron of the project, and he recruited the Cuban-American Jewish artist Baruj Salinas to illustrate the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Moreno | first =Sarah | title =Miami artist creates painting for display in Jerusalem and the Vatican | newspaper =[[Miami Herald]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =May 6, 2015 | url =http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article20376930.html | accessdate =April 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Torah Project Book==

This book contains  the [[Five Books of Moses]], [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], in the original Hebrew text. It is a [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]], a printed edition of the Torah.

It also contains commentaries from personalities in art and biblical studies, which have been translated into four languages — English, Spanish, Italian, and German. Each copy of The Torah Project also includes a handwritten blessing by Pope Francis, which says: “I want to bless all those who have worked in the production of this Torah, which is the word of God, that must unite us in love forever.”&lt;ref name="jewishchronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kolirin|first1=Lianne|title=Pope presented with hand illustrated Torah|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/world/pope-presented-with-hand-illustrated-torah-1.433561|accessdate=20 April 2017|publisher=Jewish Chronicle|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the Torah Project book represents the city of [[Jerusalem]], and it is made out of wood and pearl. In between the chapters of the Torah, there are 27 lithograph paintings created by [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruj_Salinas Baruj Salinas], a Jewish Cuban-born artist. &lt;ref name="jewishjournal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grigoryants|first1=Olga|title=Pope Francis accepts new Chumash intended to improve interfaith dialogue|url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/religion/215542/pope-francis-accepts-new-chumash-intended-improve-interfaith-dialogue/|accessdate=20 April 2017|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentation to the Vatican===

On 23 February 2017, the first copy of The Torah Project book was presented to Pope Francis at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Also present was Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]], from [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name="vaticanradio"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vatican|first1=Radio|title=Pope Francis to Rabbis: Torah manifests God's paternal love|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/02/23/pope_francis_to_rabbis_torah_manifests_gods_paternal_love_/1294466|accessdate=20 April 2017|publisher=Vatican Radio|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACC Arte Scritta, and scholars in biblical studies and art. One of the guests was Adolfo D. Roitman, the curator of the [[Shrine of the Book]], which holds the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] at the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem. &lt;ref name=jewishjournal/&gt; In addition, many of  the people who created the book were present, with their families.&lt;ref name=jewishchronicle/&gt;

Skorka pointed out in his speech to the Pope and the papal audience that “This is intended as a small, yet very significant cry to eradicate the hatred and animosities that are so tragically perceived today”.&lt;ref name="catholicherald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wooden|first1=Cindy|title=First books of the Bible show God’s love for humanity, says Francis|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/first-books-of-the-bible-show-gods-love-for-humanity-says-francis/|accessdate=20 April 2017|publisher=Catholic Herald|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Francis]] expressed his appreciation for the Torah as a “thoughtful gesture” and that it is “the Lord’s gift, his revelation, his word”. He indicated that the editor’s note inside this edition of the Torah indicates the “dialogical approach” that the relations between Catholics and Jews is “a cultural vision of openness, mutual respect, and peace that accords with the spiritual message of the [[Torah]].” He also recognised the efforts and expertise of the craftsmen and artisans, and acknowledged how they added more value to the Torah with colorful illustrations.&lt;ref name="crux"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Elise|title=Pope Francis: the Torah is a manifestation of God’s love for man|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/02/23/pope-francis-torah-manifestation-gods-love-man/|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Catholic News Agency|publisher=Crux|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope said that the gift of this edition of the Torah to the Vatican "is fully embedded" in "fraternal and institutional dialogue between Jews and Christians" that "is expressed not only through words but also in deeds." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Scaramuzzi | first =Iacopo | title =Francesco: nella Torah c’è l’amore viscerale di Dio: Il Papa riceve il suo amico rabbino argentino Abraham Skorka che gli porta una nuova edizione dei primi cinque libri sacri della Bibbia | newspaper =[[La Stampa]] | location = | pages = | language =Italian | publisher = | date =23 February 2017 | url =http://www.lastampa.it/2017/02/23/vaticaninsider/ita/vaticano/francesco-nella-torah-c-lamore-viscerale-di-dio-J1qAdJCBOryoi21yEW9zyM/pagina.html | accessdate =April 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] received the first copy of this edition of the  Torah and it will be added to the [[Vatican Secret Archives]]. &lt;ref name=jewishjournal/&gt; The book was presented to the Pope by a group of Jewish and Christian children.&lt;ref name=jewishchronicle/&gt;

The [[Dogon languages|Dogon dialects]] of the western plains below the [[Bandiagara Escarpment]] is [[Mali]] are [[mutually intelligible]]. They are sometimes called the ''Kan'' Dogon because they use the word ''kan'' (also spelled ''kã'') for varieties of speech. The dialects are:

*''Tomo kã''
*''Teŋu kã''
*''Togo kã''

The latter two are traditionally subsumed under the name ''Tene kã'' (Tene Kan, Tene Tingi), but Hochstetler separates them because the three varieties are about equidistant.

There are a quarter million speakers of these dialects, about evenly split between Tomo Kan and Tene Kan, making this the most populous of the Dogon languages. There are a few Tomo-speaking villages just across the border in Burkina Faso.

The history, characteristic, evolution, and [[genealogy|genealogies]] of present-day '''women in the Czech Republic''' can be traced back from many centuries before the establishment of the country now known as the [[Czech Republic]]. They have originated from ancestral [[Slavs|Slavic settlers]] who had an economy that was based primarily on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Republic - HISTORY|url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/czech-republic/HISTORY.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the period in the [[history of the Czech Republic]] known as the [[Velvet Revolution]], many women have become individuals with full-time jobs and who, at the same time, are also focusing on their responsibilities as homemakers, giving themselves "a high sense of personal efficacy and independence" within [[Czechs|Czech society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferber|first=Marianne A. and Phyllis Hutton Raabe|title=Women in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Czech Style|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20020174?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102874243127|work=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society Vol. 16, No. 3, Toward Gender Equity: Policies and Strategies (Spring, 2003), pp. 407-430|publisher=JSTOR, Springer|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive rights and family life==
The [[maternal mortality]] rate in Czech Republic is 5 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate is 0.05% of adults (aged 15–49) - estimates of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 1.43 children born/woman (2014 estimates), one of the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in many other European countries, family formation has become more liberal, [[cohabitation|unmarried cohabitation]] has increased and the connection between fertility and [[marriage]] has decreased in the past decades; as of 2017, 49% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/ari/population-change-year-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Czech Republic has a very high [[literacy rate]], which is the same for women and men at 99% (estimates of 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However more men (95%) than women (90%) have completed high-school ([[OECD]] 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/czech-republic/|title=OECD Better Life Index|work=oecdbetterlifeindex.org|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
