'''''AB Bookman's Weekly''''' was a weekly trade publication begun in 1948 by Sol. M. Malkin as a publication of the [[R. R. Bowker]] Company, publisher of ''Books in Print'' and other book trade and library periodicals. In its glory days between the early 1950s and the early 1990s, ''AB'' was "the best marketplace for out-of-print books in North America."&lt;ref name="bookselling"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to publishing long lists of books wanted and for sale, it included trade news, reference lists, conference announcements, and various special features concerning the book trade, librarianship, and book collecting.&lt;ref name="bookselling"/&gt; The magazine was headquartered in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AB bookman's weekly: for the specialist book world|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11278586?selectedversion=NBD917892|work=NLA|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The magazine began as a column in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called "Antiquarian Bookseller"; in 1948, it spun off as a separate publication, at a time when there was a flourishing mail-order business in out-of-print and second-hand books.&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Fox, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/arts/14malkin.html?_r=0 "Mary Ann Malkin, Journal Editor and Rare-Book Collector, Dies at 92."] New York Times, 14 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Malkin purchased the magazine from Bowker in 1953. It first appeared under its final title in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 1-59158-075-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For more than four decades, it was essential reading not only for used and rare booksellers, but also for acquisitions and rare book librarians, book collectors, as well as those interested in the history of books and printing. Malkin was assisted by his wife, [[Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin]], universally known as "[mam]," whose interest in embroidery was reflected in her many ''AB'' reviews of needlework books. In 1972, when Sol. Malkin sold the magazine to Jacob L. Chernofsky, ''AB Bookman's Weekly'' had a subscription list of more than 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, "Mary Ann Malkin."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, an annual lecture in bibliography was established in Sol. M. Malkin's honor at [[Columbia University]]'s School of Library Service. Sol. M. Malkin died in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob L. Chernofsky, "Sol. M. Malkin, 75, succumbs after lengthy illness";''AB Bookman's Weekly'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the Malkin Lecture site moved with [[Rare Book School]] to the [[University of Virginia]], where it continues as the annual Sol. M. and Mary Ann O'Brian Lecture in Bibliography.

== Spin-offs ==
In December 1977, Chernofsky and Margaret Knox Goggin, dean of the University of Denver's School of Librarianship, organized a seminar on used and antiquarian books, aimed at booksellers and librarians. The Workshop/Seminar in the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market (the eventual title of the seminar) became an annual event in 1979; in 2008 (as the [[Colorado antiquarian book seminar|Colorado Antiquaran Book Seminar]]), the seminar celebrated its 30th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminars'': 2008 brochure; see also the Seminar's website {{cite web|url=http://www.bookseminars.com |title=Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline ==
Under Chernofsky's direction, ''AB Bookman's Weekly'' flourished into the early 1990s, but it began to falter because of competition from online listings of used and rare books. ''AB Bookman's Weekly'' ceased publication at the end of 1999.&lt;ref name="basbanes"/&gt; Efforts by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' to revive it as an Internet [[online magazine]] in 2004 were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AB%20Bookman%20to%20be%20reborn%20on%20the%20net-a0112591037 |title=AB Bookman to be reborn on the net |publisher = Internet Business News-M2 Communications LTD   |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the levy is 0.1% on non-[[broadcast]] costs (e.g. 0.1% of the cost of placing a [[newspaper]] advertisement), and 0.2% of the cost of a [[Mailsort]] [[contract]]. ASBOF collects the levy and then passes the [[Funding|funds]] on to the ASA to ensure that the ASA are unaware of who has contributed to its funding. This avoids the question of money influencing the ASA's decision in its rulings.

All advertising charges (except [[classified advertising|classified]] [[:wikt:lineage|lineage]] and semi-display) are subject to a 0.1% Advertising Standards Board of Finance (asbof) levy, payable by advertisers to help finance the self-regulatory system administered by the Advertising Standards Authority.

The levy will be collected from advertisers by [[advertising agencies]] or, in case of direct [[account (accountancy)|account]]s, by [[media owner]]s.

In December 2009 after 18 months' consultation with the industry and ASA, it was agreed that the levy would be expanded to include [[paid search]] advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbof.co.uk/resources/otherdocuments/Asbof_Press_Release_Nov_2009.pdf ASBOF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105850/http://www.asbof.co.uk/resources/otherdocuments/Asbof_Press_Release_Nov_2009.pdf |date=March 1, 2012 }} press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjørn Tolleivson Frøysåk''' (1634 &amp;ndash; 1709) was a Norwegian farmer and merchant. &lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bjørn Tolleivson Frøysåk |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Bj%C3%B8rn_Tolleivson_Fr%C3%B8ys%C3%A5k |language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frøysåk was born at [[Gol, Norway|Gol]] in [[Buskerud]], Norway.  He was born into one of the major farming families in [[Hallingdal]]. His father, Tolleiv Arneson Frøysåk (1605-1677),had  owned several properties. Frøysåk worked as a farmer all his life. In addition to farming, Frøysåk took part in [[timber trade]] and trading of [[real estate]], and was ran a [[coaching inn]]. 

Frøysåk was married twice. With Ingebjørg Hersgård (died 1680), he had seven children. With Guri Tolleivsgard (1659-1733), he had eight children. Frøysåk is particularly known for a painted [[epitaph]] from 1699, showing Frøysåk with his family (both his wives including the deceased Ingebjørg and children).

==Functions==
The CNS has the following three main functions.

===Communication===
'''C'''ommunication, i.e. [[aviation communication]], refers to [[radio]] communication between two or more aircraft, or the exchange of data or verbal information between aircraft and [[air traffic control]].&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt; For [[Continent|continental airspace]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]] (civil) and [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] (military) systems are used whereas for [[Ocean|oceanic areas]], [[high frequency]] systems and [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]]s are used.&lt;ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/&gt;

===Navigation===
'''N'''avigation, i.e. [[air navigation]], refers to the process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of an aircraft from one place to another by providing accurate, reliable and seamless position determination capability.&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt;&lt;ref name='NVPUB9V1'&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===
[[Surveillance|'''S'''urveillance]] systems are used by air traffic control to determine the position of aircraft. There are two types of surveillance systems:

====Cooperative systems====
Cooperative systems ([[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] dependent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as [[Secondary surveillance radar|SSR]]) communicate with equipment (such as [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]]s) on board the aircraft to determine the position and other details of the aircraft. Aircraft information, which may include position from [[GNSS]] or other means is determined on board and then transmitted to [[air traffic control|ATC]] in response to interrogation.&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/&gt; Other cooperative systems such as [[ADS-B]] rely on aircraft transmitting their position and other information without interrogation from the ground.

====Non-cooperative systems====
Non-cooperative systems (a.k.a. independent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as [[Primary surveillance radar|PSR]]) are able to locate the aircraft and measure its position from the ground by transmitting pulses of radio waves which reflect off the aircraft's hull.&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15004">'''Dean A. Hrbacek, CPA''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[politician]] who served as the mayor of [[Sugar Land, Texas]] from 1996 to 2002. Before serving in that capacity, he served as a city council member. In 2008, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in [[Texas's 22nd congressional district]].

== Personal life ==
Hrbacek attended the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake|University of Houston at Clear Lake City]] and graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[accountancy|accounting]].  He then attended the [[University of Houston]] where he received his [[Juris Doctor|Doctor of Jurisprudence]] degree from the [[University of Houston Law Center]].  Hrbacek is an attorney and a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA). He has a law firm specializing in taxation, based in Sugar&amp;nbsp;Land.

=== Mayor of Sugar Land ===
In 1996, while serving as a City Council member for Sugar Land's affluent District Four, which included a large part of the First Colony master-planned community including [[Sweetwater Country Club]] (the one-time home of the [[Ladies Professional Golf Association|LPGA]]), Hrbacek decided to run for the mayor's office being vacated by incumbent [[Lee Duggan]] who was term limited from seeking re-election after serving a total of ten years. Sugar Land city officials are subject to four terms of two years each, which totals eight years of service, though a member may run for mayor after serving on Council.

Hrbacek won the election and was re-elected for two subsequent terms. During the time that Hrbacek served as mayor and on City Council, Sugar Land was recognized and&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sugarlandtx.gov/sugarland/publications/documents/newsletter3.pdf Sugarlandtx.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216194505/http://www.sugarlandtx.gov/sugarland/publications/documents/newsletter3.pdf |date=2007-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; received multiple times for the quality of its management and innovative governance. The once sleepy company town grew into one of Houston's largest and most affluent suburbs as the city annexed several portions of [[First Colony, Sugar Land, Texas|First Colony]], a large master-planned community that now comprises the vast majority of Sugar Land's southern area.

The development of the Sugar Land Town Square, seen as a strong economic engine for Sugar Land, began during the late 1990s with Hrbacek playing a major role in the development of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutechoices.com/graphics/portfolio/large_size_portfolio_pcs/sugarland_fall_2001_newsletter.pdf Abouthechoices.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the University of Houston System at Sugar Land, the creation of several regional parks, major economic growth, and the lowering the city property tax rate by over 30% were all highlights of his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutechoices.com/graphics/portfolio/large_size_portfolio_pcs/sugarland_fall_2001_newsletter.pdf Aboutechoices.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2002 mayoral campaign ==
In 2002, Hrbacek faced a tough re-election campaign for a fourth term against City Council member [[David G. Wallace|David Wallace]], a businessman who had built up a base of support and had just been elected to the same City Council district Hrbacek held before becoming mayor. Wallace won the election after receiving the backing of several Republican leaders with whom he was allied in Fort Bend County and a local newspaper.

=== "Mayor Osama" controversy ===

Hrbacek's re-election bid was damaged by former conservative Houston radio talk show host Jon Matthews.  Matthews hosted a radio talk show on [[KSEV]].  He endorsed Wallace and attacked Hrbacek through weekly newspaper columns in a local paper.   

Matthews referred to Hrbacek as "Mayor Osama" and "Dean Osama Hrbacek", a reference to terrorist, [[al-Qaida]] leader and suspected [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] mastermind [[Osama bin Laden]]. Columns attacking Hrbacek by both Mathews and the publisher of the paper, along with radio attacks, were made during the weeks before the May 2002 election campaign.&lt;ref name="Texnews.com"&gt;[http://www.texnews.com/1998/2002/texas/texas_Former_ma1124.html Texnews.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311200017/http://www.texnews.com/1998/2002/texas/texas_Former_ma1124.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following the election, Hrbacek filed a lawsuit against Matthews and the newspaper publisher, B.K. Carter, over the comments, which claimed that the comments also damaged the reputation of Hrbacek's law firm.&lt;ref name="Texnews.com"/&gt; The lawsuit, filed in Fort Bend County District Court, Case ID 02-CV-127119, was dismissed.

== Post-mayoral life ==
Hrbacek has served as a precinct chair for the [[Fort Bend County]] Republican Party, and has become one of the more high-profile precinct chairs in the county Republican establishment. Hrbacek has also served as the President of the Fort Bend Republican Club., and also served as a delegate and caucus official at Senatorial District and State Republican Conventions since 2000.

Hrbacek was approached in 2006 by community leaders to consider running for the heavily Republican 26th District in the [[Texas House of Representatives]], which comprises Sugar Land and several immediate areas such as the portion of the First Colony planned community in Missouri City. He decided that he would run at that time only if the incumbent Republican, [[Charles F. Howard|Charlie Howard]], chose not to run. When Howard indicated he would run in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortbendnow.com/news/372/hrbacek-warming-up-for-possible-district-26-race-against-howard Fortbendnow.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904001704/http://www.fortbendnow.com/news/372/hrbacek-warming-up-for-possible-district-26-race-against-howard |date=2006-09-04 }} [broken link]&lt;/ref&gt; Hrbacek dropped out of the race.

=== Influence in 2006 congressional race (for Texas's 22nd congressional district) ===
Hrbacek served as a Precinct Chair delegate representing Fort Bend in the nomination process for the Republican write-in candidate to challenge Democratic ex-Congressman [[Nick Lampson]] and Libertarian [[Bob Smither]] in the general election to replace former House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]]. On April 3, 2006, DeLay decided not to seek re-election following an indictment related to campaign finances by District Attorney, Ronnie Earle, in Travis County. (As of February 2008, the case against DeLay is still pending.)

Hrbacek was among the majority of Fort Bend Precinct Chairs who rejected efforts by Sugar Land Mayor David Wallace to become the Republican nominee in 2006. Republican precinct chairs from four counties, including Harris, Brazoria, and Galveston in addition to Fort Bend, later nominated dermatologist and Houston city councilwoman [[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] as a candidate in 2006. She won a special election to fill the remainder of DeLay's term but lost in the write in campaign for the general election by 10 points to Lampson who was on the ballot.

== 2008 Congressional race (Texas's 22nd District) ==
Following [[Nick Lampson]]'s 2006 victory, Hrbacek was strongly encouraged to run against Lampson, given the latter's vulnerability in a heavily Republican district due to its strongly conservative nature. In fact, it was the most conservative district in the country that fell to a Democrat, having given [[George W. Bush]] a 2-to-1 margin of victory over Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] in 2004.

On October 4, 2007, Hrbacek formally announced his candidacy for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://calc-o-meter.de/en/allplugins.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000337/http://calc-o-meter.de/en/allplugins.php |archive-date=2016-12-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included among them are: State Republican Executive Committeewoman (SREC) District 17 - Terese Raia, Former SREC District 17 Committeeman - Tim Turner, Former Republican Party of [[Fort Bend County]] Chairman - Jim Stokes and Former Fort Bend County Judge - Mike Rozell.  Former Sugar Land City Councilmembers from across the district have also endorsed Hrbacek.

=== Photoshop controversy ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

On January 19, 2008 a mailer containing a photo that was presented as a true image of Hrbacek was in reality a computerized composite of Hrbacek's face and someone else's slimmer figure, in suit and tie, from neck to knee. It made international news.&lt;ref name="DoctoredPhotoCNN"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/19/doctored.photo.ap/  |title= Candidate's photo puts his head on skinnier body |author= [[Associated Press]] |work= [[CNN]] |date= January 19, 2008 |quote= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123164202/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/19/doctored.photo.ap/ |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">In [[legal theory]], a '''default rule''' is a rule of law that can be overridden by a contract, trust, will, or other legally effective agreement.  Contract law, for example, can be divided into two kinds of rules: ''default rules'' and ''mandatory rules.''  Whereas the ''default rules'' can be modified by agreement of the parties, ''mandatory rules'' will be enforced, even if the parties to a contract attempt to override or modify them.  One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules.

The idea of a default rule in contract law is sometimes connected to the notion of a [[complete contract]].  In [[contract theory]], a complete contract fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the contract for all possible future states of the world.  An incomplete contract, therefore, contains gaps.  Most contract theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete contracts. This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a contract from uncertainty.

The '''energy industry''' is the totality of all of the [[industry|industries]] involved in the production and sale of [[energy]], including [[fuel]] extraction, manufacturing, [[oil refinery|refining]] and distribution. Modern society consumes large amounts of fuel, and the energy industry is a crucial part of the [[infrastructure]] and maintenance of society in almost all [[nation|countries]].

In particular, the energy industry comprises:
* the [[petroleum industry]], including [[oil companies]], petroleum refiners, fuel transport and end-user sales at [[gas station]]s
* the gas industry, including [[natural gas]] extraction, and [[coal gas]] manufacture, as well as distribution and sales
* the [[electrical power industry]], including [[electricity generation]], [[electric power distribution]] and sales
* the [[coal]] industry
* the [[nuclear power]] industry
* the [[renewable energy industry]], comprising [[alternative energy]] and [[sustainable energy]] companies, including those involved in [[hydroelectric power]], [[wind power]], and [[solar power]] generation, and the manufacture, distribution and sale of [[alternative fuel]]s
* traditional energy industry based on the collection and distribution of [[firewood]], the use of which, for cooking and heating, is particularly common in poorer countries

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The use of [[energy]] has been a key in the development of the [[society|human society]] by helping it to control and adapt to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Managing the use of energy is inevitable in any functional society. In the [[industrialization|industrialized world]] the development of energy resources has  become essential for [[agriculture]], [[transport]]ation, [[sewage|waste collection]], [[information technology]], [[Telecommunication|communications]] that have become prerequisites of a developed society. The increasing use of energy since the [[Industrial Revolution]] has also brought with it a number of serious problems, some of which, such as [[global warming]], present potentially grave risks to the world.

In some industries, the word ''energy'' is used as a synonym of [[Energy development|energy resources]], which refer to substances like [[fuels]], [[petroleum]] products and [[electricity]] in general, because a significant portion of the energy contained in these resources can easily be extracted to serve a useful purpose. After a useful process has taken place, the total energy is conserved, but the ressource itself is not conserved, since a process usually transforms the energy into unusable forms (such as unnecessary or excess heat).

Ever since humanity discovered various energy resources available in nature, it has been inventing devices, known as machines, that make life more comfortable by using energy resources. Thus, although the primitive man knew the utility of fire to cook food, the invention of devices like gas burners and [[microwave ovens]] has increased the usage of energy for this purpose alone manyfold. The trend is the same in any other field of social activity, be it [[construction]] of social infrastructure, manufacturing of fabrics for covering; porting; [[printing]];  decorating, for example [[textiles]], [[air conditioning]]; [[communication]] of information or for moving people and goods ([[automobiles]]).

==Economics==
{{Main article|Energy economics}}
[[Energy development|Production]] and [[World energy resources and consumption|consumption]] of energy resources is very important to the global economy.  All economic activity requires energy resources, whether to [[manufacturing|manufacture]] goods, provide [[transport]]ation, run [[computer]]s and other [[machine]]s.

Widespread demand for energy may encourage competing energy [[public utility|utilities]] and the formation of [[retailing|retail]] [[energy market]]s. Note the presence of the "Energy Marketing and Customer Service" (EMACS) sub-sector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy sector accounts for 4.6% of outstanding leveraged loans, compared with 3.1% a decade ago, while energy bonds make up 15.7% of the $1.3{{nbsp}}[[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] junk bond market, up from 4.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Alloway | first = Tracy | date = 26 November 2014 | title = Oil price fall starts to weigh on banks | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c9f4e9e8-757c-11e4-b1bf-00144feabdc0.html | website = ft.com | accessdate = 27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main article|Energy demand management}}
Since the cost of energy has become a significant factor in the performance of economy of societies, management of energy resources has become very crucial. Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively that is with minimum incremental costs. Many times it is possible to save expenditure on energy without incorporating fresh [[technology]] by simple [[management]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mepol.org/site180.php Energy Management :: MEPoL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325140222/http://www.mepol.org/site180.php |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often energy management is the practice of using energy more efficiently by eliminating energy wastage or to balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness with [[energy conservation]].

==Classifications==

===Government===
The [[United Nations]] developed the [[International Standard Industrial Classification]], which is a list of economic and social classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/family1.asp United Nations economic and social classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinct classification for an energy industry, because the classification system is based on ''activities'', ''products'', and ''expenditures according to purpose''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regct.asp?Lg=1 United Nations Available Classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in North America use the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). The NAICS sectors #21 and #22 (mining and utilities) might roughly define the energy industry in North America. This classification is used by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

===Financial market===

The [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] used by [[Morgan Stanley]] define the energy industry as comprising companies primarily working with oil, gas, coal and consumable fuels, excluding companies working with certain industrial gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscibarra.com/products/gics/structure.jsp MSCI-Barra GICS Tables] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Add also to expand this section:  [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbenchmark.com/docs/ICB_StructureSheet_120104.pdf Industry Classification Benchmark for Dow Jones Indexes (United States) and FTSE Indexes (United Kingdom)] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{main article|Environmental impact of the energy industry}}
Government encouragement in the form of [[subsidy|subsidies]] and [[tax]] [[incentive]]s for [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] efforts has increasingly fostered the view of conservation as a major function of the energy industry: saving an amount of energy provides economic benefits almost identical to generating that same amount of energy. This is compounded by the fact that the economics of delivering energy tend to be priced for capacity as opposed to average usage. One of the purposes of a [[smart grid]] infrastructure is to smooth out demand so that capacity and demand curves align more closely.
Some parts of the energy industry generate considerable [[pollution]], including toxic and [[greenhouse gas]]es from fuel combustion, [[nuclear waste]] from the generation of nuclear power, and [[oil spillage]]s as a result of  petroleum extraction. Government regulations to internalize these [[externality|externalities]] form an increasing part of doing [[business]], and the trading of [[carbon credit]]s and [[pollution credit]]s on the free market may also result in energy-saving and pollution-control measures becoming even more important to energy providers.

Consumption of energy resources, (e.g. turning on a light) requires resources and has an effect on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Many electric power plants burn coal, oil or natural gas in order to generate electricity for energy needs. While burning these fossil fuels produces a readily available and instantaneous supply of electricity, it also generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide and trioxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxides ([[NOx]]). Carbon dioxide is an important [[greenhouse gas]] which is thought to be responsible for some fraction of the rapid increase in [[climate change]] seen especially in the temperature records in the 20th century, as compared with tens of thousands of years worth of temperature records which can be read from ice cores taken in Arctic regions. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation also releases trace metals such as beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and silver into the environment, which also act as pollutants.

The large-scale use of [[renewable energy]] technologies would "greatly mitigate or eliminate a wide range of environmental and human health impacts of energy use".&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy policy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuli Aye|title=Energie vergelijken switchen Energieleverancier top 10|url=https://www.hotswitch.nl/|website=Energie vergelijken|accessdate=28 October 2016|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy technologies include [[biofuels]], [[solar heating and cooling]], [[hydroelectric power]], [[solar power]], and [[wind power]].  [[Energy conservation]] and the [[Efficient energy use|efficient use of energy]] would also help.

In addition, it is argued that there is also the potential to develop a more [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] sector. This can be done by:&lt;ref&gt;[[European Movement for Efficient Energy]] 2011. Energy efficient solutions for the conservation of energy. Retrieved: 11 October 2011 18:52&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fuel switching in the power sector from [[coal]] to [[natural gas]];
* Power plant optimisation and other measures to improve the efficiency of existing [[combined cycle gas turbine|CCGT]] power plants;
* [[Combined heat and power]] (CHP), from micro-scale residential to large-scale industrial;
* [[Waste heat recovery]]
[[Best available technology]] (BAT) offers supply-side efficiency levels far higher than global averages. The relative benefits of gas compared to coal are influenced by the development of increasingly [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] production methods. According to an impact assessment carried out for the [[European Commission]], the levels of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of coal-fired plants built have now increased to 46-49% efficiency rates, as compared to coals plants built before the 1990s (32-40%).&lt;ref name=EC1&gt;[[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=152 Impact Assessment Accompanying the document Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC]. p. 106 Retrieved 11 October 2011 19:01&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time gas can reach 58-59% efficiency levels with the best available technology.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt; Meanwhile, [[combined heat and power]] can offer efficiency rates of 80-90%.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt;

==Politics==
Since now energy plays an essential role in [[industrial society|industrial societies]], the ownership and control of energy resources plays an increasing role in [[politics]]. At the national level, governments seek to influence the sharing (distribution) of energy resources among various sections of the society through pricing mechanisms; or even who owns resources within their borders. They may also seek to influence the use of energy by individuals and business in an attempt to tackle [[environmental issues]].

The most recent international political controversy regarding energy resources is in the context of the [[Iraq War]]s. Some political analysts maintain that the hidden reason for both 1991 and 2003 wars can be traced to [[strategy|strategic]] control of international energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419104405/http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}} Oil and Empire - the backstory to the invasion of Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this analysis with the numbers related to its economics. According to the latter group of analysts, U.S. has spent about $336 billion in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 The War in Iraq Costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012210605/http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 |date=12 October 2005 }}, A running total of the U.S. taxpayer cost to date of the Iraq War.

===Policy===
{{main|Energy policy}}
Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques.

===Security===
{{main|Energy security}}
Energy security is the intersection of [[national security]] and the availability of [[natural resource]]s for [[energy]] consumption. Access to cheap [[energy]] has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, the funding to foreign dictators, rising terrorism, and dominant countries reliance to the foreign oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |title=Power plays: Energy and Australia's security |publisher=Aspi.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072715/http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |archivedate=11 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited supplies, uneven distribution, and rising costs of [[fossil fuels]], such as oil and gas, create a need to change to more [[sustainable energy]] sources in the foreseeable future. With as much dependence that the U.S. currently has for oil and with the peaking limits of oil production; economies and societies will begin to feel the decline in the resource that we have become dependent upon. Energy security has become one of the leading issues in the world today as oil and other resources have become as vital to the world's people. However, with oil production rates decreasing and oil production peak nearing the world has come to protect what resources we have left in the world. With new advancements in renewable resources less pressure has been put on companies that produce the world's oil, these resources are, geothermal, solar power, wind power and hydro-electric. Although these are not all the current and possible future options for the world to turn to as the oil depletes the most important issue is protecting these vital resources from future threats. These new resources will become more useful as the price of exporting and importing oil will increase due to increase of demand.

==Development==
{{main article|Energy development}}
Producing energy to sustain human needs is an essential social activity, and a great deal of effort goes into the activity. While most of such effort is limited towards increasing the production of [[electric power generation|electricity]] and [[oil exploration|oil]], newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One such effort is to explore means of producing [[hydrogen fuel]] from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore [[enzymatic]] decomposition of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|title=Virginia Tech Deans' Task Force on Energy Security and Sustainability|publisher=|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408155812/http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|archive-date=8 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of conventional energy resources are also being used in new ways. [[Coal|Coal gasification and liquefaction]] are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that [[oil reserves]], at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived. See [[alternative fuels]].

Energy is the subject of significant research activities globally. For example, the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] is the focal point for UK energy research while the European Union has many technology programmes as well as a platform for engaging social science and humanities within energy research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/global-sustainability-institute-gsi/research/consumption-and-change/shape-energy|title=H2020 SHAPE-Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
All societies require materials and food to be transported over ''distances'', generally against some ''force'' of friction. Since application of force over distance requires the presence of a source of usable energy, such sources are of great worth in society.

While energy resources are an essential ingredient for all modes of [[transportation]] in society, the transportation of energy resources is becoming equally important. Energy resources are frequently located far from the place where they are consumed. Therefore, their transportation is always in question. Some energy resources like liquid or gaseous fuels are transported using tankers or [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], while electricity transportation invariably requires a network of [[transmission grid|grid cables]]. The transportation of energy, whether by tanker, pipeline, or transmission line, poses challenges for scientists and engineers, policy makers, and economists to make it more risk-free and efficient.

==Crisis==
{{main article|Energy crisis}}
[[File:Oil Prices Since 1861.svg|right|thumb|Oil prices from 1861 to 2007]]
Economic and political instability can lead to an [[energy crisis]]. Notable oil crises are the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 oil crisis]]. The advent of [[peak oil]], the point in time when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, will likely precipitate another energy crisis.

== Mergers and Acquisitions ==
Between 1985 and 2018 there have been around 69,932 deals in the energy sector. This cumulates to an overall value of 9,578 bil USD. The most active year was 2010 with about 3.761 deals. In terms of value 2007 was the strongest year (684 bil. USD), which was followed by a steep decline until 2009 (-55,8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Fatema Akbari was driven into carpentry by necessity as a means of supporting her children following the death of her husband in 1999,&lt;ref name=NATO&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan women carve a career in a man’s world|publisher=[[NATO]]|date=8 March 2011|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_71227.htm|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally working on building sites in [[Iran]], where her family fled when the [[Taliban]] took control of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=VitalVoices/&gt; In 2003 she returned to homeland and started furniture manufacturing business by establishing '''Gulistan Sadaqat Company''' in [[Kabul]] with a carpentry school.&lt;ref name=SylviaScott&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Sylvia R.J.|title=Fatima Akbari, Afghan Mother, Role-Model, Social Entrepreneur and Business Owner|date=24 March 2011|url=http://sylviarjscott.com/women-entrepreneurs/fatima-akbari-afghan-mother-role-model-social-entrepreneur-and-business-owner/|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted to provide a workforce base as a means of earning to wives of men killed or disabled during conflict in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Wharton&gt;{{cite web|title=Employee Dilemma: When Family and Business Don't Mix |work=Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] |date=6 January 2011 |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/10000women/article.cfm?articleid=6230 |accessdate=14 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105221938/http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/10000women/article.cfm?articleid=6230 |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she enrolled in the [[Goldman Sachs]]-sponsored [[10,000 Women]] program at the [[American University of Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=VitalVoices/&gt; a program aimed at training women from  developing countries in business and management.&lt;ref name=GoldmanSachs&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.10000women.org/PDFs/10000Women_PressRelease.pdf |title=Goldman Sachs Launces 10,000 Women |publisher=Goldman Sachs |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gKbpAJOj?url=http://www.10000women.org/PDFs/10000Women_PressRelease.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-26 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In expanding her operations and women's literacy classes, Akbari has been able to work in [[Taliban]]-controlled areas though negotiations with local leaders and has commented ''"It would be good for the Taliban to be involved in the country, to see that there’s nothing wrong with women leaving the house."''&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=What About Afghan Women?|newspaper=New York Times|location=New York City|date=23 October 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/opinion/24kristof.html|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Fatema Akbari founded Afghanistan [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] the '''Women Affairs Council''' to train women in handicrafts in addition to educating both sexes about human rights.&lt;ref name=BushCenterBooklet&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Building Afghanistan’s Future: Promoting Women’s Freedom and Advancing their Economic Opportunity |booktitle=Speakers and Panellists Bios |page=12 |publisher=[[George W.

== 10,000 Women Entrepreneurial Achievement Award ==
On 12 April 2011 Akbari was honoured with the 10,000 Women Entrepreneurial Achievement Award at the [[Global Leadership Awards]]. In presenting, [[Vital Voices]] commended her&lt;blockquote&gt;''"for her work to empower other Afghan women — through the training and employment provided by her carpentry business, and through the literacy and skills training provided by her non-governmental organization (NGO) to women in Taliban-controlled areas."''&lt;ref name=VitalVoices/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Further work ==
During 30–31 March 2011, Akbari was a panel member at a 2-day conference in [[Dallas, Texas]] convened by former United States President [[George W. Bush]] and Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]] entitled ''Building Afghanistan’s Future: Promoting Women’s Freedom and Advancing Their Economic Opportunity''.&lt;ref name=BushCenter&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Building Afghanistan's Future |publisher=[[George W.

'''Francis Beverley Biddle''' (May 19, 1886{{spaced ndash}}October 4, 1968) was an American lawyer and [[judge]] who was [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General of the United States]] during [[World War II]] and who served as the primary American judge during the postwar [[Nuremberg trials]].

==Early life and education==
Biddle was born in [[Paris]], [[France]], while his family was living abroad.&lt;ref name=FJC&gt;{{FJC Bio|166|nid=1377796|name=Francis Biddle&lt;!--(1886–1968)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of four sons of Frances Brown (née Robinson) and Algernon Sydney Biddle, a law professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] of the [[Biddle family]]. 

He was also a great-great-grandson of [[Edmund Randolph]] (1753–1813) the [[List of Governors of Virginia|seventh]] [[Governor of Virginia]], the second [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and the first [[United States Attorney General]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/biddle.html#RAH0SAB6S Political Graveyard: Biddle, Francis Beverley (1886-1968)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a half second cousin four times removed of the 4th [[President of the United States]] [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~cbjbar/descendancy.html Rootsweb: The Ancestry of John Howard Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Groton School]], where he participated in boxing.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;  He earned degrees from [[Harvard University]] in 1909 ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]]) and 1911 ([[law degree]]).&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
He first worked as a private secretary to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] from 1911 to 1912.&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt; He spent the next 27 years practicing law in [[Philadelphia]].  In 1912, he supported the presidential candidacy of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s renegade [[Bull Moose Party]]. He was also served briefly during [[World War I]] as a private the [[United States Army]] from October 23 to November 30, 1918.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;  He served as special assistant to the U.S. attorney of the [[Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] from 1922 to 1926.&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt;

===Roosevelt administration===
Beginning in the 1930s, Biddle was appointed to a number of important governmental roles. In 1934, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] nominated him to be chairman of the [[National Labor Relations Board]]. On February 9, 1939, Roosevelt nominated Biddle to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], to a seat vacated by [[Joseph Buffington]]. Biddle was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on February 28, 1939, and received his commission on March 4, 1939. He only served one year before resigning on January 22, 1940, to become the [[United States Solicitor General]].&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt; This also turned out to be a short-lived position when Roosevelt nominated him to the position of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General of the United States]] in 1941. During this time he was also chief counsel to the [[Special Congressional Committee to Investigate the Tennessee Valley Authority]], from 1938 to 1939, and director of [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] at the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Biddle used the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] to attempt to shut down 'vermin publications'. This included [[Father Coughlin]]'s publication entitled ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]''.&lt;ref name="timecom1942"&gt;
{{ cite web  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849845,00.html
 | title = The Press: Coughlin Quits - TIME
 | date = 1942-05-18 | accessdate = 2011-03-13
 | publisher = time.com }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Biddle has also been "credited" with the creation of what became known later as the "[[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]"; in fact, this list was originally known as "The Biddle List".  In the Biddle List, eleven front groups originating in the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] ([[CPUSA]]) were singled out as being "subversive" and under the control of the Soviet Union.  Unlike the later, more infamous Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations, which contained both left and right-wing organizations, the Biddle List contained only left-wing organizations as well as civil rights organizations tied to the CPUSA.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

====Biddle List (1941)====
* [[American League Against War and Fascism]]
* [[American League for Peace and Democracy]]
* [[American Peace Mobilization]]
* [[American Youth Congress]]
* [[League of American Writers]]
* [[National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners]]
* [[National Committee for Peoples Rights]]
* [[National Federation for Constitutional Liberties]]
* [[National Negro Congress]]
* [[Washington Cooperative Bookshop]]

In 1942, Biddle was involved in a case where eight captured Nazi agents were tried by a [[military tribunal]] appointed by President Roosevelt for [[espionage]] and planning [[sabotage]] in the United States as part of [[Operation Pastorius]]. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Kenneth Claiborne Royall|Kenneth Royall]] challenged Roosevelt's decision to prosecute the Germans in military tribunals, citing ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] could not establish military tribunals to try civilians in areas where civilian courts were functioning, even during [[war]]times. Biddle responded that the Germans were not entitled to have access to civilian courts due to their status as [[unlawful combatants]]. This decision was upheld in ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'' (1942) where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the military commission created to try the Germans was lawful. On August 3, 1942, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Five days later, six of the eight were executed in the [[electric chair]] on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail. The other two were given prison terms as they willingly turned over their comrades to the [[FBI]]. In 1948, both men were released from prison and returned to Germany.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Although Biddle opposed [[Japanese-American internment]] during the war, he succumbed to "political expediency" and eventually supported the policy, and was haunted by it for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fein|Fein, Bruce]] (2007-05-07) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/may/07/00032/ State of Emergency], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Biddle strengthened his department's efforts on behalf of [[African American]] [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] by instructing [[United States Attorney|United States attorney]]s to direct their prosecutions against [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] away from the usual practice of charging "[[peonage]]," which required them to find an element of debt, and toward bringing charges of "[[slavery]]" and "[[involuntary servitude]]" against employers and local officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackmon|first=Doublas A.|authorlink= |title=Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II|year=2008|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=9780385722704|pages=377–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truman administration===
At President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s request, he resigned after Roosevelt's death. Shortly after, Truman appointed Biddle as a judge at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]]. [[Tom C. Clark|Tom Clark]], Biddle's successor, told the story that Biddle, who wore [[Spats (footwear)|spats]], was the first government official whose resignation Truman sought, and that it was quite a difficult task. Biddle was amused by Truman's stammering, but after it was over, he threw his arm around the President and said, "See, Harry, now that wasn't so hard."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1947, he was nominated by Truman as the American representative on the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].  However, after the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] refused to act on the nomination, Biddle asked Truman to withdraw his name.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In 1950, he was named as chairman of the [[Americans for Democratic Action]], a position he held for three years;&lt;ref name=FJC/&gt; then one decade later, wrote two volumes of memoirs: ''A Casual Past'' in 1961 and ''In Brief Authority'' the following year. His final position came as chairman of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Commission, which he resigned in 1965.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

===Writing===
Biddle's writing skills had long been in evidence prior to the release of his memoirs. In 1927, he wrote a novel about [[Philadelphia]] society, ''The Llanfear Pattern''.  In 1942, he wrote of his close association with Oliver Wendell Holmes 30 years earlier with a biography of the jurist, ''Mr. Justice Holmes'', which was adapted into a  Broadway play and a motion picture entitled ''[[The Magnificent Yankee (1950 film)|The Magnificent Yankee]]''.  ''Democratic Thinking and the War'', was published in 1944.  His 1949 book, ''The World's Best Hope'', looked at the role of the United States in the post-war era. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Joseph "Fred" Lawton''' (November 11, 1900 – 1975) was an American [[bureaucrat]] who served as the ninth [[Office of Management and Budget#List of directors|Director]] of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]]. Lawton was born in Washington, D.C., and became a lawyer and an accountant. He spent most of his professional career working with the government [[bureaucracy]]. He helped President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wager with members of Congress to support the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]. He first joined the [[Office of Management and Budget]] as an [[executive assistant]] in 1935. He also served as an adviser to Congress. In 1947, he became an [[administrative assistant]] to President [[Harry S. Truman]]. He was appointed to the post of Director of the Bureau of the Budget in 1950, and held the position until 1953. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] appointed Lawton to a term on the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] after he left the Bureau; he served from 1953 to 1963.

His economic policy consisted of making budget cuts among various departments of the federal government. One of his primary contributions was in helping to re-design the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (United States)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]], action which led to the creation of the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Lawton advocated a civil service, rather than a [[patronage]] system for tax agents. He opposed a number of plans in Congress, including a [[fair trade]] bill and attempts to [[decentralize]] the federal offices in Washington, D.C. to other areas of the country.

==Life==
Lawton was born in Washington, D.C. on November 11, 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wetherby|first=Lawrence|author2=John Kleber|title=The Public Papers of Governor Lawrence W.

Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the US and Kathleen Lawton Kenna, a Department of the Army senior executive Civilian Personnel Officer.

==Bureaucratic career==
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used Lawton to build support [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] in the [[United States Congress]]. Roosevelt instructed him to go to a hotel room, where Roosevelt would send various members of Congress to visit. Once there, Lawton was to put into the budget whatever [[pork barrel]] projects the Congressmen required in order to buy a supporting vote for the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Diana|title=Greasing the Wheels: Using Pork Barrel Projects to Build Majority Coalitions in Congress|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=132|isbn=0-521-54532-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeItje_vhGQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=frederick+lawton+budget&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=Kp59S4jPGJKCywT3m4n7CA&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Lawton&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawton first meet President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1938, during the consideration of the [[Roosevelt Reorganization Act]] in the [[United States Senate]], in the cloakroom of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref name=oral/&gt; He only had one professional interaction with Truman before his Presidency, over the [[Canol Road]] project.&lt;ref name=oral/&gt;

==Office of Management and Budget==

===Jobs held===
Lawton first joined the [[Office of Management and Budget]] as an [[executive assistant]] in 1935. During this time, he also appeared as a consultant and adviser to the [[United States Senate|Senate's]] Select Committee on Government Organization.&lt;ref name=oral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/lawton.htm|title=Oral History Interview with Frederick J. Lawton|last=Morrissey|first=Charles|date=17 June 1963|publisher=[[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]]|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawton landed the job of adviser to the Senate Select Committee when the Senate asked for a liaison and expert from the Budget Bureau; Lawton himself speculated that he received the job because his post did not have specific estimates assigned to it, leaving him free for new duties.&lt;ref name=oral/&gt; At the time of the assignment, he had been heading the Budget Bureau's Financial Records Division. However, after the [[United States federal budget|federal budget]] was submitted to Congress every year, Lawton's job mainly consisted of various "spot jobs" and loans to other organizations.&lt;ref name=oral/&gt;

He served as an executive assistant until 1947, when he became an [[administrative assistant]] to President [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/lawtonfj.htm|title=Frederick J. Lawton Papers|year=2010|publisher=[[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]]|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, after one year as an administrative assistant, he became the assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget,&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; taking the position vacated by [[Frank Pace]] when he became the Director of the Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T88pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AQAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1938,1242040&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Frank Pace Given Budget Directorship in Capital Shake-Up|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=7 January 1949|work=[[The Blade (Toledo)|The Blade]]|accessdate=23 February 2010|location=Toledo, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the [[Office of Management and Budget#List of directors|Director]] of the Bureau from 1950 to 1953.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; He received the job again upon vacation of [[Frank Pace]], who was appointed the [[United States Secretary of the Army]].&lt;ref name=Eugene/&gt; Eisenhower awarded him the [[President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service]] in 1961 for his years of service in the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Civil Service Awards|date=11 January 1961|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions and economic policy===
As Director, Lawton worked to cut departmental expenses in the federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ZgcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6363,1894512&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Will Plan For Transition of Administration|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=13 November 1952|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|pages=2|accessdate=23 February 2010|location=Sarasota, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as assistant director, he argued strongly against calls from Congress for large-scale budget cuts, claiming that such a thing would not be possible because of "fixed" expenses like paying down the [[public debt]] and giving promised veteran's benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7skhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LZ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1782,5540810&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Congress May Give President Task of Cutting Expenses|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=16 June 1949|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|pages=37|location=Reading, Pennsylvania|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Lawton, under order of Congress, cut more than $500 million in operating costs within the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQQvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wqoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4010,1586753&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Congressional Buck - Passing Leaves Budget to Truman|last=Edson|first=Peter|date=29 September 1950|work=[[Argus-Press]]|pages=4|accessdate=24 March 2010|location=Owosso, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawton called for reform within the [[Internal Revenue Service|Bureau of Internal Revenue]], claiming that its "magnitude and complexity" required an overhaul.&lt;ref name=adv&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MzMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ntoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3605,589299&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Tax Plan Supported: Rayburn Believes House Will Okay Bureau Shakeup|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=21 January 1952|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|pages=1|accessdate=23 February 2010|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advocacy led the Bureau to be renamed the Internal Revenue Service, and a [[Internal Revenue Service#Name change and reorganization of the IRS|reorganization of the Bureau]] which established agents as career civil servants, rather than using the [[patronage]] system.&lt;ref name=adv/&gt;

Lawton most often backed the policies of Truman. He joined with Truman in fighting a fair trade bill in [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GOsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5782,1772246&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|title=Truman Ready to Veto Proposed Fair Trade Law|last=Freedman|first=Morty|date=4 March 1952|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|pages=21|accessdate=23 February 2010|location=St. Petersburg, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawton supported a requested merger of [[Pan American World Airways]] and [[American Overseas Airlines]], a plan that Truman initially opposed, but then passed over the recommendation of the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=grgKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Uk4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5983,4574817&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719032548/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=grgKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Uk4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5983,4574817&amp;dq=frederick+lawton&amp;hl=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 July 2012|title=Capital Wonders Why President Switched on Airways Merger|last=Pearson|first=Drew|date=14 July 1950|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|pages=8|accessdate=23 February 2010|location=St. Petersburg, Florida|authorlink=Drew Pearson (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawton vocally opposed plans to [[decentralization|decentralize]] the federal offices in Washington, D.C., spreading them throughout the country so that an enemy attack would not cripple the entire national government. Lawton argued that there was a shortage of office space around the country that made the plans impossible to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugler|first=David|title=This is Only a Test: How Washington, D.C.

While he advocated fiscal restraint, he mostly found ways of carrying out Truman's policies, rather than arguing for them.

'''Fredrik Stefan Eaton''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Order of Ontario|O.Ont]] (born June 26, 1938) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and former diplomat who is a member of the prominent [[Eaton family]]. He is the great-grandson of [[Eaton's]] department store founder [[Timothy Eaton]].

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Toronto]] to [[John David Eaton]] and [[Signy Hildur Stefansson Eaton|Signy Steffanson Eaton]], and he was raised in the [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]] area. He has three brothers: [[John Craig Eaton (Chancellor Ryerson University)|John Craig Eaton]], [[George Ross Eaton]], and [[Thor Edgar Eaton]].

In 1962, Eaton received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of New Brunswick]] and started working as salesman at Eaton's in British Columbia. From 1977 to 1988, he was the chairman, president and CEO of Eaton's.

He served as [[List of Canadian high commissioners to the United Kingdom|Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] from 1991 to 1994. In 1993, he was appointed Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and served for two terms of five years.

He is married to [[Catherine "Nicky" Eaton]] and has two children: [[Fredrik D'Arcy Eaton]], who lives in Toronto and is head of the ''Catherine and Fredrik Eaton Charitable Foundation'', and [[Flora Catherine Eaton Coakley]], who lives in [[New York City]].

Eaton and his family live in a townhouse in Toronto and own a country estate in [[Caledon, Ontario]], a cottage on [[Georgian Bay]], and a winter home in [[Florida]]. He is one of the most public members of the Eaton Family, and he attends social events and endows many institutions philanthropically.

==Awards==
In 1990, Eaton was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] for having "contributed to many aspects of Canadian life. Through his leadership in a variety of organizations, in fields as diverse as those of business, education, nature, health care and the arts, he is continuing his family's tradition of exemplary service to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2808}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he was awarded the [[Order of Ontario]] for his "contributions in numerous areas including health care and the arts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizenship.gov.on.ca/english/citdiv/honours/order/order-winners01.htm Order of Ontario]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research referred to common "keep the company on track" activities conducted in departments such as internal audit, compliance, risk, legal, finance, IT, HR as well as the lines of business, executive suite and the board itself.

== Overview ==
Governance, risk management, and compliance are three related facets that help assure an organization reliably achieves objectives, addresses uncertainty and acts with integrity&lt;ref&gt;OCEG (2004), "GRC Capability Model"{{citation |url=https://go.oceg.org/grc-capability-model-red-book |title=GRC Capability Model (Free Open Source) |author=Scott L. Mitchell, OCEG | date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Governance is the combination of processes established and executed by the directors (or the board of directors) that are reflected in the organization's structure and how it is managed and led toward achieving goals. Risk management is predicting and managing risks that could hinder the organization from reliably achieving its objectives under uncertainty. Compliance refers to adhering with the mandated boundaries (laws and regulations) and voluntary boundaries (company's policies, procedures, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt F. Reding, Paul J. Sobel, Urton L. Anderson, Michael J. Head, Sridhar Ramamoorti, Mark Salamasick, Cris Riddle (2013), "Internal Auditing: Assurance &amp; Advisory Services"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OCEG (2004), "GRC Capability Model"{{citation |url=https://go.oceg.org/grc-capability-model-red-book |title=GRC Capability Model (Free Open Source) |author=Scott L. Mitchell, OCEG | date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GRC is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and activity across governance, and compliance in order to operate more efficiently, enable effective information sharing, more effectively report activities and avoid wasteful overlaps. Although interpreted differently in various organizations, GRC typically encompasses activities such as [[corporate governance]], [[enterprise risk management]] (ERM) and corporate compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Organizations reach a size where coordinated control over GRC activities is required to operate effectively. Each of these three disciplines creates information of value to the other two, and all three impact the same technologies, people, processes and information.

Substantial duplication of tasks evolves when governance, risk management and compliance are managed independently.  Overlapping and duplicated GRC activities negatively impact both operational costs and GRC matrices. For example, each internal service might be audited and assessed by multiple groups on an annual basis, creating enormous cost and disconnected results. A disconnected GRC approach will also prevent an organization from providing real-time GRC executive reports. GRC supposes that this approach, like a badly planned transport system, every individual route will operate, but the network will lack the qualities that allow them to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Terminus Systems (2018), "GRC" {{citation |url=https://terminus-system.com/grc/ |title=GRC {Free Open Source} |author=Unlisted, Terminus Systems | date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If not integrated, if tackled in a traditional "silo" approach, most organizations must sustain unmanageable numbers of GRC-related requirements due to changes in technology, increasing data storage, market globalization and increased regulation.

== GRC topics ==

=== Basic concepts ===
* [[Governance]] describes the overall management approach through which senior executives direct and control the entire organization, using a combination of management information and hierarchical management control structures. Governance activities ensure that critical management information reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate and timely to enable appropriate management decision making, and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, directions and instructions from management are carried out systematically and effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Under-Control-Governance-Across-Enterprise/dp/1430215925 |author = Lamm, Blount, etc. |title= Under Control: Governance Across the Enterprise |accessdate= 2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Risk management]] is the set of processes through which management identifies, analyzes, and, where necessary, responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect realization of the organization's business objectives. The response to risks typically depends on their perceived gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are arguably the key issue in GRC.
* [[Compliance (regulation)|Compliance]] means conforming with stated requirements. At an organizational level, it is achieved through management processes which identify the applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any corrective actions deemed necessary.

=== GRC market segmentation ===
A GRC program can be instituted to focus on any individual area within the enterprise, or a fully integrated GRC is able to work across all areas of the enterprise, using a single framework.

A fully integrated GRC uses a single core set of control material, mapped to all of the primary governance factors being monitored.  The use of a single framework also has the benefit of reducing the possibility of duplicated remedial actions.

When reviewed as individual GRC areas, the three most common individual headings are considered to be Financial GRC, IT GRC, and Legal GRC.

*Financial GRC relates to the activities that are intended to ensure the correct operation of all financial processes, as well as compliance with any finance-related mandates.
*IT GRC relates to the activities intended to ensure that the IT ([[Information Technology]]) organization supports the current and future needs of the business, and complies with all IT-related mandates.
*Legal GRC focuses on tying together all three components via an organization's legal department and [[chief compliance officer]].

Analysts disagree on how these aspects of GRC are defined as market categories.  [[Gartner]] has stated that the broad GRC market includes the following areas:
*Finance and audit GRC
*IT GRC management
*Enterprise risk management.

They further divide the IT GRC management market into these key capabilities.  Although this list relates to IT GRC, a similar list of capabilities would be suitable for other areas of GRC.
*Controls and policy library
*Policy distribution and response
*IT Controls self-assessment and measurement
*IT Asset repository
*Automated general computer control (GCC) collection
*Remediation and exception management
*Reporting
*Advanced IT risk evaluation and compliance dashboards

=== GRC product vendors ===
The distinctions between the sub-segments of the broad GRC market are often not clear.  With a large number of vendors entering this market recently, determining the best product for a given business problem can be challenging.  Given that the analysts don’t fully agree on the market segmentation, vendor positioning can increase the confusion.

Due to the dynamic nature of this market, any vendor analysis is often out of date relatively soon after its publication.

Broadly, the vendor market can be considered to exist in 3 segments:

*Integrated GRC solutions (multi-governance interest, enterprise wide)
*Domain specific GRC solutions (single governance interest, enterprise wide)
*Point solutions to GRC (relate to enterprise wide governance or enterprise wide risk or enterprise wide compliance but not in combination.)

Integrated GRC solutions attempt to unify the management of these areas, rather than treat them as separate entities.  An integrated solution is able to administer one central library of compliance controls, but manage, monitor and present them against every governance factor.  For example, in a domain specific approach, three or more findings could be generated against a single broken activity.  The integrated solution recognizes this as one break relating to the mapped governance factors.

Domain specific GRC vendors understand the cyclical connection between governance, risk and compliance within a particular area of governance.  For example, within financial processing&amp;nbsp;— that a risk will either relate to the absence of a control (need to update governance) and/or the lack of adherence to (or poor quality of) an existing control.  An initial goal of splitting out GRC into a separate market has left some vendors confused about the lack of movement.  It is thought that a lack of deep education within a domain on the audit side, coupled with a mistrust of audit in general causes a rift in a corporate environment.  However, there are vendors in the marketplace that, while remaining domain-specific, have begun marketing their product to end users and departments that, while either tangential or overlapping, have expanded to include the internal corporate internal audit (CIA) and external audit teams (tier 1 big four AND tier two and below), information security and operations/production as the target audience.  This approach provides a more 'open book' approach into the process.  If the production team will be audited by CIA using an application that production also has access to, is thought to reduce risk more quickly as the end goal is not to be 'compliant' but to be 'secure,' or as secure as possible.

Point solutions to GRC are marked by their focus on addressing only one of its areas.  In some cases of limited requirements, these solutions can serve a viable purpose.  However, because they tend to have been designed to solve domain specific problems in great depth, they generally do not take a unified approach and are not tolerant of integrated governance requirements.  [[Information system]]s will address these matters better if the requirements for GRC management are incorporated at the design stage, as part of a coherent framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bonazzi, R., Hussami, L. &amp; Pigneur, Y. |year=2009 |url=http://people.hec.unil.ch/ypigneur/files/2010/01/complianceManagement.pdf |chapter=Compliance Management is Becoming a Major Issue in IS Design |title=Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Technologies |publisher=Springer |pages=391–398 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2 |editor1-last=D'atri |editor1-first=Alessandro |editor2-last=Saccà |editor2-first=Domenico |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312075228/http://people.hec.unil.ch/ypigneur/files/2010/01/complianceManagement.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GRC data warehousing and business intelligence ===
GRC vendors with an integrated data framework are now able to offer custom built GRC data warehouse and business intelligence solutions.  This allows high value data from any number of existing GRC applications to be collated and analysed.

The aggregation of GRC data using this approach adds significant benefit in the early identification of risk and business process (and business control) improvement.

Further benefits to this approach include (i) it allows existing, specialist and high value applications to continue without impact (ii) organizations can manage an easier transition into an integrated GRC approach because the initial change is only adding to the reporting layer and (iii) it provides a real-time ability to compare and contrast data value across systems that previously had no common data scheme.'

== GRC research ==
A publication review carried out in 2009 {{Citation needed|reason="A study is cited without referencing that study"|date=March 2017}} found that there was hardly any scientific research on GRC. The authors went on to derive the first GRC short-definition from an extensive literature review. Subsequently, the definition was validated in a survey among GRC professionals. "GRC is an integrated, holistic approach to organisation-wide GRC ensuring that an organisation acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies and external regulations through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology and people, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness." The authors then translated the definition into a frame of reference for GRC research.

Each of the core disciplines – Governance, Risk Management and Compliance – consists of the four basic ''components'': strategy, processes, technology and people.
The organisation's [[risk appetite]], its internal policies and external regulations constitute the ''rules'' of GRC. The disciplines, their components and rules are now to be merged in an integrated, holistic and organisation-wide (the three main ''characteristics'' of GRC) manner&amp;nbsp;– aligned with the (business) operations that are managed and supported through GRC. In applying this approach, organisations long to achieve the ''objectives'': ethically correct behaviour, and improved efficiency and effectiveness of any of the elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Racz, N., Weippl, E. &amp; Seufert, A. |title=A frame of reference for research of integrated GRC |year=2010 |editor1=Bart De Decker |editor2=Ingrid Schaumüller-Bichl |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |pages=106–117 |isbn=978-3-642-13240-7 |volume=Communications and Multimedia Security, 11th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 International Conference, CMS 2010 Proceedings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustavs Ērenpreis''' (5 September 1891 – 19 May 1956) was a Latvian-born manufacturer of [[bicycles]] best known as recipient of the [[Order of the Three Stars]] and [[Cross of Recognition]], and as a founder and director of [[Gustavs Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory]], which in the 1930s was the largest manufacturer of bicycles in the Baltic states. Ērenpreis's bicycles were ridden by a generation of elite bicycle racers in [[Latvia]].

== Personal life ==
Gustavs Ērenpreis was the son of [[Mazsalaca Manor|Valtenberģi Manor]] coachman Lībijs and Anna. He was born in Vatenberģi (today, Mazsalaca city), [[Latvia]] which at that time was in the [[Russian Empire]].  Ērenpreis was educated at a trade school in [[Riga]].&lt;br /&gt;
He was married twice and had one child from the first marriage - a son Jānis, and four children from the second marriage - a son Juris and three daughters - Anita, Maija and Sarmīte.&lt;ref&gt;''Being happy for success of the relative/ Ar prieku par radinieka veikumu''. Interview with the son of Gustavs Ērenpreis, Andris Tiļļa. Latvijas Avīze, 17 April 2012, p. 5. Retrieved 08 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After graduation of trade school in Riga, in 1907 he worked at the Eduards Bērziņš bicycle workshop in [[Riga]], which produced bicycles and repaired and sold English [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] and [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycles in the [[Baltic states]]. During [[World War I]] he was evacuated with the workshop to [[Harkov]]. After the war the workshop equipment could not be recovered, and Gustavs had to return to Riga, Latvia without any equipment.

In 1921, following the end of the war,  Ērenpreis launched his own workshop, where in early years he repaired and sold abandoned [[military transport]]s of the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Bermont army]].&lt;ref name=FromLtoE /&gt; He moved into manufacturing the following year as the "G. Ērenpreis Motorcycle and Bicycle Workshop", where he first manufactured his own bicycles under the "Baltija" label.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt;

Due to rapid expansion, the limited space in his workshop had become a problem, and in 1924 the Ērenpreis workshop moved to a larger space.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; In 1926 Gustavs Ērenpreis and his business partners established a [[joint-stock company]] called Omega, but this entity was ultimately abandoned that same year.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt;

=== G. Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory ===
Those first manufacturing efforts were preliminary to the actual establishment of a new manufacturing entity called the G. Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory in 1927. The new firm continued in its previous quarters until, in 1931, construction began on a new, modern bicycle factory located on in Brīvības Street.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; 
Janis Seregins, the biggest bicycle collection owner in Baltics and the author of historic review of Latvian bicycle history "100 year of bicycle manufacturing in Latvia. From Leutner to Erenpreis" points out that by 1937 the factory had become the largest manufacturer of bicycles in the Baltic states.&lt;ref name=FromLtoE /&gt;

In addition to being the largest Latvian bicycle manufacture of its day, the G. Ērenpreis bicycle factory was regarded as the source of the highest quality bikes for Latvian competitive cyclists.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/sports/news/tautassports/news/latvijas-ritenbrauceju-vienibas-brauciens-toreiz-un-tagad.d?id=39999993 "Vienības brauciens – toreiz un tagad" (The Unity Ride - then and now)], the story of historic bicycle race in Latvia. Delfi, August 8, 2011. Accessed: February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Ērenpreis bicycles were ridden by the top Latvian cyclists of the era, including [[Olympic games|Olympic]] cyclists [[Arvīds Immermanis]] and [[Andrejs Apsītis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olimpiade.lv/lv/latvijas-olimpiesi/arvids-immermanis-231?ref=%3Fq%3Dimmermanis Arvīds Immermanis - Latvian Olympic], Official home page of [[Latvian Olympic Committee]]. Accessed February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationalization of factory and legacy ===

Unfortunately, [[World War II]] and the [[occupation of Latvia]] halted G. Ērenpreis bicycle factory work. The Ērenpreis company was [[nationalization|nationalized]] by the USSR and renamed the "Red Star Riga Bicycle Factory" (Rīgas Velosipēdu rūpnīca (RVR) "Sarkanā Zvaigzne"). Bicycle production continued at that company until 1963, when the factory was retooled and converted to the production of [[mopeds]].&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; Today G. Ērenpreis bicycles are exhibited at the [[Riga Motor Museum]] as part of the country's industrial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motormuzejs.lv/pub/index.php?lang=eng&amp;id=243 Made in Latvia - automobiles, bicycles and mopeds], www.motormuzejs.lv. Accessed 04 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2011, Gustavs hometown Mazsalaca has celebrated Gustavs Ērenpreis birthday in the festival "Velosvētki - Ērenpreisam 124" (bicycle festival - Ērenpreiss - 124 years old!")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mazsalaca.lv/index.php?zoomzina=362&amp;title=Velosv%C4%93tki+%26%2334%3B%C4%92renpreisam+124%26%2334%3B Velosvētki "Ērenpreisam 124"]. 20 June 2015. Accessed 04 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the brand was revived by Gustavs Ērenpreis' great grandnephew, Toms Ērenpreiss, who manufactures new [[Ērenpreiss Bicycles|Ērenpreiss bicycles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/may/06/the-bike-brand-that-helped-latvia-rediscover-its-cycling-heritage ''The bike brand that helped Latvia rediscover its cycling heritage''] by Emily Chappell, 06 May 2015.

'''Indian Accounting Standard '''(abbreviated as '''Ind-AS''') is the [[Accounting standard]] adopted by companies in India and issued under the supervison of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) which was constituted as a body in the year 1977. ASB is a committee under [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI) which consists of representatives from government department, academicians, other professional bodies viz. ICAI, representatives from ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI, etc.

The Ind AS are named and numbered in the same way as the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS). [[National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards]] (NACAS) recommend these standards to the [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Ministry of Corporate Affairs]] (MCA). MCA has to spell out the accounting standards applicable for companies in India. As on date MCA has notified 41 Ind AS. This shall be applied to the companies of financial year 2015-16 voluntarily and from 2016-17 on a mandatory basis.

Based on the international consensus, the regulators will separately notify the date of implementation of Ind-AS for the banks, insurance companies etc. Standards for the computation of Tax has been notified as ICDS in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Accounting Standards Converged with IFRS Notified|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=70248|publisher=Press Information Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instruction creep''' occurs when instructions increase in number and size over time until they are unmanageable. It can be insidious and damaging to the success of large groups such as corporations, originating from ignorance of the [[KISS principle]] and resulting in over-complex (as opposed to "simplified") procedures that are often misunderstood, followed with great irritation, or ignored.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instruction creep is common in complex organizations, where rules and guidelines are created by changing groups of people over extended periods of time.  The constant state of flux in such groups often leads them to add or modify instructions, rather than simplifying or consolidating existing ones.  This can result in considerable overlap in the message of directives, at the expense of clarity, efficiency, and communication, or even of consistency.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The fundamental fallacy of instruction creep is believing that people read instructions with the same level of attention and comprehension, regardless of the volume or complexity of those instructions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A byproduct is the advent of many new rules having the deliberate intent to control others via [[wikt:fiat#Noun|fiat]], without considering consensus or collaboration. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This tends to antagonize others, even when it appears to the instigators that they are acting with proper intent.

'''John Arthur Fentener van Vlissingen''' (born 4 March 1939 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) is a Dutch businessman. He is one of the wealthiest people in [[the Netherlands]] and has made major investments in the [[travel industry]]. The total capital of the family is, according to ''Quote'' magazine, around 9.2 billion euros. The wealth of Fentener van Vlissingen was  calculated to be €1.6 billion in ''Quote 500''.

Of the three brothers (Frits, who died in March 2006, and [[Paul Fentener van Vlissingen|Paul]], who died in August 2006) only John Fentener van Vlissingen's career was not with the family company, [[SHV Holdings]]. He began his own company, [[BCD Group|BCD Holdings N.V.]], a market leader in the travel industry. 

BCD Holdings began as a [[real estate]] company in 1975 as Property Management Advisory Services.  In 1976, the company was renamed  NORO since the name NIRO was already appropriated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Art of Enterprise-BCD Holdings 1975-2000'' {{ISBN|90-901399-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 BCD was founded, after the separation of Noro management advisories and investments by the establishment of BCD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1987, WorldTravel Advisors was purchased. In 1999, WorldTravel Advisors merged with BTI Americas to form WorldTravel BTI.  In 2006, WorldTravel BTI was renamed  BCD Travel with the takeover of the German company, TQ3, and the dissolution of the BTI brand, thus creating the third largest travel company in the United States.

John Fredriksen, Seatankers|date=12 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Fredriksen was born on 10 May 1944 to a welder and his wife, and grew up in Etterstad in the eastern half of [[Oslo]].

Fredriksen is a widower and has two twin daughters: Cecilie and [[Kathrine Fredriksen|Kathrine Astrup Fredriksen]] (both born 1983). Fredriksen's former wife, dentist Inger Astrup Fredriksen (died 2006), originally belonged to one of the Astrup families in Norway. Her father was a professor of psychiatry, and her grand uncle was the painter [[Nikolai Astrup]].

=== Business ===
Fredriksen made his fortune during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s, when his tankers picked up oil at great risk and huge profits. As described by his biographer, "he was the lifeline to the [[Ayatollah]]." Fredriksen would later become the world's largest tanker owner, with more than seventy oil tankers and major interests in oil rigs and fish farming. His fleet is dominated by costly double-hulled, environmentally safer tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/03/21/how-shipping-king-john-fredriksen-found-a-port-in-the-storm/|title=How Shipping King John Fredriksen Found A Port In The Storm|first=Christopher|last=Helman|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Seadrill bought more than 50 percent of [[Smedvig]], gaining control of the company (51.24 percent of the votes and 52.27 percent of the capital). Smedvig is Fredriksen's biggest ever deal. Noble Corp sold its stake to Seadrill in 2009, leaving Seadrill with full control.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Berglund [http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1266407.ece Smedvig now fully under Fredriksen's control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629155723/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1266407.ece |date=29 June 2011}} ''Aftenposten''; 3 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Fredriksen has been the majority owner of [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga I.F.]] for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Fortune ===
The ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' has ranked Fredriksen's wealth as £475m (2003), £1.050b (2004) and £1.887b (2005). In 2012, Fredriksen and his family were listed as the 9th richest in Britain with a combined wealth of £6.6bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunday Times Rich List shows UK's wealthiest defy recession|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17883101|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|date=28 April 2012|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredriksen owns houses in London, Oslo, Cyprus, and [[Marbella]], Spain. His house [[56 Old Church Street|The Old Rectory]] in London has been estimated to be worth around US$172 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/shipping-magnate-john-fredriksen-sticks-to-his-gut-feeling-invest/2012/09/21/0432903c-00dc-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html|title=Shipping magnate John Fredriksen sticks to his ‘gut feeling’: Invest|first1=Edward|last1=Robinson|first2=Michelle Wiese|last2=Bockmann|date=22 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a collector of classic Norwegian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bornrich.com/john-fredriksen.html|title=John Fredriksen - Bornrich|date=29 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===
Fredriksen supports research projects at [[Norwegian Radium Hospital|Radium Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ous-research.no/dgo/|title=Dept. of Gyn. Oncology - Cancer Medicine - Divisions - Oslo University Hospital Research|website=ous-research.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has donated several hundreds of millions of Norwegian kroner to medical research at hospitals in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/weekly/337168/messenger-boy-who-became-a-shipping-billionaire|title=Messenger boy who became a shipping billionaire|date=9 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gard'' case ===
In 1985, the Norwegian insurance company [[Assuranceforeningen Gard|Gard]] became suspicious about losses of cargo from Fredriksen's tankers. A private investigation was initiated, and a system for the use of heavy oil as bunker fuel was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;«For Oslo-advokatene ble Gisvolds reise slutten på den hemmelige etterforskningen. Man hadde nok, og dessuten var det nå bare et tidsspørsmål før Fredriksen fikk kjennskap til granskningen. Følgelig torde man ikke holde på lenger. Juristene anbefalte Gard å gå til politiet med sine mistanker.», fra Storeulv, side 106&lt;/ref&gt; The case was turned over to the Norwegian police and in June 1986 Fredriksen's offices in Oslo were searched and several of his nearest associates, and after a while also Fredriksen, were placed in detention while the case was investigated.&lt;ref&gt;«Samme morgen ble de seks arresterte fremstilt for Oslo forhørsrett. Siktelsen var grove oljetyverier og forsikringssvindel for cirka en million kroner.», fra Storeulv, side 125&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years of arguments between the various lawyers, the case was settled out of court. Fredriksen had to pay a fine of 2 million NOK&lt;ref&gt;«John Fredriksen måtte i 1990 godta en bot på to millioner kroner for å ha satt mannskapenes liv i fare ved å bruke olje fra lasten som drivstoff.», fra Storeulv, side 168&lt;/ref&gt; for risking his crew's lives, and in addition had to pay the insurance company Gard an amount of over {{US$}}800,000.&lt;ref&gt;«Fredriksen aksepterte å betale Gard 800,000-dollar, pluss halvparten av den Marine Management-konto de hadde tatt beslag i.», fra Storeulv, side 160&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KYCR''' (1440 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[radio station]] serving the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] metropolitan area. It is owned by [[Salem Media Group]], and is carrying a business radio format.

KYCR's studios are located in [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], while its transmitter is located in Golden Valley.

==History==
[[File:Radio Disney1440 2010.png|left|150px|thumb|''Radio Disney 1440'' logo used from 2010 to 2013.]]
The original call letters were '''KEYD''' and the station played [[country music]] for many years. The station was launched in May 1948 by former management and advertisers of [[KFAN (AM)|WDGY]], who had become disenchanted with the owners of that station over the discontinuance of religious programming. Family Broadcasting basically started the station as a new home for the spurned WDGY programming. KEYD got a sister TV station in 1955, KEYD-TV 9 (now [[KMSP-TV]]), and the two stations were co-owned by Family Broadcasting until mid-[[1956 in radio|1956]]. The original KEYD radio studios were located in downtown [[Minneapolis]] on 9th Street off of Hennepin Avenue practically next to the Orpheum Theater (see photo link below). According to the 1955 Broadcasting Yearbook, both the AM and TV stations were co-located in the Foshay Tower by the end of 1955.

The [[call sign]] was changed to '''KEVE''' in June 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAoEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1956-06-23|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the studios moved to the station's transmitter and antenna site at 917 Lilac Drive in Golden Valley. During that time, the station played [[country music]]. [[KQRS-FM|KEVE-FM]] (92.5 FM) signed on September 1, 1962, and by October 1963, it was given the call letters '''KADM''' to match its AM sister as the pair became known as "Adam and Eve in the Valley"; the city of license for the two stations is the suburb of Golden Valley. A gradual shift from country music to a mix of [[classical music]], [[show tunes]] and [[adult standards]] began in 1960 and was completed on both stations by March 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQsEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1963-03-30|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1964, the call letters for both stations became '''[[KQRS-FM|KQRS]]''' for "Quality Radio Stations".

In 1967, the stations began experimenting with [[freeform (radio format)|freeform rock]] music from midnight to 5 AM every night via the "Night Watch" program, playing [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[jazz]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. The foray proved successful and by the end of 1968 it became the full-time format.

The two KQs were a simulcast until 1982, when the AM briefly switched to an  [[oldies]] format as '''KGLD''' before returning to the simulcast. The KGLD calls became effective November 22, 1982, with the KQRS calls returning on March 28, 1984.

In 1985, [[ABC Radio Network]], then a division of the original [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC, Inc.]] bought the station and its main FM counterpart with it from previous owner Hudson Communications Corporation, a radio broadcasting company owned by [[Washington D.C.]] lawyer Joe McKenna, which owned the station from 1956 to 1985. Along with its main FM sister, it was ABC's first foray into the Minnesota broadcast market. At first, ABC programmed the station with a [[classic rock]] format, albeit essentially being an AM simulcast of its FM sister at the time from 1985 until 1996.

The station again broke away from the simulcast in late 1996, this time permanently, when it became one of the four initial affiliates of the new Radio Disney with a children's format that competed with [[WWTC]], then the flagship station of "[[Radio Aahs]]," which had its own children's format. The station's call letters changed to '''KDIZ''' on November 15, 1996. With the advent of [[HD Radio]], KDIZ began broadcasting with the technology, as did most other Radio Disney affiliates.

Disney had previously been collaborating with [[Children's Broadcasting Corporation|Radio Aahs]], which was based in Minneapolis and had launched its children's format in 1990. Radio Aahs had grown to approximately 30 affiliate stations around the country. Disney withdrew from the Aahs contract and began competing against Aahs with Radio Disney. Children's Broadcasting Corp. sued Disney and was awarded $9.5 million in 2002. Disney appealed, and after the court upheld the judgement, it was paid in 2005; with accumulated interest, the total was $12.4 million.

On November 12, 2005, the station made world news when a riot erupted at its "Jingle Jam Concert" featuring [[B5 (band)|B5]], forcing the venue, Brookdale Mall, to be closed. Members of the group were stripped of shirts, shoes and earrings.

On August 13, 2014, Disney put KDIZ and twenty-two other [[Radio Disney]] stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-radiodisneysell2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lafayette|first1=Jon|title=Exclusive: Radio Disney Moving Off Air to Digital|url=http://broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-radio-disney-moving-air-digital/133166|accessdate=August 13, 2014|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-selling&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Disney to Sell the Majority of Its Stations|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6214509/radio-disney-to-sell-the-majority-of-its-stations|website=Billboard|accessdate=13 August 2014|ref=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It held the distinction of being not only the longest-tenured Radio Disney station in its history, but also one of ABC's longest-tenured non-mainstream radio stations in its history. It was also the last-remaining Disney/ABC broadcast property in Minnesota, having had sold the others in 2007, with ABC Radio going to [[Citadel Broadcasting]] ([[KXXR]], acquired in 1993, [[Love 105]], acquired in 1997, and [[KQRS-FM]], acquired in 1985).

On September 15, 2015, it was announced that [[Salem Media Group]] acquired the last five Radio Disney owned-and-operated stations for sale (including KDIZ) for $2.225 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/94556/salem-acquires-radio-disneys-final-five/|title=Salem Acquires Radio Disney’s Final Five|date=2015-09-15|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; KDIZ was acquired through Common Ground Broadcasting, Inc., for $375.000.&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Application for Consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1686442&amp;Service=AM&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=35504|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salem put a business format on the station in December 2015 (taken from 1570 AM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/95554/salem-debuts-new-stations-in-denver-minneapolis/|title=Salem Debuts New Stations In Denver &amp; Minneapolis|date=2015-12-17|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a brief period of silence.

With the sale to Salem, the company shut off the station's HD Radio transmission.

In '''Bulgaria''', the '''[[law of obligations]]''' is set out by the Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA). According to art. 20a OCA contracts shall have the force of a law for the parties that have concluded them.

==  I. General Part ==

{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

== Contract ==

In [[Bulgaria]] the contract is one of the prerequisites for the development of obligatory relations. The term contract refers to a bilateral legal transaction, which consists of two declarations of intent (offer and acceptance) hat must be linked to each other and match in their contents. A contract is considered concluded from the moment in which the acceptance reaches the offeror (art. 14 OCA). The parties conclude the contract, because they have as their object the occurrence of certain legal consequences. In accordance with art. 9 OCA. the parties may determine the content of the contract insofar as it does not contravene the mandatory provisions of the law and good morals. In Bulgaria, the separation principle and the abstraction principle do not apply. In contracts for the transfer of ownership to generically certain things, ownership passes when the goods are determined by agreement between the parties and in the absence of such agreements - at handover. As for ownership transfer contracts and contracts of establishing or transferring some other property right over a specific chattel, the transfer or the establishment shall occur by virtue of the contract itself and shall not require that the chattel be delivered.
(according to art. 24 OCA).

===   Form of Contract ===

The OCA provides that contracts of ownership transfer and those of establishing other property rights on immovable property must be executed through a notarial deed.

== Invalidity ==

Contracts that violate legal requirements or show other legal deficits are invalid. Regarding invalid contracts, there are two subgroups to distinguish: void contracts and voidable contracts.

=== Voidable contracts ===

Initially, voidable contracts are contract that are valid and binding unless avoided or declared void by a party to them on the grounds prescribed by the law. General legal provisions regarding these grounds are provided in the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA); specific legal provisions are (inter alia) contained in the Family code, the Law on Protection of Competition and the Inheritance law. Invalidation may be claimed only by the party in whose interest the law allows such invalidation. A contract subject to invalidation may be ratified by the party entitled to demand its invalidation, by way of an instrument in writing which should indicate the grounds for invalidation.
A contract shall also be ratified where the party entitled to demand its invalidation voluntarily performs it, in whole or in part, being aware of the grounds for invalidation.
A contract which is subject to invalidation on grounds of extreme necessity may not be ratified. According to art. 27 OCA a contract may be subject to invalidation of the following grounds:
* Legal incapacity – if a contract is concluded by incapable persons or by their representatives not respecting the specific legal provisions for representation;
* According to Article 28 of the Act, a material mistake may cause the cancellation of the contract. If the contract has been concluded with regard to a specific person being one of the parties to it (intuitu personae) a mistake concerning this person may render the contract void.
* Fraud - According to Article 29 of the Act, a fraud may cause the cancellation of the contract under the condition that one party has been deceived maliciously to enter into the contractual relationship. If the fraud has been induced by a third party, the deceived party may request the cancellation of the contract if the other party knew or ought to have known of the fraud.
* A contract may be cancelled if one of the contracting parties concluded the contract out of reasonable fear induced by threats from the other party or third person.
* Incapacity to comprehend one’s own actions - If a person capable of acting is enabled to comprehend his own actions while concluding a contract, the contract may be cancelled.
* Stringent necessity - The contract is voidable as well if it has been concluded under stringent necessity and under apparently unfavorable conditions for one of the parties. The court may cancel the contract completely or in the future. If the other party offers to compensate the damages, the contract may remain in force.

=== Void contracts ===

According to the concept of void contracts used by the Bulgarian lawmakers these contracts should be regarded as if they had never been concluded. The void contracts are those which have no legal effect because of their defectiveness from their conclusion and where a conformation is usually not possible. Contracts contravening or circumventing the law, as well as contracts infringing good morals, including contracts on inheritance that does not exist as yet, shall be null and void. Null and void shall also be those contracts that have an impossible subject, as well as the contracts which lack either consent or a form prescribed by law, or grounds. Fictitious contracts are also null and void. The grounds shall be presumed to exist until otherwise proved.

=== Partial invalidity ===

The invalidity of few clauses does not render the entire contract void given that the clauses may be replaced by binding prescriptions of the law or if the transaction is supposed to have been concluded even without the void clauses.
If the contract is declared invalid, each party must pay back what he has received from the other party.

=== Reinterpretation ===

If an invalid contract complies with the requirements of another legal transaction, the former is valid and considered transformed in the latter given that the parties would have agreed to conclude the latter.

==  Representation ==

The representation is governed by art. 36-43 OCA. The Representation is a legal institution referring to legal actions of one person (agent) on behalf of another (principal) whereby the principal has to bear the consequences resulting from the agent’s legal actions. here are two forms of representation to be distinguished: voluntary representation – here, the representation is wanted and organized by the principal; and the second form is obligatory representation imposed by the law – in this case the law itself requires representation by certain persons.

=== Formation ===

* declaration of intent made by a private person:
- from the principal’s unilateral declaration of intent (authorisation), e.g. his last will
- a contract.
* Formation of representation power by an enactment:
- If the representation power arises from an administrative act, e.g. if the administrative act is appointed by a guardian that hereby obtains actual authority
- from a court decision
- from a child’s birth (parents obtain the actual authority for their child).

=== Preconditions for a successful representation ===

#  The agent must deliver an own declaration of intent. To guarantee the declaration of intent delivered by the agent, he must be capable of acting.
#  The agent must deliver the declaration of intent in the name of the principal. He must make obvious that he is acting in someone else’s name.
#  The agent must have powers of representation and act within these powers. If the agent and the person he negotiates with reach an agreement to the detriment of the principal, the contract shall not be binding on the latter. If several persons have been authorised to exercise the same right to act, each of them may perform the act by himself unless something else is provided by the authorisation.
#  In several cases, where strictly personal legal actions are required (marriages, wills etc.) agency is inadmissible as in these cases the legal actions are decided by the personal estimation of the person.

=== Termination ===

The representation is cancelled in the following cases:
* with the death of the agent or principal;
* with the dissolution of the legal entity;
* with the incapacitation of the agent or principal;
* with the withdrawal of the representation powers;
* with the adoption;
* regarding the guardianship over persons placed under disability: with the cancellation of the guardianship etc.

== Default ==

=== Debtor’s default ===

If for the performance of an obligation a time limit has been fixed, the debtor is in default when he is unable to meet the obligation within this time limit. If there is no date fixed for the performance, the debtor is in default after the creditor’s request for performance. If the obligation arose due to a tort action, the default for the payment of the damages occurs without a request, from the date of the tort.
If the debtor is in default, he must pay damages even if the performance becomes impossible for reasons for which he is not responsible unless he can prove that the creditor would have suffered the loss/damage also in case of a timely performance.
The damages due to a default encompass the suffered damages as well as any lost profit, provided that the suffered damage is directly linked to the default and the profit could be expected under the contract. If the debtor did not act in good faith, he is liable for all direct and indirect damages.

=== Creditor’s default ===

According to Article 95 of the law of obligations and contracts, the creditor defaults if he does not accept the delivery/performance offered by the debtor or if he does not cooperate when this is required for the fulfillment of the obligation.

== Transfer of claim ==

=== Assignment ===

According to Article 99 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a creditor may transfer his claims, provided that neither the law, a contract or the nature of the claim dictates otherwise. he transferred claim including the prerogatives, the remuneration and all other additions as well as the accrued interest passes on to the new creditor, unless something else is appointed. The old creditor must inform the debtor about the transfer of claim and hand over all present documents regarding the claim to the new creditor. Besides, the creditor must confirm the transfer in writing. The transfer is effective regarding third parties and the debtor from the day that the debtor gets informed by the old creditor. Regarding the transfer of claim for consideration, the old creditor is liable for the validity of the claim at the time of the transfer. The old creditor is only liable for the debtor’s ability to pay if he pledged himself to and only to the amount that he obtained by transferring the claim.

=== Stepping in as co-debtor ===

With the approval of creditor and/or debtor, an obligation may also be joined by a third person as co- debtor. If the creditor agreed to the joining, it may not be cancelled or modified without his consent. The principal debtor and the co-person are jointly and severally liable toward the creditor. The debtor may be substituted by third parties only with the explicit consent of the creditor. The substituted debtor is relieved from the liability towards the creditor. The securities given by third parties expire if they do not agree on serving the new creditor. Pledges and mortgages that have been given to the first creditor remain effective. The new debtor may plead against the creditor any defenses of the former debtor arising from the transferred legal relationship.

==  Unlawful Acts ==

The definition of the term unlawful acts can be derived from art. 45 OCA – if a person causes guiltily damage to another person, they must redress it. In all cases of tort guilt is presumed until proven otherwise.  This provision applies to all natural persons. The legal entities are liable in accordance with art. 49 OCA as principal. The subject of the tort act must be a person with legal capacity to be held liable for tort action. That is why A person lacking the capacity to understand or control his actions shall not be liable for the damage he has caused while in such a state unless he himself has faultily caused his lack of capacity (47 OCA). The legal capacity shall be evaluated in each particular case – for majors as well as for minors. In cases of self-defence the liability is excluded. It is supposed that the tortfeasor’s actions are not unlawful per se. However, in cases of stringent necessity, the created damage has to be repaired – even if the actions were not culpable, the result is unlawful.
The OCA provides for several cases of liability in case of unlawful acts:

=== Responsibility of persons with legal duty to care for incapable persons ===

The person with legal duty to care for incapable persons (e.g. teachers) is liable for damage caused by the person unable to act, unless the occurrence of the damage could not have been prevented.

=== Responsibility of parents (art. 48 OCA) ===

Parents and adoptive parents that exercise parental rights are liable for the damage caused by their minor children living with them. The guardian is liable for damage caused by his ward living with him.The abovementioned persons are not liable if they were unable to prevent the occurrence of the damage.

=== Responsibility of the principal ===

The principal is liable for the damage caused by his commissary while performing the imposed work. This legal provision is not applicable regarding contracts for work – there the person performing the work is personally liable. The principal may exercise his right on action for recourse/claim towards the commissary.

=== Responsibility for damage caused by items ===

The owner and supervisor of items are jointly and severally liable for damage caused by items of any kind. If the damage was caused by animals, the owner/supervisor is liable even if the animal ran away or got lost. Dangerousness per se or other specific characteristics of the item are not required.The owner and the supervisor are liable regardless of their personal fault; their behaviour must not be unlawful or culpable. If they prove that the damage was caused by a force majeure, by actions of third parties or by the actions of the aggrieved party, they do not carry responsibility.

== Unjustified enrichment ==

A person is obliged to return whenever that person has obtained something without legal basis or if the legal basis did not occur or has ceased later on (art. 55). What has been performed regarding moral obligations may not be claimed back.

===  Return ===

If a specific item is to be returned the recipient owes its yields as well at the time of the request. If the item that is to be returned vanishes after the request or if the recipient affected the item or used it up, knowing that he owns it without legal basis or, if the revenues he obtained from the item were higher, he is obligated to pay compensation. If the item has vanished, has been affected or used up before the time of the request, the recipient only has to compensate what he availed excluding the yields. Where restitution is owed by a person of legal incapacity only what has been used to his benefit may be claimed from him. Excluding the cases named above, each person that obtained something from someone without legal basis must pay the enrichment until the state of impoverishment. This right is justified if no other claim to defend the impoverished person is present.

===  Repayment of another person’s obligation in accordance with art. 56 OCA ===

If a person pays another person’s obligation by mistake, he has the right to claim it back from the creditor unless the latter one renounced the document or repayment of the obligation in good faith. In the latter case, the person that paid the obligation receives the creditor’s rights.

== Offsetting ==

If two persons owe each other money or similar and replaceable goods, it is possible for them to offset/to balance their mutual outstanding debts with each other under condition of maturity and solvency of both debts. The counterparty must be notified about the offsetting. When making an offset of a claim no time limits or conditions may be imposed, except for the condition that the offsetting shall be taken into account only in case the claim is brought to court. The two reciprocal claims shall be considered as extinct to the amount of the lower one as of the day on which the offsetting could have been made. The offsetting is also possible after prescription of one of the claims, if it would have been admissible before the expiry of the limitation period. If the debtor agreed to an assignment of the debt, he may not offset his obligation with the assigned one regarding his old creditor. Claims that are not subject to forcible execution and claims ensuing from wilful wrongful acts and claims for taxes cannot be set-off without the creditor's consent.

== Reconsideration (art. 107 OCA) ==

If the debt is renewed with another one with the creditor’s consent, the debt may be reconsidered. In these instances, the securities of the old debt remain in force if their providers have given their consent.

== Waiver ==

The claim may be waived if the creditor renounces his claim by a contract with the debtor.

== Limitation ==

The term „limitation“ describes a specific time period, after whose expiry the legal entity loses the right to assert and legally enforce his claims.

===  Limitation periods ===

The limitation period starts with the maturity of the claim. If agreed that the claim becomes due after request, the limitation period starts with the moment that the liability has been stated. Regarding tortious compensation claims, the limitation period starts from the point in time of acquiring knowledge of the offender. Regarding compensation claims on grounds of default, the limitation period starts with the day that the contractual penalty has been calculated. The general rules concerning the limitation are contained in the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts but there exist special regulations providing shorter limitation periods and other regulations that differ from the general rules:
* 5-year limitation period – according to art. 110 after the expiry of 5 years, all claims without legally provided limitation period prescribe;
* 3-year limitation period - According to Article 111 of the law, the following claims prescribe after 3 years have passed:
a) claims derived from an employment relationship, if there is no other limitation period provided;
b) damage compensation claims and contractual penalties in case of non-performance of a contract;
c) claims derived from tenancies, interests and other regular payments;
* 1-year limitation period - Regarding sales of immovable property with defects, the limitation period is one year as well;
* 6-month limitation period - A limitation period of 6 months is provided regarding claims for defects of movable property and other claims provided by the commercial law. 
Agreements regarding a shortening or extension of fixed limitation periods as well as such regarding the renunciation of the limitation before it expired, are ineffective.

=== Suspension of the limitation period ===

The time between the occurrence of reasons for the suspension and their disappearance is not included, hence the remaining limitation period continues.
The limitation period is suspended:
* between children and their parents whereby parents exercise their parental rights;
* between guardian and child for the duration of the guardianship;
* between spouses;
* regarding claims of persons whose assets are administrated by law or by an order of the court, against the administrator during the time of administration;
* regarding claims for damages of legal entities against their manager during the time of their appointment;
* regarding claims raised by minors or mentally immature persons for the time that they do not have a legal representative or guardian and 6 months starting from the time that a guardian has been appointed or the legal incapacity has been fixed;
* for the duration of a trial regarding the claim.

=== Interruption of the limitation period ===

If a limitation period has been interrupted, a new limitation period begins. If the claim has been defined by the court, the limitation period is always 5 years. The limitation is interrupted when the debtor’s claim is approved; when an action has been brought to court or in case of an appeal against the conciliation procedure; if the action or the appeal has been dismissed, the limitation period is uninterrupted; when enforcement procedure has been started. What has been performed to fulfil a claim barred by the statute of limitation cannot be reclaimed even if it has been performed due to ignorance of the limitation.

== Joint several liability ==

Joint several liability exists when two or more parties are liable for one obligation. The creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party but he has only one cause of action. The persons who are liable for the obligation are called joint several debtors. The joint several liability is settled in art. 121 – 127 from the Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA). Joint liability can come into being: 
* by law;
* from a contract (e.g. in case of a guarantee contract the guarantor undertakes an obligation before another's creditor to be liable for the performance of the other's obligation)

=== Effects of the joint several liability ===

The absolute effect means that one juristic act affects all joint several debtors in the same way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one several liability debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all joint several liability debtors.
The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the joint several liability debtors is the reason for one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the joint several debtors might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the joint several liability debtors does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the joint several liability is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect.
If one of the joint several liability debtors to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.

== Guarantee ==

The guarantee agreement obliges the guarantor to be personally responsible for the fulfillment of obligations/liabilities of the main debtor. The guarantee has to be confirmed in writing. Subject of the guarantee can be only existing obligations. It may be issued for parts of the debtor’s obligation or under more favorable conditions. The guarantor and the main debtor are jointly liable. The guarantor remains obliged under the given guarantee if the creditor has claimed payment from the debtor within 6 months after the due date of payment.

== Pledge ==

In Bulgaria it is possible that for safeguarding a claim, a pledge is created on movable property or the claim itself. The right of pledge is an accessory right – it appears and disappears with the transfer of the safeguarded claim.

=== Pledge on movable property ===

The pledge agreement is only effective if the pledged object is handed over to the creditor. The only obligation of the creditor is to store the pledged object until the full repayment of the secured claim. He may not benefit from the pledge, unless there is an agreement for that.

=== Pledge on claims ===

Only claims that are able to be transferred may be pledged. The contract of pledge regarding a claim may not be set against third parties if the pledge has not been displayed towards the debtor. The pledger is obliged to hand over the documents verifying the pledged claims (if existing) to the pledge. The creditor is obliged to perform any necessary actions serving its maintenance, e.g. collecting the interest and also the principal sum.

== Mortgage ==

According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim. According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim.

=== Creation of the mortgage ===

The mortgage shall be created through registration in the Property Register on the grounds of a contract or by operation of law. It may be established only on separately specified properties and for a specific sum of money.
A mortgage by operation of law:

#  in favour of the alienator of immovable property - on the alienated property as security for his claims under the contract, and
#  in favour of the co-partitioners to whom a supplementing of the share is due - on immovable property left in the share of a co-partitioner who is liable for the supplementing of the share.
The creation of a mortgage is invalid if either the mortgage contract or the application for creation of a mortgage by operation of law or the deed pursuant to which it is filed does not specify the identity of the creditor or the owner or the debtor, or does not specify the identity of the property or the secured claim or the amount of the sum the mortgage is created for. A creditor whose claim is secured by a mortgage is entitled to be satisfied preferentially from the mortgaged property's price, whoever its owner might be. The right to a preferential satisfaction also applies to the income from the property from the date on which the owner must give account of such income under forcible execution pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure.

=== Deletion of the mortgage ===

The deletion of a mortgage is only possible with the creditor’s consent – in a notarized form, or on the basis of an effective court ruling. The deletion shall be made upon an application with the deed of consent or a copy of the effective court ruling attached thereto. It shall be made through entering a note in the lot of the mortgaged property. The deletion extinguishes the mortgage.

== II. Special Part ==

{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

== Purchase ==
With the conclusion of a purchase contract, the seller obligates himself to transfer property or rights to the purchaser; the purchaser obligates himself to pay the agreed amount of money. The expenses related to the contract and all costs related to the transfer of the property are to be borne by the purchaser, except the purchase of estates where the expenses are divided equally. The risk of accidental loss passes to the purchaser upon the moment that the parties agreed upon the goods resp. upon the moment of transfer.

=== Obligations of the seller ===

The seller is obliged to transfer the sold property/right to the purchaser. In the moment of the sale, the property must be transferred including its yields.

=== Sale of an object resp. an object for which third parties have rights ===

If the sold object belongs completely to the ownership of a third party, the purchaser is entitled to dissolve the sale according to the regulations of Article 87 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act.

=== The seller’s liability for defects ===

The seller is liable for defects in the sold object that substantially reduce the value or the suitability for its required use. The seller is also liable if the defect was unknown to him. Any agreements that exempt the seller from his liability are void.

=== The purchaser’s rights regarding the liability for defects ===

In cases that the seller is liable according to Article 139 of the law of obligations and contracts, the purchaser may return the object and demand the reimbursement of the price paid and of the expenses related to the sale. Regarding the non-performance of the obligations, he is entitled to a claim for compensation according to the general provisions.

=== The purchaser’s obligations ===

The purchaser is obliged to pay the agreed price and to receive the object. The payment is to be made in the moment and at the place that the object is transferred. If the sold object produces yields or other revenues, the purchaser owes interest on the price from the day of the transfer, even if the price is not due.

==  Donation ==

The donation is a bilateral contract with the immediate and gratuitous assignment of an object performed by the giver in favour of the donee (who must accept the donation).

=== Types of contracts ===

There are 3 types of donation contracts to be distinguished:
#  indifferent donation – usual case,
#  donation by obligation – due to moral obligations,
#  donation by decency.
The significance of this division becomes apparent in respect of the donation’s revocation: Donations made due to moral obligations or decency may not be revoked.

=== Formal requirements ===

According to Article 226 OCA, the promise of donation is not binding – consequently, pre-contracts regarding donations are void. Concerning the formal requirements, there are two types of donations to be distinguished: the formal donation and the donation issued by hand (resp. Article 225 (2) of the law of obligations and contracts). Regarding the donation of real estate, the validity requires a notarial certification; regarding the donation of mobility the form is eased: only the notarial certification of the signatures is required; regarding the donation of securities, the respective form of transfer must be maintained.

== Loan ==

=== End of the contract ===

The loan agreement may be concluded for a specific period and is terminated with its expiration. Same applies accordingly if the contract has been concluded for a specific purpose.

If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obliged to perform the work on his own account. The contract for manufacture is always a legal relationship in return for payment.

=== Obligations and rights of the contractor ===

If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obligated to perform the work on his own account.The contractor is obligated to perform the work in a way that it is suitable to its usual or contractually provided use.The contractor that performs the work using his own material is liable for its quality.

* demand a gratuitous supplementary performance within an adequate period of time;
* demand the reimbursement of costs that arose with the rework or the reduction of the remuneration.
In cases of significant deviations from the agreed condition or defects that unfit the work for the usual usage or the contractually provided purpose, the customer is entitled to cancel the contract.

'''List of United States business school rankings''' is a tabular listing of some of the [[business school]]s and their affiliated [[university|universities]] located in the [[United States]] that are included in one or more of the rankings of full-time [[Master of Business Administration]] programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive [[list of business schools in the United States]]. These rankings are a subset of [[college and university rankings]]. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a [[university]] or [[college]] that produces students who attain [[business administration]] degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are [[accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for [[undergraduate]], [[part-time]] and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] and [[Academic administration|administrators]] in [[Higher education in the United States|American institutions of higher education]] regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the [[List of colleges and universities which have signed the Presidents Letter|President's letter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html|title=President's Letter|publisher=The Education Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing significance==
Business school rankings are important to the various business schools because they are an important [[marketing]] tool used to recruit top students, and lure [[recruiter]]s from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school,&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt; and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/faq_meth_brief.php#one|title=Frequently Asked Questions–Rankings|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half of recruiters said they believe the quality of MBA graduates is the same or better currently compared with past years.  Some of the most renowned schools, such as Harvard and Stanford, do not rank as highly as their stature might suggest. Recruiters complain that they often find graduates of some of the most famous institutions more arrogant and less collegial than the MBAs they meet at other schools. Recruiters also noted that "some of the large, elite schools also don't seem to enjoy as many close, personal relationships with recruiters as smaller MBA programs do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Alsop | first =Ronald| title =M.B.A. Survey: Something Old, Something New | date =September 20, 2006  | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115860376846766495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking techniques==
The rankings are based on a variety of factors such as [[standardized test]] scores of students, [[salary]] of recent graduates, survey results of graduates and/or recruiters, the specific schools that choose to participate in a market survey, the number of top companies recruiting at the school and a variety of attributes.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/bschool06/20060920-alsop-mblede.html|title=The Top Business Schools: Something Old, Something New|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|date=2006-09-20|work=The Wall Street Journal Online |author=Alsop, Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings vary significantly by method used to determine the success of each program. For instance, the ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Financial Times]]'' results are based on long-term graduate career progress concerns, the ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' and ''[[Economist]]'' polls evaluate short-term experiences of the students with their program, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' consider the recent experiences of recruiters with the program, and other rankings like the [[Aspen Institute]] ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' measure integration of sustainability material into business programs.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How the rankings compare: A matter of judgment|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della and Wai Kwen Chan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117100300/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2008-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' uses a combination of the objective and subjective as well. The magazine seeks "expert opinion about program quality and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school's faculty, research, and students." However, it ranks a broad spectrum of [[professional school]] programs such as business schools, [[law school]]s, and [[medical school]]s as well as a variety of programs specific [[academic discipline]]s such as the [[social science]]s or [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08method_brief.php|title=How We Do the Numbers|author=Morse, Robert J. and Samuel Flanigan|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business opinion data incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of professionals who actually do the hiring of the new MBA graduates from the schools. The statistical data combines measures of the qualities of the incoming students and as well as the faculty with measures of post graduate success as related to their degrees.&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR/&gt; There were 382 programs that responded out of 402 solicited, and the formula used a strict combination of quality assessment (40%), placement success (35%), and student selectivity (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' rankings, which are based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of corporate recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October of even numbered years.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2006/bs20060420_4380.htm#MBA1|title=MBA Rankings: Updated October 2006|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|work=BusinessWeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of their programs was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many [[MBA]]s a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating [[academic publishing|academic publication]]s in journals, books written, and faculty size.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

The ''Forbes magazine'' methodology was to calculate a five-year [[return on investment]] for 2002 graduates. ''Forbes'' surveyed 18,500 [[alumni]] of 102 MBA programs and used their pre-enrollment and post-graduate business school salary information as a basis for comparing post-MBA compensation with the cost of attending the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/16/business-school-methodology-biz-07mba_cz_kb_0816bschoolmeth.html|title=Best Business Schools: Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|date=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], the [[business information]] arm of the [[Economist Group]], gathered results from two [[internet]] [[questionnaire]]s, one of business schools and one of their students and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. Information provided by the schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and alumni network. Results were tabulated using a [[smoothing]] method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, with the result that some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mba.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=wmba_rank_method|title=Rankings methodology|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' poll was the result of over 10,000 respondents to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates in each of the last three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent [[response rate (survey)|response rate]]. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the ''Financial Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How to read the rankings: How the raw data are processed|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Milton, Ursula|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217140636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey responses are audited by [[KPMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=Auditing: Aim for accuracy|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227082805/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' has also produced a "ranking of rankings" summarizing five of the individual rankings (''The Economist'', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Forbes'', ''Financial Times''). They produce United States, and European summary rankings based on all five and a global summary ranking using the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Economist'' and ''Financial Times''. The summary is based on underlying polls in which a school placed in the top ten using an [[average]] of the [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] placements. The summary excludes the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' results.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt;

The ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' includes every institution that has any [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureates]], [[Fields Medal]]s, and highly cited researchers. In addition, major universities of every country with significant amount of papers indexed by Science Citation Index-Expanded ([[Science Citation Index|SCIE]]) and Social Science Citation Index ([[Social Science Citation Index|SSCI]]) are also included. Having alumni of an institution winning [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] since 1951 attributes 10% of the score. Staff of an institution winning [[Turing Award]]s in computer science since 1961 contributes 15% of the score. Highly cited researchers in economics/business category get 25% weighting. Papers indexed in SSCI in economics/business fields gets 25%. Finally, the percentage of papers published in top 20% journals of economics/business fields to that in all economics/business journals gets 25% weighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/ARWUSubjectMethodology2010.jsp|title=Ranking methodology|accessdate=2013-03-05|publisher=[[Shanghai Jiaotong University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rankings  based on attributes other than standardized test scores, salary of graduates, and similar attributes also exist. The ''[[Beyond Grey Pinstripes]]'' ranking, compiled by the [[Aspen Institute]] and published biannually, is based entirely on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Data for this survey is solicited from university administrators at accredited colleges, and audited by teams of Ph.D. scoring fellows. Rankings are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=2011-06-18|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ranking of business schools has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Caution and Controversy | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-26 | df =  }} The article contains an extensive bibliography of critical sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=April 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, and/or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, [[INSEAD]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hemel | first=Daniel J | title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students | publisher=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | date=12 April 2004 | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 | accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[MBA]] programs, one study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can duplicate some of the ranking order found in top 20 lists of Business Week and U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt;

==Rankings==

===Historical rankings===
The historical rankings of the top MBA programs show little variation, even over a long time period. In 1977, ''MBA Magazine'' surveyed business schools deans to come up with a ranking which listed [[The Wharton School]], [[Harvard Business School]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], the [[Booth School of Business]], and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] as their top 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rush to the M.B.A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage|work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]|date=January 1979|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools plus the [[Kellogg School of Management]] have always comprised the top 5 schools in every [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Business Schools |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |work=US News and World Report |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142224/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of [[Columbia Business School]], these seven schools which are most frequently listed at the top of various rankings (and are the top seven worldwide in the [[Business Insider]] ranking) have been referred to as "America's seven most powerful schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News from the schools, April 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15895173|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Master of Science in [[Marketing]]''' (or '''MS Marketing''') is a [[graduate degree]] that prepares the student to work in [[middle-management]]-and-above marketing positions.  The specific field within marketing will depend on the student, their program, and the firm with which they will work.  Fields may include [[brand management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Krey|first2=Nina|last3=Babin|first3=Barry J.|last4=Ivens|first4=Bjoern S.|date=2016-08-01|title=Brand management in higher education: The University Brand Personality Scale|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296316000369|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=69|issue=8|pages=3077–3086|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.01.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wymbs|first=Cliff|year=2011|title=Digital Marketing: The Time for a New "Academic Major" Has Arrived|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Education|volume=1–14|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated marketing communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036381119190020L?via=ihub|title=Integrated marketing communications: A new master's degree concept |language=en|access-date=2017-03-29|doi=10.1016/0363-8111(91)90020-L|volume=17|journal=Public Relations Review|pages=237–244 | last1 = Caywood | first1 = Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing [[analytics]] and [[research]], [[marketing strategy]], [[pricing strategy]] and many others.
 
The key difference between the MS Marketing degree and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree is the required number of marketing courses in the degree.  Typically the MBA degree may have a concentration in marketing or other fields of 4-6 courses.  The MS Marketing degree will usually have 10-12 marketing courses.  The MBA will offer courses in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business]] strategy, marketing, organizational behavior and other general business courses in much less depth than a specialized degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laud|first=Robert L.|last2=Johnson|first2=Matthew S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Progress and Regress in the MBA Curriculum: The Career and Practice Skills Gap|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15416518.2013.781398|journal=Organization Management Journal|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–35|doi=10.1080/15416518.2013.781398}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the MS Marketing degree that requires marketing courses, supplemented with perhaps a few [[electives]] in other areas such as analytics.

In 1996, she married [[Bill Gates Sr.]], father of [[Bill Gates]].

==Career==
Gates holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in art history from [[Stanford University]], a certificate with honors in [[Chinese language]] and [[culture of China|culture]] from the [[École Nationale des Langues Orientales Vivantes]] in [[Paris]], an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in Oriental and Chinese Studies from the [[University of Iowa]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in Art History from [[Yale University]]. An old friend of [[Theresa Heinz Kerry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also a frequent juror for the [[Heinz Awards]], appointed by the Heinz Family Philanthropies to award outstanding achievement in the area of Arts and Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinzawards.net/jurors.asp Heinz Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was curator of Asian art and then director of the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9A04E4D91438F932A05750C0A963948260 ''New York Times''], March 31, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale, she contributed to the development of the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) guideline discouraging the sale of artwork in a Museum's collection, even to cover  operating costs. In a brief, she detailed her view that museum collections are ''"a public trust"''.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Graves, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=55935 "In Art News: Sunshine, Please"], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', August 24–30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also lobbied the U.S. and [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] negotiators to ensure that implementation of [[UNESCO]] rules about non-archaeological cultural exports do not tie the hands of American curators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamd.org/advocacy/documents/MimiGates.pdf Letter to the President’s Cultural Advisory Committee on behalf of the AAMD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001163807/http://www.aamd.org/advocacy/documents/MimiGates.pdf |date=2006-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She came to Seattle in 1994 to head the museum, and in her tenure, has added over 2500 works to the collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are many Asian art treasures and works by [[Van Dyck]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Richard Serra]] and [[Alexander Calder]]. The museum has also established a [[sculpture park]]. The museum's endowment has tripled to over $75 million and the region's first conservation studio was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gates brokered an 11th-hour settlement that returned the artwork, after which the museum sued the gallery that had sold it the painting in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Palo''' is a memory resident multidimensional ([[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) or multidimensional online analytical processing ([[MOLAP]])) [[database]] server and typically used as a [[business intelligence]] tool for [[management accounting|controlling]] and [[budget]]ing purposes with [[spreadsheet]] software acting as the user interface. Beyond the multidimensional data concept, Palo enables multiple users to share one centralised data storage ([[single version of the truth]]).

This type of [[database]] is suitable to handle complex data models for business management and statistics. Apart from multidimensional queries, data can also be written back and consolidated in real-time. To give rapid access to all data, Palo stores them in the memory during run time. The server is available as [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[proprietary software]].

[[Jedox]] was founded by Kristian Raue in 2002 and developed by Jedox AG, a company based in [[Freiburg]], Germany. The firm currently employs approximately 100 people. Kristian Raue's departure from Jedox was announced in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html Jedox announces founder's departure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606063250/http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Palo for Excel is an open source [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Microsoft Excel]]. There is also an open source plug-in for [[OpenOffice.org]] named [[PalOOCa]] (discontinued), with Java and web client also available from the JPalo project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpalo.com/en/ Tools, Consulting and Service for Palo]&lt;/ref&gt; Palo can also be integrated into other systems via its client libraries for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[PHP]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], or [[.NET Framework]]. It is fairly easy to communicate with Palo OLAP Server, since it uses [[representational state transfer]] (REST).

Starting in October 2008, Palo supports [[XML for Analysis]] and [[MultiDimensional eXpressions]] (MDX) APIs for connectivity, and [[OLE DB for OLAP]] interface which allows standard Excel pivot tables to serve as a client tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palo Open Source OLAP Server now supports MDX and Excel Pivot Tables |url=http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/10965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting September 2011, Palo supports [http://ssasefprovider.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=sdx&amp;referringTitle=Glossary SDX] dialect of [[LINQ]].

Palo also provides a web-based spreadsheet interface called Palo Web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 Palo Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720170024/http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Palo Suite is a tightly integrated framework consisting of: Palo MOLAP Server, Palo ETL Server, Palo Web (Palo Spreadsheet - Connection, User, ETL, File and Report Manager), Palo for Excel, Palo Supervision Server and the Palo Client Libraries.

The Data in Palo database is stored as a cube in the Palo MOLAP server.  The Palo Excel Add-In component is used as a service to communicate between the Excel and the Palo MOLAP Server.

==Licensing==
Jedox announced only commercial licensing is available since 5.1 version (2015).

The '''Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino''' is a [[casino]]–[[hotel]] located in downtown [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] owned by the [[Tamares Group]], and PlayLV is the leaseholder and operator of the property.  It currently has 1,037 rooms and suites, as well as an {{convert|80000|sqft|adj=on}} casino and there is more than {{convert|25,000|sqft|m2}} of event space.  The Plaza also features a classic showroom, seasonal roof top [[swimming pool]], and fitness center, as well as a race and sports book.

The Plaza began an extensive $35 million renovation project at the end of 2010 that included brand new guestrooms and suites, an entirely remodeled casino floor and lobby, and all new restaurants, bars and entertainment options.&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, Amanda (23 June 2011).

Retrieved 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The renovations utilize contemporary furnishings and materials purchased from the [[Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau Resort]] after it suspended construction on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. The hotel and the full casino reopened on September 1, 2011.

==History==

=== Las Vegas Union Pacific Station ===
[[File:Union Pacific Station, Las Vegas, Nevada (74656).jpg|thumbnail|left|Union Pacific Station, Las Vegas, ca. 1940]]

Prior to the construction of the casino, part of the site was used for the first train station in Las Vegas, a Spanish style depot, constructed in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classiclasvegas.squarespace.com/downtown-history/ |title=Union Station, 1906-1940 |accessdate=2017-06-19 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced in 1940 with a [[Streamline Moderne]] train station designed by H. L. Gogerty, with a Union Pacific shield, and "Streamliners &amp; Challangers" neon sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintagelasvegas.com/post/154149973389 |title=Union Station, 1940-1970 |accessdate=2017-06-19 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This station was demolished in 1970 and replaced by the Union Plaza Hotel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintagelasvegas.com/post/43412811326 |title=Union Plaza |accessdate=2017-06-19 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a small waiting room to be used as a station for Amtrak trains.

===Union Plaza Hotel and Casino===
Opened on July 2, 1971 with the owners including local businessmen: [[Sam Boyd]], Frank Scott, [[Howard Cannon]] and [[Jackie Gaughan]]. Its original name was Union Plaza, in reference to the [[Union Pacific]] railroad station that originally stood at the site.

From 1990 to 1992, the red neon object was installed at the top of the neon sign.

Before the discontinuation of the ''[[Desert Wind]]'' train route on May 10, 1997, [[Amtrak]] made its [[Las Vegas station (Nevada)|Las Vegas, Nevada station]] near the Plaza. The station and ticket windows were directly connected to the hotel. It was the only train station in the United States located in a casino.

===Plaza===
[[Barrick Gaming Corporation]] acquired the Plaza from Jackie Gaughan and in late 2005 later ceded operation to majority owner Tamares Group. On July 1, 2005 after Tamares took control of the Plaza mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] made his opinions clear in an article in the Las Vegas Press. He said ''If I had my druthers, I would like to have somebody in place to discuss imploding the Plaza.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvbusinesspress.com/articles/2005/07/01/news/news01.txt |title=New land baron moves on downtown }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to his desire to see the Plaza replaced with new construction that would create a scenic entrance to Union Park.

During its ownership by Barrick Gaming Corporation, [[D.W. Barrick]]'s good friend, [[Larry Manetti]] (who played Orville "Rick" Wright on the television show ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'') hosted a celebrity brunch every Sunday, featuring such guests as [[Pat Morita]] and [[Steve Rossi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He also owned Manetti's in the Plaza. When Barrick sold its interest in the hotel to the Tamares Group, Manetti closed his restaurant and severed his relationship with the hotel. The Plaza's famed glass dome is now the home of Oscar's Steakhouse, mutually influenced by Las Vegas former mayor Oscar Goodman and the Plaza itself.

The hotel closed for renovations on November 11, 2010, and acquired furniture, carpets and fixtures from the bankrupt [[Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas]] project on the Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/07/plaza-gets-strip-stuff-downtown-prices/|title=Plaza gets Strip stuff at Downtown prices |accessdate=2010-010-7 |work= |publisher=Las Vegas Sun |date=2010-010-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; From November, 2010 to August, 2011, the Plaza still operated its sports &amp; racebook, showroom, one bar, and a portion of the casino. By March 2011, the south tower had been renovated, and the casino finished renovations and re-opened on August 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reiley, Tim (25 August 2011). [http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/fresh-look-downtowns-plaza "Fresh look for downtown's Plaza"]. ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' (Las Vegas). Retrieved 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel again opened for business on September 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plazahotelcasino.com/about_us/infographic "Infographic"], ''Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino''. Retrieved on 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Plaza announced that a new 3,500-seat facility would be constructed at the hotel to become the new home arena for the [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] minor league [[ice hockey|hockey]] team of the [[ECHL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2014/feb/14/wranglers-search-new-home-vegas-ends-plaza/ |title=Wranglers’ search for a new home in Las Vegas ends at the Plaza |last=Katsilometes |first=John |date=2014-02-14 |work=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hockey team suspended operations for the 2014-15 season and would eventually fold mid-season.

The '''Railway Companies' Association''' was a co-ordinating body for [[United Kingdom|British]] railway companies from 1867 until [[nationalisation]] in 1948. Its purpose was to protect the interests of the companies and their shareholders, chiefly against parliamentary interference. It was an early example of a [[Lobbying|lobby]] organisation.

==History==
The Association had its roots in a meeting of railway company chairmen, held at the [[Railway Clearing House]] (RCH) in March 1854, to discuss parliamentary matters of concern, but a properly constituted organisation developed only slowly. This was partly a result of the independent nature of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] railway companies and the number of company chairmen and senior
officers who were [[House of Lords|Lords]] or [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in their own right, and partly a reflection of the gradually increasing role of government in regulating railway company actions and the need for an 'industry' response.

By 1858 a United Railway Companies' Committee (URCC) had been formed, but it foundered after three years and was only re-constituted at a meeting on 26 June 1867, held at the Westminster office of the [[Midland Railway]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The revived body's first achievement was to promulgate a standard format for the accounts of railway companies, drawn up by the Chief Accountants of five of the major companies. This was accepted by the [[Board of Trade]] and included as a Schedule in the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1868]] (31 &amp; 32 Vict., cap. 119).&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Jack, 'Regulation Acts' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds),
''The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s'',
Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-211697-5}}, page 418&lt;/ref&gt;

The URCC was renamed 'The Railway Companies' Association' in 1869&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; or 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Its main task was to follow the progress of legislation which might affect railways, attempting to persuade MPs and Lords to vote in the '[[The railway interest|railway interest']], and giving evidence to parliamentary committees. It also promoted legislation designed to assist railway companies. This finally left the RCH free of a political role and able to concentrate on the commercial organisation of inter-company services.

Membership of the Association received a boost with the arguments over the passing of the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1873]] (36 &amp; 37 Vict., cap. 48). The perceived threats to profitability, through regulation of the rates which the 'monopolist' railways could charge, led to several moderately-large companies joining the major ones in the Association, finally giving it national coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairmanship of the Association rotated amongst the Chairmen of leading railway companies. Much of the actual lobbying work of the Association devolved onto its parliamentary subcommittee, which consisted of Lords and MPs from the member companies' boards.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association had a small permanent secretariat, paid for by a precept of one or two shillings per £1,000 of the gross revenue of each participating company. The first Secretary of the Association was Kenneth Morison, who was also the first secretary of the RCH, but by 1873 the Honorary Secretary was [[Henry Oakley]] (knighted 1891), who was Secretary and then General Manager (1870-1898) of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.159, pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Michael, 'Oakley, Henry (1823-1914)' in Simmons, Jack and Biddle, Gordon (eds), ''The Oxford companion to British Railway history: from 1603 to the 1990s'', Oxford, New York: OUP, 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-211697-5}}, page 356&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in post at the Association for the rest of 19th century, and the Association's activities were presumably co-ordinated from Oakley's offices at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]].

In the aftermath of the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889]] (52 &amp; 53 Vict., cap. 57) and the industrial unrest of the 1890s, including the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]'s unilateral recognition of the new [[Trade union|trades union]] the [[National Union of Railwaymen|Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], the ad-hoc nature of the Association came under increasing pressure, leading to a restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.186-191&lt;/ref&gt; This involved giving the secretariat a permanent base, in three rooms at 53 Parliament Street, leased from October 1900, and appointing a full-time paid secretary, the first being the rising [[barrister]] [[Guy Granet|William Guy Granet]], appointed in
November 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.191, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Later secretaries included barristers [[W. Temple Franks]] (1905-1909) and [[Arthur Beresford Crane]] (1909-1929).&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association's role was necessarily reduced during [[World War I]] when parliamentary interest in domestic transport matters was low, railways being managed for the war effort under the provisions of the [[Regulation of the Forces Act 1871]], but it gained in importance when the newly established post-war [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] decided to deal with the railway companies jointly through the Association.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the [[Railways Act 1921]], during passage of which the Association lobbied for better compensation terms for shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; grouped British companies into four large concerns, another restructuring of the Association took place. The parliamentary members' council was abolished, severing the direct link with parliament, and the four new general managers constituted a standing committee of the Association. Briefings of independent railway-linked Lords and MPs continued however, for example in the companies' 1938 'Square Deal' campaign for reform of freight rates' legislation in the face of road competition (which was overtaken by the onset of war in 1939)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.414&lt;/ref&gt; and in the run up to the [[Transport Act 1947]] which [[nationalization|nationalised]] the railways. With all railways then under a single management within the [[British Transport Commission]], the Association was wound up at this point.

==Nomenclature==
Modern commentators (Bonavia, Harris) drop the apostrophe in the name of this organisation, but Alderman includes it (when not abbreviating it to 'Railway Association'). Despite not having had opportunity to examine the Association's minutes, one feels sure that the Victorians would also have been grammatically correct and we have retained it here. The Association doesn't seem to have been referred to by its initials 'RCA'.

==Records==
The minutes of the Association were printed and distributed to the member companies, so several sets survive.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, pp.253-254&lt;/ref&gt; They are available for consultation in [[The National Archives]], together with other papers relating to the Association, and in the [[National Archives of Scotland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7390">'''Resin casting''' is a method of plastic [[casting]] where a [[Moulding (process)|mold]] is filled with a liquid [[synthetic resin]], which then hardens. It is primarily used for small-scale production like industrial prototypes and dentistry. It can be done by amateur [[hobby]]ists with little initial investment, and is used in the production of collectible toys, models and figures, as well as small-scale jewellery production.

The synthetic resin for such processes is a [[monomer]] for making a plastic [[thermosetting polymer]]. During the setting process, the liquid monomer polymerizes into the polymer, thereby hardening into a solid. 

Single-monomer resins may be used in the process, which form [[homopolymer]]s (polymers containing only one type of polymer). In such uses, the "curing agent" mixed with the resin contains what is loosely referred to as a "[[catalyst]]," but which is more technically an initial source of free radicals (such as [[MEKP]]) to act as an initiator in a free-radical chemical [[chain reaction]] polymerization. Alternately, resin casting may be accomplished with a resin plus a nearly equal amount of a "hardener" liquid (as in many [[epoxy resin]] or [[polyester resin]] systems), which functionally contains a second polymer, for use in forming a final product plastic which is a [[copolymer]]. Copolymers contain two different alternating chemical entities in the final polymer molecule.

==Process==
Most commonly a [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] resin is used that [[Polymerization|polymerizes]] by mixing with a [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] agent (polymerization catalyst) at room temperature and normal pressure. The resins are named by analogy with plant resins, but are synthetic monomers for making polymer plastics. The so-called synthetic resins used include [[polystyrene]] resin, [[polyurethane]] resin, [[epoxy]] resin, unsaturated [[polyester resin]], [[acrylic resin]] and [[silicone resin]].

Epoxy resin has a lower viscosity than polyurethane resin {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}; polyester resin also shrinks markedly while curing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmolds.com/polyurethane]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acrylic resin]], in particular the [[methyl methacrylate]] type of synthetic resin, produces [[acrylic glass]] (also called PMMA, Lucite, Plexiglass), which is not a glass but a plastic polymer that is transparent, and very hard. It is suitable for embedding objects (such as, for example, [[acrylic trophy|acrylic trophies]]), for display purposes. [[Styrene]] is a similar liquid monomer at room temperature, which will also polymerize into clear glass-like [[polystyrene]] plastic, with addition of a suitable catalyst.

A [[flexible mold]] can be made of [[latex]] rubber, [[Vulcanization#Room temperature vulcanization|room temperature vulcanized]] [[silicone]] rubber or other similar materials at relatively low cost, but can only be used for a limited number of castings.

The simplest method is gravity casting where the resin is poured into the mold and pulled down into all the parts by gravity. When the two part resin is mixed air bubbles tend to be introduced into the liquid which can be removed in a [[vacuum chamber]]. The casting can also be done in a vacuum chamber (when using open molds) to either extract these bubbles, or in a pressure pot, to reduce their size to the point where they aren't visible. Pressure and/or centrifugal force can be used to help push the liquid resin into all details of the mold. The mold can also be vibrated to expel bubbles.

Each unit requires some amount of hands-on labor, making the final cost per unit produced fairly high. This is in contrast to [[injection molding]] where the initial cost of creating the metal mold is higher, but the mold can be used to produce a much higher number of units, resulting in a lower cost per unit.

==Collectibles and models==
[[File:Silicone mold resin cast figure.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A custom resin cast [[Pinky:St]] part and two-part silicone mold]]
Resin casting is used to produce collectible and customized toys and figures like [[designer toys]], [[garage kit]]s and [[ball-jointed doll]]s, as well as [[scale model]]s, either individual parts or entire models of objects like [[Rail transport modelling|trains]], [[Model aircraft|aircraft]] or [[Ship model|ships]]. They are generally produced in small quantities, from the tens to a few hundred copies, compared to injection-molded plastic figures which are produced in many thousands. Resin casting is more labor intensive than injection molding, and the soft molds used are worn down by each cast. The low initial investment cost of resin casting means that individual hobbyists can produce small runs for their own use, such as customization, while companies can use it to produce small runs for public sale.

The creation of a toy or figure start with the traditional [[sculpting]] process where the artist designs a [[clay]] sculpture. Where appropriate, for example when making a garage kit, the sculpture is dissected into several parts like head, torso, arms and legs. A flexible mold made from [[Vulcanization#Vulcanization of silicones|room temperature vulcanized]] (RTV) silicone rubber is made for each part.

After the mold has been made, a synthetic [[resin]] - such as polyurethane or epoxy - mixed with a curing agent, is poured into each mold cavity. Mixing the two liquid parts causes an [[exothermic reaction]] which generates heat and within minutes causes the material to harden, yielding castings or copies in the shape of the mold into which it has been poured. The molds are commonly half-divided (like the hollowed chocolate Easter eggs with candy inside) and a [[release agent]] may be used to make removal of the hardened/set resin from the mold easier. The hardened resin casting is removed from the flexible mold and allowed to cool.
[[File:SHKANGLE.JPG|thumb|250px|A Baldwin 6-axle locomotive kit cast in resin in HO Scale]]
Due to aggressive nature of most compounds used for casting and the high temperature of the reaction the mold gradually degrades and loses small details. Typically, a flexible mold will yield between 25 and 100 castings depending upon the size of the part, the intensity of the heat generated.

Depending on the type of product it may then be cut or sanded to remove any casting artefacts like [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprues]] and seams. Some products are also assembled and painted, while some models and kits, which are intended for the consumer to assemble, are left unfinished.

The ability of RTV silicone molds to reproduce even the tiniest detail means that many of these low volume castings are of very high quality. Quality of both original masters and resin castings varies due to differences in creator's skill, as well as casting techniques.

'''Ricky Lauren''' (born ''' Ricky Ann Low-Beer''' on June 15, 1943), is an American author, artist and photographer and wife of fashion designer [[Ralph Lauren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/American-Icon-Ralph-Lauren-and-His-Fascinating-Family_2 |title= American Icon Ralph Lauren and His Family |work=Oprah Show |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a psychotherapist.&lt;ref name="PW The Hamptons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-1182-9327-0 | title=The Hamptons: Food, Family, and History|website=Publishers Weekly|date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Ricky Ann Low-Beer, she grew up in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="GRL" /&gt; She is the daughter of Austrian immigrants, Margaret Vytouch and Rudolph Low-Beer.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CT cowgirl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-03-18/features/0703180373_1_chilean-sea-bass-sunflowers-chocolate|title=Ricky Lauren's 10 Favorite Things|date=March 18, 2007|author=Lisa Cregan|accessdate=December 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren was an English major at [[Hunter College]]. She met her future husband Ralph Lauren at the eye doctor's office where she was working part-time. Lauren also taught fifth grade and danced for a time in [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref name="GRL" /&gt; On December 20, 1964, she married Ralph Lauren in New York City.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;

==Career==
===Hostess, patron and fundraiser===
Lauren has supported her husband's career as a kind of "silent partner", as summarized by ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="Polo Persona" /&gt; These activities included attending fashion industry events or charities with him,&lt;ref name="Polo Persona" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; hosting parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7891368/valley_news/ | title=Ms. Fontanne on the Town 'Every Night: City lights| author=Liz Smith |newspaper=Valley News |location=Van Nuys, California | date=October 7, 1977 | page=77 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her patronage for charitable events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/jm/kingston/kingston/kingston-gleaner/clippings/Celebrity/142439/ |title=Lavish Affair at the annual Round Hill Carnival|newspaper=Kingston Gleaner|location=Kingston, Jamaica | date=February 19, 2002 |page=33 | author=Janet Silvera|via=NewspaperARCHIVE|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she and her husband established a cancer center which is part of [[North General Hospital]] in [[Harlem]].

Lauren has been identified as the "Polo Persona", the model by which the Polo advertising campaigns are developed.&lt;ref name="Polo Persona" /&gt; Of being his muse, Ralph wrote in his memoir, "I didn't like the girl with all the makeup and high heels. I liked the girl in jeans and a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, wearing her boyfriend's jacket. That's the girl I am attracted to. That's the girl I married—Ricky."&lt;ref name="HB Natural beauty" /&gt; Ralph also acknowledged that when he began designing women's clothes, his interest was piqued by his wife's frustration in finding clothes she would like that could fit her slim and petite build.{{sfn|Mattern|2013|p=40}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2748">'''Ruth Forbes Young''' (1903, [[Milton, Massachusetts]] – 5 March 1998, [[Berkeley, California]]&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;) was a member of the [[Forbes family]] and a founder of the [[International Peace Academy]] in 1970. She also co-founded Berkeley's Institute for the Study of Consciousness with her third husband, [[Arthur M. Young]].

==Background and family life==
Forbes was a member of the Massachusetts [[Forbes family]], being the daughter of Ralph Emerson Forbes and Elise Cabot. She was a great-granddaughter of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and a niece of [[William Cameron Forbes]] ([[Governor-General of the Philippines]] 1908 - 1913).&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Forbes married architect [[Lyman Paine]] in the mid-1920s;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; they moved together from Boston to New York, where Forbes' friend [[Mary Bancroft]] described them as hosting "wonderful parties in their West Side apartment".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Bancroft]] (1983), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tXIrAAAAMAAJ Autobiography Of A Spy]'', [[William Morrow and Company]], p54&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes and Paine divorced in the 1930s after having two children, Cameron Paine and [[Michael Paine]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Enid Nemy, ''[[New York Times]]'', 15 March 1998, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/us/ruth-f-young-94-founded-an-academy-to-promote-peace.html Ruth F. Young, 94, Founded An Academy to Promote Peace]&lt;/ref&gt; A second marriage, in the early 1940s to Dr. Giles Thomas, was cut short by the latter's death. Forbes married [[Arthur M. Young]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Career==
Forbes studied painting at the [[Arts Student League]], and her still lifes and landscapes were exhibited in New York and Philadelphia. She produced ballets in Santa Barbara, designing sets and costumes herself.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Loomis, arthuryoung.com, [http://www.arthuryoung.com/ruth.html In Memoriam: Ruth Forbes Young, 1903-1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes joined the [[World Federalist Movement]] after the dropping of atomic bombs in 1945. Later wanting to go beyond this, she consulted with United Nations General Secretary [[U Thant]] about setting up an international academy to support international diplomatic efforts towards peace. Thant recommended getting in touch with [[Indar Jit Rikhye]], who went on to become the [[International Peace Academy]] first President.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Forbes provided the Academy's initial funding, and continued to support it financially.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In 1972 Forbes also co-founded Berkeley's Institute for the Study of Consciousness with her third husband, [[Arthur M. Young]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">'''SMART''': SCOTLAND is a high profile innovation support grant scheme in Scotland aimed at small and medium-sized firms. It supports commercially viable projects which represent a significant technological advance for the UK sector or industry concerned.

The SMART grant supports technology development through:

* Technical and Commercial [[Feasibility Study|Feasibility Studies]]. These should involve early stage [[R&amp;D]], the outcome of which will enable informed decisions on the technical and commercial feasibility of a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Business process|process]].
* Research and Development Projects that aim to develop a pre-production prototype of a new product or process.

==Criteria==
Applicants must be based in [[Scotland]] or planning to set up in Scotland and must meet the [[European Community]] definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise which in summary means they must:

* have less than 250 employees (full-time equivalent world-wide, including partners and executive directors) and have either
* an annual [[Revenue|turnover]] not exceeding EUR 50 million  and/or
* an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.

Awards are judged according to technological, intellectual property, financial and commercial aspects of the application as well as the management expertise available to the business. In addition other aspects such as the project's implications on society such as environmental impact, [[sustainability]] and [[health and safety]] may be taken into account.

==History==

The grant was launched in Scotland as SMART in 1999 and by April 2007 grants had been given to almost 400 businesses across Scotland amounting to some £14.7 million funding.[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/01/26121910] In April 2007 SMART was relaunched [http://www.ettc.co.uk/news/detail.asp?newsid=4354] as  the "SMART:SCOTLAND" Programme .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4379">'''Santiago Graf''' (October 16, 1845 in Oberhembrach, [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] - August 31, 1904 near [[Xalapa]], [[Mexico]]) was a Swiss born.&lt;ref&gt;Semblanza de la Vida de Santiago Graf, facimile, [http://www.wiecherspedia.com/eng/capitulos/26/capitulo-xvii-hl-wiechers-y-su-cunado-emilio-leycegui-junto-con-santiago-graf-en-la-cerveceria-toluca-y-mexico Wiecherspedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; brewer, businessman, and director and manager of Compania Cervecera Toluca y Mexico. He was the first successful brewer of lager beer in Mexico&lt;ref name="autogenerated638"&gt;One Hundred Years of Brewing, H.S. Rich &amp; Co., 1903, p.638&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneered the "Graf" style of Vienna lager, one of the two styles of Vienna lager today and still popular in Mexico and the southwest United States.

==Life==
In 1875 Graf purchased the original Compania Cervecera Toluca y Mexico&lt;ref name="Carpenter2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave Carpenter|title=Lager: The Definitive Guide to Tasting and Brewing the World's Most Popular Beer Styles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL0vDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|accessdate=23 October 2018|date=October 2017|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-5215-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a small producer of cerveza sencilla, a form of light ale, from fellow Swiss Ausgustin Marendazand and began brewing a popular amber ale which is often cited as the  first commercially successful beer brewed in the southwest&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Broderick(ed.) The Practical Brewer, MBAA, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;.  The problems with temperature control during [[wort]] production and fermentation in Mexico's hot climate forced him to continue brewing [[ale]] until the opening of an international railroad link with the United States enabled him to import the first large ice producing [[Absorption refrigerator|absorption]] machines from Germany in 1882.&lt;ref name="Yenne2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bill Yenne|title=Beer: The Ultimate World Tour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfjZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=23 October 2018|date=April 2014|publisher=Race Point Publishing|isbn=978-1-937994-41-9|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With better equipment and the ability to cool wort and fermenter's properly, Graf was the first to successfully brew lager in Mexico. In 1890, Graf formed a stock company and erected the first large, modern lager brewery in Mexico.&lt;ref name="autogenerated638"/&gt;

Graf brewed various types of light colored ambers but seemed uninterested in pale beers like the popular [[Pilsener]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna, Marzen, Oktoberfest, by George and Laurie Fix, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-937381-27-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disappointed with the quality of [[malt]] and [[hops]] available locally, he imported all his hops from Europe and most of his malt from the United States. In addition, he set up his own malting facilities in Mexico, using barley imported from the United States&lt;ref&gt;The Two Republics, June 30, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;. Graf was able to increase the acidity of his [[Mashing|mash]] by increasing the percentage of dark malts in his recipes&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Brewing Science, George Fix, 1989, The Association of Brewers&lt;/ref&gt; thereby counteracting the high alkalinity of brewing water available in Mexico, with the alkalinity simultaneously mellowing the acidic flavors of the dark malts in the final product. The result was a popular, mellow, darker style of [[Lager#Vienna Lager|Vienna lager]]. The popularity of the Toluca y Mexico beers was such that Graf frequently had difficulty filling orders and was forced to seek outside investors to rapidly increase production&lt;ref&gt;The Two Republics, May 21, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current popular brands of Graf style Viennas include major brands such as [[Negra Modelo]], Nocha Buena, and [[Dos Equis]] Amber.

Graf died on August 31, 1904 from [[endocarditis]] [[Vegetation (pathology)|vegetations]] as a complication of an ongoing infection&lt;ref&gt;Defuncion de Santiago Graf, 1904, Toluca, Mexico, facimile, [http://www.wiecherspedia.com/eng/capitulos/26/capitulo-xvii-hl-wiechers-y-su-cunado-emilio-leycegui-junto-con-santiago-graf-en-la-cerveceria-toluca-y-mexico Wiecherspedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in Toluca, Mexico&lt;ref&gt;The Mexican Herald, September 1, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' (SMCCI) is a non-profit organization, established in 1956 to support the Malay/Muslim business community in Singapore.

==History==
The Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) was first established in 1956 as the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce (SMCC) by a group of Malay/Muslim businessmen, including the first President of Singapore, [[Yusof Ishak]].&lt;ref name="Majulah"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rasheed |first1=Zainul Abidin |last2=Saat |first2=Norshahril |title=Majulah!: 50 Years of Malay/Muslim Community in Singapore |date=2016 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9814759880 |page=385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uixDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Yusof+Ishak+SMCCI&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JScfDgAiKk&amp;sig=fW9uXWy4jLUmjy2img-r8iRrZto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwif_9W3wYDeAhWMvo8KHdUyDM0Q6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Yusof%20Ishak%20SMCCI&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Scientific Series on Singapore's 50 Years of Nation-Building |url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9980 |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was initially intended to look after the trading interests of  the Malay/Muslim business community, however, its name was later changed to its current name in 1995 to reflect its wider scope.&lt;ref name="Majulah"/&gt;

In 2006, SME Centre @ SMCCI was established as a one-stop centre for local small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref name="Majulah2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rasheed |first1=Zainul Abidin |last2=Saat |first2=Norshahril |title=Majulah!: 50 Years of Malay/Muslim Community in Singapore |date=2016 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9814759880 |page=388 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHzQDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=SME+Centre+SMCCI+2006&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fNjawZLqxO&amp;sig=h-wmAIitCI2sFa-v5Q3EAaX09_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE6LyP24PeAhUBXLwKHXgsCB4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=SME%20Centre%20SMCCI%202006&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HomeLocal startup launches app targeting gig economy |url=https://www.theedgesingapore.com/article/local-start-releases-new-mobile-app-targeting-singapore%E2%80%99s-gig-economy |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=The Edge Singapore |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the Founder and Executive Chairman of the franchised businesses Platinum Property Partners and Platinum Business Partners.

Bolton’s personal vision is to help as many people as possible to achieve greater wealth, health and happiness and his mission and that of the Platinum companies is to help others be more, do more, have more and give more in life.

==Early life==
The son of a Lancashire miner turned professional footballer (for [[Bournemouth]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Durban City F.C.|Durban City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=249924 |title=The AFCB Vital Hall of Fame - 1945 - 1960 |website=www.bournemouth.vitalfootball.co.uk  |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a French mother (a hairdresser), Bolton was born in [[Bournemouth]], lived in South Africa between the ages of two and five, and then returned to [[Bournemouth]] where he attended Winton Junior and Secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://platinumpropertypartners.co.uk/why-platinum/meet-the-team/|title=Successful investors in property helping you to succeed|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Platinum Property Partners|language=en-US|access-date=21 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/steveboltonppp|title=Steve Bolton {{!}} LinkedIn|last=|first=|date=|website=www.linkedin.com|publisher=LinkedIn Corporation|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early age, with encouragement from his father, Bolton was interested in wealth creation, following [[stocks]] and [[shares]] from the age of eight and writing basic computer programmes with the goal of predicting the outcome of [[Horse racing|horse races]] at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bolton was also exposed to property investment at an early age when his parents purchased a block of 16 flats and converted them into holiday apartments when he was 11 years of age. The family lived in one of the flats and Bolton spent his summer holidays helping his family run the business and working alongside his father as a carpenter's mate.

Bolton attended Winton Boys Secondary school and left aged 16 with no qualifications. After working a variety of jobs including as a kitchen porter and shelf stacker at a local supermarket, Bolton decided to follow his love of sports and the outdoors and accepted an [[apprenticeship]] working in [[outdoor pursuits]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bolton worked as an outdoor pursuits instructor at the [http://allnatt.co.uk/ Joseph Allnatt] chain of activity centres on the south coast of England where he was quickly promoted to hold the position of head of activities, with 25 staff reporting to him at the age of 19. He was then headhunted in 1992 to help set up and establish Brenscombe Outdoor Pursuits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brenscombeoutdoor.co.uk/|title=Brenscombe Outdoor Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brenscombeoutdoor.co.uk|publisher=|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the most senior member of staff.

==Early career==
Bolton decided in 1994 that he wanted to ‘be his own boss’ and he joined the recently established Ropes Course Developments (RCD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcd.co.uk/index.html|title=Ropes Course Developments - Founder of the European Ropes Course Industry|website=www.rcd.co.uk|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a shareholder and Director.

The company went on to build high and low adventure ropes courses for [[Center Parcs]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[First Choice Holidays]], the [[Royal Air Force]] and many others across Europe and in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Steve-Bolton/30825200|title=Steve Bolton Peace One Day|last=Steve|first=Bolton|date=2013|website=|publisher=Zoom Information|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedge-uk.com/steve_bolton.htm|title=Steve Bolton - Property Expert &amp; Business - Keynote Speaker|last=|first=|date=|work=|language=en|access-date=23 April 2013|via=The Edge-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-founder of a national association and helped to push through safety standards for both the construction and training of ropes courses. These standards were ratified industry-wide and paved the way for the mainstream adoption of high and low ropes courses, which are now commonplace in the UK.

As the business grew, Bolton established Vision Development Training, which operated out of Wokefield Park, now the De Vere Wokefield Estate in Reading. The company provided experiential outdoor personal, management and organisational development programmes for blue chip clients like British Airways, Microsoft and KPMG,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; as well as other high-profile organisations including the British Lions.

In the early 2000’s, Bolton and his partners set up the outdoor activity facilities and businesses, Aerial Extreme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerialextreme.co.uk/|title=Aerial Extreme|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aerialextreme.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Head 4 Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.head4heights.net/|title=Head 4 Heights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.head4heights.net|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following what he describes in his book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009PPO7MS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1|title=Successful Property Investing: How to Earn £50,000 to £150,000 in Two to Five Years|last=Bolton|first=Steve|date=11 October 2012|publisher=Platinum Partners Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ‘best worst experience’ of his life when the [[Foot and mouth#United Kingdom 2001|2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain]] and the economic fallout that followed the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], meant that the market demand dried up and pushed Ropes Course Developments into liquidation, Bolton had to sell his family home to avoid bankruptcy in early 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bolton decided to exit all business interests related to ropes courses in early 2002.

Still an entrepreneur at heart, Bolton set about starting his first ‘virtual’ business and Mobile Team Challenge Europe (MTC) was formed.  The company became the European distributor for Mobile Team Challenge in America and it imported training equipment from the USA and sold it to clients in the UK and Europe.  MTC was a business where Bolton employed no staff, needed no office premises, never handled the products and was able to work on a very part-time basis by outsourcing most of the work.  The business generated a consistent six figure annual net profit for several years in succession before being sold to an investor.

==Property investing==
Alongside running MTC, Bolton invested significant time and money to learn how to build a robust income stream for himself and his family through investing in property. Two years of very intensive research, learning and development between 2002 and 2004 took him all over the world and he was mentored and taught by the best investors that he could find.

Between 2004 and 2007, Bolton purchased £6 million of residential property and converted most of them into high quality Houses in Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), producing average annual returns of 15% and providing affordable shared homes to 80 tenants.

Having developed his own portfolio, he acted on his accountant's suggestion to develop a franchise, which would enable others to build their own profitable portfolios following his model.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk/franchise/item/breaching-the-canopy|title=Breaching the canopy - Elite Franchise Magazine|last=Russel|first=Josh|date=|website=Elite Business Magazine|publisher=CE Media|language=en-gb|access-date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.director.co.uk/magazine/2009/8%20September/partners_63_01.html|title=Director|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Nick Carlisle, Richard Davies and Steve Bolton {{!}} Platinum Property Partners|publisher=Director Publications|language=en-GB|access-date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platinum Property Partners==
Bolton founded and launched Platinum Property Partners on 1 July 2007, with the goal of enabling its Franchise Partners to quickly, safely and successfully build profitable residential property portfolios in the UK, and to create more new and affordable rental homes for key workers and working professionals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PR Log"&gt;{{cite web|last=PR Log|title=Property guru Steve Bolton to speak at the 2011 franchise show in London|url=http://www.prlog.org/11255090-property-guru-steve-bolton-to-speak-at-the-2011-franchise-show-in-london.html|work=PR Log press release distribution|publisher=PR Log|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executives on the Web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Executives on the Web|title=Business Owner / Franchise Partner Franchise in UK|url=http://www.executivesontheweb.com/franchise/request.cfm?opportunity_id=326839|work=Executives on the Web|publisher= ExecutivesOnTheWeb.com 2000–2013|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Money Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Platinum Property Partners, Franchisor, Franchising Opportunities – Making Money Magazine|url=http://www.makingmoney.co.uk/franchise-opportunity/franchisor/platinum-property-partners/business-&amp;-professional-services/|work=Making Money Magazine|publisher=Aceville Publications Ltd|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Franchise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Franchise: New Lease of Life – New Lease of Life|url=https://www.businessfranchise.com/article-page/1569|work=Business Franchise|publisher=Business Franchise Magazine|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Article Dashboard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macall|first=Fiona|title=Interview with Steve Bolton, Multi-millionaire specialising in below market value properties|url=http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/Interview-with-Steve-Bolton-Multi-Millionaire-Specialising-in-Below-Market-Value-Properties/2141170|work=Article Dashboard|publisher=2005 -2011 Article Dashboard|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Franchises"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Day Property Guru Steve Bolton to speak at the Franchise Show in February 2011|url=http://www.sealrez.com/2012/01/Modern-Day-Property-Guru-Steve-Bolton-to-Speak-at-The-Franchise-Show-in-February-2011/|work=Business Franchises|publisher=Business Franchises|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franchise Info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise Info|url=https://www.franchiseinfo.co.uk/franchise-pages/premier/platinumpropertypartners|work=Franchise Info|publisher=Franchise Info|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Start Up TV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Bolton, Platinum Property Partners – Platinum Property Partners|url=http://www.startuptv.co.uk/directory/franchise/ppp/ppp-seminar.html|work=Start Up TV|publisher=The Entrepreneurs Academy|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Accountex&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Bolton – The National Accountancy Exhibition and Conference|url=http://www.accountex.co.uk/speakers/steve-bolton/|work=Accountex|publisher=Prysm BSU Limited|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Bolton - Entrepreneur and successful businessman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Performing Artistes|title=Steve Bolton – Entrepreneur and successful businessman|url=http://www.performingartistes.co.uk/artistes/851/steve-bolton.html|work=Performing Artistes|publisher=F4 Group Ltd|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum Property Partners (known as PPP) has since become the fastest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchiseexpo.co.uk/resources/interview-with-a-ceo/sept/interview-with-ceo-of-platinum-property-partnersppp--steve-bolton|title=Interview with CEO of Platinum Property Partners(PPP)- Steve Bolton|website=www.franchiseexpo.co.uk|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing premium franchise in UK history.

PPP is a successful and socially responsible franchise business that has helped over 250 Franchise Partners (as of January 2017) to source, own, develop and manage more than 800 buy to let properties) with a combined value of £250 million and an annual rent roll in excess of £36 million per annum. This portfolio provides high quality and affordable homes for over 5,000 tenants in over 100 towns, cities and London boroughs in England, Wales, Scotland and Australia.

Tenants who live in PPP properties spend a lower percentage of their income on rent, enabling them to save more of their income each month, thereby accelerating their path onto the property ladder for those that have that goal in mind.

PPP is award-winning and a full member of British Franchise Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebfa.org/members/platinum-property-partners|title=Platinum Property Partners - British Franchise Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum’s Franchise Partners are currently buying and developing property at a rate of around £10 million every three months, creating around 1,000 new rooms for young professionals in shared homes annually.

==Platinum Business Partners==
In 2016 Bolton and his partners expanded the tried, tested and proven Platinum franchising brand and system diversified into ecommerce and became the co-Founder of Platinum Business Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.platinumbusinesspartners.co.uk/|title=Platinum Business Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=Platinum Business Partners|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as PBP), which helps its clients set up their own successful ecommerce businesses. The organisation currently has over 80 Franchise Partners selling more than 300 product lines to 100,000 individual online customers globally.

The business supports it Franchise Partners in sourcing and buying products wholesale from places like China and the USA and then marketing and selling them through retail ecommerce platforms like Amazon, Shopify and others. It also helps existing retail business owners pivot and turn their ‘bricks and mortar’ business, into a ‘bricks and clicks’ business.

Always keen to lead by example, Bolton also formed an ecommerce business in 2016 with two partners and this provides a growing range of dog supplements under the Buddy &amp; Lola brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Buddy-Lola/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_14059711011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=14059711011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Buddy+&amp;+Lola|title=Amazon.com: Buddy &amp; Lola|website=www.amazon.com|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business interests==
Bolton also has interests in residential and commercial property projects. He is a co-founder of Platinum Asset Management, which owns a range of commercial property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.platinumbusinesscentre.co.uk/|title=Platinum Business Centre - Offices to rent in Bournemouth, office space in Bournemouth, Serviced offices|website=www.platinumbusinesscentre.co.uk|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing inspiring workspaces for small businesses, some retail shops and three hotels in a prime development location in the town centre of Bournemouth. He also has interests in multiple ecommerce businesses.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:The new buildings at the King's Kid orphanage.jpg|thumb|right|The new buildings at the King's Kid orphanage]]
Bolton is a Life Patron of the not-for-profit organisation [[Peace One Day]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For more than a decade he worked with the organisation and helped to raise millions of pounds in funding.

The charity is dedicated to achieving [[International Day of Peace|global ceasefire and non-violence for one day every year on 21 September]] and is ratified by the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 13 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peaceoneday.org/about/impact|title=Impact|newspaper=Peace One Day|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; people are estimated to be acting more peacefully as a result of Peace Day (source McKinsey's).

The organisation has also seen 4.5 million children being vaccinated against polio in previously unreachable areas after Peace One Day ambassador Jude Law travelled to Afghanistan to spearhead a campaign.

During his involvement with Peace One Day from 2007 to 2015, Bolton created and led the Patrons programme where he helped to ensure that the organisation was on a sound financial footing. He also led a project to acquire, fund, purchase and convert offices premises in Richmond, Surrey, which continue to be the headquarters for Peace One Day.

Bolton and his Platinum businesses have also provided funding to the King’s Kid Orphanage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingskidhome.com/our-partners|title=King's Kid Home|website=King's Kid Home|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mitiana, Uganda since 2007. This funding and investment has resulted in the purchase and construction of housing, classrooms, a deep water well, farming land as well as food, teachers’ salaries, secure accommodation for the orphanage director, medical procedures and further education funding for orphanage.  The orphanage is home to 300 children and is self-sustaining.

==Books and speaking==
Bolton’s book, Successful Property Investing, was an Amazon bestseller and has been updated three times since first publication in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Accountex" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovereading.co.uk/author/Steve-Bolton,-Nick-Carlile/gd/Steve-Bolton-Nick-Carlile.html|title=Steve-Bolton,-Nick-Carlile Books, Ebooks and Recommendations. Buy Steve-Bolton,-Nick-Carlile Books at Lovereading.co.uk|last=|first=|date=|website=lovereading.co.uk.|publisher=Love Reading|access-date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a [[keynote]] speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphantevents.co.uk/events?access=pod-gettingabove|title=Triumphant Events POD Talks {{!}} Getting above the Noise|last=|first=|date=|website=www.triumphantevents.co.uk|publisher=|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; having spoken on stages alongside Richard Reed (Innocent), Simon Woodroffe (YO!), James Caan (Dragons Den), Kriss Akabussi (World Champion athlete), Davina McCall, Ben Fogle, Michael Gerber (Emyth) and many others.

His primary keynote talk is ‘Standing on the Shoulders of Giants’ which promotes the core concept Bolton believes in passionately - ‘everyone should have a mentor’.

Bolton also speaks regularly and for free at local schools and universities on the subject of wealth, health and happiness, as well as entrepreneurship, principles of success and personal development. He is passionate about inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs.

==Axe the tenant tax==
In 2016 Bolton co-founded and continues to lead a grassroots not-for-profit campaign called Axe the Tenant Tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tenanttax.co.uk|title=Axe the Tenant Tax|newspaper=Tenant Tax|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a UK first, Bolton united the private rented sector by forming a Coalition of all of the major organisations who are opposed to new government legislation that restricts landlords’ ability to deduct mortgage finance costs as a business expense. Coalition stakeholders represent more than 100,000 landlords who provide housing to more than 1 million tenants in the UK.

Bolton and fellow landlord Chris Cooper were co-claimants in a Judicial Review against the UK government in relation to the legality of Section 24 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015. Their legal team was led by Cherie Blair CBE QC and their legal challenge campaign broke two legal crowdfunding records in 2016 by raising over £200,000 within the fastest recorded timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/clause24/|title=Alice in Wonderland Tax Grab|newspaper=CrowdJustice|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/tenanttax/|title=Landlords Fight Back #TenantTax|newspaper=CrowdJustice|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been covered in hundreds of media articles, and Bolton has met the housing Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and MPs. Bolton believes the tax is a disaster for the UK housing market and is championing the cause for the small landlords and tenants who will suffer badly if this tax comes into force.

Their Judicial Review was thwarted at the High Court on 6 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/06/landlords-lose-legal-challenge-buy-to-let-tax-changes-cherie-booth|title=Landlords lose legal challenge over buy-to-let tax changes|last=Jones|first=Rupert|date=2016-10-06|last2=Collinson|first2=Patrick|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolton and Cooper have since focussed their campaign efforts on lobbying the UK government and working with MPs and Tenant Tax coalition members to get the government to do a U-turn.

==Mentoring==
For six years Bolton was a mentor for the Key Person of Influence programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dent.global/team/|title=Our Team - Dent Global|newspaper=Dent Global|language=en-US|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentoring several thousand entrepreneurs and business owners during that time in a group setting.

Bolton provides high impact one to one mentoring to multi-millionaires, celebrities and global change-makers. His mentoring efforts in recent years have focussed around ‘mentoring the mentors’ and all of the Platinum franchise businesses have at their core, a one to one mentoring approach that the Platinum team deliver.

==Media appearances==
Bolton and his businesses have been featured on a number of TV programmes and in media outlets including BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ml5f7 |title=Home Under the Hammer, Series 16, Episode 33 |work=BBC One|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel Four,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/59622-001 |title=Dispatches - The British Property Boom|work=Channel 4 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky News, Financial Times, Sunday Times, The Telegraph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/buy-to-let/cherie-booth-challenge-to-buy-to-let-tax-not-over-yet-despite-ju/ |title=Cherie Booth: Challenge to buy-to-let tax 'not over yet' despite judicial review failure  |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=7 October 2016|first=Olivia|last=Rudgard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/cherie-blair-represent-landlords-changes-tax-regime |title=Cherie Booth to represent landlords fighting changes to tax regime |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2016|first=Matthew|last=Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Express, the Mail and many trade publications in the franchise, entrepreneur, property and business sectors.

He is often quoted in national media in relation to franchising, property, entrepreneurship and mentoring.

'''''The 50th Law''''' is a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[bestselling]] book on [[strategy]] and fearlessness written collaboratively by rapper [[50 Cent]] and author [[Robert Greene (American author)|Robert Greene]].&lt;ref name=Vibe&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Cent is New York Times Certified| url=http://www.vibe.com/article/50-cent-new-york-times-certified| publisher=Vibe |date=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimeslist&gt;{{cite news|title=Bestsellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-09-27/hardcover-advice/list.html|publisher=New York Times|date=September 27, 2009|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InsidetheList&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Inside the List|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/books/review/InsideList-t.html?ref=books|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Socrates]], [[Napoleon]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[James Baldwin]].&lt;ref name=50thlawbook&gt;{{cite book |title=The 50th Law |last1=Cent |first1=50 |last2=Greene |first2=Robert |year=2009 |publisher=HarperStudio |location=New York |isbn=978-1846680687 |pages=291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider&gt;{{cite web|last=Groth|first=Aimee|title=10 Tips For Becoming Fearless Like 50 Cent |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-greene-and-50-cents-50th-law-2012-5?op=1|publisher=Business Insider|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAustralian&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Matthew|title=Rapper's latest hit for business scene|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/rappers-latest-hit-for-business-scene/story-e6frg8n6-1225792219460|newspaper=The Australian|date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''The 50th Law'' grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Alder|first=Daniel|title=50 Cent's Partner In Prose|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/fifty-cent-music-publishing-business-media-cash-kings-fifty.html|newspaper=Forbes|date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greene's book ''[[The 48 Laws of Power]]'', which has long been a staple in the [[hip hop]] world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his "Zen-like calmness" and eye for strategy.&lt;ref name=the50thelaw&gt;[http://powerseductionandwar.com/the-50th-law/ The 50th Law]. ''Power Seduction and War''. June 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The two began to work on a book project that would combine their two worlds.&lt;ref name=the50thelaw/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNBC&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Cent sits down with CNBC and talks about his new book "The 50th Law|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCzb5zpV0PA|publisher=CNBC|date=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greene, 50 Cent is an example of what [[Machiavelli]] called a ''New Prince,'' a leader who emerges in a time of chaos or turmoil and rewrites the rules.&lt;ref name=the50thelaw/&gt; According to 50 Cent, Greene's books describe the laws and strategies used by hustlers on the street, even if they might not know the "technical terms" for what they were doing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlp66y9ML3o 50 Cent Presents "The 50th Law" - Book with Robert Greene]. ''YouTube''. September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Each of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 Cent learned this Fearless Philosophy in Southside [[Queens]].&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Jason|title=Interview: Robert Greene on 50 Cent|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-richards/interview-robert-greene-o_b_289888.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The 50th Law'' illustrates the laws of the book by supplementing anecdotes from 50 Cent's life with historical examples from [[Malcolm X]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[James Baldwin]], [[Thucydides]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], [[Charlie Parker]], and the [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-10-13/music/on-50-cent-s-surreally-insightful-self-help-book-the-50th-law/ |title=The Eight Dookie Ropes of Wisdom in Fiddy Cent's Self-Help Book |newspaper=[[Village Voice]] |author=Rob Harvilla |date=October 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FastCompany&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Lynne|title=The 50 Cent Bible|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1353390/50-cent-bible|publisher=Fast Company|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;{{cite web|last=Neilan|first=Catherine|title=50 Cent Business Book 'The 50th Law' Due This Fall|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267962/50-cent-business-book-the-50th-law-due-this-fall|publisher=Billboard|date=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Strategy Paradox''''' is a [[business strategy]] book by author [[Michael E. Raynor]], who is the Distinguished Fellow with [[Deloitte]] Research. ''The Strategy Paradox'' was published in 2007 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Currency/Doubleday]].  It was named a top ten book of 2007 by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/11/1130_business_books/index_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a top five strategy book of 2007 by ''Strategy+Business''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/07408c?pg=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''The Strategy Paradox'', the title and focus of the book sets up a ubiquitous but little-understood tradeoff.  The tradeoff is that most strategies are built on specific beliefs about an unpredictable future, but current strategic approaches force leaders to commit to an inflexible strategy regardless of how the future might unfold. It is this commitment to uncertainty that is the cause of "the strategy paradox."

==Land Swap Case==
In 2005, motivated by an article that was published in Eesti Ekspress, an investigation of the entitlement and possible corruption factors concerning the swap of rural land properties under nature conservation protection was started. In 2009 the Office of the Prosecutor General brought charges to the partakers of the Land Swap Case. Tullio Liblik was accused of bribing. Besides Liblik two members of [[Riigikogu]], Villu Reiljan and Ester Tuiksoo, businessmen Toomas Annus, Einar Vettus and Tarmo Pedjasaar, also Kalev Kangur, the former Director General of Estonian Land Board, and corporate bodies AS Järvevana and AS E.L.L. Kinnisvara were accused.

In 2012, Harju County Court acquitted all the defendants of the Land Swap Case of&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/Politics/0413fd4f-5a06-440a-9392-28e7fd56306a "All Defendants in Land Swap Case Acquitted "] ERR, June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered the state to pay court costs of the defendats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/110_112/riik-peab-lisaks-13-miljonile-huvitama-ka-tuhandete-eurode-eest-maadevahetuses-suudistatute-vabadusekaotuse.d?id=64564310 "Riik peab lisaks 1,3 miljonile hüvitama ka tuhandete eurode eest maadevahetuses süüdistatute vabadusekaotuse"] Delfi, 19. juuni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Argument with Sukles==
Saarte Investeering and MaxKinnisvara started their cooperation in 2004 in order to construct the Hirvepargi housing development in Sauga parish, Pärnu County. By the year 2007 twelve houses had been erected when the project needed additional financing to proceed with the construction. The owners of MaxKinnisvara didn’t want to add any more money to the initial investment of 20,000 euros and, as a consequence, disagreements arose between the partners.

Ongoing disagreements resulted in ordering a hit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/eestiuudised/kahtlustus-palgamorvar-pidi-tapma-tullio-libliku.d?id=32804277 "Kahtlustus: palgamõrvar pidi tapma Tullio Libliku"] Eesti Ekspress, 27. august 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Turbot War''' (known in Spain as '''Guerra del Fletán''') was an international fishing dispute between [[Canada]] (supported by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) and [[Spain]] (supported by the [[European Union]] and [[Iceland]]) in which Canada stopped a Spanish [[fishing trawler]] from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in [[international waters]] and arrested its crew. Canada claimed that European Union [[factory ship]]s were illegally [[overfishing]] [[Greenland halibut]], also known as Greenland turbot, on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], just outside Canada's declared {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ).

==Prelude==
Territorial seas have changed over time, having begun with a {{convert|3|nmi|km|lk=in|adj=on}} "cannon shot" territorial sea, followed by the long-standing extension to a {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} standard. The economic control of the waters surrounding nations to a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ) were agreed at the conference on the [[Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] in 1982, and became recognised internationally on November 14, 1994. As a self-governing colony and dominion, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]'s foreign policy, just as Canada's, was established by the British government until the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. However, in 1934, Newfoundland's government voted to be put under the administration of a commission appointed by London; this situation remained until 1949 when the dominion entered [[Canadian Confederation]].

Following Confederation, Canada recognized many of the foreign policy agreements Newfoundland had entered under this commission. During the 1950s to the 1970s, the domestic and foreign fishing fleets became increasingly [[Fishing industry|industrialized]], with massive [[factory freezer trawlers]] fishing out of Newfoundland ports – foreign fleets were based in Newfoundland and could fish 12 nautical miles offshore, while domestic fleets could fish in both the territorial sea and the offshore.

By the 1970s the overfishing by industrial vessels in the waters of the other provinces of eastern Canada was evident, although each subsequent federal government continued to ignore this problem, and even contributed to it by using the issuance of fishing licenses for more inshore and offshore domestic vessels. Between 1973 and 1982 the [[United Nations]] and its member states negotiated the Third Convention of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] – one component of which was the concept of nations being allowed to declare an EEZ. Although not adopted into international law until 1982, the possibility of declaring an EEZ became a ''de facto'' reality in 1977 with the conclusion of those sections of the Third Conference negotiations relating to [[maritime boundary]] and economic control.

Many nations worldwide declared 200-nautical-mile EEZs, including Canada and the United States. The EEZ boundaries became a foreign policy issue where overlapping claims existed, as was the case between Canada and the United States in the [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Dixon Entrance]], [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and [[Beaufort Sea]], as well as between Canada and [[France]] in the case of [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]].

But on the whole, for fishermen in eastern Canada, it meant they could fish unhindered out to the limit without fear of competing with the foreign fleets. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canada's domestic offshore fleet grew as fishermen and [[fish processing]] companies rushed to take advantage. It was also during this time when it was noticed that the foreign fleets now pushed out to 200 nautical miles offshore and excluded from the rich Canadian waters, were increasing their harvest on the small areas of the [[Grand Banks]] that were outside the area of the EEZ.

By the late 1980s the smaller catches of [[Atlantic cod|Northern cod]] were being reported throughout the Atlantic coast of Canada as the federal government and citizens of coastal regions in the area began to face the reality that the domestic and foreign overfishing had taken its toll. In the end stocks of cod in and around Canada's EEZ were severely depleted. Reluctant to act at a time of declining political popularity, the federal government was finally forced to take drastic action in 1992 when a [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|total moratorium]] was declared indefinitely for the Northern Cod.

The immediate impact was felt most in Newfoundland, followed by the Atlantic coast of [[Nova Scotia]]. The nascent [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization]], organized after the 1977 EEZ declarations to coordinate conservation efforts in Canada, the United States, and member nations in Europe (both western and eastern bloc countries), also declared a ban, however it was implemented too late to be effective – cod which 5–10 years before was being caught in record numbers, had vanished almost overnight to the point where it was considered for [[endangered species]] protection.

The economic impact in coastal Newfoundland was unprecedented. To lessen the impact that its policies of permitting overfishing had exacted upon rural Newfoundlanders, the federal government swiftly created a relief program called "The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy" (TAGS) to provide short- to medium-term financial support, and employment retraining for the longer term.

Despite TAGS, Newfoundland and coastal Nova Scotia were bleeding severely as communities began to experience an out-migration on a scale not seen in Canada since the prairie [[dust bowl]]s of the 1930s. The anger at federal political figures was palpable and with the wholesale rejection of short-term Prime Minister [[Kim Campbell]], incoming prime minister [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] were going to face the ongoing wrath of voters whose entire livelihoods had been decimated as a result of decades of federal neglect and mismanagement, and whose communities, property values, net worth, and way of life were declining rapidly.

[[File:briantobin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brian Tobin]] was the Canadian politician who was largely responsible for managing the conflict. This earned him the nicknames 'Captain Canada' and 'The Turbotonator'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/27/Turbot-Estai-050727.html |work=CBC News |title=Court backs Canada's seizure of trawler during 'turbot war' |date=July 27, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714191626/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/27/Turbot-Estai-050727.html |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the years since the cod moratorium, federal fisheries policy makers and scientists had scrambled to attempt to find a replacement species that could at least reinject economic stimulus into the affected regions. The ground fishery, while a fraction of what it had been during the cod years, did have some bright spots – one of which was the Greenland halibut commonly known in Canada as turbot. The turbot had decreased in demand due to a common dislike for the taste in the European Union.

Canada was not alone in recognizing the growing value of the turbot, and foreign fishing fleets operating off the 200-nautical-mile EEZ were beginning to pursue the species in increasing numbers. By 1994, Canada and NAFO had tracked about 50 violations of boats crossing the 200-nautical-mile EEZ limit to fish illegally within Canadian waters, as well as recording use of illegal gear and overfishing outside Canadian waters.

The new federal [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Minister of Fisheries and Oceans]], [[Brian Tobin]], directed the [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] (DFO), along with the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] (DFAIT) to begin a very aggressive dialogue with the [[European Union]] over the presence of its fishing fleet and its practices, particularly the use of illegal trawl nets just outside the Canadian EEZ while fishing for turbot. Tobin's critics in Canada noted that he was likely using his department as a political prop to shore up support during a time of increased social unrest in the region, yet in the winter of 1995, Tobin directed DFO to establish a legal argument which could be made for the seizure of a foreign vessel in international waters using the premise of conservation.

==The ''Estai'' incident==
Minister Tobin and the federal cabinet then told the DFO to demonstrate Canadian resolve on the issue by "making an example" of a European Union fishing vessel. On 9 March 1995, an offshore patrol aircraft detected the Spanish stern trawler ''Estai'' in international waters outside Canada's 200-nautical-mile EEZ. Armed DFO fisheries patrol vessels, Cape Roger, Leonard J. Cowley and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] Ship Sir Wilfred Grenfell, intercepted and pursued ''Estai'', which cut its weighted trawl net and fled after an initial boarding attempt, resulting in a several hours' chase which ended after the Canadian Fisheries Patrol vessel ''Cape Roger'' fired a .50 calibre (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine gun across the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of ''Estai''. The Canadian Coast Guard ship {{ship|CCGS|Sir Wilfred Grenfell||2}} used high-pressure fire-fighting [[water cannon]] to deter other Spanish fishing vessels from disrupting the operation. Finally, armed DFO Fishery Officers and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) officers boarded ''Estai'' in international waters on the Grand Banks.

''Estai'' was escorted to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], arriving with great [[fanfare]] across the province and region — and the country. Canada's [[Federal Court of Canada|federal court]] processed the case and the charges against the crew while Spain and the European Union protested vehemently, threatening boycotts against Canada and wishing to have the case heard at the [[International Court of Justice]].

Tobin and his department ignored the controversy and instead had the oversized trawl net which ''Estai'' had cut free salvaged. The DFO contracted a Fishery Products International ground fish trawler to drag for ''Estai''{{'}}s trawl. On the first attempt it retrieved the ''Estai''{{'}}s net which had been cut. It was found that ''Estai'' was using a liner with a mesh size smaller than permitted by the  Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO).  The net was shipped to [[New York City]] where Tobin called an international press conference on board a rented [[barge]] in the [[East River]] outside the [[United Nations]] headquarters. There, the net from ''Estai'' was displayed, hanging from an enormous crane, and Tobin used the occasion to shame the Spanish and EU governments, pointing out the small size of the holes in the net which are illegal in Canada. Spain never denied that the net was from ''Estai'' but continued to protest Canada's use of "extra-territorial force". The Spanish government asked the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, for leave to hear a case claiming that Canada had no right to detain ''Estai''. However, the court later refused the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/96/7533.pdf |title=Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I. C.J. Reports 1998 |date=1998 |publisher=International Court of Justice |issn=0074-4441 |pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Canada released the crew of ''Estai''. On the same day that Tobin was in New York, the United Kingdom blocked an EU proposal to impose sanctions on Canada.&lt;ref name="cda-cdai"/&gt;

Tobin claimed that Canada would not enter negotiations as long as illegal fishing continued, and demanded the withdrawal of all fishing vessels in the area as a precondition. On March 15, the owners of ''Estai'' posted $500,000 bond for the vessel, and it was returned to Spain. Subsequently, the rest of the fishing fleet also left the area, and preliminary talks were scheduled for the upcoming [[G7]] conference. These talks failed, as the Spanish refused to change their position, and Spanish fishing vessels subsequently returned to Grand Banks. Spain also implemented a visa mandate for all Canadians visiting, or planning to visit Spain. This resulted in several Canadians being deported from Spain who had been legally in Spain up until the moment the visa mandate was adopted.&lt;ref name="Visa"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/15/news/15iht-fish_3.html |title=Madrid Sets Visa Rules And Calls for Vessels To Start Fishing Again : Spain Steps Up Pressure on Canada in Boat Dispute |newspaper=The New York Times |last=Buerkle |first=Tom |date=15 March 1995 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visa mandate was later overturned by the EU in 1996. The [[Spanish Navy]] deployed the {{sclass-|Serviola|patrol boat}} ''Atalaya'' to protect its country's fishing vessels. The Spanish Navy also prepared a surface task group with frigates and tankers, but Spain eventually decided against sending it. Negotiations ceased on March 25, and the following day, Canadian ships cut the nets of the Spanish trawler ''Pescamero Uno''. The Spanish Navy responded by deploying a second patrol boat. Canadian warships and patrol planes in the vicinity were authorized by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to fire on Spanish vessels that exposed their guns. Direct negotiations between the EU and Canada eventually restarted, and a deal was reached on April 5. Spain, however, rejected it, demanding better terms. After Canada threatened to forcibly remove Spanish fishing vessels, the EU pressured Spain into finally reaching a settlement on April 15. Canada reimbursed the $500,000 that had been paid for ''Estai''{{'}}s release, repealed the CFPR provision that allowed the arrest of Spanish vessels, and a reduction of Canada's own Turbot allocation. A new international regime to observe EU and Canadian fishing vessels was also created.&lt;ref name="cda-cdai"&gt;[http://www.cda-cdai.ca/cdai/uploads/cdai/2009/04/sneyd05.pdf cda-cdai.ca: "Fighting over fish: A look at the 1995 Canada-Spain Turbot War"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (Sneyd, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute raised Brian Tobin's political profile, helping to preserve his political career in Newfoundland at a time when federal politicians were being increasingly vilified. It also led to his decision in 1996 to pursue to the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador|Liberal Party of Newfoundland]] following the resignation of [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador premiers|premier]] [[Clyde Wells]], as well as a widely discussed future possibility for leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].

==The ''Newlyn'' incident==
Although Spain was getting political support from the EU (including naval support from Germany among others), the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] supported Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fish-war-ends/ thecanadianencyclopedia.ca "Fish War Ends"](reprint of a 24 April 1995 article from [[Maclean's]])&lt;/ref&gt; The then prime-minister [[John Major]] risked his status within the EU community by actively speaking out against Spain. Because of this, some British fishing boats took to flying Canadian flags to show their support. This brought the conflict to European waters when a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] fishing boat, ''Newlyn'', then flying the Canadian flag, was arrested by a French ship that believed it to be Canadian. This dragged Britain from its position of passive backing into full support of the Canadians. Overnight, Canadian flags began to fly from all manner of British and Irish vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://base.d-p-h.info/fr/fiches/premierdph/fiche-premierdph-3975.html "The Turbot War – UK and Ireland support Canada"] (Sharma, ICSF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the EU rallied behind France and Spain, but hesitated to make any mobilizations against the British, Irish, or Canadians.

Upon hearing the news of the conflict, [[Iceland]] spoke up and took the side of the EU against Britain in light of their similar clash with the British, known as the [[Cod Wars]]. As with the EU, no military mobilization took place. Iceland tried to put political pressure on the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3551905 "The Canada-European Union Turbot War: A Brief Game Theoretic Analysis"] by Missios and Plourde (Canadian Public Policy Journal, Vol. 22, No. 2 Jun., 1996, pp. 144–150)&lt;/ref&gt; The British and the Irish pointedly ignored these actions and continued their unquestioned support of Brian Tobin and the Canadians.

In the end ''Newlyn'' was returned to the British without further incident.
