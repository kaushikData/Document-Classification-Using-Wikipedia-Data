'''''A Guide Book of United States Coins (Red Book)''''', by [[Richard S. Yeoman|R. S. Yeoman]], is a [[pricing guide]] for [[Coinage of the United States|United States]] [[coin collecting|coin collectors]] and is considered one of the most authoritative coin price sources.

==Editorial==
Editor [[R. S. Yeoman]] was the editor until he  retired in 1970.

In 1971 his assistant, [[Kenneth Bressett]], took over as the editor of the Blue Book and Red Book until he retired in 2017.

In 2018 Jeff Garrett, former ANA president, took over and assumed the post as senior editor, and still holds that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeff Garrett Named Senior Editor of Red Book |url=http://rarecoingallery.com/story/18 |website=Rarecoingallery.com |accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeoman is still listed as the author of each edition of the books, and Bressett is listed as [[emeritus|editor emeritus]].

== Publication ==
The book is the longest running coin price guide. The first edition, dated 1947, went on sale November 1946.&lt;ref name="coinworld2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tebben|first=Gerald|title=Looking at the 'Red Book' at age 70|magazine=[[Coin World]]|issn=0010-0447|issue=2928|date=May 23, 2016|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first three editions (dated 1947, 1948, 1949), the ''Guide Book'' was not published in 1949; annual publication resumed in 1950 with the 4th edition (dated 1951–1952) and has continued to this day. The book's all-time peak print run for a single year was 1.2&amp;nbsp;million copies in 1965.&lt;ref name="coinworld2016" /&gt;  The 70th edition, cover-dated 2017, was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="coinworld2016" /&gt;

The ''Red Book'' lists the retail value of all United States coins from Colonial and pre-federal State Issues to all circulating issues, as well as commemorative and modern-day [[bullion coin]]s, as well as other significant U.S. [[Pattern coin|patterns]], private and territorial gold, [[Hard-times token]]s, Confederate issues, Hawaiian tokens and coins, Philippine issues and Alaskan tokens. It also shows Issue Prices and Current Values of [[mint set]]s and [[proof set]]s.

The values are divided by main [[Coin grading|coin grades]].

[[File:Redbookinside.jpg|thumb|alt=Inside page.|Example inside page of the Red Book showing the [[Walking Liberty half dollar]]]]
== Name ==
The ''Guide Book'' got its ''Red Book'' nickname due to the book's solid red cover. 

== Formats ==
In addition to the traditional hardcover edition, new formats have been added through the years:
* Softcover (perfect bound) – 1993–1996, 1998, 2003–2006.
* Spiralbound softcover – 1997, 1999 to date.
* Spiralbound hardcover – 2008 to date.
* Large-print edition – 8x10, spiralbound softcover – 2010.
* LE Leatherbound – 2009 to date. Each year the publisher prints fewer copies than the previous year. (2015 was limited to only 500 copies; in years past they've printed 3,000 copies and those sold out very quickly)
* MEGA red - only 4 editions were printed, latest in 2018, dated 2019.

Early editions of the ''Red Book'' are collectible. The first edition has commanded $1,500 or more on the open market. 
The ''Red Book'' has its own ''Red Book'' – '''''A Guide Book Of The Official Red Book Of United States Coins''''' by [[Frank J. Colletti]] published 2009 by Whitman Publishing ({{ISBN|978-0-7948-2580-5}}).

A facsimile of the 1947 edition was published in 2006, on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the first edition.  Dubbed the "1947 Tribute Edition" ({{ISBN|0-7948-2230-4}}), it differs from the original by having a dust jacket (the first ''Red Book'' ever to have one) and an additional 32-page color section, comparing the coin collecting hobby in 1946 and 2006.  Except for the dust jacket and color section, it was an exact replica of the first printing (with the phrase "scarcity of this date" on page 135).

The '''''Alan Turing''''' statue, created in [[slate]] by [[Stephen Kettle]] in 2007, is located at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[England]] as part of an exhibition on [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref name="kettle"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stephenkettle.co.uk/turing.html | title=Alan Turing | first=Stephen | last=Kettle | authorlink=Stephen Kettle | website=www.stephenkettle.co.uk | location=UK | accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Greenish|Greenish, Simon]].

The slate for the sculpture was selected from [[North Wales]] because the sculptor learned that Turing used to holiday there as a child and adult.&lt;ref name="kettle" /&gt; The slate originated from [[Llechwedd quarry|Llechwedd]], near [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]]. Turing is depicted seated and looking at a German [[Enigma machine]]. He is dressed in a jacket, but there is some deliberate untidiness in his clothing.

In 2007, it was commented that the statue acknowledges Turing as a [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]] but not as a [[gay icon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/jun/19/theenigmaofalanturing | first=Richard | last=Smith | title=The enigma of Alan Turing | work=Art &amp; design blog  | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=19 June 2007 | accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue became part of a new exhibition at Bletchley Park on Alan Turing in 2012, the centenary year of Turing's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/06/new_turing_exhibition_bletchley_park/ | first=Brid-Aine | last=Parnell | title=Bletchley Park gets personal with new Alan Turing exhibition | work=Science | publisher=[[The Register]] | location=UK | date=6 March 2012 | accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Dermot Turing]], nephew of Alan Turing, attended the opening of the exhibition and posed with the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-17262062 | title=Alan Turing exhibition opens at Bletchley Park | work=[[BBC News]]  | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | date=7 March 2007 | accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfercam Museum''' ({{es icon}}: '''Museo Alfercam''') is a music and automobile [[museum]] in [[Avilés]], [[Asturias]], [[Spain]]. Its name is a combination of the owners' names: '''Al'''fredo and '''Fer'''nando '''Cam'''pelo.  Established 15 December 2006, it was Aviles' first museum and was open Wednesday through Sunday. It closed temporally 19 November 2008 due to financial losses.&lt;ref name="elcomerciodigital"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/aviles/20081217/aviles/museo-alfercam-unico-ciudad-20081217.html&amp;ei=I052SpnkE4eAswPK-tHMCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Museo%2BAlfercam%2522%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DODT|title=Alfercam Museum, the only one of the city, closed its doors after two years of activity|publisher=ElComercioDigital.com|access-date=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was open again.

The '''Allsport''' photography agency was started in 1968 by sports photographer Tony Duffy. It grew to become arguably the most highly respected sport photo agency in the world, and its photographers won numerous awards until acquisition by [[Getty Images]] in 1998.

Until 1968 Tony Duffy was an accountant and part-time photographer who shot [[track and field athletics]] in his spare time. He paid for himself to go to the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] in Mexico City.

At the 1968 Olympic Games, [[Bob Beamon]] broke the World Record in the Long Jump with a leap of 8m 90 or 29&amp;nbsp;ft 2½&amp;nbsp;inches. Crouched at the end of the long jump pit was Tony Duffy. Duffy took a picture which, through wide re-production, is perhaps the definitive shot of this remarkable jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosenbaum, Mike |url=http://trackandfield.about.com/od/longjump/ss/illuslongjump_3.htm|title= An Illustrated History of the Long Jump|accessdate=20 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Allsport agency was founded on the strength of his photograph of Beamon.

==1970s==

Tony Duffy was joined in the 1970s by photographers John Starr, Don Morley, and in 1971, Steve Powell. Powell would go on to become Group Managing Director. Morley specialised in shooting [[motorsport]], specifically motorbikes, and Starr took studio shots. Adrian Murrell joined in the mid seventies and became the agency's [[Cricket]] specialist. Duffy's innovative feature 'Sport and the Body' brought his name and the name of the agency to a wider audience when published by the Sunday Times in 1973. The use of naked sports stars caused uproar and brought nationwide publicity.

==1980s==

The Allsport agency experienced tremendous growth throughout the 1980s, and in 1983 Tony Duffy moved to California to open the Allsport USA offices in Santa Monica. In 1985 he was joined by Mike Powell, the younger brother of Steve. David Cannon joined in 1982 as a general sport photographer specialising in [[association football|football]] and [[golf]]. With Duffy working stateside, Bob Martin assumed the role of leading athletics photographer in Europe. Younger photographers such as Mike King, Simon Bruty, Gray Mortimore, Mike Stahlschmidt, Jonathan Daniel and Pascal Rondeau continued to create stunning and thought-provoking sport images.

In 1988 Allsport was appointed as Official Photographer to the International Olympic Committee. The first book in the Visions of Sport series was published to celebrate 20 years of Allsport, and included all of the famous images shot by Allsport photographers in its first 20 years.

The '''Amsterdam City Archives''' ({{lang-nl|Stadsarchief Amsterdam}}) preserves documents pertaining to the history of [[Amsterdam]] and provides information about the city. With archives covering a shelf-length of about 50 kilometres,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief/organisatie/bedrijfsprofiel/ Bedrijfsprofiel Stadsarchief Amsterdam]" {{du icon}} [archives profile], 20&amp;nbsp;March 2017. City of Amsterdam. www.amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief. Retrieved 8&amp;nbsp;June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the Amsterdam City Archives is the largest municipal archive in the world.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, Amsterdam’s important documents were stored in a special cabinet that was kept in the so-called ‘Iron Chapel’ (IJzeren Kapel) in the Old Church ([[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]]).&lt;ref&gt;P. Scheltema, ''Het archief der ijzeren kapel in de Oude of Sint Nikolaas kerk te Amsterdam'', Amsterdam 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, the archives moved to the Waag building at the [[Nieuwmarkt]], and in 1914 to the [[former town hall of Nieuwer-Amstel]]. Since the summer of 2007, the Amsterdam City Archives have been located in the monumental building [[De Bazel]], in the city-centre, which derives its name from the famous Dutch architect K.P.C. de Bazel, who designed it.&lt;ref&gt;''De Bazel: tempel aan de Vijzelstraat in Amsterdam'', Mariëlle Hageman, Stefanie van Odenhoven and Ludger Smit eds., Bussum 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
The Amsterdam City Archives belongs to the [[government of Amsterdam]]. It preserves the archives of the municipal government and of the national government when related to Amsterdam, besides those of private institutions, families or individuals, and companies connected with the city. The municipalities of [[Ouder-Amstel]] and [[Amstelveen]] have also deposited their historical archives at the Amsterdam City Archives. In addition, the City Archives houses a large collection of images and audio-visual material, as well as a library.

Among the various documents of international significance kept at the Amsterdam City Archives are the archives of the [[Heineken]] brewery and the renowned [[Concertgebouw]], letters written by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], an eighteenth-century trade agreement between the city and the newly founded [[United States of America]], the book containing the excommunication of seventeenth-century philosopher [[Spinoza]], and a police report about the theft of [[Anne Frank]]’s bike, dated April 13, 1942.

The Amsterdam City Archives also monitors the way the various departments within Amsterdam’s administrative structure manage their archives, ensuring that documents that are of significance for the city’s history are maintained.

==Publication==
Archival material is made available for consultation both on site and through the internet. In recent years, many documents have been digitized. The website of the Amsterdam City Archives features an Image Bank, containing more than 260.000 photos, drawings, and prints related to the city, and an Archives Database, providing scans of archival material on request, including a wealth of sources for genealogical research, accessible through several indexes. These scans now number more than seven million.&lt;ref&gt;''Stadsarchief in beweging: het Stadsarchief Amsterdam tussen 2006 en 2010'', Amsterdam 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amsterdam City Archives also shares the available expertise on Amsterdam and its history through publications and events. The Archives regularly presents temporary exhibitions, while noteworthy documents are on permanent display in the so-called Treasury (Schatkamer). Historical films about Amsterdam are shown in a small movie theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">'''Biodiesel''' has a number of '''standards''' for its quality.

{{main|Biodiesel}}

[[Image:Biodiesel.JPG|thumb|Biodiesel sample]]

The European standard for biodiesel is [[EN 14214]], which is translated into the respective national standards for each country that forms the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] (European Committee for Standardization) area e.g., for the United Kingdom, [[British Standards|BS]] EN 14214 and for Germany [[DIN]] EN 14214.  It may be used outside the CEN area  as well. The main difference that exists between EN 14214 standards of different countries is the national annex detailing climate related requirements of biodiesel in different CEN member countries.

Other international standards published by [[ASTM International]] include:
* [[ASTM D6751|D6751]]-08 Specification for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock (B100) for Middle Distillate Fuels
* D975-08a Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils (on and off-road applications)
* D396-08b Specification for Fuel Oils (home heating and boiler applications)
* D7467-08 Specification for Diesel Fuel Oil, Biodiesel Blend (B6 to B20)

There are also [[DIN]] standards for three different varieties of biodiesel, which are made of different oils:
*RME ([[rapeseed]] methyl [[ester]], according to DIN E 51606)
*PME (vegetable methyl ester, purely vegetable products, according to DIN E 51606)
*FME (fat methyl ester, vegetable and animal products, according to DIN V 51606)

The National Standards of Canada for biodiesel are published by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc-cgsb/publications/catalogue/index-eng.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
*CAN/CGSB-3.520  Diesel Fuel Containing Low Levels of Biodiesel (B1 - B5)    
*CAN/CGSB-3.522  Diesel Fuel Containing Biodiesel (B6-B20)  
*CAN/CGSB-3.524  Biodiesel (B100) for Blending in Middle Distillate Fuels

The standards ensure that the following important factors in the fuel production process are satisfied:
*Acid value
*Complete reaction.
*Removal of [[glycerin]].
*Removal of [[catalyst]].
*Removal of [[alcohol]].
*Absence of [[Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acids]].
*Low [[sulfur]] content.
*Cold Filter Plugging point
*Cloud Point

Basic industrial tests to determine whether the products conform to the standards typically include [[Chromatography#Gas chromatography|gas chromatography]], a test that verifies only the more important of the variables above. Tests that are more complete are more expensive. Fuel meeting the quality standards is very non-toxic, with a toxicity rating ({{LD50}}) of greater than 50 mL/kg.

==ASTM B20 ==

[[ASTM International]] has approved a new specification for diesel fuel blends containing 6%-20% biodiesel. According to the [[National Biodiesel Board]] (NBB), ASTM standards for the 20% biodiesel blends, or B20, are a crucial hurdle for the full acceptance of the use of such blends in diesel vehicles. In 2008, ASTM published new Biodiesel Blend Specifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbb.grassroots.com/09Releases/ASTMBlend/ National Biodiesel Board Press Release 10/14/08] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216020822/http://nbb.grassroots.com/09Releases/ASTMBlend/ |date=2008-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new specification in place, automakers and engine manufacturers can test B20 in their diesel engines and know that consumers will be fueling their vehicle with a fuel of the same quality. Currently, Chrysler LLC supports the use of B20 in its Dodge Ram diesel pickups, but only for use in fleets. Likewise, General Motors Corporation accepts the use of 5% biodiesel blends, or B5, in all its vehicles, but limits the use of B20 to special equipment options available only to government fleets in a limited selection of vehicles. While setting the new B20 standard, ASTM International also made changes to its specifications for B5 and for 100% biodiesel, or B100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11838 EERE News: EERE Network News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The FTC will require pumps with biodiesel blends to carry a blue label, while biomass-based diesel blends will carry an orange label. The somewhat confusing "small print" was required by the energy act.
Credit: Federal Trade Commission
 
Engine warranty concerns also came into play in a recent effort to create labeling requirements for diesel fuels containing renewable fuel blends. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to set labeling requirements that address the blending of biodiesel and other types of biomass-based diesel fuels into diesel fuel. Some companies are converting biomass such as animal fats directly into a liquid with the properties of diesel fuel, a product that blurs the lines between biodiesel and diesel fuel. At first, the FTC proposed to treat all renewable diesel fuels the same, but the NBB warned that not all biomass-based diesel fuels would necessarily meet the ASTM standards required by automakers for diesel fuels. On the other hand, biomass-based diesel fuels that meet ASTM standards could be used in much higher concentrations than biodiesel, which is usually limited to 20% biodiesel blends for standard diesel vehicles. Considering those comments, the FTC decided to set separate labeling requirements for biodiesel blends and biomass-based diesel fuel blends.

'''''Cape Town &amp; District Gas, Light &amp; Coke Co, Ltd v Director of Valuations'''''&lt;ref&gt;1949 (4) SA 197 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by De Villiers JP and Searle J on August 5, 1949, with judgment on August 30. P. Charles appeared for the appellant and HG Lawrence KC for the respondent.

== Facts ==
In 1903, the appellant company had built, on a concrete foundation sunk four feet below surface level, a heavy steel structure for the purpose

# of storing gas generated in a building some distance from it; and
# of supplying such gas for consumption to the public.

The gas holder was not affixed to the soil by any mechanical means; its affixation was entirely due to its sheer weight resting upon the concrete foundation. It appeared that the company intended using it as long as it continued to function efficiently.

== Judgment ==
In an appeal under section 67 of Ordinance 26 of 1944 (Cape), the court held that the [[gasometer]] was [[immovable property]]. The court held further that it was a "structural improvement" within section 45(h) of the Ordinance, although ''[[quaere]]'' whether the structure was also a "building" within the meaning of sub-section (b) of section 45.

The '''{{code|cd}}''' command, also known as '''{{code|chdir}}''' ('''ch'''ange '''dir'''ectory), is a [[Command-line interface|command-line]] [[operating system shell|OS shell]]&lt;!-- It is a sea of blue, but not a pleonasm: "command-line" is subordinated to "shell", not to "command" further --&gt; command used to change the current [[working directory]] in [[operating system]]s such as [[Unix]], [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], [[TRIPOS]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagetable.com/docs/amigados_tripos/tripos_manuals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, [[AmigaOS]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/1988-rugheimer-spanik-amigados-quick-reference&lt;/ref&gt; (where if a bare [[Path (computing)|path]] is given, cd is ''implied''), [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], and [[Linux]]. It can be used in [[shell script]]s and [[batch file]]s. The command is also available in the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[MS-DOS]] [[emulator]] [[DOSBox]] and in the [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI shell]].&lt;ref name="EFI-Shells-and-Scripting"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/efi-shells-and-scripting/
 | title = EFI Shells and Scripting
 | publisher = [[Intel]]
 | accessdate = 2013-09-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The command is named {{code|chdir}} in [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE/iX]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamnaconsulting.com/compresources/pdfs/c01687363.pdf MPE/iX Command Reference Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[system call]] that affects the command in most operating systems is {{code|chdir}} that is defined by [[POSIX]].
The command is analogous to the [[Stratus VOS|OpenVOS]] {{code|change_current_dir}} command.&lt;ref&gt;http://stratadoc.stratus.com/vos/19.1.0/r098-19/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/r098-19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
A [[directory (file systems)|directory]] is a logical section of a [[file system]] used to hold files. Directories may also contain other directories. The {{code|cd}} command can be used to change into a subdirectory, move back into the parent directory, move all the way back to the [[root directory]] or move to any given directory.

Consider the following subsection of a Unix filesystem, which shows a user's [[home directory]] (represented as {{code|~}}) with a file, {{code|text.txt}}, and three subdirectories.

[[File:chdir example.png|center|framed|A user's view of the file system in Unix-like systems begins with the home directory (often abbreviated to {{code|~}}). From there, the tree can spread into more subdirectories and/or files.]]
{{clear}}

If the user's current working directory is the home directory ({{code|~}}), then entering the command &lt;code&gt;[[ls]]&lt;/code&gt; followed by {{code|cd games}} might produce the following transcript:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
user@wikipedia:~$ ls
workreports games encyclopedia text.txt
user@wikipedia:~$ cd games
user@wikipedia:~/games$
&lt;/source&gt;

The user is now in the "games" directory.

A similar session in DOS (though the concept of a "home directory" may not apply, depending on the specific version{{Vague|date=February 2011}}) would look like this:

 C:\&gt; '''[[dir (command)|dir]]'''
 workreports        &lt;DIR&gt;       Wed Oct 9th   9:01
 games              &lt;DIR&gt;       Tue Oct 8th  14:32
 encyclopedia       &lt;DIR&gt;       Mon Oct 1st  10:05
 text        txt           1903 Thu Oct10th  12:43
 C:\&gt; '''cd''' games
 C:\games&gt;

DOS maintains separate working directories for each [[Drive letter assignment|lettered drive]], and also has the concept of a current working drive. The {{code|cd}} command can be used to change the working directory of the working drive or another lettered drive. Typing the drive letter as a command on its own changes the working drive, e.g. {{code|C:}}; alternatively, {{code|cd}} with the {{code|/d}} switch may be used to change the working drive and that drive's working directory in one step.
Modern versions of Windows simulate this behaviour for backwards compatibility under [[CMD.EXE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/10/11/10073890.aspx Why does each drive have its own current directory?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that executing {{code|cd}} from the command line with no arguments has different effects in different operating systems. For example, if  {{code|cd}} is executed without arguments in DOS, OS/2, or Windows, the current [[working directory]] is displayed (equivalent to Unix &lt;code&gt;[[pwd]]&lt;/code&gt;). If {{code|cd}} is executed without arguments in Unix, the user is returned to the home directory.

Executing the {{code|cd}} command within a script or batch file also has different effects in different operating systems. In DOS, the caller's current directory can be directly altered by the [[batch file]]'s use of this command.  In [[Unix]], the caller's current directory is not altered by the script's invocation of the {{code|cd}} command. This is because in Unix, the script is usually executed within a [[child process|subshell]].

{{code|cd}} is frequently included built directly into a command-line interpreter. This is the case in most of the [[Unix shell]]s ([[Bourne shell]], [[tcsh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], etc.), &lt;code&gt;[[cmd.exe]]&lt;/code&gt; and [[Windows PowerShell]] on Windows and &lt;code&gt;[[COMMAND.COM]]&lt;/code&gt;  on DOS.

Command line shells on Windows usually use the [[Windows API]] to change the current working directory, whereas on Unix systems {{code|cd}} calls the {{code|chdir()}} [[POSIX]] [[C (programming language)|C]] function. This means that when the command is executed, no new process is created to migrate to the other directory as is the case with other commands such as [[ls]]. Instead, the shell itself executes this command. This is because, when a new [[Process (computing)|process]] is created, [[child process]] inherits the directory in which the [[parent process]] was created. If the {{code|cd}} command inherits the parent process' directory, then the objective of the command cd will never be achieved.

[[Windows PowerShell]], Microsoft's object-oriented command line shell and [[scripting language]], executes the {{code|cd}} command (''cmdlet'') within the shell's process. However, since PowerShell is based on the [[.NET Framework]] and has a different architecture than previous shells, all of PowerShell's cmdlets like [[ls]], [[rm (Unix)|rm]] etc. run in the shell's process. Of course, this is not true for legacy commands which still run in a separate process.

* {{code|cd}} by itself or {{code|cd ~}} will always put you in your home directory.
* {{code|cd .}} will leave you in the same directory you are currently in (i.e. your current directory won't change). This can be useful if your shell's internal code can't deal with the directory you are in being recreated; running {{code|cd .}} will place your shell in the recreated directory.
* {{code|cd ~username}} will put you in username's home directory.
* {{code|cd dir}} (without a {{code|/}}) will put you in a subdirectory; for example, if you are in {{code|/usr}}, typing {{code|cd bin}} will put you in {{code|/usr/bin}}, while {{code|cd /bin}} puts you in {{code|/bin}}.
* {{code|cd ..}} will move you up one directory. So, if you are {{code|/usr/bin/tmp}}, {{code|cd ..}} moves you to {{code|/usr/bin}}, while {{code|cd ../..}} moves you to {{code|/usr}} (i.e. up two levels). You can use this indirection to access subdirectories too. So, from {{code|/usr/bin/tmp}}, you can use {{code|cd ../../local}} to go to {{code|/usr/local}}.
* {{code|cd -}} will switch you to the previous directory. For example, if you are in {{code|/usr/bin/tmp}}, and go to {{code|/etc}}, you can type {{code|cd -}} to go back to {{code|/usr/bin/tmp}}. You can use this to toggle back and forth between two directories.

===DOS, OS/2, Windows, ReactOS===
* ''no attributes'' print the full [[Path (computing)|path]] of the current directory.
* {{code|-p}} Print the final directory stack, just like dirs.{{Where|Which OS? On Linux, &lt;code&gt;cd -p&lt;/code&gt; outputs &lt;code&gt;bash: cd: -p: invalid option&lt;/code&gt; whereas &lt;code&gt;dirs&lt;/code&gt; outputs &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;.|date=July 2011}}
* {{code|-n}} Entries are wrapped before they reach the edge of the screen. {{Where|Which OS? &lt;code&gt;cd -n&lt;/code&gt; outputs &lt;code&gt;invalid option&lt;/code&gt; under Linux.|date=July 2011}}
* {{code|-v}} entries are printed one per line, preceded by their stack positions. {{Where|Which OS? &lt;code&gt;cd -v&lt;/code&gt; outputs &lt;code&gt;invalid option&lt;/code&gt; under Linux.|date=July 2011}}
* {{code|cd\}} (DOS and Windows only) returns to the root dir. Consequently, command {{code|cd\subdir}} always takes the user to the named subdirectory on the ''root directory'', regardless of where they are located when the command is issued.
&lt;!-- Unlike the
O/T moved to [[working directory]]
--&gt;

==Interpreters other than an operating systems shell==
In the [[File Transfer Protocol]], the respective command is spelled {{code|CWD}} in the control stream, but is available as {{code|cd}} in most [[client (computing)|client]] command-line programs. Some clients also have the {{code|lcd}} for changing the working directory '''l'''ocally.

The command also pertains to command-line interpreters of various application software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">'''Charles Pierre Henri Rieu''' (June 8, 1820 &amp;ndash; March 19, 1902) was a Swiss [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], for many years Professor of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in [[University College London|London]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

==Biography==
Rieu was born at [[Geneva]], and studied at [[Bonn University]], where he received his doctors degree in 1843. He entered the [[British Museum]] in 1847, and after twenty years of service, a new post, that of Keeper of Oriental Manuscripts, was created for him.

He was a Professor of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] at [[University College London]].&lt;ref name=TTObituary /&gt; In 1895 he was made professor of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], with the full title '[[Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic]]', in succession to [[William Robertson Smith|Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=R894CP|name=Rieu, Charle Pierre Henri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieu died in [[London]] on 19 March 1902.&lt;ref name=TTObituary&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Obituary |day_of_week=Friday |date=21 March 1902 |page_number=3 |issue=36721| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of [[E. V. Rieu]].

==Publications==
Rieu completed in 1871 the second part, dealing with Arabic manuscripts, of the ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum orientalium'', which had been begun by [[William Cureton]], and he issued a supplementary volume in 1894.

He also drew up a ''Catalogue of the Turkish Manuscripts'' (1888) and a ''Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts'' (4 vols, 1879–95),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/catalogueofpersi01brituoft Catalogue of the Persian manuscripts in the British museum (1879)]&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being a storehouse of information on the books and their authors.

:''CSEL redirects here. For the Combat Survivor/Evader Locator of the U.S. military, see [[survival radio]].''

The '''''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum''''' ('''CSEL''') is an academic series that publishes critical editions of Latin works by late-antique Christian authors.

== Description ==
The CSEL publishes Latin writings of Christian authors from the time of the late 2nd century ([[Tertullian]]) until the beginning of the 8th century ([[Bede]] the Venerable, †735). Each text is edited on the basis of all (or the most important of all) the extant manuscripts according to modern [[Textual criticism|editorial techniques]], in order to produce a text as close as possible to the original. Each volume includes an introduction, in which the principles of the preparation of the text are explained. 
Some editions are prepared by the [http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/personen/ staff of the CSEL], others by external, internationally renowned experts; the volumes are published after a positive evaluation by an international advisory board; the publisher is [[De Gruyter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/432120 Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum]&lt;/ref&gt; (prior to 2012: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften). The CSEL also runs the online database [http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/hilfsmittel/edenda/ Edenda],&lt;ref&gt;[http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/hilfsmittel/edenda/ CSEL – Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum]&lt;/ref&gt; where CSEL editions as well as editing projects by others are publicly announced.
In addition, the CSEL publishes special catalogues for the large extant corpus of medieval manuscripts containing works of Augustine or ascribed to him ("Die handschriftliche Überlieferung der Werke des heiligen Augustinus"), in order to make time-consuming research in this field easier. In addition, monographs on topics related to the Latin patristic period and conference proceedings are published at irregular intervals ("[http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/publikationen/extra-seriem/ CSEL Extra seriem]").&lt;ref&gt;http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/publikationen/extra-seriem/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The CSEL was founded in 1864 by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna (Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften) in order to produce critical editions of Latin patristic texts – editions that were meant to facilitate the lexicographical work of the Thesaurus linguae Latinae (at that time still in the planning stages).&lt;ref&gt;http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/profil/geschichte/&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2012 the CSEL was edited by the “Kommission zur Herausgabe des Corpus der lateinischen Kirchenväter” (“Kirchenväterkommission”) of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. The chairmen of this commission were:&lt;ref&gt;Weber, 150 Jahre Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, X&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1864–1874: Johannes Vahlen
* 1875–1891: Franz von Miklosich
* 1891–1907: Wilhelm von Hartel
* 1907–1916: Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke
* 1916–1941: Edmund Hauler
* 1941–1963: Richard Meister
* 1964–1982: Rudolf Hanslik
* 1982–1991: Herbert Hunger
* 1991–2001: Adolf Primmer
* 2001–2012: Kurt Smolak
After the commission was transferred to the [[University of Salzburg]] in 2012, the CSEL became part of the Department of Ancient Studies / Latin at the University of Salzburg.

== Evaluation and controversy ==
The series currently consists of about 100 [http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/publikationen/csel/ volumes], some with multiple sub-volumes.&lt;ref&gt;http://csel.sbg.ac.at/en/publikationen/csel/&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes have replaced about a third of J. P. Migne’s [[Patrologia Latina]], which do not offer critical editions. Some CSEL volumes have themselves been replaced by more recent critical editions (e.g., [[Corpus Christianorum]] Series Latina, [[Sources chrétiennes]], [[Bibliothèque augustinienne]]), but about two-thirds of them are still considered authoritative standard editions; in fact, the CSEL edition often remains the only critical edition of a given text.
In the course of work on the manuscript catalogues as well as on the preparation of CSEL editions, patristic texts which were previously thought lost have been recovered: e.g., the writings of the Spanish heretic [[Priscillian]],&lt;ref&gt;CSEL 18, Wien 1889, ed. Georg Schepps&lt;/ref&gt; the commentary on Revelation by [[Victorinus of Pettau]],&lt;ref&gt;CSEL 49, Wien 1916, ed. Johannes Haussleiter&lt;/ref&gt; 29 unknown letters of [[Augustine]] ("Epistulae Divjak"),&lt;ref&gt;CSEL 88, Wien 1981, ed. Johannes Divjak&lt;/ref&gt; six of Augustine’s sermons ("Sermones Erfurt"),&lt;ref&gt;Wiener Studien 121 (2008), 227-284 und 122 (2009), 171-213, edd. Isabella Schiller, Dorothea Weber, Clemens Weidmann&lt;/ref&gt; and the full text of the commentary on the gospels by [[Fortunatianus of Aquileia]] (mid-4th century; edition published 2017). Numerous volumes of the CSEL were incorporated into the digital [[Library of Latin Texts]] (LLT).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10440">'''Country code top-level domains with commercial licenses''' are [[Internet]] [[country code top-level domain]] that have adopted a policy for worldwide commercial use.

Some of the world's smallest countries have opened their country code domain to worldwide registrations for commercial purposes. For example, [[Tuvalu]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], small island-states in the Pacific, have partnered with [[VeriSign]] and FSM Telecommunications respectively, to sell domain name registrations using the &lt;tt&gt;[[.tv|TV]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.fm|fm]]&lt;/tt&gt; TLDs to television and radio stations.

Some commercially available ccTLDs are in demand for use outside their home countries because their name can provide a component of a meaningful word or phrase. These are sometimes referred to as vanity ccTLDs.

==List of ccTLDs permitting worldwide commercial use==
* [[.ac|&lt;tt&gt;ac&lt;/tt&gt;]] ([[Ascension Island]]) is sometimes used to stand for "Access Connection" or "Access Card". It is occasionally used by universities to stand for "academic", for example by the [[University of Kurdistan – Hawler]] (&lt;tt&gt;ukh.ac&lt;/tt&gt;) or [[Ralston College]] (&lt;tt&gt;ralston.ac&lt;/tt&gt;), 
* [[.ad|&lt;tt&gt;ad&lt;/tt&gt;]] ([[Andorra]]) has recently been increasingly used by advertising agencies or [[classified advertising]].
* [[.ag|&lt;tt&gt;ag&lt;/tt&gt;]] ([[Antigua and Barbuda]]) is sometimes used for agricultural sites.

CPT coding is similar to [[ICD-9]] and [[ICD-10]] coding, except that it identifies the services rendered, rather than the diagnosis on the claim (ICD-10-CM was created for diagnostic coding- it took the place of Volume 3 of the ICD-9). The ICD code sets also contain procedure codes ([[ICD-10 Procedure Coding System|ICD-10-PCS codes]]), but these are only used in the [[inpatient]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Overview of inpatient coding |journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy |date=1 November 2003 |first=Sherri, Pharm.D. |last=Alexander |volume=60 |url=http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/docs/files/Suppl6_Alexander.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917102527/https://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/docs/files/Suppl6_Alexander.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPT is currently identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)&lt;ref name="cms.hhs"&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720142115/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ |date=July 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Level 1 of the [[Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System]].

The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) was developed by the American Medical Association (AMA).&lt;ref name="cms.hhs" /&gt;

==Types of code==
There are three types of CPT code: Category I, Category II, and Category III.

===Category I===
Category I CPT Code(s). There are six main sections:&lt;ref name="Moisio2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie A.

CPT II codes describe clinical components usually included in evaluation and management or clinical services and are not associated with any relative value.  Category II codes are reviewed by the Performance Measures Advisory Group (PMAG), an advisory body to the CPT Editorial Panel and the CPT/HCPAC Advisory Committee. The PMAG is composed of performance measurement experts representing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement. The PMAG may seek additional expertise and/or input from other national health care organizations, as necessary, for the development of Category II codes. These may include national medical specialty societies, other national health care professional associations, accrediting bodies and federal regulatory agencies.

Category II codes make use of an alphabetical character as the 5th character in the string (i.e., 4 digits followed by the letter F). These digits are not intended to reflect the placement of the code in the regular (Category I) part of the CPT codebook. Appendix H in CPT section contains information about performance measurement exclusion of modifiers, measures, and the measures' source(s).  Currently there are 11 Category II codes. They are:

* (0001F-0015F) Composite measures
* (0500F-0584F) Patient management
* (1000F-1505F) Patient history
* (2000F-2060F) Physical examination
* (3006F-3776F) Diagnostic/screening processes or results
* (4000F-4563F) Therapeutic, preventive or other interventions
* (5005F-5250F) Follow-up or other outcomes
* (6005F-6150F) Patient safety
* (7010F-7025F) Structural Measures
* (9001F-9007F) Non-Measure Claims Based Reporting

CPT II codes are billed in the procedure code field, just as CPT Category I codes are billed.  Because CPT II codes are not associated with any relative value, they are billed with a $0.00 billable charge amount.&lt;ref&gt;AMA coding manual&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Profundis''''' (Latin: "from the depths") is a letter written by [[Oscar Wilde]] during his imprisonment in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]], to "Bosie" ([[Lord Alfred Douglas]]).

In its first half Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde's conviction and imprisonment for [[gross indecency]]. He indicts both Lord Alfred's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes. In the second half, Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with [[Jesus Christ]], whom he characterises as a romantic, individualist artist. The letter began "Dear Bosie" and ended "Your Affectionate Friend".

Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897, close to the end of his imprisonment. Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision, physical labour, and emotional isolation. Nelson, the new prison governor, thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour. He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write "for medicinal purposes"; each page was taken away when completed, and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions. Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897.{{sfn|Belford|2000|p=272}}

Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]] (another former lover, loyal friend and rival to "Bosie"). Ross published the letter in 1905, five years after Wilde's death, giving it the title "''De Profundis''" from [[Psalm 130]]. It was an incomplete version, excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde's letters.

==Background==

=== Trials ===
{{main| Oscar Wilde#Trials}}
[[File:Oscar Wilde.jpeg|175px|thumb|right|Oscar Wilde in New York in 1882; by 1897 he had lost much weight after a year and a half in prison.]]
In 1891 Wilde began an intimate friendship with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], a young, vain aristocrat. As the two grew closer, family and friends on both sides urged Wilde and Douglas to lessen their contact. Lord Alfred's father, [[John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|the Marquess of Queensberry]], often feuded with his son over the topic. Especially after the suicide death of his eldest son, the [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Viscount Drumlanrig]], Queensberry privately accused them of improper acts and threatened to cut off Lord Alfred's allowance. When they refused, he began publicly harassing Wilde. In early 1895 Wilde had reached the height of his fame and success with his plays ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' on stage in London.  When Wilde returned from holidays after the premieres, he found Queensberry's card at his club with the inscription: "For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite{{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;Holland (2004:300)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes" name='e'&gt;Queensberry's handwriting was almost indecipherable: The hall porter initially read "ponce and sodomite", but Queensberry himself claimed that he'd written "posing 'as' a sodomite", an easier accusation to defend in court. [[Merlin Holland]] concludes that "what Queensberry almost certainly wrote was "posing {{Sic|som|domite}}", (Holland (2004:300))&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to bear further insults and encouraged by Lord Alfred (who wanted to attack his father in every possible way), Wilde sued Queensberry for criminal libel. Wilde withdrew his claim as the defence began but the Judge deemed that Queensberry's accusation was justified. The Crown promptly issued a warrant for his arrest and he was charged with gross indecency with other men under the [[Labouchere Amendment]] in April 1895. The trial was the centre of public discussion as details of Wilde's consorts from the working class became known. Wilde refused to admit wrongdoing and the jury were unable to reach a verdict. At the retrial Wilde was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to be held to [[hard labour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/sentence.html Sentencing Statement of Justice Wills]. Criminal Trial Transcript Page, University of Missouri-Kansas Law School. Retrieved 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imprisonment ===
He was imprisoned in [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]], [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth]], and [[Reading (HM Prison)|Reading]] Prisons, where the poor food, manual labour, and harsh conditions greatly weakened his health.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:451)&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly began suffering from hunger, insomnia, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (19988:454)&lt;/ref&gt; He was visited in Pentonville by [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|R. B. S. Haldane]], a liberal, reforming MP whom he had known before. Haldane championed his case and arranged for access to religious, educational, and historical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:456)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in Wandsworth Wilde collapsed in the Chapel and burst his right ear drum, an injury that would later contribute to his death. He spent two months recovering in the infirmary.&lt;ref name="Ellmann 1988:465"&gt;Ellmann (1988:465)&lt;/ref&gt; Friends arranged for him to be transferred to Reading Prison, where he was prescribed lighter duties and allowed to spend some time reading but not writing.&lt;ref name="Ellmann 1988:465" /&gt; Depressed, he was unable to complete even these duties, and under Colonel Isaacson, the strict Warden of Reading Prison, Wilde became trapped in a series of harsh punishments for trivial offences. The failure to complete them led to renewed sanction.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:465–466)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde, who still loved Lord Alfred, became upset as contact from him became rare, then annoyed when he learned that the latter planned to publish Wilde's letters without permission and dedicate poems to him unasked. He wrote to friends immediately, forbidding the former and refusing the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:460)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde still maintained his belief that the Queensberrys owed him a debt of honour arising from his bankruptcy trial.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
[[File:Oscar Wilde Prison Cell Reading 2016.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Wilde's cell in Reading Gaol where he wrote ''De Profundis'' – as it appears today]]
Wilde's friends continued pressing for better conditions and, in 1897, Major Nelson, a man of a more progressive mind, replaced Col. Isaacson as Warden. He quickly visited Wilde and offered him a book from his personal library, the sympathy bringing Wilde to tears.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:467)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon Wilde requested lists of books, returning to Ancient Greek poets and Christian theology, and studying modern Italian and German, though it was [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' that held his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:478)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde was granted official permission to have writing materials in early 1897, but even then under strict control: he could write to his friends and his solicitor, but only one page at a time. Wilde decided to write a letter to Douglas, and in it discuss the last five years they had spent together, creating an autobiography of sorts.&lt;ref name="Ellmann 1988:479"&gt;Ellmann (1988:479)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde spent January, February, and March 1897 writing his letter. Textual analysis of the manuscript shows that Nelson probably relaxed the stringent rules, allowing Wilde to see the papers together: three of the sheets are of relatively fair copy, suggesting they were entirely re-written, and most do not end with a full-stop.&lt;ref name="Ellmann 1988:479" /&gt; Wilde requested that he might send the letter to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] or [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]], which the Home Office denied, but he was permitted to take it with him on release.&lt;ref name="Holland/Hart-Davis 2000 683"&gt;Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:683)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde never revised the work after he left prison.&lt;ref&gt;Raby (1988:140)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and content ==
[[File:Lord Alfred Douglas by George Charles Beresford (1903).jpg|175px|thumb|left| Lord Alfred Douglas, to whom ''De Profundis'' is addressed]]
{{Quotation|HM Prison, Reading&lt;br&gt; Dear Bosie,&lt;br&gt; After long and fruitless waiting I have determined to write to you myself, as much for your sake as for mine, as I would not like to think that I had passed through two long years of imprisonment without ever having received a single line from you, or any news or message even, except such as gave me pain&amp;nbsp;...}}

=== First part: Wilde's account of time with Douglas ===
Wilde's work was written as a prose letter on twenty sheets of prison paper. It contains no formal divisions (save paragraphs) and is addressed and signed off as a letter. Scholars have distinguished a noticeable change in style, tone and content in the latter half of the letter, when Wilde addresses his spiritual journey in prison.&lt;ref name="Raby 1988 135"&gt;Raby (1988:135)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part, Wilde examines the time he and Lord Alfred had spent together, from 1892 until Wilde's trials in the spring of 1895. He examines Lord Alfred's behaviour and its detrimental effect on Wilde's work, and recounts Lord Alfred's constant demands on his attention and hospitality. Poignancy builds throughout this section as Wilde details the expenses of their sumptuous dinners and hotel-stays, many costing over £1,000; it culminates in an account of Douglas's rage in Brighton whilst Wilde was ill. Though he was a constant presence at Wilde's side, their relationship was intellectually sterile.&lt;ref name="Raby134"&gt;Raby (1988:134)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Wilde's self-accusation is that he acceded to these demands instead of placing himself within quiet, intellectual company dedicated to the contemplation of beauty and ideas, but instead succumbed to an "imperfect world of coarse uncompleted passions, of appetite without distinction, desire without limit, and formless greed".&lt;ref name="Raby 1988 135" /&gt; This passage concludes with Wilde offering his forgiveness to Douglas. He repudiates him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity; he had not forgotten Douglas's remark, when he was ill, "When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting."&lt;ref&gt;(''De Profundis'') Holland/Hart-Davis, (2000:700)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second part: Christ as a romantic artist ===
The second part of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual growth through the physical and emotional hardships of his imprisonment. Wilde introduces the greater context, making a typically grandiose claim: "I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age",&lt;ref&gt;Raby (1988:135,6)&lt;/ref&gt; though he later writes, in a more humble vein, "I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. There is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life. For the secret of life is suffering." Briefly sketching his ascendancy and dominance of the literary and social scenes in London, he contrasts his past position and the attendant pleasure with his current position and the pain it brings. Pleasure and success are an artifice, he says, while pain wears no mask. He turns to humility as a remedy, and identifies with the other prisoners.&lt;ref name="Raby 1988 136"&gt;Raby (1988:136)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde uses [[Isaiah]] 53:3 to introduce his Christian theme: "He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid our faces from him." Though Peter Raby acknowledges the "obvious relevance" of this quotation to Wilde's situation, he argues that the line does not necessitate the comparison with Christ implicit in his description of Robert Ross doffing his hat to Wilde after his conviction.&lt;ref name="Raby 1988 136" /&gt; Wilde adopts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] as a symbol of western kindness and eastern serenity and as a rebel-hero of mind, body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Kiberd (2000:330)&lt;/ref&gt; Though other [[romantic movement|romantics]] had discussed Jesus in artistic terms, Wilde's conception is the most radical. He moves methodically toward this conclusion: his earlier [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] attitude is re-iterated and he finds no recompense in traditional morality. Though Wilde loved the beauty of religion, he dismissed it now as a source of solace, saying "My Gods dwell in temples made with hands". Reason was similarly lacking: Wilde felt that the law had convicted him unjustly. Instead Wilde reworked his earlier doctrine of the appreciation of experience: all of it must be accepted and transformed, whatever its origin. Wilde declared he would actively accept sorrow and discover humility, be happy and appreciate developments in art and life.&lt;ref&gt;Raby (1988:137)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also felt redemption and fulfilment in his ordeal, realising that his hardship had filled the soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time:

{{quote|I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world&amp;nbsp;... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.&lt;ref&gt;(''De Profundis'') Holland/Hart-Davis, (2000:739).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Simon Critchley]] argues that the major element of ''De Profundis'' is self-realisation. Wilde, having lost everything dear to him, does not accuse external forces, justified as this might have been, but rather absorbs his hardships through the artistic process into a spiritual experience.&lt;ref name="critchley"&gt;Critchley, Simon [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jan/14/religion-wilde Oscar Wilde's faithless Christianity] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 15 January 2009. Retrieved 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and themes ==
Though a letter, at 50,000 words long ''De Profundis'' becomes a sort of dramatic monologue which considers Douglas's supposed responses.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988){{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde's previous prose writing had assumed a flippant, chatty style, which he again employed in his comic plays. In prison Wilde was disconnected from his audiences, which Declan Kiberd suggested was possibly his harshest punishment. He characterises Wilde as an Irish critic of English social mores ultimately silenced for his polemics, and reports that while convalescing in the sick-bay, Wilde entertained his fellow-patients and carers with stories and wit until the authorities placed a warder beside his bed.&lt;ref name="kiberd335" /&gt;

In a preface to the 1905 (and, later, 1912) edition,&lt;ref&gt;Robert, Ross, Preface to "De Profundis". London: Methuen &amp; Co., Mar. 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;  published as a popular edition by Methuen, [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]], Wilde's literary executor, published an extract from Wilde's instructions to him which included the author's own summation of the work:

{{quote|I don't defend my conduct. I explain it. Also in my letter there are several passages which explain my mental development while in prison, and the inevitable evolution of my character and intellectual attitude towards life that has taken place, and I want you and others who stand by me and have affection for me to know exactly in what mood and manner I face the world. Of course, from one point of view, I know that on the day of my release I will merely be moving from one prison into another, and there are times when the whole world seems to be no larger than my cell, and as full of terror for me. Still at the beginning I believe that God made a world for each separate man, and within that world, which is within us, one should seek to live.&lt;ref&gt;Robert, Ross, Preface to ''De Profundis'', by Oscar Wilde. Methuen, London. 6 April 1912&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Kiberd, Wilde follows Christ's individualist theme of self-perfection into a testing new zone: prison. Wilde, who had always looked to test English society's hypocrisies, declined the opportunity to flee to France.&lt;ref&gt;Kiberd (2000:334)&lt;/ref&gt; Kiberd places Wilde within the long tradition of prison writing by Irish Republican prisoners; when Wilde wanted to criticise the penal system after release, he contacted [[Michael Davitt]], an Irish political reformer who had himself been imprisoned in England.&lt;ref name="kiberd335"&gt;Kiberd (2000:335)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
[[File:Robert Ross (1869-1918) nel 1911 in una foto di Elliott and Fry.JPG|thumb|right| Robert Ross in 1911. He was Wilde's literary executor and oversaw the publication of ''De Profundis''.]] 
On his release, Wilde unburdened himself of the manuscript by giving it to Robbie Ross, with the putative title ''Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis'' ("Letter: In Prison and in Chains"),&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3554465/How-De-Profundis-got-its-name.html "How De Profundis got its name"], Dexter, G.  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 15 June 2008. Retrieved 23 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross and Reggie Turner met the exiled Wilde on the ferry from England at Dieppe on 20 May 1897. The manuscript comprised eighty close-written pages on twenty folio sheets of thin blue prison paper. Ross was instructed to make two typed copies, one for Wilde himself, and to send the original to Lord Alfred. However, fearing that Douglas would destroy the original, Ross sent him a copy instead (Douglas said at the 1913 Ransome libel trial that he burnt the copy he was sent without reading it).{{sfn|Belford|2000|pp=278}} Due to its length, Ross could not have it fully typed until August.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:496)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Wilde's contemporary translator to German, Max Meyerfeld, published the first book edition with [[Samuel Fischer]] in Berlin which was preceded by a publication in Fischer's monthly magazine ''[[Neue Rundschau]]'' (Vol. 16, Nos. 1–2 [Jan.–Febr. 1905]). The book appeared on 11 February 1905 and hence preceded the English edition by Ross by about two weeks. Ross published the letter with the title "''De Profundis''", expurgating all references to the Queensberry family. This edition would go through eight printings in the next three years, including ''de luxe'' editions.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1976:454)&lt;/ref&gt; The title, meaning "from the depths", comes from [[Psalm 130]], "From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord". In 1924, when Lord Alfred served six months in prison for libel against [[Winston Churchill]], he wrote a sonnet sequence entitled ''In Excelsis'' ("from the heights"), intentionally mirroring Wilde's letter.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

A second, slightly expanded, version of ''De Profundis'' appeared in the edition of Collected Works of Wilde published by Ross between 1908 and 1922. Also included were three other letters Wilde wrote from Reading Prison and his two letters to the editor of the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' written after his release.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1976:453)&lt;/ref&gt; Ross then donated the manuscript to the [[British Museum]] on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. The manuscript is now in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Oscar Wilde.

Retrieved: 30 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 the unabridged text was read in court. In 1912 [[Arthur Ransome]] had published ''Oscar Wilde: a critical study''. Douglas sued Ransome for libel, and the case went to the High Court in April 1913. Ransome's counsel (Campbell) had the unabridged ''De Profundis'' read to the High Court. While the full text "was so inconsistent as to be quite unreliable as evidence of anything except Wilde's fluctuating state of mind while in prison .... the endless text, read out by Campbell's junior, bored the jury and further irritated the judge. They rebelled, and the reading was broken off; but the unalterable impression that it left in everybody’s mind was that Bosie was, in Labouchere's words, a young scoundrel and that he had ruined his great friend."{{sfn|Brogan|1988|p=87}} Douglas testified that he had received the letter from Ross, but after reading Ross's cover note threw it in the fire unread. He later said that he had never received the package at all.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:497)&lt;/ref&gt; Observers reported that Douglas could not bear it when he learned that the letter was addressed to him and heard its full contents. Once during the reading he simply disappeared, and was roundly rebuked by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:552)&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the text were published subsequently in the London papers.&lt;ref name="Mason 1976 456"&gt;Mason (1976:456)&lt;/ref&gt; Ross quickly brought out another edition: ''The Suppressed Portion of "De Profundis"'', to claim the copyright on Wilde's work. It contained about half of the complete text.&lt;ref name="Mason 1976 456" /&gt;

In 1949, Wilde's son [[Vyvyan Holland]] published the full text, but used a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Ross's typescripts had contained several hundred errors, including typist's mistakes, his own emendations, and other omissions.&lt;ref name="Holland/Hart-Davis 2000 683" /&gt;

In 1960, [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] examined the manuscript in the library of the British Museum, and produced a new, corrected text from it, which was published in ''[[The Letters of Oscar Wilde]]'' in 1962. He wrote that:

{{quote|In July Ruth and I had the excitement of being the first people to see the original manuscript of Oscar's longest, best, and most important letter ''De Profundis'', which had been given to the British Museum by Robbie Ross with a fifty-year ban on anyone's seeing it, so as to make sure Lord Alfred Douglas never saw it. To our delight, we found that the published versions were wildly inaccurate, so our version in ''The Letters'' was the first accurate text in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart-Davis |first=Rupert  |title=Halfway to Heaven: Concluding memoirs of a literary life  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear= First ed. published |year= 1998 |publisher=  Sutton |location= Stroud Gloucestershire |isbn= 0-7509-1837-3 |oclc=  |page= 57 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1962 Hart-Davis edition is currently still in print in the expanded version of the book titled [[The Letters of Oscar Wilde|''The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde'']], which was published in New York and London in 2000. The British Library (formerly British Museum) published a facsimile of the original manuscript in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Oscar.

In 2005, Oxford University Press published Volume 2 of ''The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde''. In this volume, entitled ''De Profundis; 'Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis''', editor Ian Small tried "to establish an authoritative (and perhaps definitive) text" of Wilde's prison letter. The volume also aimed to "present the complete textual history of one of the most famous love letters ever written".&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;[http://oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LiteratureEnglish/BritishLiterature/20thC/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5ODExOTYyMw==?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198119623#Description "The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde—Description"], [[Oxford University Press]], April 2005.

German academic Horst Schroeder has, however, compared the previously published typescripts of the ''De Profundis'' text to German-language translations that were published in the first quarter of the 20th century and were prepared by Max Meyerfeld from typescripts he had received from Robert Ross. Based on his findings, Schroeder argues that, due to the large amount of typing errors and unauthorised changes, no previously published typescript of the text (including the 1949 Holland edition) is suitable as a base text and that only the British Museum manuscript (i.e. the 1962 Hart-Davis edition) is "what really matters."&lt;ref name="Schroeder"&gt;[http://horst-schroeder.com/deprofundis.htm "The 'Definitive' Edition of Oscar Wilde's De Profundis"], Schroeder, H.

==Reception==

G. S. Street, who had earlier been an intellectual opponent of [[Decadent movement|the decadents]], had two impressions of ''De Profundis'': one, "that it was poignantly touching, the other it was extraordinarily and profoundly interesting".&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Street, ''The Outlook'' magazine, (4 March 1905) xv 294-5; Beckson (1970:252)&lt;/ref&gt; Street dismissed contemporary complaints that the letter lacked sincerity, saying this was just a manifestation of those who opposed Wilde's graceful writing style.&lt;ref&gt;Beckson (1970:253)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Beerbohm]], an old friend of Wilde's, wrote a signed review, "A Lord of Language," for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. He described the writing in ''De Profundis'' as having achieved the perfect grace of Wilde's earlier work, and said that Wilde had remained a detached artist of words, concluding: "We see him here as the spectator of his own tragedy. His tragedy was great. It is one of the tragedies that will always live on in romantic history."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Beerbohm]], "A Lord of Language", 2 March 1905 ''Vanity Fair'', cxxiii 349 Beckson (1970:251)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T.W.H. Crosland|T. W. H. Crosland]], a journalist and friend of Douglas after Wilde's death, negatively reviewed ''De Profundis'' in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Beckson (1970:322)&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly criticised Ross's editing, but claimed the entire document was even more [[morally bankrupt]] than the published version: "A blacker, fiercer, falser, craftier, more grovelling or more abominable piece of writing never fell from a mortal pen", he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Backson (1970:323)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic adaptations==

A version abridged by [[Merlin Holland]] was performed by [[Corin Redgrave]] in 2000 at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London. It was revived in 2008.&lt;ref name="nationaltheatre.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/deprofundis "De Profundis – Productions – National Theatre"]&lt;/ref&gt;

An abridged version was set for speaking pianist by composer [[Frederic Rzewski]].

Extracts were set to music for chorus and orchestra in 2012 by the British composer [[Matthew King (composer)|Matthew King]].

{{Population transfer}}
'''Deportations of the Ingrian Finns''' were a series of mass deportations of the [[Ingrian Finnish]] population by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. Deportations took place from the late 1920s to the end of World War II.

==Background==
Lutheran Finns had lived in [[Ingria]] for over 400 years, since the period of [[Swedish Ingria|Swedish rule]]. They had immigrated there from [[Finland]] and the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and eventually started referring to themselves as Ingrian Finns.&lt;ref name="Taagepera1"&gt;[[#Taagepera2013|Taagepera (2013)]], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adler1"&gt;[[#Adler2011|Adler, Leydesdorff, Chamberlain, and Neyzi (2011)]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the population of the Ingrian Finns was 132,000 in Ingria and an additional 10,000 in [[Petrograd]]. The [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Finnish-Soviet peace treaty]] of 1920 had granted Ingrian Finns a degree of national autonomy. A national district was formed in 1928 and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] was used in schools, radio and administration.&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"&gt;[[#Taagepera2013|Taagepera (2013)]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deportations==
Soviet repression of the Ingrian Finns started at the same time as the forced [[collectivization in the Soviet Union]] in 1928. Between 1929 and 1931 Soviet authorities deported 18,000 people from areas near the Finnish border, consisting of up to 16% of the total Ingrian Finnic population. All remaining Finns in four border parishes were deported in 1936 and replaced with [[Russians]]. In 1937 all Finnish-language schools, publications, broadcasts, and Ingrian Lutheran churches were closed down.&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"/&gt; During 1937&amp;ndash;1938, 4,000 Ingrian Finns were shot and over 10,000 deported to prison camps.&lt;ref name="Adler2"&gt;[[#Adler2011|Adler, Leydesdorff, Chamberlain, and Neyzi (2011)]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 the Ingrian Finnish population had decreased to about 50,000, which was about 43% of 1928 population figures,&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"/&gt; and the Ingrian Finn national district was abolished.&lt;ref name="Taagepera1"/&gt;

Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] and the beginning of the [[Leningrad Blockade]], in early 1942 all 20,000 Ingrian Finns remaining in Soviet-controlled territory were deported to [[Siberia]]. Most of the Ingrian Finns together with [[Votes]] and [[Izhorians]] living in German-occupied territory were evacuated to Finland in 1943-1944. After Finland [[Moscow Armistice|sued for peace]], it was forced to return the evacuees.&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"/&gt; Soviet authorities did not allow the 55,733 people who had been handed over to settle back in Ingria, and instead deported them to central regions of Russia.&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;[[#Scott2013|Scott and Liikanen (2013)]], pp. 59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The main regions of Ingrian Finns forced settlement were the interior areas of Siberia, [[Central Russia]], and [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref name="Evmenov"&gt;[[#Evmenov2010|Evmenov and Muslimov (2010)]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The deportations led to the rapid ethnic assimilation of Ingrian Finns. After 1956, return to Ingria was officially allowed but made unfeasible in practice; as a result, many settled in the nearby regions of [[Estonia]] and [[Karelia]]. In 1989 there were 18,000 Finns in Ingria and Leningrad, and a total of 67,813 in the Soviet Union, with only 34.7 percent declaring Finnish as their main language. Ingrian and other Finns were not differentiated in the [[Soviet Census|official census]]. With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], attempts began to revive Ingrian Finnish cultural life in Ingria, but at the same time, many of them moved to Finland.&lt;ref name="Taagepera2"/&gt;

== History ==
The call was suspended briefly between 19 May 1018 and 9 May 1019 CE during the [[apostasy]] of [[ad-Darazi]] and again between 1021 and 1026 CE during a period of persecution by [[Ali az-Zahir]] for those who had sworn the [[oath]] to accept the call.&lt;ref name="Makārim1974"/&gt; Persecutions started forty days after the disappearance into [[Ghaybah|occultation]] of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]], who was thought to have been converting people to a [[Muwahhidun|Unitarian]] faith for over twenty years prior.&lt;ref name="Makārim1974"/&gt; Al-Hakim convinced some heretical followers such as [[Ad-Darazi]] of his [[soteriological]] [[divinity]] and officially declared the Divine call after issuing a decree promoting religious freedom.&lt;ref name="Makārim1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daftary1992"/&gt;{{quote |Remove ye the causes of fear and estrangement from yourselves.  Do away with the corruption of delusion and conformity.

He hath done thus so that when you relinquish your previous beliefs and doctrines ye shall not indeed lean on such causes of impediments and pretensions.  By conveying to you the reality of his intention, the [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Prince of Believers]] hath spared you any excuse for doing so.  He hath urged you to declare your belief openly.  Ye are now safe from any hand which may bring harm unto you.  Ye now may find rest in his assurance ye shall not be wronged.

'''Dragon dance''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|舞|龙}}|t={{linktext|舞|龍}}|p=wǔ lóng}}) is a form of traditional [[dance]] and performance in [[China|Chinese]] [[culture of China|culture]].  Like the [[lion dance]] it is most often seen in festive celebrations.  The dance is performed by a team of experienced dancers who manipulate a long flexible figure of a dragon using poles positioned at regular intervals along the length of the dragon.  The dance team simulates the imagined movements of this river spirit in a sinuous, undulating manner.

The dragon dance is often performed during [[Chinese New Year]].  [[Chinese dragon]]s are a symbol of China's culture, and they are believed to bring good luck to people, therefore the longer the dragon in the dance, the more luck it will bring to the community.&lt;ref name=cultural&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/96Arts8434.html |title= Dragon Dance |work= Cultural China |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140612020903/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/96Arts8434.html |archivedate= 2014-06-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dragons are believed to possess qualities that include great power, dignity, fertility, wisdom and auspiciousness. The appearance of a dragon is both fearsome and bold but it has a benevolent disposition, and it was an emblem to represent imperial authority. The movements in a performance traditionally symbolize historical roles of dragons demonstrating power and dignity.

==History==
[[File:Dragon Dance Han Dynasty stone relief.jpg|thumb|250px|Han Dynasty stone relief engraving showing a form of Dragon Dance.]]
During the [[Han Dynasty]], different forms of the dragon dance were described in ancient texts.  Rain dance performed at times of drought may involve the use of figures of dragon as [[Chinese dragon]] was associated with rain in ancient China, for example the dragon [[Yinglong]] was considered a rain deity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology |author= Lihui Yang, Deming An |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=104 |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0195332636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shenlong]] had the power to determine how much wind and rain to bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7DIIc-gg0vMC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Chinese Mythology A to Z: [A Young Reader's Companion] |author= Jeremy Roberts |page=31 |publisher=Facts on File |year=2004 |isbn=9780816048700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Han Dynasty text ''[[Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' by [[Dong Zhongshu]], as part of a ritual to appeal for rain, clay figures of the dragons were made and children or adults may then perform a dance.  The number of dragons, their length and colour, as well as the performers may vary according to the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology |author= Lihui Yang, Deming An |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=107–108 |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0195332636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/chun-qiu-fan-lu/qiu-yu/ |title=《求雨》|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other dances involving dragons may be found in a popular form of entertainment during the Han Dynasty, the ''baixi'' (百戲) [[Chinese variety art|variety shows]], where performers called "mime people" (象人) dressed up as various creatures such as beasts, fish and dragons. In his ''Lyric Essay on Western Capital'' (西京賦) [[Zhang Heng]] recorded various performances such as performers who dressed as a green dragon playing a flute, and a fish-dragon act where fish transformed into a dragon.&lt;ref name="baixi"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |page=104 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CiQegTh99-wC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Theories of Theater and Performance from Confucius to the Present |pages=24–25 |editor= Faye Chunfang Fei |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2002 |isbn= 978-0472089239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%AC%E8%B3%A6 |title=西京賦 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the fish-dragon dance called "fish-dragon extending" (魚龍曼延) was also performed at the Han court to entertain foreign guests – in this dance a mythical beast of Shenli (舍利之獸) transforms into flounder, then to a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3wsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT216&amp;lpg=PT216#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=中国文化博览1 |author= 陈晓丹 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient dances however do not resemble modern Dragon Dance in their descriptions, and depictions of dragon dance in Han Dynasty stone relief engravings suggest that the props used may also be cumbersome, unlike modern Dragon Dance where light-weight dragons are manipulated by performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |pages=25–27 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Chinese dragon, Seattle, c. 1909.jpg|thumb|250px|Parade of a Chinese dragon in Seattle, c. 1909]]

The dragon acts of the Han Dynasty were also mentioned in the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty]].  Figures similar to the dragon lantern (龍燈) used during [[Lantern Festival]] were described in the Song Dynasty work ''[[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu|Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital]]'', where figures of dragon mounted for display were constructed out of grass and cloth and inside which numerous candle lights may be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rrsJDdMsFRQC&amp;pg=PA688&amp;lpg=PA688&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=宋代文化史 |page=688|isbn=9579086826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%A2%E8%8F%AF%E9%8C%84/%E5%8D%B7%E5%85%AD |title=東京夢華錄/卷六 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dragon lanterns may also be carried and paraded by performers in the street during the Lantern festival at nighttime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology |author= Lihui Yang, Deming An |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=109 |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0195332636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of dragon dances have developed in various regions in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinesecio.com/cms/en/culture/dragon-dance-long-wu |title=Dragon Dance |work=Confucius Institute Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[Fenghua District|Fenghua]] Cloth Dragon (奉化布龙) from [[Zhejiang]] was made with bamboo frame and covered with cloth, and is said to have been developed in the 1200s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DMGpDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of World Folk Dance |author= Mary Ellen Snodgrass |pages=80&amp;ndash;81 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |date=8 August 2016|isbn=9781442257498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ningbo.gov.cn/art/2009/7/23/art_474_84305.html |title= Fenghua Cloth Dragon |date=2009-07-23 |work=Ningbo.China}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of dragon dance from [[Tongliang]] County (铜梁龙舞), which originated as snake totem worship, began during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and became popular in the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M-O9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Intellectual Property Protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions: Folklore in China |author= Luo Li |page=141 |publisher=Springer |year= 2014 |isbn= 978-3319045245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, the government of [[People's Republic of China]] adapted and promoted various traditional folk dances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |page=103 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to the popularity of the current form of the dragon dance now found widely in China as well as Chinese communities around the world.

Aside from the popular form of dragon dance, other regional dragon dances include one from [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] province whereby the body of the dragon is formed entirely of a human chain of dozens to hundreds of performers, and in [[Pujiang County, Zhejiang|Pujiang County]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, the body of the dragon is formed using wooden stools.&lt;ref name=cultural /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://china-zhanjiang.com/leisure/suite_article.php?ch_id=59 |title= A brief history of Zhanjiang Dragon’s Dance |work=The Zhanjiang Travel &amp; Tourism Portal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of different dragon dances has been put at over 700.&lt;ref name=asian&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8tCYjXOtkdgC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Dance |author=Janet Descutner |page=100 |publisher= Chelsea House Publishing |isbn=978-1604134780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dragon structure==

[[File:SunLoong.jpg|thumb|The head of [[Sun Loong]] in [[Bendigo]], [[Australia]].]]
The dragon is a long serpentine body formed of a number of sections on poles, with a dragon head and a tail.  The dragon is assembled by joining the series of hoops on each section and attaching the ornamental head and tail pieces at the ends. Traditionally, dragons were constructed of wood, with bamboo hoops on the inside and covered with a rich fabric, however in the modern era lighter materials such as aluminium and plastics have replaced the wood and heavy material.

Dragons can range in length from as little as {{convert|2|m|ft|-1}} operated by two people for small displays, around {{convert|25|to|35|m|ft|-1}} for the more acrobatic models, and up to {{convert|50|to|70|m|ft|-1}} for the larger parade and ceremonial styles. The size and length of a dragon depends on the human power available, financial power, materials, skills and size of the field. A small organization cannot afford to run a very long dragon because it requires considerable human power, great expenses and special skills which are difficult to manage.

[[File:2010-10-09 南瑤宮 彰化縣中正國小舞龍隊.jpg|thumb|Performers holding the dragons on poles in Taiwan]]
The normal length and size of the body recommended for the dragon is {{convert|34|m|ft|-1}} and is divided into 9 major sections.  The distance of each minor (rib-like) section is {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} apart; therefore, the body has 81 rings. Many may also be up to 15 sections long, and some dragons are as long as 46 sections.  Occasionally dragon with far more sections may be constructed in Chinese communities around the world to produce longest dragon possible, since part of the myth of the dragon is that the longer the creature, the more luck it will bring. [[Sun Loong]] in [[Bendigo]], [[Australia]] was, at the time it was made in 1970, the longest dragon in the world measuring approximately {{convert|100|m|ft|-1}} and is believed to be the longest regularly used dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bendigochinese.org.au/about/dragons.html |title=BCA - Our Dragon Collection |publisher=Bendigochinese.org.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232036/http://www.bendigochinese.org.au/about/dragons.html |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Murray |url=http://www.kitezh.com/texts/bendigo.htm |title=Bendigo's Year of the Dragon |publisher=Kitezh.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worthington |first=Brett |url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/73567/dragon-has-lived-a-long-life/ |title=Dragon has lived a long life |publisher=Bendigo Advertiser |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much longer dragons have been created for one-off events. The [[world record]] for the longest dragon is {{convert|5605|m|ft|-1}}, set in [[Hong Kong]] on 1 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-traditional-chinese-dragon|title=Longest traditional Chinese dragon|publisher=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically the dragon dance may be performed in a variety of ways with different types and colors of dragon. Green is sometimes selected as a main color of the dragon, which symbolizes a great harvest. Other colors include: yellow symbolizing the solemn empire, golden or silver colors symbolizing prosperity, red color representing excitement while its scales and tail are mostly beautiful silver colors and glittering at all times which provides a feeling of joyous atmosphere. As the Dragon dance is not performed every day, the cloth of the dragon is to be removed and to have a new touch of ultra-paint before the next performance.

==Performance==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Dança do dragão.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Chinese Youth Society of [[Melbourne]] performing for Chinese New Year, at [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]], demonstrate a basic "corkscrew" routine]]

The dragon dance is performed by a skilled team whose job is to bring the motionless body to life.  The correct combination and proper timing of the different parts of the dragon are very important to make a successful dance. Any mistakes made by even some of the performers would spoil the whole performance. To be very successful in the dance, the head of the Dragon must be able to coordinate with the body movement to match the timing of the drum. For larger ceremonial and parade style dragons, the head can weigh as much as 12 [[catty|katis]] (14.4&amp;nbsp;kg, almost 32&amp;nbsp;lb). The dragon tail also has an important role to play as it will have to keep in time with head movements. The  fifth section is considered to be the middle portion and the performers must be very alert as the body movements change from time to time.  The dragon is often led by a person holding a spherical object representing a pearl.
[[File:Fire Dragon dance.jpg|thumb|left|Fire dragon dance]]

The patterns of the dragon dance are choreographed according to the skills and experiences acquired by the performers. Some of the patterns of the dragon dance are "Cloud Cave", "Whirlpool", [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] pattern, "threading the money", "looking for pearl"&lt;!-- "dragon vomiting the pearl" this one seems like it might be a mistranslation --&gt;, and "dragon encircling the pillar". The movement "dragon chasing the pearl" shows that the dragon is continually in the pursuit of wisdom.

The dragon moves in a wave-like pattern achieved by the co-ordinated swinging of each section in succession. Whilst this swinging constitutes the basic movement of the dragon, executing more complex formations is only limited by a team’s creativity. The patterns and tricks that are performed generally involve running into spiralled formations to make the dragon body turn and twist on itself. This causes performers to jump over or through the dragon’s body sections, adding to the visual display. Other advanced manoeuvres include various corkscrew-like rotating tricks and more acrobatic moves where the performers stand on each other's legs and shoulders to increase the height of the dragon’s movements.

[[File:DragonDance.jpg|thumb|right|A double dragon dance at [[Chongqing]], China in September 2002 during a week-long celebration of [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|China's National Day]]]]
Performing in a dragon dance team incorporates several elements and skills; it is something of a cross-over activity, combining the training and mentality of a sports team with the stagecraft and flair of a performing arts troupe. The basic skills are simple to learn, however to become a competent performer takes dedicated training until movements become second nature and complex formations can be achieved – which rely not only on the skill of the individual member, but on concentration by the team as a whole to move in co-operation.

A double dragon dance, rarely seen in Western exhibitions, involves two troupes of dancers intertwining the dragons. Even rarer are dances with the full array of nine dragons, since nine is a "perfect" number. Such dances involve large number of participants from various organizations, and are often only possible under the auspices of a regional or national government.

===Competition===
A number of dragon dance competitions have been organized around the world.  In competition performances however, there are strict rules governing the specifications of the dragon body and the routine performed, and so dragons made for these events and what are mostly seen in the impressive stage shows are made for speed and agility, to be used by the performing team for maximum trick difficulty. In these dragons, the head is smaller and light enough to be whipped around, and must be a minimum of 3&amp;nbsp;kg, the body pieces are a light aluminium with cane and the majority of the hoops will be very thin PVC tubing. Performances are typically 8- to 10-minute routines with an accompanying percussion set.

In more recent times, luminous dragons whereby the dragons are painted with [[luminous paint]]s that fluoresce under [[black light]] are also used in competition.

==Outside China==
[[File:Senso-ji Kinryu-no-mai 02.jpg|thumb|Golden Dragon Dance of Sensō-ji]]
Unlike the [[lion dance]] in many Asian countries where there are numerous native versions of the dance, the dragon dance is found in other countries primarily among overseas Chinese communities. In Japan, the dragon dance (龍踊, ''Ja Odori'' &amp;ndash; also referred to as "Snake Dance" 蛇踊)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://himahima1.cocolog-nifty.com/in/2014/11/post-a541.html |title=蛇踊？龍踊？竜踊？ その１ |date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the main attractions in the [[Nagasaki Kunchi]] festival.  The dance was originally performed by Chinese residents who settled in [[Nagasaki]], the only port said to be open for foreign trade in Japan during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/calendar/october/kunchi.html |title=Nagasaki Kunchi |work=Kids Web Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.gaijinpot.com/festivals-of-japan-nagasaki-kunchi-festival/ |title=Festivals of Japan: Nagasaki Kunchi Festival |work= GaijinPot |author=John Asano }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dragon dance has also been adapted for other local festivities by the Japanese – a golden dragon dance (金龍の舞, ''Kinryū no Mai'') has been performed at the [[Sensō-ji]] in Tokyo since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotokyo.org/en/kanko/taito/event/kinryuunomai.html |title=Kinryu no mai (golden dragon dance) |work=Go Tokyo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ambassadors-japan.com/en/tokyodailylife/397/ |title=Kinryu no Mai (Golden Dragon Dance) |work=Ambassadors Japan |date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is however a form that is unique to Japan  – the ''[[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]]'' (a great serpent or [[Japanese dragon]]) which may be found in a ''[[kagura]]'' performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rikisha.jp/japan/iwami-kagura-a-traditional-autumn-festival/ |title=“Iwami Kagura,” a Traditional Autumn Festival in Shimane |work=Rikisha Amazing Asia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, the dragon dance may be performed during [[Tết]], the Vietnamese New Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dragonsinn.net/vietnam.htm |title=Vietnamese Dragons |work=DragonsInn,net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]'s poem "The Great Chinese Dragon", published in his 1961 anthology ''[[Starting from San Francisco]]'' was inspired by the dragon dance.
Gregory Stephenson says the dragon "... represents 'the force and mystery of life,' the true sight that 'sees the spiritual everywhere translucent in the material world'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' contains rules concerning the arbitration and administration of a game, and is intended for use primarily or only by the game's [[Dungeon Master]].&lt;ref name="WD16"/&gt; The original ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was published in 1979,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=2008-10-04| deadurl=yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Dungeon Masters everything they needed to run a ''D&amp;D'' game campaign.&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"/&gt;

It is intended as a companion book to the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', which contains all of the basic rules of gameplay, and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'', which is a reference book giving [[statistics]] and characteristics to various [[animal]]s and [[monster]]s. The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''[[Monster Manual]]'' are collectively referred to as the "core rules" of the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Livingstone |first =Ian |authorlink= |coauthors= |title =White Dwarf Interviews Gary Gygax |format=interview |journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] |volume= |issue=14 |pages =23–24 |publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=August–September 1979 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Pulsipher |first =Lewis |authorlink= |coauthors= |title =An Introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Part II |format=overview |journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] |volume= |issue=24 |pages =10–11 |publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=April–May 1981 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all players, including the Dungeon Master, are expected to have at their disposal a copy of the ''Player's Handbook'', only the Dungeon Master is expected to refer to the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' or ''Monster Manual'' during gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Pulsipher |first =Lewis |authorlink= |coauthors= |title =An Introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons |format=overview |journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] |volume= |issue=23 |pages =8–9 |publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=February–March 1981 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
The original AD&amp;D ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' (sic) was written by [[Gary Gygax]], and published by [[TSR (company)|TSR]] in 1979 as a 232-page hardcover with a cover by [[David C. Sutherland III]].&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 printing featured a new cover by [[Jeff Easley]].&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

Like other volumes of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' handbooks, the ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' has gone through several versions through the years. The original edition was written by [[Gary Gygax]] and edited by [[Mike Carr (game designer)|Mike Carr]], who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by [[David C. Sutherland III]], and interior illustrations were provided by Sutherland, [[David A. Trampier|D. A. Trampier]], [[Darlene Pekul]], Will McLean, [[David S. LaForce]], and [[Erol Otus]].

The first edition ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' covered all the essential rules for the [[Dungeon Master]]: creating and maintaining [[player character]]s and managing [[non-player character]]s, handling combat, and running adventures and multi-session campaigns.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book also included descriptions of [[Magic item (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic items]] and treasure, random monster encounters, and statistics for the basic monsters and creatures of the game.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; New magic items were introduced, including the [[Apparatus of Kwalish]].

The ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters.

One supplement to the ''Guide'' was the ''[[Dungeon Master's Screen]]'': two heavy-duty tri-fold boards with the most frequently used tables printed on them for easy reference. The 1979 second edition of the screen describes its purpose as "useful for shielding maps and other game materials from the players when placed upright, and also provide[s] instant reference to the charts and tables most commonly used during play." The ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' Second Edition screen came packaged with a brief [[adventure (role-playing games)|adventure]]; later editions of that screen, and screens produced for later editions, have instead included [[character sheet]]s and general reference [[book]]lets.

A feature of the first edition ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of [[dice]], to generate a dungeon adventure "on the fly". A dungeon complete with [[passage (architecture)|passageways]], [[room (architecture)|rooms]], [[treasure]], monsters, and other [[Random encounter|encounters]] could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player. The generator was not included in subsequent editions of the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' but made a re-appearance in the fifth edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide''.

The original ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' was reviewed by [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]] in issue #16 of the magazine ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' (December 1979/January 1980). Turnbull commented mostly on the size of the book, "I would say that only the most severe critic could point at a minor omission, let alone a serious one."&lt;ref name="WD16"&gt;{{cite journal |last =Turnbull |first =Don |authorlink= |coauthors= |title =Open Box |type=review |journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] |volume= |issue=16 |pages =15 |publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=December 1979 – January 1980 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AD&amp;D 2nd Edition ''Dungeon Master Guide'' was released in 1989.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This 192-page hardcover book was designed by [[David Cook (game designer)|David "Zeb" Cook]], with cover art by [[Jeff Easley]].&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book featured interior illustrations by Easley, [[Clyde Caldwell]], [[John and Laura Lakey]], [[Dave Dorman|David Dorman]], [[Douglas Chaffee]], and Jean E. Martin.

This ''Dungeon Master Guide'' featured revised second edition rules for the Dungeon Master, totally reorganized and streamlined.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book detailed options for character creation, handling [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]], new money and equipment rules, treasure and magical items, encounters, time and movement, and handling non-player characters.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book is indexed, and contains many full-page color illustrations.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

The second edition ''Dungeon Master Guide'' is an ORIGINS and Gamer's Choice award-winner.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; In his 1991 book ''Heroic Worlds'', [[Lawrence Schick]] commented that this book contained "lots of excellent new advice on how to run ''AD&amp;D''".&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; A new version of the ''Dungeon Master Guide'', with new art and layout but the same text, was released in 1995, as part of TSR's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The 3rd edition D&amp;D ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was published in 2000.

[[Monte Cook]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Skip Williams]] all contributed to the 3rd edition ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''[[Monster Manual]]'', and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.&lt;ref name="Dragon #275"&gt;{{cite journal| last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Profiles: Monte Cook| journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue=#275| pages=10, 12, 14| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| location=[[Renton, Washington]]|date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook is credited with the book's design. Cover art is by [[Henry Higginbotham]], with interior art by [[Lars Grant-West]], [[Scott Fischer (artist)|Scott Fischer]], [[Jon Foster (artist)|John Foster]], [[Todd Lockwood]], [[David L. Martin|David Martin]], [[Arnie Swekel]], [[Kev Walker|Kevin Walker]], [[Sam Wood (artist)|Sam Wood]], and [[Wayne Reynolds]].

In 2003, the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was revised for the 3.5 edition. [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] are credited for the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' 3.5 revision. Cover art is by [[Henry Higginbotham]], with interior art by [[Matt Cavotta]], [[Ed Cox (artist)|Ed Cox]], [[Lars Grant-West]], [[Scott Fischer (artist)|Scott Fischer]], [[Jon Foster (artist)|John Foster]], [[Jeremy Jarvis]], [[John and Laura Lakey]], [[Todd Lockwood]], [[David L. Martin|David Martin]], [[Raven Mimura]], [[Wayne Reynolds]], [[Scott Roller]], [[Brian Snoddy]], [[Arnie Swekel]], and [[Sam Wood (artist)|Sam Wood]].

When asked about the changes from the previous ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', Rich Redman said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20030704a| title=Product Spotlight: D&amp;D 3.5 |date=July 4, 2003| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 11, 2013| last=Ryan| first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|I think the most immediate, obvious, and dramatic change is the reorganization. When the 3rd Edition books came out, the adventure game was supposed to teach you about ''D&amp;D'' (including both playing and DMing) and the adventure path modules were supposed to help you learn more about DMing. That meant that the ''DMG'' could be, more or less, a catalogue or encyclopedia of rules information, a reference book for DMs. With the demise of the adventure game (which had stopped printing long before we started on 3.5), we needed to focus the 3.5 books much more on introducing the game to players. That meant reorganizing the ''DMG'' in particular. Several years of published books that referred to pages and chapters in the ''DMG'' meant we could only reorganize so much, but the copies I've seen stayed pretty close to the way I reorganized it.}}

The D&amp;D ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' (v.3.5) was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/02440000 |title=3.5 Edition Premium Dungeon Master's Guide |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th edition D&amp;D ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was released on June 6, 2008, at the same time as its companion volumes. It is a 224-page hardcover written by [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. The front cover illustration was by [[Wayne Reynolds]] and the back cover illustration is by [[Brian Hagan]], with interior illustrations by [[Rob Alexander]], [[Steve Argyle]], [[Wayne England]], [[Jason Engle]], [[David Griffith (artist)|David Griffith]], [[Espen Grundetjern]], Brian Hagan, [[Ralph Horsley]], [[Howard Lyon]], [[Lee Moyer]], [[William O'Connor (artist)|William O'Connor]], Wayne Reynolds, [[Dan Scott (artist)|Dan Scott]], [[Ron Spears (artist)|Ron Spears]], [[Chris Stevens (artist)|Chris Stevens]], [[Anne Stokes]], and [[Eva Widermann]]. In addition to a comprehensive look at how to DM a 4th Edition campaign or adventure, it contains information on building encounters, aquatic and mounted combat, skill challenges, traps and hazards, rewards, NPC creation, artifacts, monster creation, and template, along with a sample town and short adventure so that DMs can start running their first 4th Edition adventure right away. Although it does contain artifacts, it is the first ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' not to contain standard magic items, which were moved into the ''Player's Handbook'' for 4th Edition. In addition, a ''Dungeon Master's Guide 2'' was released.

As part of the ''Essentials'' line of products, which were intended as an easy entry point for new players, Wizards of the Coast released a ''Dungeon Master's Kit'' that included a digest-sized book for the Dungeon Master containing much of the same material as the 4th edition ''DMG'' along with a two-part adventure module and a set of cardboard tokens for monsters.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 5th edition==
The 5th edition D&amp;D ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was released in 2014.

Chuck Francisco of mania.com comments: "Miles of treasure tables escort a wealth of random adventure tables to the ball, where they're resplendent in all of their easy session crafting majesty. The versatility of this tome is nowhere more obvious than amongst the flavor filled side panels, which further detail the lower magical level of the main setting, before explaining all of the variable options a DM has in bringing to life a world of their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mania.com/dungeons-dragons-dungeon-masters-guide-review_article_141111.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316020109/http://www.mania.com/dungeons-dragons-dungeon-masters-guide-review_article_141111.html|archivedate=March 16, 2015|date=January 5, 2015|title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | align = left| width = 33% | quote =[Doeringer] has come under some opposition for his stance on [copying pictures] and has received more than one cease-and-desist order from galleries and artists, but has also received praise for his activities with purchases from a few of the artists he appropriated.

Eric Doeringer's "Bootlegs" are small copies of work by eminent contemporary artists including [[Richard Prince]] and [[Lisa Yuskavage]]. Doeringer reproduces the artworks using "collage, digital photography, paint and varnish".&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{cite news |title=Slimmed-down Art Chicago shines in 'fair wars'  |author=Hawkins, Margaret |url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-art03.html |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2005-05-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031171554/http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-art03.html |archivedate=2005-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doeringer can make between six and fifteen paintings each day and told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a 2005 interview that his process is "like an assembly line".&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Little Artist Versus Big Dealer in Sidewalk Showdown |author=Kennedy, Randy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/arts/design/12stre.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2005-11-12 |accessdate=2011-01-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vng1PsjD?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/arts/design/12stre.html?_r%3D1 |archivedate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturdays beginning in 2001, he set up a vending table in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] on West 24th Street. Small canvases reproducing contemporary paintings lined the table. Paintings by the original artists (sold within a short walking distance from Doeringer's stand) cost tens of thousands of dollars, while Doeringer's copies sold for less than $100. His total profit in a day of selling paintings has sometimes reached $1500.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' stated that Doeringer is "famous for bootlegging art on the streets of New York".&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite news|title=In a word |author=Lopez, Ruth |url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/art-design/18037/in-a-word |newspaper=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |location=Chicago |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2011-01-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vng4noY7?url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/art-design/18037/in-a-word |archivedate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Doeringer, the majority of the artists he copies do not mind, while others have sent him [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letters. [[Richard Prince]] was a "fan" of his work, while [[Takashi Murakami]] put a stop to his copies.&lt;ref name="Egan"/&gt; Doeringer states that his work is [[fair use]] because he "culled the pictures from the public domain of the Internet".&lt;ref name="Schira"&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Commentary: At the Freedman, the nature of originality |author=Schira, Ron |url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=87980 |newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]] |date=2008-04-13 |accessdate=2011-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923173318/http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=87980 |archivedate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chelsea art dealer Mike Weiss called the police to remove Doeringer's Bootleg stand from 24th Street. Weiss told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "he did so for reasons that might be condemned in the art world but that made perfect sense for any businessman like himself who has to pay a huge rent" and claimed Doeringer was "an opportunist and that he just wants his 15 minutes".&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;

In 2007, Doeringer sold his wares in the Geisai Art Fair in Miami. For the fair, he crafted 42-cent stamps decorated with pictures of celebrities. The stamps, which cost $1, were legally usable as postage and were decorated with photographs of eminent people in the art world.&lt;ref name="Peers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Basel Miami: Where's All the Cheap Stuff? |author=Peers, Alexandra |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/art_basel_miami_wheres_all.html |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2011-01-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vng9uEur?url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/art_basel_miami_wheres_all.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over his booth, Doeringer placed orange and neon signs that proclaimed "Best Art Deals in Miami" and "Nothing Over $250!" ''[[The New York Sun]]'' deemed his decorations "a pitch-perfect metamockery of the art fair's commercialism".&lt;ref name="Orden"&gt;{{cite news |title=Art Basel Beyond The Box |author=Orden, Erica |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/art-basel-beyond-the-box/67776/ |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=2007-12-10 |accessdate=2011-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Doeringer began making larger, more faithful recreations of works of [[Conceptual art]] by artists like [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]], and [[On Kawara]]. [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine called a 2009 exhibition of Doeringer's ''Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings'' "perfectly executed" and "a genuine aesthetic experience, not just a knowing scold."&lt;ref name="Saltz"&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Kind of Boom |author=Saltz, Jerry |url=http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/59651/ |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2009-10-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031171554/http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-art03.html |archivedate=2005-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Doeringer exhibited his work at Another Year in L.A.; he titled his exhibition "Eastern Standard Time". In one piece, Doeringer copied [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]]'s 1973 [[avant-garde]] photograph panorama ''All My Clothes''. Titled ''All My Clothes (After Charles Ray)'', Doeringer's photographs each contain himself standing in front of a white background attired in various clothes. In an interview with the ''[[LA Weekly]]'', he said he adapted Ray's general ideas for the artwork, adding that the key distinction between their works is the "East Coast-West Coast divide". Whereas Ray's figure is garbed in a single winter outfit, Doeringer's wears much toastier clothing. Other pieces Doeringer copied and showcased at the Los Angeles exhibition were [[John Baldessari]]'s ''Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line'', [[On Kawara]]'s ''I Went'', [[Richard Prince]]'s ''Cowboy'' photographs, and several of [[Edward Ruscha]]'s books.&lt;ref name="Duvernoy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eric Doeringer's Eastern Standard Time: Best Rip-Off of Pacific Standard Time |author=Duvernoy, Sophie |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/11/eric_doeringer_pst_copies.php |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2011-11-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63O87pyo6?url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/11/eric_doeringer_pst_copies.php |archivedate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Ken Johnson (art critic)|Ken Johnson]] reviewed Doeringer's solo exhibition at the Mulherin + Pollard gallery titled "The Rematerialization of the Art Object". In the front room, Doeringer displayed "well-made simulations" of [[Damien Hirst]]'s spot paintings and [[Richard Prince]]'s [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cowboy advertisements. In the back room, Doeringer presented imitations of three artists: [[Edward Ruscha]] (counterfeit books), [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]] (16 photographs of himself wearing various clothes in imitation of Ray's ''All My Clothes''), and [[Andy Warhol]] (a film mimicking Warhol's ''Empire'' by recording the [[Empire State Building]]). Johnson wrote that Doeringer's "distinction is his focus not on canonical works of Modernism but on famous Conceptualist pieces that are themselves art about art".&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Johnson (art critic) |date=2012-11-02 |title=Eric Doeringer: 'The Rematerialization of the Art Object' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/arts/design/eric-doeringer-the-rematerialization-of-the-art-object.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2013-12-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M2MJjF2K?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/arts/design/eric-doeringer-the-rematerialization-of-the-art-object.html?_r%3D0 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ''[[Toronto Star]]''{{'}}s Murray Whyte reviewed Doeringer's ''Survey'', "a series of his exacting knock-offs of the late 20th century's greatest art hits". In addition to containing imitations of works by Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, and Andy Warhol, the exhibition also contained imitations of [[Sol LeWitt]]'s wall drawings and [[Lawrence Weiner]]'s spray paintings. Art critic Murray Whyte wrote that Doeringer is "less heretic than prophet, putting the towering genius of a previous generation to its own test".&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;{{cite news|last=Whyte |first=Murray |date=2013-07-20 |title=Eric Doeringer: The Rip-Off Artist |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2013/07/20/eric_doeringer_the_ripoff_artist.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2013-12-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M2OPy49S?url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2013/07/20/eric_doeringer_the_ripoff_artist.html |archivedate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art in Odd Places project==
During the 2008 [[Art in Odd Places]], Doeringer's project "Free Books" involved planting cardboard boxes of free books in four different locations. He removed the final pages of each book to deny the readers from discovering the ending.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news|title=Endpaper: Eric Doeringer's free books |author=Clark, Alex |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3561953/Endpaper-Eric-Doeringers-free-books.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnheqWut?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3561953/Endpaper-Eric-Doeringers-free-books.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' speculated about the broader meaning behind his removal of the final pages:

{{quote|It might be a plea to consider a novel's merits as separate from that final flourish, that moment of closure. It might even be an arch challenge to the reader - the artist asking us how many of us actually get to the end of the books we stockpile so smugly? These seem reasonable questions and ones that would not be so powerfully posed in prose.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;}}

Doeringer later wrote on his website that he appended his name to the "front of each book, as a type of signature", and altered the books to make them into "works of art". He noted that a reader could become annoyed his alterations instead of realizing their artistic worth.&lt;ref name="FreeBooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdoeringer.com/FreeBooks.html |title=Free Books |author=Doeringer, Eric |accessdate=2011-01-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w6wQPnUW?url=http://www.ericdoeringer.com/FreeBooks.html |archivedate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School of Visual Arts==
Doeringer lectures at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in [[Manhattan]]. He said in a November 2011 interview with the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' that enraged people from the audience have accosted him for creating bootleg copies of artists' works.&lt;ref name="Duvernoy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1406">'''Fasolt''', '''Fasold''' or '''Vasolt''' is a [[giant]] who appears in the following works:

*The [[Middle High German]] heroic poem ''[[Das Eckenlied]]'' (c. 1230).

*The [[Old Norse]] compendium of German legends known as the ''[[Thidrekssaga]]'' (c. 1250).

*[[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (1869).

The name ''Fasolt'' likely derives from a root similar to [[Old High German]] ''faso'', thread, and most likely refers to the long braided hair he is described as having in the ''Eckenlied''.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=44}} He may have originally been a storm demon, as evidenced by  a 17th-century prayer to witches at the mountain Jochgrimm outside of [[Bozen]] to cause "ffasolt" to send storms far away.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=121}}

They are unrelated to the [[ccTLDs]] such as the [[.us]] country code domain. Examples of geodomains are Atlanta.com, LosAngeles.com, Texas.com and LongIsland.com. Since geographical names are limited in number, and have good [[name recognition]], geodomains are valuable, with the [[.com]] extension valued the most. Geodomains tend to provide a virtual representation of the locations they serve—for example, Hawaii.com is heavily [[tourism]] focused, while Syracuse.com and Madison.com have more local content.  Collectively, geographic domain names are estimated to represent approximately over 500 million [[dollars]] a year in gross [[hotel]] bookings alone.  {{Citation needed|reason=according to who?|date=August 2017}}

'''Commander George Gideon''' of [[Scotland Yard]] is a fictional policeman who appeared in 26 [[police procedural]] novels, 21 of which were written by [[John Creasey]] under the pseudonym J.J. Marric, and published between 1955 and 1976.&lt;ref name="FFB"&gt;{{cite web|title=FFB: Gideon's Fire|url=http://inreferencetomurder.typepad.com/my_weblog/2014/06/ffb-gideons-fire.html|website=In Reference to Murder|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Portraying Gideon as a master balancing the management of cases and the workings of law enforcement, it has been considered his "most famous police procedural series".&lt;ref name="Kansas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Review: Gideon’s Fire by John Creasey|url=https://www.kclibrary.org/blog/book-reviews/book-review-gideon%E2%80%99s-fire-john-creasey|website=Kansas City Public Library|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After Creasey's death, the series was continued in five further novels by [[William Vivian Butler]]. 

[[Anthony Boucher]] of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' considered the first of the books, ''Gideon's Day'' (1955), to be author's best book.  [[H. R. F. Keating]], reviewer for the ''[[London Times]]'' picked ''Gideon's Week'' (1956) as one of the "100 Best Crime and Mystery Books" (1845-1986). ''Gideon's Fire'' (1962) won the [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]].&lt;ref name="FFB"/&gt;

== The character ==
George Gideon ("G.G." or "Gee-Gee" to coppers and crooks alike) is powerfully built but has a gentle voice. He has pale-blue eyes.  He is famed for his prodigious feats of memory and his ability to handle a bewildering work-load of cases simultaneously. Despite his seniority in rank, Gideon often takes a hands-on approach and on occasions physically engages with criminals.  He is respected and liked by his staff - but they know to keep their heads down  when his temper is aroused. In the first novel, ''[[Gideon's Day]]'' he holds the rank of [[Detective]] [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]], but in the second ''Gideon's Week'', he has been promoted to [[Commander]], and is the operational head of the [[London Metropolitan Police|Yard's]] entire [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]], a position he holds for the rest of the series.  

One of Creasey's technical advisers for the series was Commander George Hatherill, who had organized the [[British Army|British Army's]] [[Special Investigation Branch]] during [[World War II]], and was the operational head of the [[London Metropolitan Police|Yard's CID]] from 1954 through 1964 (the same position Gideon held in fiction) during which time he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].  Hatherill is generally believed to have been Creasey's model for Gideon.

== Family ==
Throughout the series, Marric emphasizes the pressure experienced by police families due to the demands of police work, and the impact of distress in the family on the ability to work.
Gideon is married to Kate, and has six surviving children. Their relationship has been strained by the loss of a seventh child while Gideon was on the [[Flying Squad]] (prior to the start of the series). In ''Gideon's Day '', the first book in the series, the children are described as Tom (age 26); Prudence (18+), Priscilla (15+), Matthew (14), Penelope (12), and Malcolm (8).  The oldest children are self-supporting; the younger ones in school. As the series progresses, the children train for careers, move out, and marry. Family relationships are usually mentioned only briefly, to establish a time frame or as they relate to or affect Gideon's work. 

Penny, the Gideon's youngest daughter, is mentioned most frequently, in part because of her on-and-off relationship with an older police officer, Alec Hobbs. In ''Gideon's Wrath'' (1967) Alec Hobbs' first wife Helen dies, around the time that Hobbs becomes Gideon's deputy. In ''Gideon's River'' (1968) Hobbs escorts Penelope to the river gala, accompanying Gideon and Kate. In ''Gideon's Way'', written by William Vivian Butler and published in 1983, Alec and Penny are married and have a son, George.

The number of children was trimmed in the TV series.

== Film and TV ==
In ''[[Gideon's Day (film)|Gideon's Day]]'' (1958, directed by [[John Ford]], USA title: ''Gideon Of Scotland Yard''), Gideon is played by [[Jack Hawkins]]. The co-stars were 
[[Anna Lee]] (Kate Gideon), 
Dianne Foster (Joanna Delafield), 
[[Ronald Howard (British actor)|Ronald Howard]] (Paul Delafield), 
[[Cyril Cusack]] (Birdy Sparrow), and 
[[Andrew Ray]] (PC Simon Farnaby-Green). The film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] and is only loosely based on the book of the same title.  Ford treats it as a comedy-melodrama, whereas the book is a more serious and straightforward procedural.&lt;ref name="CROWTHER"&gt;{{cite news|last1=CROWTHER|first1=BOSLEY|title=Screen: John Ford Spoof; Gideon of Scotland Yard' at the Odeon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B00E6D6113CE63BBC4851DFB3668382649EDE|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=May 20, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 26-part TV series ''[[Gideon's Way]]'' (USA title: ''Gideon C.I.D.'') was made in 1964, starring [[John Gregson]], which ran until 1966 in the UK, produced by [[ITC Entertainment]].

'''''How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found''''' is a book by Doug Richmond, originally released in 1985, which is a how-to guide on starting a new identity. It includes chapters on planning a disappearance, arranging for new identification, finding work, establishing credit, [[pseudocide]] (creating the impression of one's own death), and more. The book recommends a method of disappearing by assuming the identity of a dead person with similar vital statistics and age, and also includes a section on avoiding paper trails which, due to the age of the book, may no longer be relevant or useful.

A play inspired by the book was released in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Fin Kennedy (2005) ''How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found'', [[Nick Hern Books]], London. {{ISBN|978-1-85459-964-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Fin Kennedy]], about a man wanting to disappear, which won the [[John Whiting Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/teacher-wins-coveted-prize-for-the-play-that-theatres-turned-down-vmq2fp966gd Teacher wins coveted prize for the play that theatres turned down]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiohead's song "How To Disappear Completely" from their fourth album, ''[[Kid A]]'', is named after this book and was originally going to be named after its full title.

ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 is issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The standard consists of guidelines for the ethical behavior, quality management and performance of an ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 engagement.

Generally ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 is applied for [[audit]]s of internal control, sustainability and compliance with laws and regulations. [[ISAE 3402]] assurance engagements also should be performed in accordance with the ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 standard.

ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 recognizes two types of reports, a type 1 and a type 2 report. A type 1 report provides assurance on the suitability of design and existence of controls and type 2 report provides assurance on suitability of design, existence and operational effectiveness.

==ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 audit==
In the ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 standard no detailed guidelines are included for the performance of the engagement. This implies that the auditor use professional judgement for the scope, amount of controls tested and testing methods.

==Content report==
An ISAE&amp;nbsp;3000 report generally consists of a description of the scope, the norm against which the report is tested, a description of the control framework and a detailed description of the risk management system and a control matrix consisting of the risks, the related control objectives and the related controls.

'''Knyvett v Christchurch Casinos Ltd''' [1999] 2 NZLR 559 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding whether a contract illegal under statute, can be subsequently validated under the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Polglase won a $31,173.71 jackpot at the Christchurch Casino, however when the casino later discovered that he was only 18 years old, a minor, they refused to pay him out his winnings.

The Casino argued that under the Casino Control Act 1990, gambling by a minor is illegal, and thus honoring any wager would be illegal under the Act.

However, the Act only prohibited a minor being on the premises of a Casino, it did not go as far as stating any bets would be illegal as well.

The casino successfully obtained a judgment from the High Court.

Polglase, via his guardian Kynvett appealed.

==Decision==
The court refused to grant relief.

[[File:Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 4ed.jpg|thumb|''LDOCE'' 4th ed.]]

'''''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English''''' ('''''LDOCE''''') was first published by [[Longman]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners: A History|author=Anthony Paul Cowie|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary is available in various formats: paper only; paper with a bundled premium website; online access only or a gratis online version. ''LDOCE'' is an [[advanced learner's dictionary]], providing definitions by using a restricted vocabulary, helping non-native English speakers to understand meanings easily.

The latest version of ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' is the sixth edition. The premium website was revised during 2014 and 2015 and offers over a million corpus examples, exceeding that of the paper version and also supplying sound files for every word and 88,000 example sentences, along with various tools for study, teaching, examinations and grammar. The 9000 most important English words to learn have been highlighted via the Longman Communication 9000. 

The gratis ''LDOCE'' online was updated to its current layout in 2008 and offers a search (with spelling assistance), definitions; collocations; many examples and pictures.

==Longman Defining Vocabulary==

A key feature of the ''LDOCE'' is its utilization of the Longman Defining Vocabulary, a 2000-word controlled [[defining vocabulary]] used to write all of the definitions in the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, B. and M. Rundell. ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography'', 2008: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This defining vocabulary was developed from Michael West's ''General Service List'' of high-frequency words and their most common meanings.&lt;ref&gt;West, M. ''A General Service List of English Words'', 1953, London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controlled defining vocabulary is not only helpful to second-language learners, but has also facilitated the use of the ''LDOCE'' as a [[machine-readable dictionary]] in computational linguistics research.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, D. 'NSM + LDOCE: A Non-Circular Dictionary of English', ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 24/2, 2011: 226-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[http://mlksrcollaborative.org Martin Luther King Sr. Community Resources Collaborative]''' named after the late Reverend turned community activist [[Martin Luther King Sr.]],  held its official dedication ceremony, November 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choateco.com/martin-luther-king-sr-community-resources-complex-dedicated-on-sunday/|title=Choate Construction|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8-million-dollar  brick complex is located at 101 Jackson Street NE, in the "National Historic King District," of Atlanta, Georgia, which is also known as the Sweet Auburn and Old Fourth Ward Districts. The Collaborative, often referred to as the MLK Sr. CRC, is three stories tall and houses the fellowship hall of  [[Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church]], where Reverend King Sr. once pastored and co-pastored with his son [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]]  Also serving as a mini historical museum, the Collaborative, houses and displays relics from Reverend King Sr., such as his sermon notes, documents, clothing, pictures and the original church organ that his late wife, [[Alberta Williams King|Alberta Christine Williams King]] played during Ebenezer services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/2012/11/16/the-martin-luther-king-sr-community-resource-complex/1709717/|title = USA Today|date = |accessdate = 9 May 2015|website = |publisher = USA Today|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Containing a commercial grade kitchen and conference/exhibit hall, the Collaborative is frequently rented and utilized for private, corporate and government meetings and functions.  However, one of the main purposes of building the expansive Collaborative was to create and maintain an ongoing community partnership of local and national non-profit agencies focusing on improving and enhancing the lives of  underserved children and families residing in the Sweet Auburn and Old Fourth Ward geographic areas, as well as, surrounding Fulton counties in Atlanta. Detailed programs focused on Literacy/Education, Financial Literacy, Housing, Employment Services and overall Family Enhancement are administered to participants via  in-house non-profit community partners: Ebenezer Baptist Church, [[Casey Family Programs]], [[Operation HOPE, Inc.|Operation Hope]] and [[Enroll America]], as well as, services and programs from community referral partner agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kingdom Politics: In Search of a New Political Imagination for Today's Church|last1 = Norris|first1 = Kristopher|last2 = Speers|first2 = Sam|publisher = Wipf and Stock|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-62564-105-2|location = |pages = 148–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The community Cyber Cafe hosted by Operation Hope, as well as, office and suite space for the Collaborative's in house community partners, along with the Collaborative's Executive Director, [[Detria Russell]] is located throughout the Martin Luther King Sr. Community Resources Collaborative's three floors. Because the Collaborative is located in the "National Historic King District," The [[National Park Service]] administers the Collaborative's parking lot and surrounding land, which includes the old Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church building, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth home and gravesite, as well as, a community playground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/atlanta/kin.htm|title = National Park Service – Atlanta|accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Muyesinbo''''' (or '''''Muyeshinbo''''', meaning "new compendium of martial arts") is a [[Korean martial arts]] manual published in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Ehwa University Press 2008, Sippalgi: Traditional Korean Martial Arts, Dr. B.K. Choi&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a revision of the older ''[[Muyejebo]]'', made during the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Youngjo]] (1724–1776).
It adds twelve disciplines or "skills" of both armed and unarmed fighting by [[Prince Sado]] to the original six which were descbribed in the ''Muyejebo''. No copies of the ''Muyesinbo'' have survived, but its contents can easily be determined by tracing back and comparing the ''Muyejebo'' with the later ''[[Muyedobotongji]]''.

Prince Sado also originated the term  '''''Sib Pal Gi''''' (십팔기, 十八技, “Eighteen [Fighting] Methods” or possibly "Eighteen [Warrior's] Tools” if using 十八器), shortened from ''Bonjo Muye Sib Pal Ban'' (본조무예십팔반, 本條武藝十八般,  "A Treatise on the 18 Martial Categories of the Yi Dynasty"). This mirrors the Chinese concept of the "[[Eighteen Arms of Wushu]]" (十八般兵器) to identify the Korean collection of weapons depicted in the Mu Ye Sin Bo (note that 十八般兵器 is pronounced ''Sip Pal Ban Byeong Gi'' in Korean, 십팔반병기, where the words ''Ban Byeong'' are left out to render Prince Sado's term, and these omitted words roughly translate as "martial methods" making them essentially superfluous when taken in context).

== Historical background ==
The earlier manual of 1610, ''[[Muyejebo]]'' (''Martial Arts Illustrations'') had as its background the [[Imjin War]] (1592–1598), which revealed severe shortcomings in the Korean national army causing [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] (1567–1608) to order reforms based on the successful training model of the Chinese General [[Qi Jiguang]] (1527–1587).

During the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] (1724–1776) the ''Muyejebo'' was revised, and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by [[Prince Sado]], published in 1759.
Prince Sado was the heir-apparent of king Yeongjo, but he suffered from a mental illness which triggered violent outbreaks. After the prince took to randomly killing and raping people in the palace, he was executed by suffocation in 1762, aged 27.

Both the ''Muyejebo'' and ''Muyesinbo'' formed the basis for the later  ''[[Muyedobotongji]]'' ("Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts") of 1795, which added 4 already depicted disciplines only as executed on horseback (namely: [[Gichang|flag spear]], [[Sabre|twin sabres]], [[Woldo|moon-knife]], and [[flail]]) in addition to [[Equestrianism|horsemanship]] itself as well as a [[Polo|polo-like game]], bringing the total number of systems to 24.

==The Eighteen Skills==
These are the eighteen "skills" (技 skill, ability, method) which are classified into three categories (thrust, slice, and strike) and reflect strong influence from [[Chinese martial arts]].

The first six skills already present in the ''Muyejebo'' can also be found in the ''Muyesinbo'':
*Gonbong  곤봉 (long staff), c.f. Chinese [[Gun (staff)|Gun]] (棍)
*[[Deungpae]] 등패 盾牌 (shield)
*[[Nangseon]] 낭선 狼筅 (thorn spear)
*[[Jangchang]] 장창  長槍 (long spear), c.f Chinese [[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]] 槍 / Shuò 槊
*[[Dangpa]] 당파鎲杷 (three-pronged spear) 
*[[Ssangsudo]] 쌍수도 雙手刀(two-handed sword)
 
The remaining twelve skills are original to the ''Muyesinbo'':
*[[Jukjangchang]] 죽장창 竹長槍(long bamboo spear) 
*[[Gichang]] 기창 旗槍(spear with flag)
*Yedo 예도 銳刀 (sharp sword): a single-edged sword that was about three feet in length. It was typically used one-handed and was favored by foot soldiers and sailors.
*Wae geom 왜검倭刀 (Japanese sword): the Japanese [[katana]].
*Gyojeon  교전校劍 (sword sparring techniques):
*[[Woldo]] 월도 月刀(moon-blade):  a polearm with a curving blade paralleling the Chinese [[guandao]].
*[[Hyeopdo]] 협도 (spear-blade): a polearm paralleling the Japanese [[naginata]] or [[nagamaki]]. 
*[[Ssang geom]] 쌍검 雙劍 (twin-swords): fighting with two identical swords; twin-swords were made to be carried in a single sheath.
*[[Jedok geom]]  제독검 將軍劍 (admiral sword): techniques introduced by Chinese admiral [[Li Rusong]], who fought on the Korean side in the [[Imjin War]].  Li used straight-bladed swords (jikdo) with a single edge for slashing and a double-edged sword (geom) for stabbing. The manual gives 14 basic stances for this discipline.
*[[Bonguk geom]] 본국검 邦國劍(national sword): a method of swordsmanship stressing traditional Korean origin (as opposed to the more recent adoption of the techniques of the "admiral sword"). 
*[[Gwonbeop]] 권법 拳搏(unarmed fighting skills): based on the 1567 ''Ji Xiao Shin Shu''紀效新書 or "Manual of New Military Tactics" by General [[Qi Jiguang]]戚継光 (1528-1588). Of the original 32 methods cited by General Qi, about 19 methods are identified in the Muyesinbo, besides another 14 original methods, yielding a total of 33.
*[[Pyeongon]] 편곤 鞭杆(flail): paralleling the Chinese [[two-section staff]]

The term ''Sip Pal Gi'' in modern [[Korean martial arts]]  has come to identify three separate but related activities.

==Modern reception==
{{further|Sib Pal Gi Association}}
In modern Korean martial arts, ''Sip Pal Gi'' has come to be used generically, much like "[[kung fu]]" in the west.
There are, however, small groups of practitioners{{who|date=March 2014}} who use the term ''Sip Pal Gi'' historically, for the attempted reconstruction of 18th-century Korean martial arts based on the historical manuals, much in the same way as [[Historical European martial arts revival|martial arts reconstruction in the West]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3194">'''Philip Alexander Munz''', botanist, taxonomist and educator (1892–1974), of the [[Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden]], was Professor of Botany at [[Pomona College]], serving as Dean for three years.

Munz compiled the voluminous'' [[A California Flora]]'' with [[David D. Keck]] published by the [[University of California Press]] in 1959 and a supplement in 1968. Munz published ''A California Flora'' without any research support and with a relatively small subvention for publication to the University of California Press.

James Hickman, editor of the 1993 revisions of ''[[The Jepson Manual]]'', writing  in ''The Blazing Star'' (the newsletter of the Santa Clara Valley Chapter of the California Native Plant Society), Sept./Oct., 1993 states "Munz used a phylogenetic system which so far as I know has never been explained in print except for a statement on the inside of the front portion of the dust jacket, 'It abandons the conventional family order and attempts to follow that suggested by recent contributions from morphology and phylogeny.' Floras are not a place to introduce new phylogenetic systems. In Munz' 1974 A Flora of Southern California he saw the light and arranged the families alphabetically within major groups."

Munz also authored a series of popular plant guides, published by the UC Press,  entitled the ''California Wildflower Books'', for general readers interested in botany but untrained in taxonomy.

'''''Powell v. State of Georgia''''', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998){{ref|citation}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]].  Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house.  The jury [[acquit]]ted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but [[convicted]] him of consensual sodomy.

In its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 186]] (1986).

In ''Bowers'', the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had observed in his ''Bowers'' dissent that ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either.

The Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6-1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The majority noted that "privacy rights protected by the U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case," while the dissenting justice cited ''Bowers'' extensively.

Powell's conviction was overturned.

Although this case involved [[heterosexual]] activity, the decision overturned the state's [[sodomy law]] and had the effect of making [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sexual activity legal in the State of Georgia. Sodomy laws were overturned nationwide five years later, when ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) overruled ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.

{{one-nation conservatism}}
'''Progressive conservatism''' is a political ideology which attempts to combine [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies. The initial origins of progressivism come from [[Western Europe]] during the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when it was believed that [[social reform]] and progression in areas such as [[science]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[technology]] and [[medicine]] were necessary to improve human living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gotquestions.org/progressivism.html|title=What is progressivism?|author=|date=|website=Got Questions|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 19th century British prime minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] advocated an alternative form of progressive politics known as progressive conservatism under his [[one-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]] government.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, USA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. Pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnessing the negative impacts current working conditions had on people during the time, mainly brought about by the [[Industrial Revolution]], Disraeli started to believe that changes to society were not only necessary but needed to improve human and environmental conditions. However, this progression needed to be done through conservative thinking and policies, namely that the government can do good and should get involved, but only when it is necessary and within its own means, being a limited but obligatory government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacLean |first=Stephen |url=https://www.trg.org.uk/a-royal-example-for-progressive-conservatism/|title=A Royal example for progressive Conservatism|author=|date=13 July 2010|website=TRG|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea advocates that a [[social safety net]] is required, but only in a minimal form. [[Christian democracy]] and [[Catholic social teaching]] promotes some form of progressive conservatism, derived from the text of ''[[Rerum novarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emile F. Sahliyeh. Religious resurgence and politics in the contemporary world. Albany, New York, USA: State University of New York Press, 1990. Pp. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive conservatives also believe instant change is not always the best and can sometimes be damaging to society, therefore cautious change is necessary which fits in with the nations social and political traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2012/09/10/what-a-progressive-conservatism-looks-like/|title=What Progressive Conservatism Looks Like|first=Mike|last=Dwyer|date=10 September 2012|website=Ordinary Times|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, one-nation conservatives such as [[David Cameron]] who launched the [[Progressive Conservatism Project]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Letwin |first=Oliver |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/02/progressive-conservatism|title=How liberal is progressive Conservatism?|author=|date=|website=New Statesman|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theresa May]] have described themselves as progressive conservatives. Other European leaders such as [[Angela Merkel]] have been aligning themselves with centre-progressive politics with a conservative stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/30/why-angela-merkel-known-for-embracing-liberal-values-voted-against-same-sex-marriage/|title=Why Angela Merkel, known for embracing liberal values, voted against same-sex marriage|first=Rick|last=Noack|date=30 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2018|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political science, a '''reactionary''' is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the ''[[Status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]'', the previous political state of society, which he or she believes possessed characteristics ([[discipline]], [[Traditionalist conservatism|respect for authority]], etc.) that are negatively absent from the contemporary ''status quo'' of a society. As an adjective, the word ''reactionary'' describes points of view and policies meant to restore the ''status quo ante''.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, (1999) p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political reactionaries are predominantly found on the [[right-wing]] of a political spectrum, though [[left-wing]] reactionaries exist as well.&lt;ref&gt; Lilla, Mark [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/rise-of-the-reactionary "Rise of the Reactionary"], accessed 10/10/2017. "For [Lilla] “reactionary” is not an insult. It is a taxonomic term. It describes an organic response to political and social revolution, and the quite sensible fear that the shared common life of a people has been wrenched out of its cherished patterns. Nor is the phenomenon limited to the ideological right. The left has reactionaries, too—including progressives in the nineteen-nineties who, Lilla wrote at the time, were convinced that Americans did not grasp the disastrous truth about the Reagan Revolution, “since if they did, they would overturn it.” But reactionaries on the right far outnumber those on the left." &lt;/ref&gt; Reactionary ideologies can also be radical, in the sense of [[Extremism|political extremism]], in service to re-establishing the ''status quo ante''. In political discourse, being a reactionary is generally regarded as negative; the descriptor "political reactionary" has been adopted by the likes of the Austrian monarchist [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1943jul-00086 ''Credo of a Reactionary''] by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn – [[The American Mercury]], under his alias Francis Stuart Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish journalist [[Gerald Warner]] of Craigenmaddie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/100048734/scrap-the-meaningless-terms-left-and-right-and-reclaim-the-honourable-title-reactionary/ | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Scrap the meaningless terms Left and Right and reclaim the honourable title 'reactionary' | date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Colombian [[political theology|political theologian]] [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and the American historian [[John Lukacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confessions of an Original Sinner|isbn= 9781890318123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and usage ==
The [[French Revolution]] gave the English language three politically descriptive words denoting anti-progressive politics: "reactionary", "conservative" and "[[Right-wing politics|right]]". "Reactionary" derives from the French word ''réactionnaire'' (a late 18th century coinage based on the word ''réaction'', "reaction") and "[[Conservatism|conservative]]" from ''conservateur'', identifying monarchist parliamentarians opposed to the revolution.&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;''The Governments of Europe'', Frederic Austin OGG, Rev. Ed., The MacMillan Co., 1922, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; In this French usage, reactionary denotes "a movement towards the reversal of an existing tendency or state" and a "return to a previous condition of affairs". The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites the first English language usage in 1799 in a translation of [[Lazare Carnot]]'s letter on the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reply of L. N. M. Carnot, citizen of France ... to the report made on the conspiracy of the 18th Fructidor |last=Carnot |first=L. N. M. |year=1799 |publisher=J. Wright |location=London |page=149| edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMdDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=reactionaries&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Revolution, conservative forces (especially within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) organized opposition to the [[Progressivism|progressive]] sociopolitical and economic changes brought by the revolution; and they fought to restore the temporal authority of the Church and [[The Crown|Crown]]. In 19th century European politics, the reactionary class included the Roman Catholic Church's hierarchy—the [[clergy]], the [[aristocracy]], [[Royal family|royal families]] and [[Monarchism|royalists]]—believing that national government is the sole domain of the Church and the state. In France, supporters of traditional rule by direct heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] dynasty were labelled the [[legitimist]] reaction. In the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], the monarchists were the reactionary faction, later renamed conservative.&lt;ref name=Austin /&gt; These forces also saw "reaction" as a legitimate response to the often rash "action" of the French Revolution, hence there is nothing inherently derogatory in the term reactionary and it is sometimes also used to describe the principle of waiting for an opponent's action to take part in a general reaction.{{citation needed|reason="and it is sometimes also used to describe...waiting for an opponent..." When is sometimes? Who has used this meaning?|date=March 2015}} In Protestant Christian societies, reactionary has described those supporting tradition against modernity.

In the 19th century, reactionary denoted people who idealized [[feudalism]] and the pre-modern era—before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the French Revolution—when economies were mostly [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], a [[landed aristocracy]] dominated society, a [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary king]] ruled and the Roman Catholic Church was society's moral centre. Those labelled as "reactionary" favoured the [[aristocracy]] instead of the [[middle class]] and the [[working class]]. Reactionaries [[Opposition to democracy|opposed democracy]] and [[parliamentarism]].

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===
The [[Thermidorian Reaction]] was a movement within the revolution against perceived excesses of the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]. On 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor year II in the [[French Republican Calendar]]), [[Maximilien Robespierre]]'s [[Reign of Terror]] was brought to an end. The overthrow of Robespierre signalled the reassertion of the French [[National Convention]] over the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The Jacobins were suppressed, the prisons were emptied and the Committee was shorn of its powers. After the execution of some 104 Robespierre supporters, the Thermidorian Reaction stopped the use of the [[guillotine]] against alleged [[counterrevolutionaries]], set a middle course between the monarchists and the radicals and ushered in a time of relative exuberance and its accompanying corruption.

===Restoration of the French monarchy===
With the [[Congress of Vienna]], inspired by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]], the monarchs of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] formed the [[Holy Alliance]], a form of collective security against [[revolution]] and [[Bonapartism]]. This instance of reaction was surpassed by a movement that developed in France when, after the second fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Bourbon Restoration]] or reinstatement of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty, ensued. This time it was to be a [[constitutional monarchy]], with an [[election|elected]] lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. The Franchise was restricted to men over the age of forty, which indicated that for the first fifteen years of their lives they had lived under the ''[[ancien régime]]''. Nevertheless, King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] was worried that he would still suffer an intractable parliament. He was delighted with the [[ultra-royalist]]s, or Ultras, whom the election returned, declaring that he had found a ''[[chambre introuvable]]'', literally, an "unfindable house".

It was the [[Declaration of Saint-Ouen]] that prepared the way for the Restoration. Before the French Revolution, which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of French society's organisation, the only way constitutional change could be instituted was by extracting it from old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal. Everything new had to be expressed as a righteous revival of something old that had lapsed and had been forgotten. This was also the means used for diminished aristocrats to get themselves a bigger piece of the pie. In the 18th century, those gentry whose fortunes and prestige had diminished to the level of peasants would search diligently for every ancient feudal statute that might give them something. The "ban," for example, meant that all peasants had to grind their grain in their lord's mill. Therefore, these gentry came to the [[French States-General of 1789]] fully prepared to press for the expansion of such practices in all provinces, to the legal limit. They were horrified when, for example, the French Revolution permitted common citizens to go hunting, one of the few perquisites that they had always enjoyed everywhere.

Thus with the restoration of the Bourbons, the ''Chambre Introuvable'' set about reverting every law to return society not merely to the ''ancien régime'' with its [[absolute monarchy]], but to even earlier conditions when the aristocracy really was a socially powerful class. It is this which clearly distinguishes a "reactionary" from a "conservative." The conservative would have accepted many improvements brought about by the revolution, and simply refused a program of wholesale ''reversion''. Use of the word "reactionary" in later days as a political slur is thus often rhetorical, since there is nothing directly comparable with the ''Chambre Introuvable'' in the history of other countries.

===Clerical philosophers===
{{Main|Clerical philosophers}}
In the revolution's aftermath, France was continually wracked with the quarrels between the right-wing [[legitimists]] and left-wing revolutionaries. Herein arose the clerical philosophers—[[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis de Bonald]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]—whose answer was restoring the [[House of Bourbon]] and reinstalling the Roman Catholic Church as the [[established church]]. Since then, France's political spectrum has featured similar divisions. (see ''[[Action Française]]''). The ideas of the clerical philosophers were buttressed by the teachings of the 19th century popes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Metternich and containment===
During the period of 1815-1848, [[Prince Metternich]], the [[List of foreign ministers of Austria-Hungary|foreign minister]] of the [[Austrian Empire]], stepped in to organise [[cordon sanitaire|containment of revolutionary forces]] through international [[Political alliance|alliances]] meant to prevent the spread of [[revolutionary]] fervour. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], he was very influential in establishing the new order, the [[Concert of Europe]], after the defeat of [[Napoleon]].

After the Congress, Prince Metternich worked hard bolstering and stabilising the conservative regime of the Restoration period. He worked furiously to prevent Russia's Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] (who aided the [[liberalism|liberal]] forces in Germany, Italy and France) from gaining influence in Europe. The Church was his principal ally, promoting it as a conservative principle of order while opposing [[nationalist]] and liberal tendencies within the Church. His basic philosophy was based on [[Edmund Burke]], who championed the need for old roots and an orderly development of society. He opposed [[democracy|democratic]] and [[parliament]]ary institutions but favoured [[modernization|modernising]] existing structures by gradual [[reform movement|reform]]. Despite Metternich's efforts a series of [[1848 Revolutions|revolutions rocked Europe in 1848]].

===20th century===
{{See also|Revisionism (Marxism)}}
[[File:Le suffrage à 2 tours vaincra la réaction.jpg|thumb|right|French poster saying that suffrage with 2 steps will win against reactionary people (1932).]]

In the 20th century, proponents of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] used the term ''reactionary'' polemically to label their enemies, such as the [[White Armies]], who fought in the [[Russian Civil War]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] after the [[October Revolution]]. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] terminology, ''reactionary'' is a [[pejorative]] adjective denoting people whose ideas might appear to be socialist, but, in their opinion, contain elements of [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]], [[nationalism]], [[fascism]] or other characteristics of the [[ruling class]], including usage between conflicting factions of Marxist movements.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Non-socialists did also use the label ''reactionary'', with British diplomat [[John Jordan (diplomat)|Sir John Jordan]] nicknaming the Chinese [[Royalist Party]] the "reactionary party" for supporting the [[Qing dynasty]] and opposing [[republicanism]] during the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1912.{{sfnp|Kit-ching|1978|p=51}}

''Reactionary'' is also used to denote supporters of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] régimes such as [[Vichy France]], Spain under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], and Portugal under [[António Salazar|Salazar]]. One example of this took place after [[Boris Pasternak]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. On 26 October 1958, the day following the [[Nobel Committee]]'s announcement, Moscow's ''Literary Gazette'' ran a polemical article by David Zaslavski entitled, ''Reactionary [[Propaganda]] Uproar over a Literary Weed''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olga Ivinskaya]], ''A Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak'', Doubleday, 1978. Page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactionary feelings were often coupled with a hostility to modern, industrial means of production and a nostalgia for a more rural society. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime in [[France]], [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] regime, the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] regime in [[Portugal]] and Maurras's ''[[Action Française]]'' political movements are examples of such traditional reactionary feelings, in favour of [[authoritarian]] regimes with strong unelected leaders and with Catholicism as a [[state religion]]. The [[motto]] of Vichy France was "[[travail, famille, patrie]]"("work, family, homeland"), and its leader, [[Marshal]] [[Philippe Pétain]], declared that "la terre, elle ne ment pas" ("the earth, it does not lie") in an indication of his belief that the truest life is rural and agrarian.

The [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] showed a desire to bring about a new social order based on the ancient feudal principle of delegation (though without serfdom) in their enthusiasm for the [[corporate state]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] said that "fascism is reaction" and that "fascism, which did not fear to call itself reactionary... has not today any impediment against declaring itself illiberal and anti-liberal."&lt;ref&gt;Gerarchia, March, 1923 quoted in [[George Seldes]], ''Facts and Fascism'', eighth edition, New York: In Fact, 1943, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Giovanni Gentile|Gentile]] and Mussolini also attacked certain reactionary policies, particularly monarchism and—more veiled—some aspects of Italian conservative [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. They wrote, "History doesn't travel backwards. The fascist doctrine has not taken [[Joseph de Maistre|De Maistre]] as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry." They further elaborated in the political doctrine that fascism "is not reactionary [in the old way] but revolutionary." Conversely, they also explained that fascism was of the right, not of the left. Fascism was certainly not simply a return to tradition: it carried the centralised state beyond even what had been seen in [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]]. Fascist [[one-party state]]s were as centralised as most [[communist states]], and fascism's intense [[nationalism]] was not found in the period prior to the French Revolution.

The [[Nazism|German Nazis]] did not consider themselves reactionary, and considered the forces of reaction (Prussian [[monarchist]]s, [[Junker|nobility]], [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]) among their enemies right next to their [[Roter Frontkämpferbund|Red Front]] enemies in the Nazi Party march ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied|Die Fahne hoch]]''. The fact that the Nazis called their 1933 rise to power the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft|National]] [[Revolution]]'', shows that they supported some form of revolution. Nevertheless, they idealised tradition, folklore, classical thought, leadership (as exemplified by [[Frederick the Great]]), rejected the liberalism of the [[Weimar Republic]], and called the German state the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] (which traces back to the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire|First Reich]] and the pre-Weimar [[German Empire|Second Reich]]). (See also [[Reactionary modernism]].)

[[Clericalism|Clericalist]] movements, sometimes labelled as [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] by their critics, can be considered reactionaries in terms of the 19th century, since they share some elements of fascism, while at the same time promote a return to the pre-revolutionary model of social relations, with a strong role for the Church. Their utmost philosopher was [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]].

Political scientist [[Corey Robin]] argues that modern [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]]
is fundamentally reactionary in his book ''[[The Reactionary Mind]]: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coreyrobin.com/about|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Neoreactionary" is a term applied to, and sometimes a self-description of, an informal group of online political theorists who have been active since the 2000s.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/ |website=TechCrunch |title=Geeks for Monarchy: The Rise of the Neoreactionaries |date=22 November 2013 |first=Klint |last=Finley }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "neo-reactionary" was coined by "Mencius Moldbug" (the pseudonym of [[Curtis Yarvin]], a computer programmer) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/ol3-jacobite-history-of-world.html|title=Unqualified Reservations|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.co.uk/2008/06/olx-simple-sovereign-bankruptcy.html|title=Unqualified Reservations|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}} ([[George Orwell]] used it in a different context in 1943 – {{cite web |url=http://www.telelib.com/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/essay/tribune/AsIPlease19431224.html |title=As I Please |work=Tribune |date=24 December 1943 |first=George |last=Orwell }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Kling]] used it in 2010 to describe "Moldbug" and the subculture quickly adopted it.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy" /&gt; Proponents of the "Neo-Reactionary" movement (also called the "[[Dark Enlightenment]]" movement) include philosopher [[Nick Land]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Walther |url=http://spectator.org/blog/57516/dark-enlightenment-silly-not-scary |title=The Dark Enlightenment Is Silly Not Scary |website=[[The American Spectator]] |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dc"&gt;{{cite web |first=Bryce |last=Laliberte |url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/08/its-not-racist-to-seek-an-exit/ |title=It's Not Racist to seek an "Exit" |website=The Daily Caller |date=November 8, 2013 |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's objectives included opposition to any form of [[egalitarianism]] as well as "a return to traditional [[gender role]]s, [[monarchism]], and typically a more [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]]-oriented economic system".&lt;ref name="dc" /&gt;

'''Risk Everything''' is an advertisement campaign created for American sports apparel company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] by the American advertising agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]]. The advertisement campaign, spanning radio, television, out-of-home, online advertising and print media, was specially made for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and starring well-known [[football players]] from national teams and clubs. This campaign emphasizes the mantra of "risk everything" – taking every dangerous life-or-death chance to succeed and outshine your rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Risk everything! Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and David Luiz take fight to 'unbeatable' clones in animated advert |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/risk-everything-wayne-rooney-cristiano-ronaldo-and-david-luiz-take-fight-to-unbeatable-clones-in-9528849.html |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The campaign, created by ad agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]], emphasizes risk-taking and what it takes to carry on a nation's hopes. The ads show players feeling the heat from intense neck-to-neck competition, fighting for glory and victory who suddenly arrive at a turning point in the football world – or match – and take a risk: giving an amateur the opportunity for a penalty kick or challenging perfect gameplay.

==Television==
Nike released three television advertisements in the Risk Everything series across the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries: Risk Everything, Winner Stays, and The Last Game

===Risk Everything===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Risk Everything-Wayne Rooney.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Wayne Rooney]] in a scene]] --&gt;
Starring Portuguese footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], Brazil's [[Neymar]] and England's [[Wayne Rooney]], the advertisement focuses on the pressure superstar players face when playing for their country in the [[FIFA World Cup]]. Ronaldo is surrounded by his fans – and advertisements depicting him – everywhere and Portugal's hopes seem to be riding on Ronaldo. Rooney, on the other hand, faces skepticism everywhere he goes and Neymar, who is wearing Brazil's prestigious number 10 shirt, is trying to live up to his country's football fanaticism, the legend of the players who wore the number 10 for Brazil and World Cup aspirations. The ad ends the three players walking with their team to the pitch, preparing themselves for the onslaught and the tagline "Pressure shapes Legends".

===Winner Stays===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Winner Stays-Cristiano Ronaldo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15||[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in the ad]] --&gt;

A group of friends agree to a pick-up football match in a park, with the winning team getting to stay on the field. The players pretend to be (and transform) into players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Wayne Rooney, [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[David Luiz]], [[Andrea Pirlo]], [[Thibaut Courtois]], [[Gonzalo Higuaín]], [[Eden Hazard]], [[Gerard Piqué]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Mario Götze]], [[Thiago Silva]] and [[Tim Howard]]. The ad features cameos by [[Irina Shayk]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Jon Jones]], [[Anderson Silva]] and the [[Incredible Hulk]]. As the match nears the end with a 2–2 tie and a "next goal wins" scenario, a young boy takes the ball off Ronaldo, and with immense pressure upon him from people across the globe watching the match, scores the penalty and wins the game for his team.

===The Last Game===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Last Game-Players.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Originals overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]]]] --&gt;
An animated feature created in collaboration with [[Passion Pictures]], the ad shows the scientist, promoter of "Perfect Inc.", giving a presentation on how football players are reckless in their game play and "take too many risks". He unveils clones, which are programmed for perfect, no-risk-taken football and focus on efficiency, accuracy and risk mitigation by guaranteed results. The world of football (and sports) suffers from these clones, as they defeat the real players, put them out of business, and drive sports to near-extinction.

Retired Brazilian football legend [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who is saddened by this state of football, watches a young boy practising football tricks all alone and an interview of the scientist, in which he says "Before Perfect Inc. football was a wild and unpredictable affair. I've changed that" which fires him up and embarks on a mission to save football. He rescues the now-forgotten players: Zlatan Ibrahimović, trying to sell copies of his autobiography ''I Am Zlatan Ibrahimović''; Cristiano Ronaldo, who now works as a mannequin in "Sport-U-Gal" sports equipment store; Andrés Iniesta, now a farmer; Neymar and David Luiz, barbers at a beauty salon, trimming the hair of their clones; and Wayne Rooney, a fisherman. Their spirits are raised by Ronaldo, who motivates them by showing them glimpses of their former glory and the death football is facing. There, Neymar takes a selfie on a statue. Rooney questions, "We all want to destroy the clones, but they all are unbeatable!" Ronaldo replies: "Nobody thinks that they can be beatable, but you can do it!" The players challenge the clones to a football match; the team with the first goal wins, and the losers quit football for eternity.

The Players outsmart the clones with their skills despite the Scientist activating a fail-safe which introduces more clones to the field; the match ends with Cristiano Ronaldo effortlessly scoring a goal. As the players [[Goal celebration|celebrate]] and the Scientist sulks, the entire world cheers and human players start returning to sports. A jubilant Ronaldo looks at the players celebrating, and exclaims, "Clone that!"

== Internet ==

=== Ask Zlatan ===
On 9 March 2014, Nike organized a question-and-answer session on [[Twitter]] with then-[[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] striker Zlatan Ibrahimović; Twitter users asked questions to Ibrahimović by tweeting with the [[hashtag]] #DareToZlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic hosts hilarious Twitter Q&amp;A|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/10/zlatan-ibrahimovic-hosts-hilarious-twitter-qa-4513883/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Metro|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Rose Center for Earth and Space''' is a part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]. The Center's complete name is '''The Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space'''.  The main entrance is located on the northern side of the museum on [[81st Street (Manhattan)|81st Street]] near [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. Completed in 2000, it includes the new '''Hayden Planetarium''', the original of which was opened in 1935 and closed in 1997. [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] is its first and, {{As of|2016|alt=to date}}, only director.

==History==
[[File:Hayden Planetarium.jpg|thumb|250px|Hayden Planetarium, circa 1935–45]]
The center is an extensive reworking of the former Hayden Planetarium, whose first projector, dedicated in 1935, had 2 successors previous to the current one.

The original Hayden Planetarium was founded in 1933 with a donation by philanthropist [[Charles Hayden (banker)|Charles Hayden]]. In 1935, the Hayden Planetarium, designed by architects [[Trowbridge &amp; Livingston]], opened, after its construction was funded by a $650,000 loan from the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] and a $150,000 donation from banker [[Charles Hayden (banker)|Charles Hayden]] of [[Hayden, Stone &amp; Co.]]  Its mission was to give the public "a more lively and sincere appreciation of the magnitude of the universe... and for the wonderful things which are daily occurring in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=A Remnant of the 1930s, and Its Sky, Will Fall|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-08-16|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71431F93BA2575BC0A960958260|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph chamberlain (planetarium director)|Joseph M. Chamberlain]], hired as an assistant curator in 1952, became Chairman of the Planetarium in 1956.&lt;ref name=NYT20111211&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Joseph Chamberlain, 88, Dies; Brought the Stars a Bit Closer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/science/space/joseph-m-chamberlain-dies-at-88-led-hayden-and-adler-planetariums.html|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, a [[Zeiss projector|Zeiss Mark IV projector]] was installed, followed by a Zeiss Mark VI projector and new seats in 1993.

In January 1997, the original Hayden Planetarium was closed and demolished. In August 1999, a new, customized Zeiss Mark IX projector was installed, accompanied by a digital dome projection system that provides a [[3D computer graphics|3-D visualization]] of the universe based on images generated in real time by a [[Silicon Graphics]] supercomputer.

On February 19, 2000, the $210 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, containing the new Hayden Planetarium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Goldberger|title=Stairway to the Stars|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2000-01-17|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/01/17/2000_01_17_072_TNY_LIBRY_000020017|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened to the public. The Rose Center is named after [[Frederick P. Rose|two members]] of the Rose family, and was designed by [[James Polshek]] and Todd H. Schliemann of Polshek Partnership Architects with the exhibition design by [[Ralph Appelbaum|Ralph Appelbaum Associates]]. [[Tom Hanks]] provided the voice-over for the first planetarium show during the opening of the new Rose Center for Earth &amp; Space in the Hayden Planetarium in 2000. Since then such celebrities as [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Maya Angelou]] have been featured.

[[File:Hayden ball &amp; disks jeh.jpg|thumb|250px|The Hayden Sphere with the winding Cosmic Pathway helix.]]
Designed by Polshek and Todd Schliemann, the building consists of a six-story high glass cube enclosing the {{convert|87|ft|m|adj=on}} illuminated Hayden Sphere, which appears to float, although it is actually supported by truss work. Polshek has referred to this work as a "cosmic cathedral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glancey|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Glancey|title=A cosmic cathedral on 81st Street|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-05-08|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/may/08/artsfeatures1|accessdate=2009-03-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rose Center and its adjacent plaza are both located on the north face of the Museum; the Center encloses {{convert|333500|sqft|m2 ha}} of research, education, and exhibition spaces, in addition to the Hayden Planetarium.  Also located in the facility is the Department of [[Astrophysics]], the newest academic research department in the Museum.  Furthermore, Polshek designed the {{convert|1800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Weston Pavilion, a {{convert|43|ft|m|adj=on}} high transparent structure of "water white" glass along the Museum's west facade.  This structure, a small companion piece to the Rose Center, offers a new entry way to the Museum, as well as opening further exhibition space for astronomically-related objects. The planetarium's original magazine, ''The Sky'', merged with another journal, ''The Telescope'', to become the leading astronomy magazine ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnh.org/science/facilities/hayden.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibits highlight human connection to the cosmos along with the scale and properties of the [[observable universe]] itself. When the new Rose Center opened with a model of only eight planets, excluding [[Pluto]], which had been thought of as the ninth planet, it resulted in a headline-making controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/tyson_responds_010202.html| title=Astronomer Responds to Pluto-Not-a-Planet Claim| date=February 2, 2001| website=Space.com| last=deGrasse Tyson| first=Neil| authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson| accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hayden Planetarium===
{{For|the Charles Hayden Planetarium in Boston|Museum of Science, Boston}}
The '''Hayden Planetarium''' (often called "The Hayden Sphere" or "The Great Sphere") has, since 2000, been one of the two main attractions within the Rose Center. It was established by the State of New York in 1933, some of the funding coming from philanthropist [[Charles Hayden (banker)|Charles Hayden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/hp/history.html |title=History of the Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306054830/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/hp/history.html |archivedate=March 6, 2006 |df= }} Accessed 2008-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;  The top half of the Hayden Sphere houses the Star Theater, which uses high-resolution [[fulldome|fulldome video]] to project “space shows” based on scientific visualization of current astrophysical data, in addition to a customized [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Zeiss projector|Star Projector]] system replicating an accurate night sky as seen from Earth. The Star Theater is one of the world's pre-eminent [[planetarium]]s, which incorporates high-resolution full-dome video to create "space shows", based in scientific visualization of current astrophysical data. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The Big Bang Theater, which occupies the bottom half of the Hayden Sphere, depicts [[Big Bang|the birth of the universe]] in a four-minute program. Utilizing a screen that measures {{convert|36|ft}} in diameter over an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} bowl, a four-minute program depicts [[Big Bang|the birth of the universe]], with narration by [[Liam Neeson]]. The Big Bang Theater serves as an introduction to the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, a spiral which wraps around the sphere, connecting the second and first floors of the Rose Center. The cosmic pathway provides a timeline of the universe's history from the Big Bang to the present day.  The Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway is one of the most popular exhibits in the Rose Center, which opened February 19, 2000.&lt;ref name="timeline2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: The History of the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index4.html|accessdate=2009-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310030550/http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index4.html|archivedate=2009-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hayden Planetarium offers a number of courses and public presentations including the Frontiers of Astrophysics and Distinguished Authors lecture series.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway===
As visitors leave the Planetarium theater, they exit to the Size Scales of the Universe exhibit which shows the vast array of sizes in the universe; the walkway itself is a timeline of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present. This exhibit leads to the Big Bang Theater and exits to the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, an interactive exhibit designed by the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] at the Rose Center, which shows the history of the universe. From the bottom of the Cosmic Pathway, visitors can stop by the Hall of Planet Earth to explore geology, weather, plate tectonics, and more, or go down to the Hall of the Universe to explore the realms of planets, stars, galaxies and more. The {{convert|360|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ramp illustrates 13 billion years of cosmic history&lt;ref name="path"&gt;{{cite web | title=Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/rose-center-for-earth-and-space/harriet-and-robert-heilbrunn-cosmic-pathway | accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a rate of about 36,111,111 years per foot (about 1,184,748 years per centimeter); a typical adult walking step length of approximately {{convert|28|in|cm ft}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/438170-the-average-walking-stride-length/|title=The Average Walking Stride Length|last=Johnson|first=Jolie|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers about 84 million years.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Along the pathway are thirteen markers denoting the passage of each billion years. At eight landings, panels show visitors the relative size of the universe at that point in time, along with major developmental stages of the universe including the first generation of stars, [[globular clusters]], [[quasar]]s, [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], [[Bulge (astronomy)|galactic bulges]], [[Radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], [[galactic disk]]s, and later generations of stars. At each of the landings, computer interactives provide overviews of the entire pathway, and more in-depth information, as well as connections to exhibit topics in the Hall of the Universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Walking down the pathway, visitors also pass by a photographic record of cosmic history. Astronomical images appear at that time of the universe corresponding to that place on the pathway. The light from these objects has taken billions of years to reach the earth, and visitors see them not as they are now, but as they were when their light began its journey toward Earth. Among these are some of the most distant celestial objects known to scientists, along with their cosmic "[[red shift]]", the measurement that indicates what epoch of the expanding universe is being shown. Panels along the beginning of the Pathway are intentionally left blank in order allow space to document future discoveries of new "record holders" that are even more distant than the ones currently known.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Artifacts along the Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway include [[presolar grains]], a meteorite that dates from the birth of our solar system, a sample from the oldest rock formation on Earth, a [[stromatolite]] as an example of multicellular life formation, a trilobite, the first animal with eyes; and the fossilized serrated tooth of a giant carnivorous dinosaur. The Cosmic Pathway concludes with the Age of Dinosaurs, which became extinct 66 million years ago, less than {{convert|2|ft|cm}} from the end of the Pathway. The duration of recorded human history is portrayed, by contrast, as comparable to the thickness of a human hair.&lt;ref name="path" /&gt;

===Arthur Ross Terrace===
The Ross Terrace adjacent to the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and built over the new parking garage on 81st Street. This rooftop plaza is designed to be a stage set that celebrates both astronomy and Earth’s natural history, as well as an outdoor gathering place for museum visitors. Renowned garden designer [[Kathryn Gustafson]] formed the concept for the Terrace after seeing an illustration of shadows cast by a lunar eclipse. A terrace covering {{convert|47,114|ft2|m2 ha}} was designed by [[Charles Morris Anderson]] as a Landscape Architect, and his design was awarded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) Design award in 2003.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Current exhibits and shows==

{{As of|2015}}, five shows have premiered in the theater. The first show, ''Passport to the Universe'', opened with the new theater and features the voice of [[Tom Hanks]] as a guide along a voyage from [[Earth]] to the edge of the [[observable universe]]. ''The Search for Life: Are We Alone?'' debuted in 2002, with narration by [[Harrison Ford]] describing the possibilities of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Opened in 2006 and narrated by [[Robert Redford]], ''Cosmic Collisions'' examines the role that impacts have played in shaping the universe—including visualizations of Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[Moon Formation|the formation of the Moon]], and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|the meteorite impact]] that contributed to the end of the age of dinosaurs. ''Journey to the Stars'', narrated by [[Whoopi Goldberg]], premiered on, July 4, 2009, featuring extraordinary images from telescopes on the ground and in space and stunning, never-before-seen visualizations of physics-based simulations. ''Dark Universe'', narrated by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], premiered on November 2, 2013.

Other exhibits can be found outside the sphere. The Gottesman Hall of the Planet Earth has displays that illustrate the Earth's geological history and weather patterns. The Cullman Hall of the Universe focuses on topics ranging from planets to stars, life on other worlds to current cosmology. The Scales of the Universe exhibit makes comparisons between the size of the Hayden Sphere and other objects in the universe presented at appropriate relative scale. There is also a photographic exhibit about the Apollo moon landings. The photographs are throughout the first floor level of the Rose Center.

[[File:Square-foot-garden.JPG|thumb|Square foot garden in raised bed]]
'''Square Foot Gardening''' is the practice of dividing the growing area into small square sections (typically 12" on a side, hence the name). The aim is to assist the planning and creating of a [[Gardening in restricted spaces|small]] but intensively planted [[vegetable]] [[garden]]. It results in a simple and orderly gardening system, from which it draws much of its appeal. Mel Bartholomew coined the term "square foot gardening" in his 1981 book of the same name.

==Overview==
[[File:SquareFootGardening.gif|thumb|A basic, 4x4, 16-unit "square-foot garden."]]
The phrase "square foot gardening" was popularized by Mel Bartholomew in a 1981 [[Rodale Press]] book and subsequent [[PBS]] television series.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Bartholomew a retired engineer, devised a raised 4’x4’square bed(s)with a grid. Each of these 4’ by 4’ square beds were then divided into sixteen one foot squares (the grid). Each square is planted with a different crop species based on a formulation of either one, four, nine or sixteen plants per square depending on its overall size. Once a “square foot” is harvested, a different crop can be planted for a continual harvest. 
To encourage a variety of different crops in succession, and discourage pests, each square would be used for a different kind of plant (crop rotation) within the growing season. The number of plants per square would depend on an individual plant's size. For example, a single [[tomato]] plant takes a full square, as might herbs such as [[oregano]], [[basil]] or [[Mentha|mint]], while [[lettuce]] plants would be planted four per square, and up to sixteen per square of plants such as [[radish]] or carrots. Tall plants are trellised on the north side of the bed to avoid shading smaller plants and prevent sprawling on the ground.

One advantage of densely planted crops is that they can form a living [[mulch]], and also prevent [[weed]]s from establishing or even germinating. Also, natural insect repellent methods such as [[companion planting]] (eg planting [[Tagetes|marigolds]] or other naturally pest-repelling plants) become more efficient in a close space, which may reduce the need to use [[pesticide]]s. The large variety of crops in a small space also prevents plant diseases from spreading easily&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Biodiversity loss affects global disease ecology|first1 = Montira J.|last1 = Pongsiri|first2 = Joe|last2 = Roman|authorlink2 = Joe Roman|first3 = Vanessa O.|last3 = Ezenwa|first4 = Tony L.|last4 = Goldberg|first5 = Hillel S.|last5 = Koren|first6 = Stephen C.|last6 = Newbold|first7 = Richard S.|last7 = Ostfeld|first8 = Subhrendu K.|last8 = Pattanayak|first9 = Daniel J.|last9 = Salkeld|journal = [[BioScience]]|year = 2009|volume = 59|issue = 11|pages = 945-954|doi = 10.1525/bio.2009.59.11.6|doi-access = free|url = https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/59/11/945/696758/59-11-945.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beds are typically small, making covers or cages to protect plants from pests, cold, or sun is more practical than with larger gardens. To extend the growing season of a square foot garden, a cold/hot frame may be built around the SFG, and by facing the cold/hot frame south, the SFG captures more light and heat during the colder months of spring and winter.

In 2006, Bartholemew updated the concept with the book "All New Square Foot Gardening", which advocates using “Mel’s Mix” created by Bartholomew. After much experimentation, Bartholomew concluded that his formulation of 1/3 peat moss or coconut coir, 1/3 vermiculite and 1/3 blended compost yielded superior results in only a 6” depth. The benefits of the mix included keeping soil friable, virtually weed free with all the necessary nutrients. This mix eliminated the need for artificial fertilizer as compost is added each time you re-plant a square which provides enough nutrients naturally.

[[File:01-26-1953 11274 Maurice Tillet (4304937426).jpg|thumb|Maurice Tillet in 1953]]
'''Maurice Tillet''' (October 23, 1903 – September 4, 1954) was a French [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''The French Angel'''. Tillet was a leading box office draw in the early 1940s and was twice contracted to act as [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|World Heavyweight Champion]] by the [[American Wrestling Association]] run by [[Paul Bowser]] in [[Boston]].

== Early life ==
Tillet was born in 1903 in the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] to [[French people|French]] parents.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; His mother was a [[teacher]] and his father was a [[railroad engineer]]. Tillet's father died when he was young. As a child he had a completely normal appearance and Tillet was [[nickname]]d "The Angel" due to his angelic face. In 1917, Tillet and his mother left Russia due to the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] and moved to France, where they settled in [[Reims]]. When Tillet was 20, he noticed swelling in his feet, hands, and head, and after visiting a doctor was diagnosed with [[acromegaly]]—a condition usually caused by a [[benign tumor]] on the [[pituitary gland]], resulting in bone overgrowth and thickening.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/12/14/19123831.html|title=The French Angel was more man than monster|date=December 14, 2011|last=Oliver|first=Greg|accessdate=February 11, 2012|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had wanted to become a lawyer, but his acromegaly prevented him from doing so. Tillet served in the [[French Navy]] for five years as an engineer.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
[[File:Wrestling. The Angel...Lou Thesz BAnQ P48S1P06188.jpg|thumb|left|The French Angel against [[Lou Thesz]] in the ring, 1940]]
[[File:Radio. At C.H.L.P. Wrestler "The Angel" BAnQ P48S1P22990.jpg|thumb|right|Tillet being interviewed in Montreal, 1940.]]
In February 1937, Tillet met Karl Pojello (Lithuanian Karolis Požėla) in [[Singapore]]. Pojello was a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], and convinced Tillet to enter the business. Tillet and Pojello moved to [[Paris]] for training, and Tillet wrestled for two years in [[France]] and [[England]] until [[World War II]] forced them to leave for the [[United States]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

In [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1940, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promoter|promoter]] [[Paul Bowser]] [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] Tillet, who was wrestling as The French Angel, as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Main eventer|main eventer]], and he became a large [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|draw]] in the area. As a result of his popularity, Tillet was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] as unstoppable, scripted to win for a span of 19 consecutive months. Tillet acted as the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] from May 1940 until May 1942. In early 1942, he also worked as the [[Montreal]]-based world heavyweight champion.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He re-appeared with the Boston-based title for a short time in 1944.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

As a result of his success, several Angel imitators emerged, including Paul Olaffsen (Swedish Angel), who also had acromegaly; Tony Angelo (Russian Angel), [[Tor Johnson]] (Super Swedish Angel), Jack Rush (Canadian Angel), Wladislaw Tulin (Polish Angel), Stan Pinto (Czech Angel), Clive Welsh (Irish Angel), Jack Falk (Golden Angel), Gil Guerrero (Black Angel), and Jean Noble (Lady Angel). Tillet competed against Tor Johnson, who was billed as The Swedish Angel on those occasions.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

By 1945, Tillet's health began to fail and he was no longer advertised as unstoppable. In his final wrestling match, in Singapore on February 14, 1953, working The [[National Wrestling Alliance]] Mid South Area then known as [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Tri-State]] and owned by [[Leroy McGuirk]] he agreed to lose to [[Bert Assirati]].&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

In 1950, Chicago sculptor [[Louis Linck]] befriended Tillet and made a series of plaster busts commemorating him for his wrestling career. One of the busts is in Chicago’s [[International Museum of Surgical Science]].

== Death ==
Tillet died on September 4, 1954, in Chicago, from [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; Tillet is buried at Lithuanian National Cemetery in [[Justice, Illinois]], [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of [[Chicago]].

'''''Travancore State Manual''''' was a publication of the erstwhile Travancore kingdom, written and published under the statutory command of the king of Travancore. Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the South Asian Subcontinent (currently consisting of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh), on its western side. 
''Travancore State Manual'' was written by V. Nagam Aiya, who was then working as the Dewan Peishcar in Travancore government service. 

The section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by Harold S. Ferguson Esq. F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: "a subject upon which he is an authority having spent nearly the whole of his life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum."

== The writing ==

V Nagam Aiya mentions that he was commanded by His Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the ''Travancore State Manual'' with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule.  However, he also mentions that the idea had been ‘broached’ to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier.  At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon.  Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan himself retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped. 

However, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901.  Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of ‘encyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press’. 

It might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work.  He started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904. 

== Contents ==

The ''Travancore State Manual'' is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place.  It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there. 

Detailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes,  rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees,  and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, ‘Archaeology’, ‘Fauna’, census and population, language, economic condition  and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound.
There are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. 
The latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom.  The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend.  This legend is also mentioned in great detail.  Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. 

Mentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. 

Then the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. 

There is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings  and kingdoms north of Travancore, small-time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. 

Velu Thampi Dalawa’s rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy.  The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations.  

'''QUOTE''': Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. '''END of QUOTE'''. 

'''QUOTE''': His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. '''END of QUOTE'''.

All rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal’s (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.

== Problems with the contents ==

From the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance.  The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner.  

The writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading. 

The various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty. 

The general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste-based in mentioned in raw words. 
The lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner. 

The next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent.  In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus: 

'''QUOTE''': ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State’ of India '''END OF QUOTE'''

King Marthanda Varma’s words on his deathbed: '''QUOTE''': That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association." '''END OF QUOTE''' is also mentioned in the book. 

These kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency. 

Another item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom. Enough and more historical incidences are mentioned that point to the fact that this social upheaval was the handiwork of the English Missionaries from the London Missionary Society.  Beyond that it is seen mentioned that each time such social problems happened, the English officials from Madras exerted pressure on the raja family to give the freedom that was demanded by the lower castes. 

However, Nagam Aiya does hint that the English rulers did not understand the social issues correctly. That even when the lower castes were given some freedom that had not been traditionally given to them, they used the occasion to go beyond what was allowed, and create social problems and rioting.
The history of such incidences could more or less deprive the claims of some lower castes leaders that they were the persons who had spearheaded the social revolution in Travancore. 

Another item that can be actively disliked is the statement that Malayalam, the erstwhile language of Travancore kingdom, and currently the state language of Kerala, is of very recent origin. 

'''QUOTE''': Another fact disclosed by the statements already given is that the language of most of the inscriptions is Tamil. The reason here is equally simple. Malayalam as a national language is not very old. Its resemblance to old Tamil is so patent that one could hardly help concluding that Malayalam is nothing more than old Tamil with a good admixture of Sanskrit words. '''END of QUOTE'''.

In fact, there is a strong hint that the actual antiquity of Travancore is Tamil. Almost all the stone inscriptions mentioned in the book are in Tamil, with a few in Sanskrit. 

Sultan Tippu (Tipu Sulthaan), who is revered by some as a great freedom fighter, is not mentioned in the superlative.
