[[File:Self-propelled laser system 1K17 Szhatie.jpg|thumb|250px|A preserved 1K17 Szhatie.]]

The '''1K17 Szhatie''' (Russian: 1К17 Сжатие — "Compression") is a self-propelled [[Laser weapon|laser]] vehicle of Soviet origin. The platform uses a [[2S19 Msta|Msta-S]] chassis with a battery of laser projectors mounted in the turret. It was developed by the [[Soviet Union]] in order to disable the optical-electronic equipment of enemy missiles, ground and aerial vehicles.

==History==
The 1K17 Szhatie was developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the Soviet Union attempted to keep the plans secret, the Pentagon managed to obtain drawings from defectors. Western intelligence services code named it the Stiletto. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the development of the Szhatie was abandoned, as the development and manufacturing of the laser projection system had become too expensive and unnecessary. Two of these "tanks" were tested, with one being scrapped and the other being displayed in the Army Technology Museum near Moscow, but without its laser projector.

The Russian Armed Forces already have been commissioned some types of laser weaponry, Russian Deputy Defense Minister [[Yuri Borisov]] said on 2 August 2016. These might be laser systems for jamming tank armament command systems or air defence/anti-missile systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/russia/20160807/1044027427/russia-laser-weapons.html|title=Russia’s Ray Guns: The Military Capability of Moscow’s Secret Laser Weapons|first=|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/military/20160802/1043869562/russia-laser-weapons.html|title=Future is Here: Russian Army Already Uses Several Types of Laser Weaponry|first=|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/military/201803031062186741-what-russias-new-laser-is-for/|title=Nuclear-Powered Anti-Missile System?

==Design==
The "tank" used an intense laser beam to disable the optical-electronic equipment of the enemy vehicles. This was created by focusing light through 30 kg of artificial rubies which made the whole system very expensive to produce. The optics that produced the laser were placed at the end of a silver coated spiral which helped amplify the beam and increase convergence. The energy to power the laser was provided by a generator and an auxiliary battery system. The lenses themselves were able to operate in different environments by moving metal caps closer to protect the lens. It was also equipped with a 12.7mm [[NSV machine gun]] to defend itself against attacks by infantry and air.

A similar laser system was also developed around the same time named "Sangvin", which was based on the [[ZSU-23-4]] self-propelled anti-aircraft gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://army-news.ru/2011/12/boevye-kvantovye-generatory-sssr/|title=Боевые квантовые генераторы СССР|last=|first=|date=|website=army-news.ru|publisher=Армейский вестник|language=ru-RU|trans-title=Military quantum generators of the USSR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski''' ({{lang-ru|Анатолий Петрович Бугорский}} ''Anatoly Petrovich Bugorsky''), born 25 June 1942, is a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[scientist]] who was struck by a [[particle accelerator]] beam in 1978.&lt;ref name="wired_future_ruins"&gt;{{cite web

== Accident ==
As a researcher at the [[Institute for High Energy Physics]] in [[Protvino]], Bugorski worked with the largest Soviet [[particle accelerator]], the [[U-70 (synchrotron)|U-70]] [[synchrotron]].

&lt;/ref&gt;
On 13 July 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when the safety mechanisms failed. Bugorski was leaning over the equipment when he stuck his head in the path of the 76 GeV [[proton beam]]. Reportedly, he saw the flash "brighter than a thousand suns" but did not feel any pain.&lt;ref name="wired_future_ruins" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The left half of Bugorski's face swelled up beyond recognition and, over the next several days, the skin started to peel, revealing the path that the proton beam (moving near the [[speed of light]]) had burned through parts of his face, his bone and the brain tissue underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/what-happens-when-you-stick-your-head-into-a-particle-a-1171981874 |title=What Happens When You Stick Your Head Into a Particle Accelerator  |last=Hiskey |first=Daven |date=August 20, 2013 |website= |publisher=Gizmodo |access-date=December 3, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation, Bugorski was taken to a clinic in [[Moscow]] where the doctors could observe his expected demise. However, Bugorski survived and even completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity, but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly.&lt;ref name="gd-info_km_ru_personal" /&gt; Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear, save a moderate case of [[tinnitus]]. The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves.&lt;ref name="wired_future_ruins" /&gt; He was able to function well, except for the fact that he had occasional [[complex partial seizure]]s and rare [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s.

Bugorski continued to work in science and held the post of coordinator of physics experiments.&lt;ref name="gd-info_km_ru_personal" /&gt; Because of the [[Soviet Union]]'s policy of maintaining secrecy on [[nuclear power]]-related issues, Bugorski did not speak about the accident for over a decade. He continued going to the Moscow radiation clinic twice a year for examinations and to meet with other nuclear-accident victims. He was described as "a [[poster boy]] for Soviet and [[Russia]]n radiation medicine".&lt;ref name="wired_future_ruins" /&gt; In 1996, he applied unsuccessfully for disabled status to receive free [[epilepsy]] medication. Bugorski showed interest in making himself available for study to [[Western world|Western]] researchers but could not afford to leave [[Protvino]].&lt;ref name="wired_future_ruins" /&gt;

Bugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna, and they have a son, Peter.&lt;ref name="gd-info_km_ru_personal" /&gt;

On the evening of 30 November 1961, '''Ansett-ANA Flight 325''', a service from [[Sydney]] to [[Canberra]], Australia, operated by a [[Vickers Viscount]] propliner, broke up mid-air and crashed shortly after takeoff, when it encountered a severe [[thunderstorm]]. All 15 people on board were killed.

Radio contact was lost about 9 minutes after takeoff, but no reports of a crash were initially received by the authorities. The next day, wreckage and a [[Oil spill|fuel slick]] were found on the surface of [[Botany Bay]], Sydney. The aircraft had been drawn into a thunderstorm and subjected to extreme turbulence. It had broken up and crashed into Botany Bay less than {{convert|3|mi|km}} from where it took off.&lt;ref name=Yeend&gt;[http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Vickers%20Viscount%20VH-TVC%20crash%20Botany%20Bay.htm The Loss of Viscount VH-TVC in Botany Bay] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VVN&gt;[http://www.vickersviscount.net/Index/VickersViscount046History.aspx Vickers Viscount Network] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASN&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19611130-1 Aviation Safety Network] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of Flight 325 was the first fatal accident suffered by Ansett since commencement of operations as [[Ansett Australia#History|Ansett Airways Pty Ltd]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=MJ179&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The flight==
[[File:TVC.pdf|thumb|250px|right|Record of talk in Sydney Airport control tower on the night of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|pp=4–6, 26, 35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount [[Aircraft registration#List of countries/regions and their registration prefixes and patterns|registered VH-TVC]] "John Oxley", took off from [[Sydney airport]] on [[Runway#Orientation and dimensions|runway 07]] at 7:17&amp;nbsp;pm local time for a scheduled {{convert|128|nmi|km|abbr=on}} passenger flight to Canberra. The aircraft was being leased from Trans-Australia Airlines in exchange for a DC-6B aircraft. On board were the pilot, Stan Lindsay; co-pilot, Ben Costello; two [[Flight attendant|air hostesses]], Aileen Keldie&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Margaret (1996). [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/keldie-aileen-margaret-10669 Keldie, Aileen Margaret (1936–1961)] ''Australian Dictionary of Biography''. Retrieved 5 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Elizabeth Hardy; and eleven passengers.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA&gt;[http://www.aussieairliners.org/viscount/vh-tvc/vhtvc.html Aussieairliners] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of takeoff there was a severe thunderstorm with very heavy rain to the south of the airport and another to the north. Above Sydney airport there was cloud at about {{convert|800|ft|-1}} but no thunderstorm activity. Flight 325 was observed to enter cloud shortly after take off.&lt;ref name=S22&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five other aircraft took off while this [[meteorological]] situation existed.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;

Flight 325 was directed to take-off and continue heading east towards the [[Tasman Sea]] until reaching an [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]] of {{convert|3000|ft|-1}}, turn around and fly west to a [[Non-directional beacon|radio navigation aid]] {{convert|6+1/2|mi}} west of the airport{{#tag:ref|[[Padstow, New South Wales|Padstow]] locator beacon.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;|group=Note}} and then turn south-west for Canberra. The crew were to ensure they passed over the airport no lower than {{convert|5000|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;

Five minutes after takeoff the crew advised they had reached {{convert|6000|ft|-1}}. About 3½ minutes later, Sydney [[air traffic control]] called Flight 325 with a routine request for information but received no reply. No further radio communication was received from Flight 325 so when it did not arrive at [[Canberra airport]] authorities knew it had suffered an accident. An air search was planned to commence at dawn.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105854227 "Airliner Believed Down In Sea"] ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' – 1 December 1961, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 9 minutes after takeoff the outer section of the [[Starboard|right]] wing{{#tag:ref|The wing spar broke at station 323, slightly outboard of the No. 4 engine. The outer section of the right wing, including the wingtip and [[aileron]], was torn away from the aircraft.&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt; All four engines were found with the main wreckage in Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=MJ183&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} had been torn away and the aircraft had crashed into Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt; The rain, thunder and lightning associated with the thunderstorm over Botany Bay had been so intense that no-one saw the aircraft or observed anything crash into the water. Accident Investigator Frank Yeend wrote "The weather was so bad that this aircraft crashed in the middle of a major city without anybody having seen it or heard anything that would give cause to alarm."&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;

When it became clear Flight 325 was not responding to radio calls and the aircraft could not be seen on the radar screen in the control tower the Alert Phase of search and rescue procedures was initiated.{{#tag:ref|In 1961 the control tower at Sydney Airport was equipped with an early civil radar system. The operator worked in a darkened enclosure and watched a small screen to see the radar echoes from aircraft.&lt;ref name=MJ178&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  The [[NSW Police|Police]], [[RAAF]], [[Royal Australian Navy]] and [[Volunteer Coastal Patrol]] were notified. A message was broadcast on the radio frequency used by coastal shipping. The Department of Civil Aviation air-sea rescue launch based on Botany Bay made a circuit of the Bay's foreshores. When Flight 325 failed to arrive at its destination, search and rescue procedures were elevated to the Distress Phase. In the hours after loss of contact with Flight 325 no report was received of an aircraft accident so there was general foreboding that it had crashed into the Tasman Sea. At [[Twilight#Civil twilight|first light]] the next morning two [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft began searching the sea to the east of Sydney. A helicopter and several motor launches also began searching Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=MJ179/&gt;

Soon after sunrise the crew of the helicopter reported an item floating on Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=CT2121&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105854369 "Airliner Split Open In Crash"] ''The Canberra Times'' – 2 December 1961, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of the air-sea rescue launch investigated the sighting and retrieved a piece of damaged upholstery. Airline staff confirmed the upholstery was from a Vickers Viscount pilot's seat. Searchers on the beach in the north-east of Botany Bay, near [[Bunnerong Power Station]], found some cabin furnishings and human remains. At the south of the Bay the outer section of the right wing, still showing registration VH-TVC, was found protruding above the surface of shallow water near [[Kurnell]].{{#tag:ref|The outer section of the right wing was located {{convert|1500|ft|-1}} from the shore near Bonna Point; north of Balboa Street.&lt;ref name=S6&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bonna Point is at the western end of Kurnell Beach.)&lt;br /&gt;
{{coord|34.0036|S|151.1994|E|scale:50000_type:event|display=inline}}|group=Note}}  Later in the day Police and Navy divers investigated a large fuel slick in the centre of Botany Bay and discovered the scattered wreckage of VH-TVC in {{convert|25|ft}} of water, {{convert|1.6|mi}} north of the outer section of the right wing.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ179/&gt;&lt;ref name=S6/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ180&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft had crashed {{convert|2.8|mi}} south-east of Sydney airport.{{#tag:ref|The main wreckage was located from Sydney airport on a bearing of 140° (magnetic.)&lt;ref name=S48&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was {{convert|8350|ft}} north of, and {{convert|100|ft}} east of, the outer section of the right wing.&lt;ref name=S15/&gt;&lt;ref name=S7&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{coord|33.9807|S|151.1998|E|scale:50000_type:event|display=inline}}|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=S48/&gt;

The Royal Australian Navy sent a team of [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|clearance divers]] and ''HMAS Kimbla'', a [[boom defence vessel]], to Botany Bay and brought the main wreckage of VH-TVC to the surface. After a week ''Kimbla'' was replaced by ''HMAS Walrus'', a smaller workboat from which the Navy divers worked for many weeks, locating and recovering many smaller pieces of wreckage.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ180/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT1813&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104920160 "Vital Plane Parts Found"] ''The Canberra Times'' – 18 January 1962, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The right [[tailplane]] was missing from the main wreckage. Navy divers eventually found the missing parts of the tailplane close to where the outer section of the right wing was found, indicating the right tailplane was also torn from the aircraft prior to its impact with the water.&lt;ref name=MJ180/&gt;&lt;ref name=S15&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous small items, including many from the [[Aircraft engine position number|number 4 engine]] [[nacelle]], were found on Kurnell peninsula, south of the outer section of the right wing. The wreckage trail was aligned approximately north-south with the main wreckage at the north in Botany Bay; and the smaller, lighter items at the south on Kurnell peninsula.&lt;ref name=S15/&gt;

The aircraft was not equipped with a [[flight data recorder]] or [[cockpit voice recorder]] so it was important that as much as possible of the wreckage should be recovered and examined.{{#tag:ref|In November 1960, after Mr Justice Spicer's investigation of the fatal crash of Fokker Friendship [[Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538]] he recommended flight data recorders should be installed in all turbine-powered airline aircraft registered in Australia.

The top section of the [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] was not found during the recovery of the wreckage. Twelve years after the accident the missing section was found in shallow water in Botany Bay, near Kurnell Beach.{{#tag:ref|The missing section of rudder was found by a Kurnell resident on 2 March 1974.&lt;ref name=MJ186&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=MJ186/&gt;

As pieces of wreckage from VH-TVC were progressively recovered from Botany Bay they were laid out in a hangar at Sydney airport to allow investigators to search for the cause of the accident. The right tailplane and the outer section of the right wing had received almost no damage on impact with the water but the main wreckage in Botany Bay showed extensive disintegration, suggesting a very high speed of impact.{{#tag:ref|All four engines were producing power at the time of the impact. The angles of the propeller blades led investigators to estimate that the aircraft struck the water at a speed between {{convert|300|and|400|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=S22/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ183/&gt; Post mortem examination of the bodies showed all occupants died instantly due to impact forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=S7/&gt; No evidence was found of any fault or mechanical failure that might have existed prior to the accident.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ183/&gt;

It soon became clear that the [[spar (aviation)|spar]] in the right wing had broken and the outer section of the wing had been torn away by the airstream. The lower boom (or lower [[I-beam|flange]]) in the wing spar had failed in upward bending at station 323 due to extreme overload.{{#tag:ref|Station 323 on the right wing is a little outboard of number 4 engine.&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt; All four engines were found with the main wreckage in Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=MJ183/&gt; Some small items from the nacelle of number 4 engine detached at the same time as the outer section of the right wing and were found on Kurnell peninsula.&lt;ref name=S15/&gt;|group=Note}}  The wing had been overloaded while the aircraft was flying at very high speed, probably in excess of the maximum safe speed of {{convert|260|kn|km/h}} [[indicated airspeed]].&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt; As an immediate consequence of the aircraft's gyrations during failure of the right wing, the right tailplane had also been subjected to excessive forces and had separated from the fuselage.&lt;ref name=MJ182&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers assisting the accident investigation calculated that for the wing spar to fail in the way it did in VH-TVC would require the aircraft to be flying faster than its maximum speed of {{convert|260|kn|km/h}} and, while being subjected to a severe recovery manoeuvre by the crew, to encounter a very strong gust, possibly as much as {{convert|100|ft/s}}. At the time of the accident investigation, gusts up to {{convert|72|ft/s|abbr=on}} had been measured inside thunderstorms by suitably equipped research aircraft.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt; Investigators were aware of the crash of [[Capital Airlines Flight 75]], a Vickers Viscount that crashed in Maryland, USA in May 1959 after encountering extreme turbulence associated with thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=MJ185&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the wreckage lay in a trail aligned north-south. By making assumptions about the likely [[Terminal velocity|terminal velocities]] of key pieces of wreckage, accident investigators were able to determine the approximate location, height and speed of the aircraft at the time it broke up. They believed the outer section of the right wing was torn away when the aircraft was south of its intended flight path, heading in a northerly direction, and at a height between {{convert|3500|and|5500|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref name=MJ183/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spicer|1962|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed this occurred at a time when the aircraft should have been at about {{convert|9000|ft|-1}}, heading west and passing over a radio navigation aid nine miles away. It was necessary for the investigation to find a rational explanation as to why the aircraft was so far from where it should have been.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;

Accident investigators studied a scientific report titled ''The Thunderstorm'' published in the USA in 1949. This report proposed that where two thunderstorms were separated, edge to edge, by less than {{convert|6|mi}} there was a likelihood of severe turbulence in the clear air between the two. The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature thunderstorms, encountered strong turbulence that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose a significant amount of height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum safe speed or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;

== Board of Accident Inquiry ==
A Board of Accident Inquiry was appointed in 1962 to investigate all aspects of the accident to Flight 325.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt; chairman of the board was [[John Spicer (Australian politician)|Mr Justice Spicer]] of the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission|Commonwealth Industrial Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Browne |first=Geoff |authorlink= |year=2002 |id=A160348b |title= Spicer, Sir John Armstrong (1899–1978) |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board first convened on 12 June 1962, sat for 24 days and closed on 27 July 1962.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT1361&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130577955 "Collapse of Wing In Storm Blamed"] ''The Canberra Times'' – 13 June 1962, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the accident concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The cause of the accident was the failure in flight of the starboard outer wing in upward bending due to tensile overloading of the lower spar boom at station 323, probably induced by a combination of manoeuvre and gust loading when the speed of the aircraft was in excess of 260 knots. The circumstances and available evidence carry a strong implication that the in-flight structural failure was preceded by a loss of control with a consequential increase in speed to at least 260 knots. The most probable explanation for the loss of control is that the aircraft entered an area of unexpected turbulence of such severity as to deprive the pilots of full recovery.''{{#tag:ref|
The Board of Inquiry heard evidence from two Ansett-ANA pilots who had experienced loss of control of a Viscount aircraft in severe turbulence. The two pilots were flying Viscount VH-BAT from Adelaide to Sydney on 3 January 1960 when they encountered severe turbulence at an altitude of about 18,000 feet in the vicinity of [[Mildura]]. The aircraft descended vertically until they were able to regain control at an altitude of about 9,000 feet.&lt;ref name=CT2964&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131725201 "7,000 ft Plunge Out Of Control"] ''The Canberra Times'' – 29 June 1962, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=ASN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT1591&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131779726 "Storm Cause Of Viscount Disaster"] ''The Canberra Times'' – 15 September 1962, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inquiry gave a strong impetus for greater co-operation between the meteorological service and air traffic control; and for airline aircraft in Australia to be equipped with [[Weather radar#Avionics weather radar|weather radar]] to give pilots of these aircraft the ability to avoid hazardous weather.&lt;ref name=Yeend/&gt;&lt;ref name=AM&gt;[http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Vickers%20Viscount%20VH-TVC.htm Airways Museum] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; All Australian airliners were required to be equipped with weather radar by 1 June 1963.&lt;ref name=MJ187&gt;{{harvnb|Job|1992|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/keldie-aileen-margaret-10669 Aileen Keldie – Air Hostess] Retrieved 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beaverboard''' (also '''beaver board''') is a [[fiberboard]] building material, formed of [[wood fibre]] compressed into sheets. It was originally a [[trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/beaverboard "beaverboard." ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Answers.com 11 April 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It has occasionally been used as a canvas by artists; most famously, the iconic painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' (1930) by [[Grant Wood]] is painted on a beaverboard panel.

{{Politics of Bolivia}}

A '''referendum on [[natural gas]] reserves''' was held in [[Bolivia]] on 18 July 2004.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p133 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked five questions on the government's policy on natural gas, with all five approved.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, pp140–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Holding a referendum on the use of the country's gas reserves was one of the first promises made by [[List of presidents of Bolivia|President]] [[Carlos Mesa]] upon assuming the presidency in the aftermath of the [[Bolivian Gas War]] of October 2003 that saw his predecessor, [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]], forced to resign and to flee the country.

The referendum was largely intended to quell the political unrest seen during the Gas War. Fears of an uprising led the Bolivian government to take measures essentially forcing the population to vote (announcing [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and other penalties for those who refused or boycotted) and warned that protesters against the referendum would be [[prison|imprisoned]].

==Results==
Do you agree that the Hydrocarbons Law (No. 1689), enacted by Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, should be repealed?

==Chorus Motors==
Chorus Motors PLC. is research and development company that has invented and developed an improved [[Alternating current|AC]] [[induction motor]]/drive system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
According to a Businessweek company overview as of Jun 27, 2013 "Chorus Motors PLC filed its Annual on Jun 27, 2013 for the period ending Mar 31, 2013. In this report its auditor, Moore Stephens, gave an unqualified opinion expressing doubt that the company can continue as a going concern."&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7628337&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motor types===
The Chorus Meshcon motor is a high-phase-order motor/drive system that claims to offer up to ten times the "burst", start-up, or acceleration torque of a conventional motor and drive of the same rated power and base speed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Chorus motors claims the Meshcon Motor co-opts the [[harmonics]] that limit motor performance and that typically cause motor heating. According to these claims, a Chorus [[AC motor]] can generate far more [[torque]] than its conventional brethren. It is said to do this by changing both the layout of the magnetic coils and the power input waveforms of a standard [[AC induction motor]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Another example, the Chorus Star motor, is claimed to achieve much higher torque densities than a traditional 3-phase motor, but allegedly with no cost penalty. The Chorus Star concept utilizes concentrated, high phase order windings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

===WheelTug===
{{update|section|date=January 2014}}

[[Wheeltug]] is a ground propulsion system for aircraft which puts an electric motor into the hub of the nose wheel to allow for backwards movement without the use of pushback tugs and to allow for forward movement without using the aircraft engines. WheelTug will drive the aircraft with power supplied by the onboard APU (Auxiliary Power Unit). The first version is being designed for the Boeing 737NG with delivery expected in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

The parent company [[Borealis Exploration Ltd.]] signed an agreement with [[Delta Air Lines]] making Delta the development partner and launch customer for the Boeing 737NG version of WheelTug to allow electric ground taxi. The company ''Wheeltug PLC'' has been spun off as a subsidiary of '''Chorus Motors PLC.''' and the expected delivery of the first units is scheduled for 2010.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

WheelTug and Co-Operative Industries completed an Electrical Load Measurement (ELM) test on a B737NG in January 2010 at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, GA to confirm sufficient power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheeltug.gi/press/pr_WT20100201.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818053150/http://www.wheeltug.gi/press/pr_WT20100201.shtml |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheeltug's financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2013 include an audit by [[Moore Stephens]] accounting firm which raises doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheeltug.gi/reports/FY2013/Wheeltug_plc_annual_report_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a company press release as of January 1, 2014, WheelTug's Order Book was 731 aircraft systems, across 13 airlines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20131021-906829.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Catlin Seaview Survey''', later renamed the '''XL Catlin Seaview Survey''', was a major scientific expedition which commenced in September 2012, whose aim was to document the composition and [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|health]] of [[coral reef]]s worldwide. Specifically, the survey aimed to "carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use". The survey was sponsored by the [[Catlin Group]] until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs.&lt;ref name=CSSMain2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Catlin Seaview Survey|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately {{convert|150|km}} of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally,&lt;ref name=CSSAbout2014&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/about|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using image recognition software.&lt;ref name=CSSScience2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Science|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/science|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of {{convert|125|m}}.

This initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the [[Caribbean sea]] and [[Bermuda]]. Other sites are also being explored in 2014.&lt;ref name="CSSAbout2014"/&gt;

==Surveying==

[[File:Seaview SVII Camera.jpg|thumb|The [[Seaview SVII]] Camera, used extensively throughout the Catlin Seaview Survey.]]

The status of surveyed reefs is being documented using [[Optical resolution|high-resolution]], 360-degree [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision.&lt;ref name='CSSAbout2014'/&gt; These images are [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs.

To survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels.

Much of this imaging was produced using the [[Seaview SVII|SVII Camera]]. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human-propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with [[social media]]. 

As mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt;

==Catlin Global Reef Record==

Data from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the [[Catlin Global Reef Record]], which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt; However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.&lt;ref name=GRRHome2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://globalreefrecord.org/home_scientific|work=Global Reef Record|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015''' (COMAH) are the enforcing regulations within the United Kingdom of the [[Seveso II Directive]] devised in [[Brussels]] following the [[Seveso disaster]]. They are applicable to any establishment storing or otherwise handling large quantities of industrial chemicals of a hazardous nature. Types of establishments include chemical warehousing, chemical production facilities and some distributors.

The principal aim of the regulations is to reduce the risks of potential major accidents, such as the [[Flixborough disaster]], that are associated with the handling of hazardous substances. The regulations operate on two levels depending on the establishment's status which is divided into two categories,'Lower Tier' and 'Upper Tier', determined by inventory.

Lower tier establishments are required to document a Major Accident Prevention Policy which should be signed off by the managing director. A top tier COMAH establishment is required to produce a full safety report which demonstrates that all necessary measures have been taken to minimise risks posed by the site with regard to the environment and local populations. The penalty for unauthorised storage can be severe and companies unsure of whether the COMAH regulations apply should seek advice from trade associations and local health and safety inspectors.

The Competent Authorities and enforcing agencies in the UK are the [[Health and Safety Executive]] and either the [[Environment Agency]] in England, [[Natural Resources Wales]] (NRW) in Wales or the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA) in [[Scotland]].

They may be eaten ripe or unripe and are generally [[starch]]y. Many cooking bananas are referred to as '''plantains''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|æ|n|t|ᵻ|n}}&lt;ref name="Wells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plantain|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|p|l|æ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|n}},&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0638170?rskey=l7k7CB&amp;result=2|title=Plantain|date=April 2010|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=17 September 2010}}

Bananas are treated as a starchy fruit with a relatively neutral flavour and soft texture when cooked. Bananas fruit all year round, making them a reliable all-season staple food.

Cooking bananas are a major [[staple food|food staple]] in West and Central Africa, the Caribbean islands, Central America, and northern, coastal parts of South America. Members of the genus ''Musa'' are [[Indigenous plant|indigenous]] to the tropical regions of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]], including the [[Malay Archipelago]] (modern [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the [[Philippines]]) and [[Northern Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agroforestry.net/tti/Musa-banana-plantain.pdf|title=Musa species (banana and plantain)|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa is considered a second centre of diversity for ''Musa'' cultivars: [[West Africa]] for some plantains and the [[Central Africa|central highlands]] for [[East African Highland bananas]] (''Musa'' AAA-EAHB; known as ''[[matoke]]'' in [[Uganda]]), most of which are cooked, although some are primarily used to make [[beer]]. 

The term "plantain" is loosely applied to any banana cultivar that is usually cooked before it is eaten. However, there is no botanical distinction between bananas and plantains. Cooking is also a matter of custom, rather than necessity, for many bananas. In fact, [[Ripening|ripe]] plantains can be eaten raw since their starches are converted to sugars. In some countries, where only a few cultivars of banana are consumed, there may be a clear distinction between plantains and bananas. In other countries, where many cultivars are consumed, there is no distinction in the [[common name]]s used.&lt;ref name="redhead"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Redhead|editor =M.

Plantains contain more [[starch]] and less [[sugar]] than dessert bananas, therefore they are usually cooked or otherwise processed before being eaten. They are always cooked or fried when eaten green. At this stage, the pulp is hard and the peel often so stiff that it has to be cut with a knife to be removed.

Mature, yellow plantains can be peeled like typical dessert bananas; the pulp is softer than in immature, green fruit and some of the starch has been converted to sugar. They can be eaten raw, but are not as flavourful as dessert bananas, so are usually cooked. When mature, yellow plantains are fried, they tend to caramelize, turning a golden-brown color. They can also be boiled, baked, microwaved or grilled over charcoal, either peeled or unpeeled.

Plantains are a [[staple food]] in the tropical regions of the world, ranking as the tenth most important staple food in the world. As a staple, plantains are treated in much the same way as potatoes and with a similar neutral flavour and texture when the unripe fruit is cooked by steaming, boiling or frying.

Since they fruit all year round, plantains are a reliable all-season staple food, particularly in [[developing countries]] with inadequate food storage, preservation and transportation technologies. In Africa, plantains and bananas provide more than 25 percent of the [[Recommended Daily Intake|carbohydrate requirements]] for over 70 million people.&lt;ref name=uncst&gt;{{cite web|title=THE BIOLOGY OF BANANAS AND PLANTAINS|date=July 2007|author=UNCST|publisher=Uganda National Council for Science and Technology in collaboration with PBS – a US Agency for International Development (USAID)|url=http://www.biovisioneastafrica.com/publications/BIOLOGY%20OF%20BANANAS%20AND%20PLANTAINS-BZ%20Jul07.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216042631/http://www.biovisioneastafrica.com/publications/BIOLOGY%20OF%20BANANAS%20AND%20PLANTAINS-BZ%20Jul07.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musa'' spp. do not stand high winds well, however, so plantain plantations are liable to destruction by hurricanes.

An average plantain has about 220 calories and is a good source of potassium and dietary fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plantains|url=http://www.chiquitabananas.com/Banana-Information/type-plantains-bananas.aspx|accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sap from the fruit peel, as well as the entire plant, can stain clothing and hands, and can be very difficult to remove.

==Taxonomy==
{{Main|Banana#Taxonomy}}{{See also|List of banana cultivars}}

Linnaeus originally classified bananas into two species based only on their uses as food:  ''Musa paradisiaca'' for plantains and ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas. Both are now known to be [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between the species ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' (A genome) and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'' (B genome). The earlier published name, ''Musa'' × ''paradisiaca'', is now used as the scientific name for all such hybrids. Most modern plantains are sterile [[triploid]]s belonging to the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]], sometimes known as the "Plantain group". Other economically important cooking banana groups include the [[East African Highland bananas]] (Mutika/Lujugira subgroup) of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAA Group|AAA Group]] and the Pacific plantains (including the Popoulo, Maoli, and Iholena subgroups), also of the AAB Group.&lt;ref name="ploetz"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Randy C.

==Food preparations==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}

===Steamed, boiled, grilled, baked, or fried===
[[File:PreparedPacu VillaTunari.jpg|240px|thumb|Plantains served over fried [[pacu]]]]
In countries in Central America and the Caribbean, the plantain is either simply fried, boiled or made into [[plantain soup]].

In [[Ghana]] of West Africa, boiled plantain is eaten with ''kontomire'' stew, cabbage stew or ''fante-fante'' (fish) stew. The boiled plantain can be mixed with [[Peanut|groundnut]] paste, pepper, onion and palm oil to make ''eto'', which is eaten with avocado&lt;!-- What is this? : and without pork --&gt;. Ripe plantains can also be fried and eaten with black eyed beans cooked in palm oil – a popular breakfast dish. [[Kelewele]], a Ghanaian snack, is spiced ripe plantain [[deep fried]] in palm oil or vegetable oil. In [[Nigeria]], plantain is eaten boiled, fried or roasted; ''[[boli (plantain)|boli]]'' – roasted plantain – is usually eaten with palm oil or groundnut. 

In [[Guatemala]], ripe plantains are eaten boiled, fried, or in a special combination where they are boiled, mashed and then stuffed with sweetened black beans. Afterwards, they are deep fried in [[Sunflower oil|sunflower]] or [[corn oil]]. The dish is called ''[[rellenitos de plátano]]'' and is served as a dessert. In Puerto Rico, the [[Dominican Republic]], and Cuba, it can also be mashed after it has been fried and be made a ''mofongo'', or fried and made into ''tostones, tajadas'', or ''platanutres,'' or it can be boiled or stuffed. ''Tostones'', also known as ''patacones'' are a popular staple in many South American countries.

===Fruit===
[[File:Plantains on white background.png|thumb|Yellow plantains]]
Plantains can be used for cooking at any stage of ripeness, but ripe ones can be eaten raw. As the plantain ripens, it becomes sweeter and its colour changes from green to yellow to black, just like bananas. Green plantains are firm and [[starch]]y, and resemble potatoes in flavour. Yellow plantains are softer and starchy yet sweet. Extremely ripe plantains have softer, deep yellow pulp that is much sweeter.

Plantains in the yellow to black stages of ripeness can be used in [[sweet dishes]]. Steam-cooked plantains are considered a nutritious food for infants and the elderly. A ripe plantain is used as food for infants at weaning, mashed with a pinch of salt.

===Dried flour===
Plantains are also dried and ground into flour; "banana meal" forms an important foodstuff. 

In southern India, dried plantain powder is mixed with a little bit of fennel seed powder and boiled in milk or water to make baby food to feed babies until they are one year old.

===Drink===
In Peru, plantains are boiled and blended with water, spices, and sugar to make [[Chapo (beverage)|chapo]]. In [[Kerala]], ripe plantains are boiled with [[sago]], [[coconut milk]], sugar and spices to make a pudding.

===Chips===
{{main|Chifle}}
{{Also|Banana chip}}
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Plantain chips.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Plantain chips]]]]

After removing the skin, the unripe fruit can be sliced thin and [[Deep frying|deep fried]] in hot oil to produce chips. This thin preparation of plantain is known as ''tostones'', ''patacones'' or ''plataninas'' in some of Central American and South American countries, ''platanutres'' in [[Puerto Rico]], ''mariquitas'' or ''chicharritas'' in [[Cuba]] and ''chifles'' in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. In Cuba, the [[Dominican Republic]], Guatemala, [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Venezuela]], ''tostones'' instead refers to thicker twice-fried patties (see below). In [[Cuba]], plantain chips are called ''mariquitas''. They are sliced thinly, and fried in oil until golden colored. They are popular appetizers served with a main dish. In [[Colombian cuisine|Colombia]] they are known as ''platanitos'' and are eaten with [[suero atollabuey]] as a snack. ''Tostada'' refers to a green, unripe plantain which has been cut into sections, fried, flattened, fried again, and salted. These tostadas are often served as a side dish or a snack. They are also known as ''tostones'' or ''patacones'' in many Latin American countries. In [[Honduras]], banana chips are called ''tajadas'', which may be sliced vertically to create a variation known as plantain strips.

Chips fried in [[coconut oil]] and sprinkled with salt, called ''upperi'' or ''kaya varuthathu'', are a snack in [[South India]].&lt;ref name=upperi&gt;{{cite news |title = The taste of Kerala|url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/the-taste-of-kerala/article4605855.ece |accessdate =3 January 2014 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |first=Ignatius |last=Pereira |date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an important item in [[sadya]], a vegetarian feast prepared during festive occasions. The chips are typically labeled "plantain chips" when they are made of green plantains that taste starchy, like [[potato chips]]. In [[Tamil Nadu]], a thin variety made from green plantains is used to make chips seasoned with salt, chili powder and [[asafoetida]]. In the western/central Indian language [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the plantain is called ''rajeli kela'' (figuratively meaning "king-sized" banana), and is often used to make fried chips.

===Curries and soup===
[[File:అరటికాయ ఉల్లిపాయ పోపు కూర (2).jpg|thumb |right |'''Banana with onion curry''' ]]
[[Curry|Curries]] and [[Plantain soup|soups]] using plantains are consumed throughout the world.

==Plantain dishes==
{{Main article|List of banana dishes}}

[[File:Plantain-Yellow.jpg|thumb|Ripe plantains are used for making ''[[#Plátanos maduros|maduros]]'' (also named ''amarillos'') in Latin American cuisine, in contrast to ''[[Tostones]]'' which are made with starchy unripe plantains.]]

===Alcapurria===
{{main|Alcapurria}}
Alcapurria is a type of savory [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[fritter]]. Although usually consisting mainly of grated green bananas and yautias, they can also contain plantains. The ''[[masa]]'' (dough) is used to encase a filling of ground meat (''[[picadillo]]''), and the ''alcapurrias'' are then [[Deep frying|deep-fried]].

===Aloco===
Plantains are used in the [[Ivory Coast]] dish ''[[aloco]]'' as the main ingredient. Fried plantains are covered in an onion-tomato sauce, often with a grilled fish between the plantains and sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Arañitas===
"Little spiders" in Spanish translation, a Puerto Rican pattie fritter made from shredded unripe and ripe plantains mixed sometimes with herbs, spices and eggs.

===Ash plantains===
[[Sri Lanka]]'s ash plantains called ''alu kesel'' are generally used for cooking. On some occasions, they are used in [[Ayurvedic|Ayurvedic medicine]]. Plantain flower also called as kesel mala (or kehelmala or kesel muwa). Plantain flower (or kehelmala or kesel muwa) is also used to make curries to be eaten with rice.

===Banana cue, Turrón and Arroz a la Cubana===
[[File:Arroz a la cubana.jpg|thumb|[[Arroz a la Cubana]]]]
In the Philippines, [[Banana cue]] is a popular snack. 'Banana cue' may be a misnomer as it is not cooked in a skewer over hot embers like a barbecue. Rather, the peeled flesh of an under-ripe plantain is fried in hot oil over medium fire before it is held in a skewer ready for sale. There are two ways to prepare a banana cue. One way is to fry the peeled banana in oil with some amount of brown sugar thrown in to caramelize the flesh. Another way is to fry the flesh in oil until done. When done, they are scooped out of the cooking pan and placed on a dripping pan to allow the oil to drip, before a generous amount of refined sugar is sprinkled over them. A variant from [[Mindanao]], known as ''[[Ginanggang]]'', is different in that it is actually grilled over charcoal.

Philippine plantains (called [[Saba banana|Saba or Cardaba Bananas]]) are much smaller than the Latin American varieties, usually around 4–5&amp;nbsp;inches and somewhat boxy in shape. They are eaten mostly in their ripe stage as a dessert or sweet snack, often simply boiled, in syrup, or sliced lengthwise and fried, then sprinkled with sugar. They are also quite popular in this fried form (without the sugar) in the local version of the Spanish dish, ''Arroz a la Cubana'', consisting of minced picadillo-style seasoned beef, white rice, and fried eggs, with fried plantains on the side. In addition, there is the equally popular ''[[merienda]]'' snack, ''[[Turrón (Filipino cuisine)|Turrón]]'', where ripe plantains, as well as jackfruit in some variants, are sliced and then wrapped in lumpia wrapper (a thin rice paper) and deep-fried. Turron is then finished off with a brown sugar glaze.

The traditional South American style large plantains (grown in the [[Southern Philippines]]) are now increasingly available in local [[Filipino people|Filipino]] markets.

===Boli===
''[[Boli (plantain)|Boli]]'' is the term used for roasted plantain in [[Nigeria]]. The plantain is usually grilled and served with roasted fish, ground peanuts and a hot palm oil sauce. It is very popular as a lunch snack in southern and western Nigeria, for example in [[Rivers State]], [[Bayelsa State]], [[Cross River State]], [[Delta State]], [[Edo State]] and [[Lagos State]]. It is popular among the working class as a quick [[midday]] meal.

===Bolitas de Platano===
Plantain dumplings from Puerto Rico are grated and mixed with cornstarch, egg, seasoning, parsley, and [[annatto]] oil. They are then formed into a ball about the size of a [[golf ball]]. The balls are first deep fried and then dropped into a hot broth usually a soup with [[pigeon peas]] and ham called [[asopao]].

===Cayeye===
{{main|Cayeye}}
Cayeye, also called Mote de Guineo, is a traditional Colombian dish from the Caribbean Coast of the country. Cayeye is made by cooking small green bananas or plantains in water, then mashing and mixing them with refrito, made with onions, garlic, red bell pepper, tomato and achiote.

Cayeye are usually served for breakfast with fresh grated Colombian cheese (Queso Costeño) and fried fish, shrimp, crab, or beef. Most popular is Cayeye with fresh cheese, avocado and fried egg on top.

===Chifles===
{{main|chifle}}
''Chifles'' is the Spanish term used in [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] for fried green plantains sliced (1 or 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick); it is also used to describe plantain chips which are sliced thinner.

===Dodo===
[[File:Vendeuses de bananes plantain.jpg|thumb|A road side stall in [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso selling Dodo.]]
Plantain is popular in West Africa, especially [[Cameroon]], Bénin, Ghana and [[Nigeria]]; when ripe plantain is fried, it is generally called ''dodo'' (dough – dough). The ripe plantain is usually sliced diagonally for a large oval shape, then fried in oil to a golden brown color. This can be eaten as such, with stew or served with beans or on rice.

In Ikire, a town in Western Nigeria precisely Osun State, there is a special and unique way of preparing plantain chips. This is popularly called Dodo Ikire. Dodo Ikire is made from overripe plantain, chopped in small pieces, sprinkled with [[chili pepper]] and fried in boiling point [[palm oil]]. After frying it turns blackish. The fried plantain chips are then stuffed carefully into a special conically shaped woven basket of about 10 centimeters high. This special dodo can have a preservative quality that lasts up to two months without refrigeration.

===Ethakka appam===
[[File:Pazhampori.jpg|thumb|[[List of Indian sweets and desserts#South|Pazham pori]] – a plantain dish from south India.]]
''Ethakka appam'', ''pazham'' (banana) ''boli'' or ''pazham pori'' are terms used for fried plantain in [[Kerala]]. The plantain is usually dipped in sweetened rice and white flour batter and then fried in coconut or [[vegetable oil]]. It is a very popular snack among Keralites. This is very similar to [[pisang goreng]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for fried bananas), which is a dessert common to [[Malaysia]], Indonesia and [[Singapore]]. It is also known as Bajji in Tamil Nadu.

===Eto===
Eto a popular Ghanaian traditional dish. It is mainly made from boiled and mashed yam or plaintain. For the plaintain option called ‘Boodie eto’, the plantain can be used unripe, slightly ripe or fully ripe.

Culturally, it was the food fed to a bride on the day of her marriage and its best savored with a whole egg, groundnut (peanuts) and sliced avocado.

===Fufu de platano===
''Fufu de platano'' is a traditional and very popular lunch dish in Cuba, and essentially akin to the Puerto Rican mofongo. It is a ''[[fufu]]'' made by boiling the plantains in water and mashing with a fork. The ''fufu'' is then mixed with chicken stock and ''[[sofrito]]'', a sauce made from lard, garlic, onions, pepper, tomato sauce, a touch of vinegar and cumin. The texture of Cuban ''fufu'' is similar to the ''[[mofongo]]'' consumed in Puerto Rico, but it is not formed into a ball. ''Fufu'' is also a common centuries-old traditional dish made in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and other West &amp; Central African countries. It is made in a similar fashion as the Cuban ''fufu'', but is pounded, and has a thick paste, putty-like texture which is then formed into a ball. West African ''fufu'' is sometimes separately made with cassava, [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] or made with plantains combined with [[cassava]].

===Majado, tigrillo, and bolones===
In [[Ecuador]], plantain is boiled, crushed, scrambled, and fried into ''majado''. This dish is typically served with a cup of coffee and [[bistek]], fish, or grated cheese. It is a popular breakfast dish. Majado is also used as a base to prepare [[tigrillo]] and ''bolones''. To prepare trigrillo, majado is scrambled with pork rind, egg, cheese, green onions, parsley, and cilantro. To prepare bolones, majado is scrambled with cheese, pork rind, or a mixture of both. The resulting mixture is then shaped into a sphere which is later deep-fried. Both tigrillo and bolones are typically served with a cup of coffee.

===Mangú===
{{main|Mangú (dish)}}
A traditional mangú from the [[Dominican Republic]] consists of peeled green, boiled plantains, mashed with enough hot water they were boiled in so the consistency is a little stiffer than mashed potatoes. It is traditionally eaten for breakfast, topped with sautéed onions and accompanied by fried eggs, fried cheese, fried salami, or avocado.

===Matooke===
''[[Matooke]]'', or ''matoke'', is a cooking banana dish of the Baganda, now widely prepared in [[Uganda]], Tanzania, [[Rwanda]] and eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. The cooking bananas (specifically [[East African Highland bananas]]) are peeled, wrapped in the plant's leaves and set in a cooking pot (a ''[[sufuria]]'') on the stalks that have been removed from the leaves. The pot is then placed on a charcoal fire and the matoke is steamed for a few hours. While uncooked, the ''matoke'' is white and fairly hard, but cooking turns it soft and yellow. The ''matoke'' is then mashed while still wrapped in the leaves, and often is served on a fresh leaf and eaten with a sauce made of vegetables, ground peanuts, or some type of meat (goat meat and beef are common).

===Mofongo===
[[File:El Mofongo.jpg|thumb|[[Mofongo]], a Puerto Rican dish made from fried green plantains.]]
{{main|Mofongo}}
Originating from [[Puerto Rico]], and essentially akin to the Cuban ''[[fufu]]'', ''mofongo'' is made by mashing fried plantains in a mortar with [[chicharrón]] or bacon, garlic, olive oil and stock. Any meat, fish, shellfish, vegetables, spices, or herbs can also be added. The resulting mixture is formed into cylinders the size of about two fists and eaten warm, usually with chicken broth. 

''Mofongo relleno'' is topped with creole sauce rather than served with chicken broth. Creole sauce may contain stewed beef, chicken or seafood; it is poured into a center crater, formed with the serving spoon, in the ''mofongo''.

===Nagasari===
{{main|Nagasari}}
''Nagasari'' is a traditional steamed ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional cake) made from [[rice flour]], [[coconut milk]] and [[sugar]], filled with slices of [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c_kxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=kuih+nagasari&amp;dq=kuih+nagasari|title=Isi dan kelengkapan rumah tangga tradisional menurut tujuan, fungsi dan ... - J.

Sometimes it is simply called ''kue pisang'' (banana cake).

===Piñon===
[[File:Puerto Rican Lasagna.jpg|thumb|[[Pastelón]] from [[Puerto Rico]]]]
''Piñon'' is a traditional dish from [[Puerto Rico]].  The dish is similar to [[lasagna]], but uses sweet plantains (amarillitos) to replace the pasta layers. A similar dish called ''pastelon'' is made with layers of mashed plantains.

===Piononos===
A popular Caribbean dish which originated in Puerto Rico is called ''[[pionono]]s'', after [[Pope Pius IX]], and is made of sweet plantain forming a ring stuffed with seasoned meat or seafood, with an egg-and-flour mixture covering both open sides of the ring and deep-fried.

===Pisang goreng===
{{main|Pisang goreng}}
''Pisang goreng '' ("fried banana" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]) is a plantain snack [[deep-fried]] in coconut oil. ''Pisang goreng'' can be coated in batter flour or fried without batter. It is a snack food mostly found in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tay|first=Leslie|title=Million Stars Goreng Pisang|url=http://ieatishootipost.sg/2013/03/million-stars-goreng-pisang-do-you-eat.html|work=ieatishootipost.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plátanos maduros===&lt;!--What is the etymology of "maduros"?--&gt;
After removing the skin, the ripened fruit (''maduro'') can be sliced (between 3&amp;nbsp;mm and 2&amp;nbsp;cm thick) and pan-fried in oil until golden brown or according to preference. In the [[Dominican Republic]], Ecuador, [[Colombia]], Honduras (where they are usually eaten with the native sour cream) and [[Venezuela]], they are also eaten baked in the oven (sometimes with cinnamon). In Puerto Rico baked ''plátanos maduros'' are usually eaten for breakfast and served with eggs (mainly an omelet with cheese), chorizo or bacon. Only salt is added to green plantains.

''Plátanos maduros'' are commonly eaten in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], El Salvador, [[Guatemala]], Ecuador, Honduras, [[Panama]], Peru, Colombia, [[Cuba]], Suriname, [[Nicaragua]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and most of the English-speaking Caribbean (called plantain), [[Aruba]], [[Nicaragua]] and Venezuela. In [[Costa Rica]], they are sprinkled with sugar. In western [[Nigeria]], fried, sliced plantains are known as ''dodo'', and in [[Cameroon]], they are known as ''missole''. In Venezuela, the ripe fruit is cut lengthwise, 3–4&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and fried until golden and sticky to make ''tajadas'', a common side dish; they are an integral piece of the national dish, ''pabellon criollo''.

===Tajadas===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nicaragua]] --&gt;
In [[Honduras]], Venezuela and Central [[Colombia]], fried ripened plantain slices are known as ''tajadas''. They are customary in most typical meals, such as the Venezuelan ''[[pabellón criollo]]''. The host or waiter may also offer them as ''barandas'' (guard rails), in common slang, as the long slices are typically placed on the sides of a full dish, and therefore look as such. Some variations include adding honey or sugar and frying the slices in butter, to obtain a golden caramel; the result has a sweeter taste and a characteristic pleasant smell. The same slices are known as ''amarillos'' and ''fritos maduros'' in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] respectively.

In Honduras, they are a popular takeaway food, usually with fried chicken, though they are also regularly eaten at home. They are popular chips sold in ''pulperias'' (minimarkets). In [[Panama]], ''[[tajada]]s'' are eaten daily together with [[steamed rice]], meat and beans, thus making up an essential part of the Panamanian diet, as with Honduras.

By contrast, in [[Nicaragua]], ''tajadas'' are fried unripened plantain slices, and are traditionally served in a ''[[fritanga]]'' or with fried pork, or on their own on green banana leaves, either with a cabbage salad or fresh cheese.

On Colombia's Caribbean coast, ''tajadas'' of fried green plantain are consumed along with grilled meats, and are the dietary equivalent of the [[French-fried potato]]es/chips of Europe and North America.

===Tostones===

[[File:Fryingplantains10-28-06b.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[Tostones]]'' being fried for the second time.]]
''Tostones'' (also known as ''banann peze'' in Haiti, ''tachinos'' or ''chatinos'' in Cuba, ''platanos verdes fritos'' or ''fritos verdes'' in the Dominican Republic and ''[[patacones]]'' in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru and Venezuela) are twice-fried plantain patties, often served as a side dish, appetizer, or snack. Plantains are sliced in {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} long pieces and fried in oil. The segments are then removed and individually smashed down either with the bottom of a bottle or with a ''[[tostonera]]'', to about half their original height. Finally, the pieces are fried again and then seasoned, often with salt. In some countries, such as [[Haiti]], Cuba, [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], the ''tostones'' are dipped in creole sauce from chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp before eating. In [[Nicaragua]], tostones are typically served with fried cheese (Tostones con queso) and sometimes with refried beans. In some South American countries, the name ''tostones'' is used to describe this food when prepared at home and also plantain chips (mentioned above), which are typically purchased from a store.  

In western [[Venezuela]], much of Colombia and the [[Peruvian Amazon]], ''patacones'' are a frequently seen variation of ''tostones''. Plantains are sliced in long pieces and fried in oil, then used to make sandwiches with pork, beef, chicken, vegetables and ketchup. They can be made with unripe ''patacon verde'' or ripe ''patacon amarillo'' plantains. ''Tostones'' in the Dominican Republic are only fried once and are thicker than chips. Although there are local names for ''tostones'' in almost every Latin country, they are still commonly called ''tostones'' in all of Latin America.

===Tacacho===
{{main|tacacho}}
[[Tacacho]] is a roasted plantain Amazonian cuisine dish from Peru. It is usually served ''con cecina'', with bits of pork.

===Yo-yo===
In [[Venezuela]], a yo-yo is a traditional dish made of two short slices of fried ripened plantain (see [[Plantain (cooking)#Tajadas|Tajadas]]) placed on top of each other, with local soft white cheese in the middle (in a sandwich-like fashion) and held together with toothpicks. The arrangement is dipped in beaten eggs and fried again until the cheese melts and the yo-yo acquires a deep golden hue. They are served as sides or entrees.

===Plantain flowers===

Each [[pseudostem]] of a plantain plant will flower only once, and all the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch consisting of multiple hands with individual fingers (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits.

In the [[Philippines]], the plantain inflorescence (particularly those from [[saba banana]]s), locally known as ''puso ng saging'' (banana hearts) are eaten. In [[Vietnam]], the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used in salads. In the [[cuisine of Laos]], the plantain flower is typically eaten raw in [[vermicelli]] soups. A type of poriyal, or peretal (dry [[curry]]), is made from plantain flowers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. [[Thoran]] is made in [[Kerala]] with the end of the bunch (called ''koompu'' in [[Malayalam]]) and is considered highly nutritious. In [[Karnataka]], the inflorescence is used to make sweet and sour ''gojju'', a [[gravy]] dish.

===Plantain leaves===

{{Main|Banana leaf}}

Plantain leaves can exceed two meters in length. They are similar to banana leaves, but are larger and stronger, thus reducing waste in cooking. In Latin America, plantain leaves are lightly smoked over an open fire, which makes them more flexible, and improves storage properties, flavor and aroma. In [[Venezuela]], they are available in grocery stores or open-air markets and are used as wrappers in ''[[hallaca]]s''. In [[Nicaragua]], they wrap ''[[nacatamal]]es'', as well as ''[[vigoron]]'', ''[[vaho]]'' and other dishes. In [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], Peru, [[El Salvador]], Honduras, [[Costa Rica]], Panama, and [[Colombia]], plantain leaves are usually used to wrap ''[[tamale]]s'' before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. Puerto Rican ''[[pasteles]]'' are made primarily with fresh green banana dough stuffed with pork, and then wrapped in plantain leaves which have been softened by smoking. Many rice dishes in Puerto Rico are cooked with plantain leaves as a lid to add flavor and aroma. In Puerto Rico fish and pork shoulder can be wrapped in plantain leaves and baked. ''[[Guanime]]s'', known as Puerto Rican tamales, which are made of cornmeal cooked with coconut milk and other ingredients, are wrapped in plantain leaves. Similarly, in Africa, plantain leaves are dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make ''[[Kenkey|fanti kenkey]]'', a [[Ghana]]ian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.  In Nigeria, ground beans mixed with onions, fish and boiled egg is wrapped in plantain leaves and boiled to make bean cakes called ''moin-moin'' or ''moi-moi''.

Traditionally, plantain leaves are used like plates while serving [[South India]]n [[thali]] or during [[sadya]]. A traditional southern Indian meal is served on a plantain leaf with the positions of the different kinds of food items on the leaf having significance. The leaves also have a religious significance in many [[Hindu]] rituals. They add a subtle, but essential, aroma to cooked dishes. In the Indian state of [[Kerala]], a food preparation called ''[[Ada (food)|ada]]'' is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making ''karimeen pollichathu'' in [[Kerala]]. In the South Indian states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], Andhra Pradesh and [[Tamil Nadu]], plantain leaves are used to serve food during festivals or special occasions. People use the leaves like cooking foil for steaming ''idlis'' (steamed rice cakes) and ''kozhukkatais'' (steamed rice dumplings). The leaves are also widely used as a packaging material for packing food and flowers, although plastics are beginning to replace the leaves for this purpose.  The leaves are similarly used to wrap certain kinds of food in the [[Philippines]] as well.

===Plantain shoot===

After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled like an onion to get a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]-shaped soft shoot. In the South Indian states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], plantain shoot is chopped into fine pieces and used in salads, dry [[curry]] (often seasoned with coconut and green chillies), or wet curry (with yogurt, red chillies and coconut). Plantain shoot is considered rich in fibre, and is considered a very good remedy for avoiding constipation. Regular intake of the juice squeezed from the shoot or of the shoot consumed as a salad is locally considered a cure for various ailments such as stomach ulcers and kidney stones.
This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with [[spice mix|masala]] powder, to make a special dish. This dish is called ''[[posola]]'' in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and a distinct part of [[Cuisine of Assam|Assamese cuisine]]. In [[Kerala]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], a [[thoran]] is made from the shoot for auspicious occasions like marriages.
The peeled layers are used by farmers as a binding rope for packaging agricultural produce, such as flowers, betel leaves, etc. The dried stem peels are slit into fine threads and are used for weaving mats, stringing garlands and wrapping packages. Juice from the stem and the peel have also been used traditionally in first aid for burns and minor abrasions.

[[Vazhaithandu]] is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for the stem and it is used in various soups, stews, stir-fries, and [[koottu]]s.

==Nutrition==

Plantain is 32% [[carbohydrates]] with 2% [[dietary fiber]] and 15% [[sugar]]s, 1% [[protein]], 0.4% [[fat]], and 65% water, supplying 122 [[calories]] in a 100-gram serving (table). Raw plantain is an excellent source (20% or higher of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[vitamin B6]] (23% DV) and [[vitamin C]] (22% DV), and a good source (10-19% DV) of [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (table).

Containing little [[beta-carotene]] (457 micrograms per 100 grams), plantain is not a good source of [[vitamin A]] (table).

=== Comparison to other staple foods ===

==Allergies==

Plantain and banana allergies occur with typical characteristics of [[food allergy]] or [[latex allergy|latex fruit syndrome]],&lt;ref name="pmid9188921"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brehler |first1=R. |last2=Theissen |first2=U. |last3=Mohr |first3=C. |last4=Luger |first4=T. |title='Latex-fruit syndrome': frequency of cross-reacting IgE antibodies |journal=Allergy |volume=52 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=404–10 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb01019.x |pmid=9188921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|year=2002|volume=30|issue=6|pages=935–40|title=The latex-fruit syndrome|authors=Wagner S, Breiteneder H|pmid=12440950|url=http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/content/ppbiost/30/6/935.full.pdf|doi=10.1042/bst0300935}}&lt;/ref&gt; including itching and mild swelling of the lips, tongue, palate or throat, skin rash, stomach complaints or [[anaphylactic shock]].

'''Cotton candy''' (also known as '''fairy floss''' in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fairyfloss |title=Fairyfloss &amp;#124; Define Fairyfloss at |website=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''candy floss''' in the Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, India and Sri Lanka) is a form of [[Spinning (polymers)|spun]] [[sugar]]. The confection is mostly sugar, with small amounts of either flavoring or [[food coloring]] often being added.&lt;ref name="nyt15"&gt;{{cite web  | title =In Coney Island, Weaving a Confection That Tastes Like Long-Ago Summers

== History ==
[[File:MapleCandyFloss.jpg|thumb|Maple-flavored cotton candy at the ''cabane à sucre'' (sugar shack), Pakenham, Canada]]
Several places claim the origin of cotton candy, with some sources tracing it to a form of spun sugar found in [[Europe]] in the 19th century. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person.&lt;ref name="The Food Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lynne Olver |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcandy.html#cottoncandy |title=history notes-candy |publisher=The Food Timeline |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest versions of spun sugar originated in Italy as early as the 15th century.&lt;ref name="cottoncandy.net"&gt;{{cite web|author=Linda Fri |url=http://www.cottoncandy.net/history.html |title=Cotton Candy History |publisher=CottonCandy.net |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by the dentist [[William Morrison (dentist)|William Morrison]] and confectioner John C. Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the [[1904 World's Fair]] as "Fairy Floss"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mcottoncandy.html |title=Cotton Candy |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=February 7, 2000 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25¢ per box (equivalent to $6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1904-dollars-in-2017?amount=1|title=$1 in 1904 → 2017 – Inflation Calculator|website=www.in2013dollars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; per box today). Joseph Lascaux, a dentist from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921. In fact, the Lascaux patent named the sweet confection “cotton candy” and the "fairy floss" name faded away, although it retains this name in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="History of Cotton Candy.” www.fineentertaining.com.  Retrieved June 28, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fineentertaining.com/page/History-of-Cotton-Candy|title=History of Cotton Candy|website=Fineentertaining.com|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotton Candy Fun Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyusa.com/FunStuff/FunFactsDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=967 |title=Cotton Candy Fun Facts |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708114410/http://www.candyusa.com/FunStuff/FunFactsDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=967 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, an automatic cotton candy machine was created which made the product and packaged it. This made it easier to produce and available to sell at carnivals, fairs, and stores in the 1970s and on.

[[Tootsie Roll]] of Canada Ltd., the world's largest cotton-candy manufacturer, makes a bagged, fruit-flavored version called [[Fluffy Stuff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tootsie.com/products.php?pid=148 |title=Welcome to Tootsie – Product Information – Fluffy Stuff Cotton Candy |publisher=Tootsie.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States declared National Cotton Candy Day to be on December 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/12/07/breakfast-buffet-national-cotton-candy-day/ |title=Breakfast buffet: National cotton candy day |publisher=CNN |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704222741/http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/12/07/breakfast-buffet-national-cotton-candy-day/ |archivedate=July 4, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thv11.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=184179 |title=National Cotton Candy Day is Dec. 7 |publisher=THV11 |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Typical machines used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small "sugar reserve" bowl into which a charge of granulated, colored sugar (or separate sugar and food coloring) is poured. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by [[centrifugal force]]. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.

Modern innovations in cotton-candy equipment include vending machines which automatically produce single servings of the product, developed in [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April+2010.pdf |title=VendEver Rolls Out Cotton Candy Machine |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17 |work=Vending Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064024/http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April%2B2010.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lighted or glowing sticks.

== Flavoring ==
[[File:Pink and blue cotton candy.jpg|thumb|Pink and blue cotton candy]]
The source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is first white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring can transform the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white.   In the US, so-called 'floss sugar' is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate – 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla'{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy also comes out purple, when mixed, making a significant favorite at fairs.   Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949, and since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton-candy machines and much of the floss sugar in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1738/who-invented-cotton-candy |title=Who invented cotton candy? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2000-02-07 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than 'blue', the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow ("cotton-candy flavored ice cream") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy that people typically only get to experience on vacation or holidays.  Pink [[bubble gum]] went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and 'bubble gum flavor' often shows up in the same product categories as 'cotton candy flavor'.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Machines ==
In 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, the creations and innovations of this machine have become greater and greater. They range in sizes from counter-top accessible to party and carnival size. Modern machines that are made for commercial use can hold up to {{convert|3|lbs}} of sugar and have compartments for storage of extra flavors. The rotating bowl at the top spins at 3,450 revolutions per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venzon |first=Christine |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/cotton-candy3.htm |title=How Stuff Works Inc.

'''Fiber crops''' are field crops grown for their [[fibre|fiber]]s, which are traditionally used to make [[paper]], cloth, or rope. They are organized into 3 main groups—textile fibers (used in production of cloth), cordage fibers (used in production of rope), and filling fibers (used to stuff upholstery and mattresses). They are a type of [[natural fiber]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fiber crops are characterized by having a large concentration of cellulose, which is what gives them their strength. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in [[viscose]] (used to make [[rayon]] and [[cellophane]]). In recent years, [[materials science|materials scientists]] have begun exploring further use of these fibers in [[composite materials]]. Due to cellulose being the main factor of a plant fibers strength, this is what scientists are looking to manipulate to create different types of fibers.

Fiber crops are generally harvestable after a single growing season, as distinct from [[tree]]s, which are typically grown for many years before being harvested for such materials as [[wood pulp]] fiber or [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark]]. In specific circumstances, fiber crops can be superior to wood pulp fiber in terms of technical performance, [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agripulp.com/index.html|title=Agripulp: pulping agricultural crops|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of issues regarding the use of fiber crops to make pulp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp |title=Nonwood Alternatives to Wood Fiber in Paper |accessdate=2007-10-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708092411/http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp |archivedate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is seasonal availability.  While trees can be harvested continuously, many field crops are harvested once during the year and must be stored such that the crop doesn't rot over a period of many months. Considering that many pulp mills require several thousand tonnes of fiber source per day, storage of the fiber source can be a major issue.These fiber mostly found in leaf ,seeds or in the  body of a tree.Fiber crops are more important in daily life basis.

Botanically, the fibers harvested from many of these plants are [[bast fiber]]s; the fibers come from the [[phloem]] tissue of the plant. The other fiber crop fibers are hard/leaf fibers (come from the entirety of plant vascular bundles) and surface fibers (come from plant epidermal tissue).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants and Society|last=Levetin|first=Estelle|last2=McMahon|first2=Karen|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2012|isbn=978-0-07-352422-1|location=New York, NY|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fiber source was recycled fibers from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

To have a source of fiber to utilize in production, the fiber first must be extracted from the plant. This is done in different ways depending on the fiber classification. Bast fibers are harvested through [[retting]] which is where microbes are utilized to remove soft tissues from the plant and only the useful fibrous material remains. Hard fibers are harvested mainly through [[decortication]] which is where the non-fibrous tissues are removed by hand or machine. Lastly, surface fibers are harvested through [[ginning]] which is where a machine removes the fibers from other plant material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">The '''Fineness modulus''' ('''FM''') is an empirical figure obtained by adding the total percentage of the sample of an [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] retained on each of a specified series of [[sieves]], and dividing the sum by 100. The sieve sizes are 0.15 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.6 mm, 1.18&amp;nbsp;mm, 2.36&amp;nbsp;mm, 4.75&amp;nbsp;mm, 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 19.0&amp;nbsp;mm, 38.1&amp;nbsp;mm and larger increasing in the ratio of 2:1. The same value of fineness modulus may therefore be obtained from several different [[particle size distribution]]s. In general, however, a smaller value indicates a finer aggregate. Fine aggregates range from a FM of 2.00 to 4.00, and coarse aggregates smaller than 38.1&amp;nbsp;mm range from 6.50 to 8.00. Combinations of fine and coarse aggregates have intermediate values.&lt;ref name = "WBDGuide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/ARMYCOE/COESTDS/crd_c104.pdf |title=Method of calculation of the Fineness modulus of aggregate |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=1980-03-01 |work=Whole Building Design Guide |publisher=National Institute of Building Science |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fineness modulus of combined aggregates==
Fineness modulus of combined aggregates is always between the Fineness modulus of aggregates combined. it is given by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;http://theconstructor.org/practical-guide/fineness-modulus-method-of-concrete-mix-design/7214/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Explorer''' is a range of SUVs manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]]. Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, it is currently in its fifth generation. Variants have also been marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury Division as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] (1997-2010) and [[Lincoln Aviator]] (2003-2005).  As with the Ford Ranger, it derives its name from a trim package used on the Ford F-Series (from 1968 to 1986). Alongside it, Ford also markets the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, a replacement for the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]].  A specially modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is also available from Ford Fleet for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]]. 

Intended as the replacement for the [[Ford Bronco II]], the Ford Explorer was introduced in both two-door (the Ford Explorer Sport, also sold as the 1991-1994 Mazda Navajo) and four-door body styles, with the latter being the first four-door Ford SUV.  Following the 2002 introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Ford Explorer Sport was discontinued after the 2003 model year.  The [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size pickup truck based upon two generations of the four-door style from 2001 to 2010. It was sold with several powertrain configurations.  Along with two-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive 1991-2010; front-wheel drive 2011-present), part-time four-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive are options.  Since 1995, part-time four-wheel drive has been a 'shift on the fly' system with full protection against being engaged at high speed.   

As with its Ford Bronco II predecessor, the initial versions of the Ford Explorer derived its chassis and powertrain from the [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]], sharing a common chassis through 2001 for the four-door (the Explorer Sport was shared this commonality through its 2003 discontinuation and the Explorer Sport Trac would do so through 2005). For the 2002 launch of the third-generation Explorer, the model was given a body-on-frame chassis distinct from the Ranger.  For the fifth-generation 2011 Explorer, the model range was shifted to unibody construction and into the full-size segment. Though sharing a similar chassis as the [[Ford Flex]] and [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]], Ford officially markets the current Ford Explorer as an SUV, slotted between the unibody-chassis [[Ford Escape]] and body-on-frame [[Ford Expedition]].

The Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 for the 1991 model year.  To better compete against the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] mid-size sport-utility vehicles, Ford sought to replace the Ford Bronco II with a vehicle sized closer to its competitors. In an effort to attract family buyers, a four-door version was developed alongside the two-door (launched the same month as the four-door S-10 Blazer).

As with the Ford Bronco II, the first-generation Ford Explorer shares its chassis and underpinnings with the first-generation (1983-1992) Ford Ranger.  In comparison to the Bronco II, the Explorer is far larger, with the two-door Explorer Sport gaining 12.6 inches in length and 2.1 inches of width; a four-door is 22.5 inches longer and 730 pounds heavier.

As with its predecessor, the Ford Explorer has a large degree of commonality with the Ford Ranger, sharing its front bumper, fenders (modified), headlights, grille, and wheels; with the exception of its steering wheel hub, the Explorer shares its entire dashboard with the 1989-1992 Ford Ranger.  In a major change from the Bronco II, the Explorer was given its own front door stampings.  In addition for creating a four-door layout, the lack of commonality with the Ranger allowed for two major aerodynamic improvements; along with the elimination of exterior drip rails (by wrapping the doors into the roof), the sideview mirrors were integrated onto the doors (rather than bolted on). 

=== Chassis ===
Sharing its engine with the Ranger and four-wheel drive Ford Aerostar, the Explorer was fitted with a German-produced 155hp 4.0L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne'']] V6 as the sole engine offering, replacing the previous 2.9L V6.  A Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]] overdrive automatic transmission.  For 1993, the engine output was increased to 160hp.

Along with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with various configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, powered by a [[Borg Warner]] 13–54 transfer case.  In addition to a manually shifted transfer case, Ford offered "Touch Drive" electronic push-button shifting; both were "shift-on-the-fly" designs that allowed the vehicle to be shifted from [[two-wheel drive]] to "four-high" at any speed and into "four-low" when the vehicle was stopped.  All Explorers were equipped with the [[Ford 8.8 axle]] in either a limited slip differential, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB ("[[Twin Traction Beam]]") [[Dana 35]] with some [[Dana 44|Dana 44-spec]] components.

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the Ford Explorer followed the Aerostar, Bronco, Econoline, F-Series, and Ranger in model trim.  The XL was sold as the base trim, with XLT as the upper range, with the outdoors-themed [[Eddie Bauer]] trim as the top trim.  The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork.  

The Ford Explorer Sport was offered solely on the two-door body style.  Offering black lower bodywork and grille and alloy wheels, the Sport was intended as a replacement for the Bronco II.  From 1991 to 1994, Mazda marketed the two-door Ford Explorer as the Mazda Navajo; the model was awarded the 1991 Motor Trend Truck of the Year award.

The Ford Explorer Limited was introduced for 1993 as a luxury-trim model slotted above the Eddie Bauer.  Largely introduced as a competitor to the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], the Explorer Limited was offered only as a four-door with an automatic transmission.  Distinguished by its color-matched grille, headlight trim, and model-specific bodywork and wheels, the Limited was offered with several model-specific features, including automatic headlights, an [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|auto-dimming rearview mirror]], [[foglamps]], and center roof console (with compass and outside thermometer).      

The Limited edition, added for the 1993 model year, was available only in the 5-door body style and was positioned at the top of the lineup above the Eddie Bauer edition. It featured [[Twilight Sentinel|automatic headlights]], an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, foglamps, a center roof console with compass and outside thermometer, unique wheels and grille, and an automatic transmission as standard equipment. The grill and headlight trims on the Limited edition were paint-matched to the body color, unlike the chrome (XLT) or black plastic (XL) versions on other trim levels.{{Clear}}

The second-generation Ford Explorer made its debut in late 1994 as a 1995 model.  Retaining the same footprint as its predecessor, the 1995 Ford Explorer underwent extensive modifications to its chassis to improve its road manners.  In an effort to better differentiate the model line from the Ford Ranger, Ford stylists redesigned the vehicle, giving the Explorer a model-specific exterior.  As with its predecessor, the second generation was sold in both three-door and five-door configurations.  Rear-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive offered as an option.  

Following the 2002 introduction of the third-generation five-door Ford Explorer, the three-door Explorer became a stand-alone model on the second-generation design; the Explorer Sport was produced through the 2003 model year.  

This generation of the Ford Explorer marks the debut of the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], introduced by Mercury for 1997.  In 2001, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] was introduced, which was a mid-size pickup truck; offered with a crew cab with a short pickup bed, the Sport Trac was based on the five-door Explorer.  The Explorer Sport Trac was produced through the 2005 model year (until it was redesigned for 2007).  

Outside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs.   Due to Japan's strict [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|Shaken Laws]], used vehicles tend to have low mileage with detailed repair histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdrive.ca/cars/view/204|title=Right Hand Drive JDM Imports – RightDrive – Est. 2007|work=Right Drive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104021358/http://www.rightdrive.ca/cars/view/204|archivedate=November 4, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the second-generation Ford Explorer has the (dubious) distinction of being two of the top five vehicles traded in under the 2009 "[[Car Allowance Rebate System|Cash for Clunkers]]" program, with the 4WD model topping the list and the 2WD model coming in at number 4. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikipedia [[Car Allowance Rebate System|Cash for Clunkers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Ford Explorer is based upon the Ford U1 platform shared with its predecessor, adopting the UN105/UN150 model codes.  Alongside similar changes in development for the [[Ford Ranger (North America)#Third generation (1998–2012)|1998 Ford Ranger]], the long-running [[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]/[[Twin Traction Beam]] front suspension was retired in favor of a [[Double wishbone suspension#Short long arms suspension|short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone]] front suspension configuration.  Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components, the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel.     

==== Powertrain ====
The optional engine of the Ford Ranger and Ford Aerostar, the 160 hp 4.0L V6 was carried over from the first-generation Ford Explorer.  To match the V8 engine of the similar-sized [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]], for the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a 5.0L V8 as an option.  Initially available on rear-wheel drive XLT models, the availability of the 210 hp V8 was expanded to many versions of the five-door Explorer.  For 1997, revised cylinder heads increased output of the 5.0L V8 to 215hp.  Following the 1997 introduction of the 4.6L SOHC V8 by the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]] and [[Ford E-Series|E-Series]], the Explorer became the final vehicle sold by Ford Motor Company sold with a gasoline-fuel pushrod V8.  

For 1997, the Ford Explorer gained a third engine, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0L Cologne V6.  Using a common displacement with the pushrod 4.0L V6, the 210 hp SOHC V6 rivaled the V8 in engine output.  Offered as standard equipment on the top-trim Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, the engine became an option on all other versions of the Explorer and Explorer Sport.  For 2001, the pushrod V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC becoming the standard engine in all versions of the Explorer (and the sole engine of the 3-door Explorer Sport).       

In 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time.

A Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with both V6 engines; all V8 examples were equipped with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Mustang, and Crown Victoria).  On four-wheel drive versions, the four-wheel drive system was redesigned for the 1995 Explorer.  In place of Touch Drive from the previous generation, [[ControlTrac]] was an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, with software controlling a multi-disc clutch (in place of a center differential). Along with traditional two-wheel drive and high and low-range four-wheel drive, "Auto" mode allowed software to maintain the amount of torque sent to the front wheels; if the front axle begins to spin faster, torque is shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved.  Similar to TouchDrive, ControlTrac is dash-controlled, with a rotary selector for two-wheel drive(1995-1996), auto, high range, and low range.

While visibly similar to its predecessor, many exterior panels from the 1995 Ford Explorer were changed, with only the roofline and the side doors carrying over.  As part of the changes related to the redesigned front suspension, the entire front fascia was redesigned, with the Explorer gaining model-distinct styling.  In a styling theme that would be used in several other Ford small trucks, the 1995 Explorer was given an oval grille; the headlamps were changed from rectangular to oval as well, wrapping into the fenders.  Depending on trim, the grille and bumpers were painted gray (XLT), body color (Limited/Sport), or chromed.  In contrast to the front fascia, the rear fascia saw relatively few changes, with the rear bumper nearly unchanged.  Along with slightly reshaped taillamps (with amber turn signals), the 1995 Ford Explorer marked the debut of a neon CHMSL (center brake light).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1084360/Ford-Explorer.html|title=1995 Explorer first production vehicle to use a neon stop lamp|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alongside the redesigned exterior, the interior of the second-generation Ford Explorer was given a redesign.  Maintaining commonality with the Ranger, the Explorer was given a new dashboard (marking the debut of dual airbags in an American-produced SUV), a new instrument panel; to improve user ergonomics, the Ford Explorer introduced a double-DIN radio panel and rotary-style climate controls.  

For 1997, a third-row seat was introduced as an option; expanding seating to seven passengers, the design was only offered in export markets.  

For 1998, the exterior of the Ford Explorer was given a mid-cycle update.  Distinguished by the addition of fender flares, the rear fascia was restyled, with larger taillamps (deleting the amber turn signals); to better accommodate export, the license plate was shifted from the bumper to the liftgate; the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version.  16-inch wheels replaced 15-inch wheels (shared with the Ranger).  For 1999, the front bumper was redesigned, allowing for larger lower grille and fog lights.  

The interior was given redesigned front and rear seats, along with second-generation airbags; in 1999, side airbags were introduced (as an option).  Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system.

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade.  Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited.  For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999).   

In contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature.  While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level.  In 1995, the Expedition trim was introduced; roughly the 3-door equivalent of the Eddie Bauer, the trim was discontinued at the end of the model year as Ford reserved the name for the [[Ford Expedition]] full-size SUV (which entered production in mid-1996).  

For 1998, the Explorer Sport became the sole version of the three-door; following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Explorer Sport became a distinct model through the 2003 model year.

}}The third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 (as an early 2002 model). The U152 program began in 1995, with the final design being chosen in 1997 and frozen for production in February 1998, with development ending in 2000. The primary objective behind the third-generation Ford Explorer was to make the vehicle line more competitive in both domestic and export markets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20010326/ANE/103260845#axzz2hlp6op7Q|title=Ford Explorer project leader aimed at a global standard|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with tuning the Explorer for higher-speed European driving, the Explorer was benchmarked to lead against the [[Lexus RX|Lexus RX300]] and the then-in-development [[Volkswagen Touareg]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    
[[File:2002 Ford Explorer (UT) XLT wagon (2015-06-25) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Explorer XLT (Australia)]]
To make the Explorer more competitive, Ford shifted away from typical SUV design, abandoning the use of the Ford Ranger chassis architecture in favor of designing a purpose-built platform.  As part of the change, the Explorer became only the second rear-wheel drive American Ford platform fitted with four-wheel independent suspension (behind the MN12 platform).  In another major change, the third-generation Explorer was developed solely as a five-door vehicle.   Retaining the previous-generation chassis architecture, the three-door Explorer Sport continued production through the 2003 model year; the Explorer Sport Trac four-door pickup truck continued through 2005.     

The third-generation Ford Explorer was marketed by all three divisions of Ford Motor Company: by Mercury as the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln marketed the third-generation Explorer from 2003 to 2005 as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].  

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation is based on the body-on-frame [[Ford U platform#U1|Ford UN152 platform]].  No longer derived from the Ford Ranger, the UN152 chassis was designed specifically for the five-door Explorer and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts.  In a major shift from its predecessors, the third-generation Explorer adopted a four-wheel [[independent suspension]] configuration, never before used on a Ford truck (on American-produced SUVs, fully independent suspension was previously exclusive to the [[Hummer H1]]).  Similar to the layout used on the Ford MN12-chassis cars (1989-1998 Thunderbird/Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII), each rear wheel was connected to the rear-axle differential with two half-shafts.

While the third-generation Ford Explorer was in development during the late 1990s controversy involving the [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy|Explorer and Firestone tires]], the increased stability of the configuration was designed in part to reduce rollover risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/business/explorer-model-raises-doubts-about-safety.html?p=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Explorer Model Raises Doubts About Safety|author=Bradsher, Keith|date=April 26, 2001|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autosafety.org" /&gt;  In another change, Firestone tires (which had caused the rollovers and crashes of the Ford Explorers)  were not made available on any version of the third-generation Explorer.  Ford's AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control) system became available as a standard feature on the Explorer for the 2005 model year.

Along with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive; the latter was offered on the Explorer for the first time.  

Carried over from the previous generation, the base engine for the third-generation Explorer was a 210hp 4.0L V6.  Becoming the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt to the [[Ford Modular engine|Modular V8]], the third-generation Explorer offered a 239hp 4.6L SOHC V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis) as its optional engine.  A five-speed manual transmission was offered for 2002 before its discontinuation; as of 2018, it is the final year a Ford Explorer was available with a manual transmission.  As an option for both the 4.0L and 4.6L V8 engines, the Ford 5R55 transmission was offered, becoming standard from 2003 to 2005.

=== Body ===
In contrast with the second-generation (a major revision of the 1991-1994 generation), the exterior and interior of the third-generation Ford Explorer were completely new designs. While sharing a number of design elements with the 1997 F-Series and Ford Expedition, the Ford Explorer also served as the introduction of a new design theme for several Ford vehicles; the 2003 Ford Expedition, the Ford Freestar, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred would share various elements of the 2002 Ford Explorer design.  Retaining nearly the same proportions as the first two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter in length and two inches wider, gaining two inches in wheelbase.

With the addition of independent rear suspension, several functional changes were brought as part of the redesign.  The cargo floor was lowered several inches, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of total cargo room.  Coinciding with the lower cargo floor, on nearly all models, a folding third-row seat was either standard or an option, bringing seating capacity to seven.  The rear liftgate was redesigned, with the upper hatch enlarged.

=== Trim ===
Carried over from the previous generation, Ford produced the Explorer in four trim levels, XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer, and Limited.  Slotted below the XLS were two major trim packages, Sport Value, Sport Choice, with Sport Premium between XLS and XLT.  The outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer continued production with a two-tone exterior (with a tan lower body); the Limited wore a monochromatic body.

The ''Ford Explorer'' and the ''[[Mercury Mountaineer]]'' were both updated for the 2006 model year on a new frame, produced by ''[[Magna International]]'' rather than ''[[Tower Automotive]]''. Along with this new, stronger chassis, Ford updated the interior, redesigned the rear suspension and added power-folding third-row seats. Also, a [[tire pressure monitoring system]] and [[electronic stability control]] became standard equipment. Power [[running boards]], like the ones from the [[Lincoln Navigator]], were also made available on the Explorer and Mountaineer; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. Unlike previous generations, there was no [[right hand drive|right-hand drive]] option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in [[left hand drive|left-hand drive]] configuration. The LHD Explorers were desirable there because LHD vehicles are considered prestigious in Japan. Moreover, Ford switched to a one-piece rear liftgate design due to the problems associated with the previous generation's design.

The {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0L [[multi-valve|12-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-6 was once again the standard engine. A more powerful {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6L [[multi-valve|24-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-8, similar to the [[Fifth-generation Ford Mustang]]'s engine, was available as an option. The 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission|6R]] [[automatic transmission]], built by Ford and based on a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] design, was made standard equipment with the V-8 engine as well. The five-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] automatic transmission was advanced. It was the only transmission available for the V-6 engine, because the [[Mazda]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was dropped in the previous generation.

The 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award for 2006.

===Model year changes===
In 2007, The Explorer received a few minor updates including standard AUX input on all stereos and optional power running boards,  heated windshield, Ironman Package, XLT  Appearance Package, and heated leather seat package.

For 2008, Ford added side curtain airbags across the Explorer range. Also, the optional satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2008/review.html |title=2008 Ford Explorer Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received [[traffic]] flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2009/review.html |title=2009 Ford Explorer Review and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 model year, Ford's [[MyKey]] became standard on all Explorer trims.

===Ford Explorer Sport Trac===

The second generation '''[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Sport Trac]]''' came out in early 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]]. Unlike its predecessor sold through 2005, it featured the V-8 engine as an option and was based on this generation Explorer's platform. ''AdvanceTrac'' with ''Roll Stability Control'' was made standard on the Sport Trac.

===Sport Trac Adrenalin===

[[File:2008 Adrenalin.jpg|thumb|2010 Sport Trac Adrenalin]] 
For the 2007 model year, the Ford [[Special Vehicle Team]] built the ''Sport Trac Adrenalin'' concept with a [[supercharged]] version of the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine|Modular]]'' [[V8 engine|V-8]], with {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and featuring {{convert|21|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels. Ford SVT said then it was the successor to the [[Ford F-Series#Lightening|F-150 Lightning]] [[sport car|sports]] [[pickup truck]]. However, the SVT version of the Adrenalin was cancelled in a cost-cutting move as part of ''[[The Way Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=109191 |title=Death Row: Ford Pulls Plug on GT Supercar, Lincoln LS and Explorer Sport Trac Adrenalin |work=Edmunds Inside Line |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=October 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624041928/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D109191 |archivedate=June 24, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adrenalin was sold as  an appearance package though from 2008-2010. It had blacked out headlights, black grill, mono color interior, different front and rear bumpers, vents in the front fenders and molded in running boards. It also came standard with 20" polished aluminum wheels, and the fender flares that came on the Explorer and standard Sport Trac were deleted.

The fifth generation Explorer features blacked-out A, B, and D-pillars to produce a ''floating roof'' effect similar to Land Rover's floating roof design used on its sport utility vehicles; a design which Ford previously used on the [[Ford Flex]]. The fifth generation Explorer features sculpted body work with stepped style headlamps similar to the [[Ford Flex|Flex]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], [[Ford Escape#2008–present|Escape]], [[Ford Expedition#Third generation (2007–present)|Expedition]] and [[F-150]], as well as new stepped style tail lamps. The grille features Ford's corporate three-bar design with upper and lower perforated mesh work, similar to that of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Ford Taurus]].

The development of the fifth generation Explorer was led by chief engineer Jim Holland, who was also a chief engineer for [[Land Rover]]; heading development of the Land Rover [[Range Rover#Third generation (2002-)|Range Rover]] (L322) 2005 facelift. Holland also worked on the Ford Expedition (U324) during its initial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32661 |title=Jim Holland: Bringing Luxury Levels Of Content, Craftsmanship To Reinvigorated Ford Explorer, Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524001259/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32661 |archivedate=May 24, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth generation Explorer made its debut online on July 26, 2010. Ford had set up a Ford Explorer Facebook page ahead of its debut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/mashable/20100721/tc_mashable/ford_to_unveil_2011_explorer_on_facebook_1]{{dead link|date=April 2011}} from Yahoo.com (July 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Assembly of the fifth-generation Explorer moved to Ford's [[Chicago Assembly]] plant, where it is built alongside the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS. The Louisville plant, where the previous generation was built, was converted to produce cars based on Ford's global [[Ford C1 platform|C platform]] (potentially including the [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford C-Max]], and [[Ford Kuga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31941 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |date=January 26, 2010 |title=FORD TO BRING NEXT-GENERATION FORD EXPLORER, 1,200 JOBS TO CHICAGO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728215959/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31941 |archivedate=July 28, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Escape, the Explorer will continue to be marketed as an "SUV" rather than a "crossover SUV". It went on sale in late 2010, pre-launch sales had by the end of November 2010 totaled around 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Ford Explorer orders nearly double expectations|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/11/28/report-ford-explorer-orders-nearly-double-expectations/|publisher=Autoblog|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA rated fuel economy of 20/28 mpg city/highway for the  four-cylinder EcoBoost engine option.

===Features===
Available features on the fifth generation Explorer include intelligent access with push button start, remote engine start, power liftgate, power adjustable pedals with memory, premium leather trimmed seating, heated and cooled front seats, dual headrest DVD entertainment system, [[adaptive cruise control]], [[active park assist]], [[Sirius XM|SIRIUS Travel Link]], [[MyFord Touch]], [[Ford SYNC]] by [[Microsoft]], [[Sony]] audio system with [[HD radio]] and [[Apple iTunes]] tagging, in-dash advanced [[GPS navigation device|navigation system]], SoundScreen laminated [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and solar tinted [[windshield]] with [[rain-sensing]] wipers, 20-inch polished V-spoke aluminium wheels, and [[High-intensity discharge headlamp]]s (HID) and [[LED]] tail lamps.

Unlike the Explorer America concept vehicle which only seats five occupants, the production Explorer holds two rows of seating with available ''PowerFold'' fold flat third row seating (like the previous generation) and accommodates up to seven occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature2 |title=Ford – Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers, Ford Vehicles, The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930183135/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature2 |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capability===
The Explorer is available in either [[front-wheel drive]] or full-time [[all-wheel drive]]. At first only one engine was available: the {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|255|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque) 3.5 liter TiVCT (Twin independent [[Variable Camshaft Timing]]) V-6 attached to either the 6-speed 6F automatic or 6-speed 6F ''SelectShift'' automatic.

Soon thereafter, Ford offered the economical {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|270|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque) 2 liter ''EcoBoost'' [[turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I-4 mated to the 6-speed 6F automatic. The I-4 engine is not available with the optional 6-speed 6F SelectShift automatic, and will only be available in front-wheel drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature10 |title=Ford – Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers, Ford Vehicles, The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930183135/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature10 |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/specifications/engine/ |title=2011 Ford Explorer, View Full Engine Specifications |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930195728/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/specifications/engine/ |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Explorer is available with an automatic intelligent [[all-wheel drive]] system inspired by [[Land Rover]], featuring a variable center [[Electromagnetic clutch#Multiple disk clutches|multi-disc differential]] with computer controlled lock.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703727804576017951373275340 |title=The Pioneering SUV Isn't One Anymore |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional front and rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]] are used with 3.39:1 gearing.

Off-road electronics include [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] (HDC), [[Hill-start assist|Hill Ascent Assist]] (HAA), [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and Terrain Management.

Four-wheel electronic traction control (ABS braking) is employed to simulate front and rear [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]] via aggressively "brake locking" the front or rear differentials, transferring up to 100 percent of torque from side-to-side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motortrend1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceDD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1065366_2012-ford-explorer_performance_3 |title=2012 Ford Explorer |publisher=thecarconnection.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the right conditions, the Explorer can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction, regardless of which wheel it is.

Terrain Management includes four selectable modes. Each mode is selected via a rotary control dial on the center console, aft of the transmission shifter.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp brakeover angles are 21°, 21° and 16° respectively.&lt;ref name="fordvehicles.com"/&gt; Minimum running ground clearance is {{Convert|7.6|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref name="fordvehicles.com"/&gt; Standard running ground clearance is {{Convert|8.2|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2011-ford-explorer-revealed |title=2011 Ford Explorer Revealed – Kelley Blue Book |publisher=Kbb.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low hanging running boards are no longer offered from the factory to help increase side obstacle clearance.

Moving to a monocoque body usually has a negative impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional trailer tow package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the trailer tow package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to {{Convert|5000|lb|abbr=on}} of braked trailer. That is {{Convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and {{Convert|2115|lb|abbr=on}}  less than the outgoing Explorer's towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature11 |title=Ford – Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers, Ford Vehicles, The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930183135/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature11 |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/specifications/towing/ |title=2010 Ford Explorer, View Towing Specifications |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117015020/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/specifications/towing/ |archivedate=January 17, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety and security===
Safety features include: Dual front adaptive SRS air bags, dual front seat side impact air bags, dual rear safety belt air bags (available first quarter, 2011) and side curtain head, torso and rollover protection air bags. Other optional safety features include BLIS [[blind spot information system]] with [[Intersection assistant|rear cross traffic alert]], [[forward collision warning with brake support]] [[precrash system]], [[Auto high-beam]], [[Roll Stability Control]] (RSC), [[Electronic stability control]] (ESC) and [[Curve Control]].

The fifth-generation Explorer was the first-ever vehicle to be equipped with inflatable dual rear [[inflatable safety belt]]s. Air bags are sewn into the inside of the seat belts, and inflate with cold air to prevent burns. Ford claims it will be released as an option and to introduce inflatable seat belts on other Ford models eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumors.automobilemag.com/6574402/news/2011-ford-explorer-will-offer-inflatable-seatbelts-to-rear-seat-passengers/index.html |title=2011 Ford Explorer Will Offer Inflatable Seatbelts to Rear Seat Passengers – Automotive News &amp; Car Rumors at Automobile Magazine |publisher=Rumors.automobilemag.com |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 facelift===
[[File:Ford Explorer V facelift China 2016-04-13.jpg|thumb|right|2016 facelift]]
The refreshed 2016 model year Ford Explorer debuted at the 2014 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]], with a redesigned front fascia, hood and lower bumper, standard LED low-beam headlights, and fog lamps that were inspired by the [[Ford F-Series thirteenth generation|thirteenth generation Ford F-150]]. The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the [[I4 engine]]  to a 2.3 Liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 [[Ford Mustang]]. A newly introduced Platinum trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the [[Ford Escape]], an exclusive 500-watt [[Sony]] surround sound system, and a heated steering-wheel. The '''Platinum''' trim is paired with a 3.5 Liter EcoBoost [[Twin-turbo]] V6 with 365 horsepower which was previously only available with the '''Sport''' trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the Summer of 2015. Other than the addition of the top-of-the-line Platinum trim, as well as standard eighteen-inch [[alloy wheels]] on the base Explorer trim, the changes are mainly in styling, exterior and interior color combinations, technology, and power.

===2018 facelift===
The Ford Explorer will receive a second facelift which will include a refreshed front end with revised LED headlights and redesigned LED fog lights plus new exterior colors, new interior colors, and new wheel designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/suvs/explorer/2017/features/design/?intcmp=cmod-fv-vhp-explorer-170411#the_2018_explorer |title=2017 Ford Explorer SUV &amp;#124; Features Designed for Comfort and Style |publisher=Ford.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sixth generation (2020) ==

An all-new, sixth-generation [[Ford]] Explorer will debut in 2019 for the 2020 [[model year]], and is slated to return to a [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] (FR Setup) utilizing Rear Wheel Drive (RWD), as utilized  by all [[Ford]] Explorers prior to 2011. [[Ford]] showed a prototype 2020 Explorer under wraps on display at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show in China. A high-performance '''Explorer ST''' is also planned, joining the '''[[Ford Edge]] ST''' as [[Ford]]'s second [[SUV]] from their '''ST''' performance lineup. The former is expected to be powered by a Twin-Turbocharged [[EcoBoost]] V6 gasoline engine that could produce over 400 horsepower. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/news/ford-teases-2020-explorer-beijing-195434916.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototype of the sixth-generation [[Ford]] Explorer has been seen testing, and appears similar in design to the all-new 2018 [[Ford Expedition]] and Expedition EL. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1052465_2020-ford-explorer-spy-shots#image=100596246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explorer Sport variation==
The '''Ford Explorer Sport''' was a 3-door version of the Ford Explorer, designed to take the place of the Bronco II in Ford's model line, and was produced from 1991 to 2003. The Sport began as a trim level of the Ford Explorer, but it eventually became its own model. It rode on a 10" shorter wheelbase. There was only one Sport, but there were several other trim levels of the Explorer that were available with 2-doors, such as the XL (1991–1997), the Eddie Bauer (1991–1994), and the Expedition (1995). In 1998 the Explorer Sport became the only 3-door trim level of the Explorer, and in 2001 it became its own model, as the second generation Explorer moved on to a 5-door-only 3rd generation. Production ceased in July 2003.
===Fifth generation Explorer Sport===
The Explorer Sport returned to the Fifth generation Explorer however the Fifth generation Explorer Sport has 4 doors instead of the 2 doors of the old  Explorer sport but has a unique engine and styling compared to the regular Explorer

==Mazda Navajo==
[[File:Mazda-Navajo.jpg|thumb|1994 Mazda Navajo LX]]

The '''Mazda Navajo''' is a rebadged version of the first-generation Ford Explorer Sport that was sold during the 1991 to 1994 model years. It was Mazda's first sport-utility vehicle in North America and was sold exclusively in the United States (Mazda's Canadian division declined to market the vehicle). At its launch, the Navajo was sold in a single configuration, a three-door body with four-wheel drive. As with the Explorer, it was assembled at the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]].  The Navajo was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] for 1991. The Navajo was not offered in Japan.

The Navajo and Explorer Sport largely differed in exterior trim, with unique taillights, grille, front bumper, and wheels.  Inside, the two were nearly impossible to distinguish from one another, except for minor changes to seat fabrics, the typeface on the instrument cluster, and the Navajo was given a different design for its steering wheel hub.  Similar to the 3-door Explorer, the Navajo came in two trim levels: base (renamed DX for 1992) and LX.  In contrast to the Explorer, the base version of the Navajo offered power windows, power locks and power mirrors as standard.  The LX added features such as extra interior illumination and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.  An optional premium package loaded up the Navajo with luxuries including air conditioning, a stereo system with cassette deck, cruise control, sport seats with power lumbar adjustment and a pop-up/removable moonroof.

For 1992, the Navajo became available with [[rear-wheel drive]], geared towards buyers who liked the sporty image of an SUV, but did not need four-wheel drive.  Aside from the nomenclature change of the base model to DX (to fit Mazda's naming scheme), the Navajo changed so little that the company reused much of the photography from its 1991 promotional materials for another year.  For 1993, the Navajo received mechanical upgrades alongside the Explorer, such as increased power for the V6 engine and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. Unlike the Explorer, however, the only other change was an optional CD player.  For 1994, the LX model was given 5-spoke alloy wheels.

In comparison to the Explorer, sales of the Navajo were relatively poor and it was discontinued after the 1994 model year. Mazda would not market another sport utility vehicle in North America until the [[Mazda Tribute|Tribute]] (based on the [[Ford Escape]]) launched for the 2001 model year.

==Ford Police Interceptor Utility==
[[File:CHP Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Police Interceptor Utility vehicle operated by the [[California Highway Patrol]].]]
[[File:Ford Explorer 5 Miami Beach Police (1).jpg|thumb|right|Ford Police Interceptor Utility vehicle operated by the Miami Beach Police.]]

Following the end of production of the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] in 2011, Ford began development of a police-service variant of the Ford Explorer.  For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Police Interceptor Utility; as with the related Police Interceptor Sedan variant of the Ford Taurus, the Utility is referred to as a Ford Police Interceptor in lieu of being a Ford Explorer.  

As with the Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Expedition SSV, the Utility is not sold for retail sale and is specifically designed for use by law enforcement or use by other emergency service agencies.  Along with fleet-specific options such as steel wheels and provisions for user-specific paint schemes (such as contrasting doors), the Utility comes with provisions for the fitment of emergency equipment such as radios, [[lightbar]]s and sirens.  To free up interior space on the center console for equipment, the transmission is fitted with a column-mounted shifter.     

The Police Interceptor Utility comes with an all-wheel drive powertrain standard.  Over a standard Explorer, the Utility is fitted with larger brake rotors, more advanced ABS and traction control systems, a more efficient cooling system and other standard police equipment.  

At its launch, the initial engine fitted was a 305hp 3.7L version of the Ti-VCT V6, shared with the Ford Mustang and F-150.  For 2014, Ford added the 365hp 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (shared with the Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Taurus SHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/hot-selling-ford-police-interceptor-utility-vehicle-now-offers-3|title=Ford Motor Company Official Global Corporate Homepage &amp;#124; Ford.com|author=|date=March 13, 2017|website=Corporate.ford.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The California Highway Patrol now uses the '''''Police Interceptor Utility''''' because the current Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car.&lt;ref name="motortrend.com" /&gt;  In May 2014, statisticians R.L. Polk declared the PI Utility the most popular police vehicle, based on 2013 U.S. sales figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140324/BUSINESS01/303240049|title=Auto news - Detroit Free Press - freep.com|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Export sales ==

===UK models===
In the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification – the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black. With the introduction of the all-new platform in 2002, Ford withdrew the Explorer from the UK and [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] market.

===Middle East and Asia===
In the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer is currently available in several trims, all of which have a 3.5-liter V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Explorer 2011-2012 full GCC spec-sheets - DriveArabia.com|url=http://www.drivearabia.com/news/2011/08/24/ford-explorer-2011-2012-gcc-specifications-dubai-uae-gcc/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ford.co.jp/|title=Ford Japan|work=ford.co.jp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001082041/https://www.ford.co.jp/|archivedate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current exports===
As of 2009, American-made Explorer is exported to Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Iceland, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.

As of 2014, the Explorer is available in Ukraine and Belarus.

===Other usage===
Gothic black Ford Explorer vehicles are also used by federal agencies, such as Secret Service for example.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Rollover and Firestone Tire controversy===
{{Main article|Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy}}
240 deaths and 3,000 catastrophic injuries resulted from the combination of early generation Explorers and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosafety.org/ford-explorer-firestone-tire|title=Ford Explorer-Firestone Tire|work=autosafety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tire tread separated and the vehicle had an unusually high rate of [[rollover]] crash as a result. Both companies' reputations were tarnished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/autosafety/article_redirect.cfm?ID=5413|title=Public Citizen Auto Safety|work=citizen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.

Rollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt; The previous Bronco II had already been cited by [[Consumer Reports]] for rollover tendencies in turns.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

The Explorer was cleared by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely.  It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a9399/why-blowouts-happen-and-how-to-avoid-them-15832078/|title=Why Blowouts Happen—and How to Avoid Them|author=Mac Demere|work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer's center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.

Explorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors.  While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McCarty |url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com |title=Ford Explorer Rollover |publisher=Ford Explorer Rollover |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted Ford and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about a higher than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[Mazda Navajo]]s fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved ''tread separation'', in which the outer tread carcass would [[delamination|delaminate]] and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant.

Ford recommended a tire inflation of only {{convert|26|psi|0}} likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

Ford argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to {{convert|30|psi|0}} on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.

Some have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowout was a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="Wards"&gt;"Bad Drivers, Good Credibility – car makers face uphill struggle against public perception", ''Ward's Auto World'', April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle's weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for ''[[Car and Driver|Car &amp; Driver]]'' magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Doron Levin]] column, ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', October 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''Forbes'' magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths are caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ackman, "Ford, Firestone Face Off", ''[[Forbes]]'', June 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Many vehicle injury attorneys dissent from this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psblawblog.com/tire-defects/tire-separation-causes-california-auto-accident-involving-police-officer/ |title=Tire Separation Causes California Auto Accident Involving Police Officer |date=August 31, 2010 |publisher=Panish, Shea &amp; Boyle |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519051428/http://www.psblawblog.com/tire-defects/tire-separation-causes-california-auto-accident-involving-police-officer/ |archivedate=May 19, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tire Tread Separation - 2 Theories of Liability.doc |website=Cdrb-law.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328225419/https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Firestone's allegations of the Explorer's design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required. Its conclusion was that the Explorer was no more prone to rollover than other SUVs given their high [[center of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.gov/affairs/nhtsa01102.htm NHTSA Denies Firestone Request For Ford Explorer Investigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613053037/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/nhtsa01102.htm |date=June 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent introduction and proliferation of [[Electronic stability control#Effectiveness|electronic stability control]] systems have essentially addressed and mitigated this shortcoming.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In May 2001, Ford announced it would replace 13 million Firestone tires fitted to Explorer vehicles.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

===U-Haul trailers===
On December 22, 2003, [[U-Haul]], the largest American equipment rental company, announced it would prohibit its outlets from renting trailers to persons planning to tow behind Ford Explorers due to liability concerns, with no published data to substantiate the claim.&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-01-08-uhaul-ford_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=U-Haul rejects Explorers |first=Eric |last=Mayne |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficial reports from employees indicated that it was due to the rear bumper separating from the vehicle, including the tow hook assembly. U-Haul did not alter its policies regarding the renting of trailers to persons planning to tow behind the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], [[Mazda Navajo]] or earlier versions of the [[Lincoln Aviator]], which are all mechanically identical to the Ford Explorer.&lt;ref name="Mayne" /&gt;  In mid-2013, U-Haul began allowing Ford Explorers of model year 2011 and newer to tow their trailers. All other Ford Motor Company vehicles are allowed to tow U-Haul trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhaul.com/trucks/faq.aspx#equipment |title=Frequently asked questions: Truck rentals |publisher=U-Haul |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">The '''Fuel Economy Reform Act''' was a bill (S. 3694 in the [[109th United States Congress]] and S. 767 and S. 768 in the [[110th United States Congress]]) sponsored by seven Democrats and four Republicans including [[Barack Obama]] and [[Richard Lugar]].  It set a goal of raising mandated [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] fleet standards by 4% per year, approximately one [[mile per gallon]].  The bill also provided tax incentives for retooling production.  Fuel economy increases were subject to the authority of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], part of the [[executive branch]].  Thus Obama and Lugar remarked upon introducing their bill, "Mr. President, we embrace the call upon Congress to improve the executive branch's authority to reform and strengthen fuel economy standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/07/28/gasmileage/|title=Coleman supports higher gas mileage standards|author=Daniel Olsen|date=2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/noteBook/Note_06-S3694.htm|title=06-S3694 on Jul 19, 2006|publisher=OnTheIssues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advisors"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/23/AR2008062301450_3.html?tid=informbox|title=Obama Campaign Advisers Remark on Energy|publisher=Washington Post | date=2008-06-23 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/08/27/barack_qa/print.html|title=Obama on energy for '08|publisher=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These bills were introduced in the Senate, but did not pass.  ''(see [[list of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate]])''  However, according to Obama's advisors, "virtually the exact same set of proposals" were enacted by Congress 18 months later in December 2007, when the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] was passed.&lt;ref name="advisors" /&gt;

'''Garuda Indonesia Flight 152''' was a scheduled domestic [[Indonesia]]n passenger flight from [[Soekarno-Hatta International Airport]] in [[Jakarta]] to [[Polonia International Airport]] in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], operated by Garuda Indonesia using an [[Airbus A300B4]] [[Aircraft registration|registered]] PK-GAI.

On 26 September 1997, Flight 152, on final approach into Polonia International Airport, crashed into mountainous woodlands {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Medan during low visibility caused by the [[1997 Southeast Asian haze]]. All 234 passengers and crew were killed. The crash site was in a ravine near the village of [[Buah Nabar]] in the [[Sibolangit]] district south of Medan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/pk-gai/photo.shtml |title=Accident Photo: Garuda Indonesia 152 – Airbus A300 PK-GAI |publisher=AirDisaster.Com |date=1997-09-26 |accessdate=2014-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515053923/http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/pk-gai/photo.shtml |archivedate=May 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With 234 fatalities, it is the deadliest [[List of aviation accidents and incidents in Indonesia|airline disaster in Indonesia's history]].

==Aircraft==
[[File:Iran Air's Airbus A300B4-203 cockpit.jpg|left|thumb|The Flight Deck of an A300B4 with the FFCC conversion. While modified for two crew operation, the FFCC does not have the electronic instrumentation of the A300-600 model.]]The aircraft was an Airbus A300B4 FFCC, or "forward-facing crew concept." The FFCC model is a modified version of the A300B4 in which the flight engineer station is eliminated, and the relevant controls are simplified and relocated to be positioned on the overhead panel between the two pilots. This control arrangement is similar to the Airbus A310 series, the difference being that the FFCC retains most of the analogue flight instrumentation of the original A300. The FFCC would later be developed into the A300-600 series, in which all elements of the flight deck are brought to A310 standards, including the addition of electronic flight instrumentation. The two pilots aboard the accident flight were qualified to fly both the FFCC and the -600 model, however the adequacy of their conversion training between the two would later be called into question.

==Accident==
At approximately 1:00pm, air traffic controllers in Medan cleared Flight 152 for an ILS approach into Runway 05 from its current 316 degree heading. The crew, led by Captain Rahmo Wiyogo, 42, a pilot with over 20 years of flying experience at Garuda Indonesia and more than 12,000 flying hours, and First Officer Tata Zuwaldi, a former flight engineer who recently upgraded to pilot, was instructed to turn left heading 240 degrees to intercept the ILS beacon. 120 seconds prior to impact, the crew was asked to turn left further, to 215 degrees, and descend to 2000 feet. At 1:30pm, Medan directed the flight to turn right heading to a heading of 046 to line up for arrival into Runway 05, and asked the crew to report which direction the plane was travelling. Air traffic controllers then became confused as to which plane they were talking to, as another flight with the same number ([[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]] Flight 152) was also in the area at the time.

Earlier in the day, another Flight 152, Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 152, was handled by the same air traffic controller. This led to the controller mistakenly saying "Merpati one five two turn left heading 240 to intercept runway zero five from the right side"; as the wrong [[Airline call sign|call sign]] was used, the Garuda pilots disregarded these instructions. The controller, on not receiving a response, queried the pilots on if they heard the instructions; this time the correct call sign "Indonesia 152" was used. The controller then repeated his instructions, though he did not say that the flight would be making its approach on the south side of the runway, or right side. The pilots believed they were flying the approach on the north side of the airport, as was the approach on the approach chart the pilots were using. Thus, when the pilots were instructed to turn right to a heading of 046 maintaining 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft to capture the localizer for the [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] to Runway 05, out of habit – or possibly due to the approach chart – the captain initiated a left turn to a heading of 046. The First Officer was distracted during the turn and did not notice for a while that the aircraft was turning left. When he did notice, he told the captain he was turning the wrong way, and the captain questioned the controller over which way they needed to turn, to which the controller confirmed they were to turn right. A confusing conversation took place over which way to turn, with the controller not having a clear picture over what the flight was doing, due the Medan radar system having a refresh time of 12 seconds.

Without a constant up-to-date view over the flight's heading, the controller thought the plane was continuing left, when it was actually turning right and into high terrain. During this time the flight descended through 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft due to the captain inputting the wrong altitude of 1,500&amp;nbsp;ft. The pilots did not notice this due to the poor visibility from the [[1997 Southeast Asian haze]]. Five seconds prior to the initial impact with trees, the First Officer made a comment about the airplane's altitude. The FDR recorded increases in pitch and engine power, likely commanded by the crew in an effort to correct their altitude. Shortly before the recording ended, the cockpit voice recorder registered the sound of the plane striking trees, followed by shouting from the pilots. The aircraft crashed into the ground at 1:34 pm, killing all 234 people on board.

==Victims==
The passengers were mostly Indonesian, with six Japanese, four Germans, three Taiwanese, two Americans, two British, two Canadians, one Australian, one Belgian, one Dutch, one French, one Italian, one Malaysian, and one Swedish.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

===Passenger remains===
Forty-eight of the bodies recovered from the crash were never identified and were buried in a mass grave in a cemetery outside Medan's Polonia Airport, where 61 victims of the [[1979 Garuda Fokker F28 crash]] were also buried. The remaining 186 bodies were identified and returned to their families for private burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/29/indonesia/ |title=Unidentified dead from Indonesia plane crash buried – Sept. 29, 1997 |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable passengers ===
One of the passengers killed in the crash was Singaporean businessman [[Yanto Tonoto]], the younger brother of [[Sukanto Tanoto]].&lt;ref name="forbes2008"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/07/five-indonesians-039forbes039-rich-list.html|title=Five Indonesians on 'Forbes' rich list|date=2008-03-08|publisher=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatisgenius.blogspot.tw/2011/04/billionaire-with-worst-environmental.html|title=What is Genius|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419161202/http://whatisgenius.blogspot.tw/2011/04/billionaire-with-worst-environmental.html|archive-date=19 April 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

The causes of the crash, according to the official report of the National Transportation Safety Committee  (NTSC), were:

"There was confusion regarding turning direction of left turn instead of right turn at critical position during radar vectoring that reduced the flight crew’s vertical awareness while they were concentrating on the aircraft’s lateral changes. These caused the aircraft to continue descending below the assigned altitude of 2000 ft and hit treetops at 1550 ft above mean sea level."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knkt.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/baru/1997/1997%20PK-GAI%20Final%20Report.pdf |title=National Transportation Safety Comittee |publisher=knkt.dephub.go.id }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report also criticized the airline's conversion training for pilots who fly both the A300-600 and A300B4-FF models. The former is equipped with digital navigation displays, while the latter is equipped with analog equipment. Though both are sufficient for conducting instrument approaches, the captain may have been overwhelmed due to his lack of familiarity with the analog instrumentation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Contributing to the accident was the failure of the GPWS for undetermined reasons and the inadequate vectoring charts used by the controllers at Medan.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
The first lawsuit was filed by Nolan Law Group in Chicago, Illinois on September 24, 1998 on behalf of American passengers Fritz and Djoeminah Baden.&lt;ref&gt;https://w3.courtlink.lexisnexis.com/cookcounty/Finddock.asp?DocketKey=BJJI0L0ABBBFH0LD&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts in Chicago related to many more victims from Indonesia, Germany, England, Italy, and Australia.  The sole defendant in the lawsuits was Sundstrand Corporation (later Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation), the company that designed and manufactured the Mark-II [[ground proximity warning system]] ("GPWS") installed on the Airbus 300.  The plaintiffs alleged that the GPWS was defectively designed, that the manufacturer was aware of its deficiencies in mountainous terrain for over a decade, and had the system worked as designed the accident could have been avoided. Had the aircraft been fitted with [[Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System|EGPWS]] the crew would have had the alarm sound between 18 and 23 seconds before impact; the accident would have been avoided.

The victims' lawyers produced several internal memos from Hamilton-Sundstrand showing that the system had been inadequately tested for mountainous terrain, having been mostly tested on flat ground with gentle slopes. Perhaps the most critical memo was one written by Hamilton-Sundstrand engineer Donald Bateman, who wrote: "Based on recent flight demonstrations ... of the MK II GPWS, I have become very concerned about the Excessive Rate Detector Circuits in the MK II computers. I believe we have a much more potentially serious problem than was first envisioned in 1982. GPWS warnings can be short or non-existent in some circumstances." Bateman's memo went on to say that "the warning time for flight into mountainous terrain and steep descent rates from altitudes above the range of the radio altimeter can be very short and erratic at times ... From our studies, the average escape margin is only three-and-one-half seconds for the typical mountainous-terrain accident scenario." Sundstrand's in-house experts conducted their own after-crash simulations and confirmed that a properly functioning warning system should have sounded alarms about 14 seconds before impact and that the accident would have been avoided if that had occurred.

Nearly six years after the crash the lawsuit was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sep 25, 2003 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/EI25Ae01.html |title=Asia Times |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2003-09-25 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Coyle v. P.T. Garuda Indonesia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/coyl041304.htm |title=Ninth Circuit: Indonesian Carrier Immune in Sumatran Air Crash |publisher=Metnews.com |date=2004-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Coyle filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Indonesian government subsidiary that operates Garuda Indonesia Airlines. Coyle alleged in her complaint that Garuda was liable for wrongful death under the [[Warsaw Convention]]. She also claimed that Garuda, which is wholly owned by the Indonesian government, could be held liable under two exceptions to the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]. She contended that because Garuda was authorized to operate in the United States at the time, the immunity had been explicitly waived under the rules of the [[Department of Transportation]], which requires foreign air carriers to open themselves to suit in the United States as a condition of being allowed to fly to, from, or within this country. The waiver is limited to actions arising under treaties. Coyle also claimed that by selling tickets in the United States, Garuda waived immunity under the "commercial activity" exception to the FSIA. U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones denied Garuda’s motion to dismiss, adopting a magistrate judge’s conclusion that the trip to Medan was "one leg of an international journey" and thus subject to the Warsaw Convention and the explicit waiver of immunity.

On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Circuit Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, rejected Garuda’s claim that a flight between two points in the same country will always fall outside the scope of the waiver. But the Ninth Circuit agreed with Garuda that under the circumstances, the Badens’ trip to Medan did not constitute "international air transportation" within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention.  The facts that the tickets did not reference any international travel, were purchased in Indonesia from a source independent of the travel agent who sold them the U.S.-Indonesia tickets, and were labeled "DOMESTIK" unambiguously established that the flight was not part of their international journey as contemplated by the treaty, O’Scannlain said.

The court explained:
"[T]he crux of this litigation is whether Flight 152 was a part of [the] larger international trip for purposes of the Warsaw Convention...whether it was a component of 'one undivided transportation...regarded by the parties as a single operation'...or just a late-added, purely domestic side trip apart from their international itinerary with its own final destination. The Badens' tickets for Flight 152 are powerful, unambiguous evidence of the latter."

Nor was the court persuaded by Coyle's "commercial activity" argument. For the exception to apply, O’Scannlain noted, the statute requires that the action arise from “a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state...or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere [when such] act causes a direct effect in the United States.” The fact that Garuda sold tickets in the United States did not furnish a sufficient nexus to subject its domestic flights to the exception, the judge wrote. Senior Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez and Judge Raymond C. Fisher joined in the opinion that ended Coyle's suit.

== Current registration ==
[[Garuda Indonesia]]'s fleet of [[ATR 72|ATR 72-600]] aircraft use the same registration numbers as their previous fleet of [[Airbus A300]], meaning that the registration PK-GAI was passed onto a currently-in-service ATR 72-600.

== Dramatization ==
The crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 is featured in the Fifth Episode on the Season 17 of ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' (''Air Crash Investigation''). The episode is titled "Lethal Turn".

== Aftermath ==
Garuda Indonesia still uses GA-152 flight number, but now used on Jakarta - [[Batam]] route operated by [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-800]].

'''Geotechnical investigations''' are performed by [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical engineers]] or [[engineering geologists]] to obtain information on the physical properties of soil [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] and [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, '''geotechnical investigations''' are also used to measure the [[thermal resistivity]] of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, [[exploration geophysics|geophysical methods]] are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.

Surface exploration can include [[geologic map]]ping, geophysical methods, and [[photogrammetry]], or it can be as simple as a geotechnical professional walking around on the site to observe the physical conditions at the site.

To obtain information about the soil conditions below the surface, some form of subsurface exploration is required. Methods of observing the soils below the surface, obtaining samples, and determining physical properties of the soils and rocks include test pits, trenching (particularly for locating [[geologic fault|faults]] and [[landslide|slide planes]]), boring, and [[in situ]] tests.

== Soil sampling ==
Borings come in two main varieties, large-diameter and small-diameter. Large-diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or an engineer to visually and manually examine the soil and rock stratigraphy in-situ. Small-diameter borings are frequently used to allow a geologist or engineer to examine soil or rock cuttings or to retrieve samples at depth using [[#Soil samplers|soil samplers]], and to perform in-place soil tests.

Soil samples are often categorized as being either "disturbed" or "undisturbed;" however, "undisturbed" samples are not truly undisturbed. A disturbed sample is one in which the structure of the soil has been changed sufficiently that tests of structural properties of the soil will not be representative of in-situ conditions, and only properties of the soil grains (e.g., grain size distribution, [[Atterberg limits]], and possibly the water content) can be accurately determined. An undisturbed sample is one where the condition of the soil in the sample is close enough to the conditions of the soil in-situ to allow tests of structural properties of the soil to be used to approximate the properties of the soil in-situ.

Offshore soil collection introduces many difficult variables. In shallow water, work can be done off a barge. In deeper water a ship will be required. Deepwater soil samplers are normally variants of Kullenberg-type samplers, a modification on a basic gravity corer using a piston (Lunne and Long, 2006). Seabed samplers are also available, which push the collection tube slowly into the soil.

===Soil samplers===
Soil samples are taken using a variety of samplers; some provide only disturbed samples, while others can provide relatively undisturbed samples.
* [[Shovel]]. Samples can be obtained by digging out soil from the site. Samples taken this way are disturbed samples.
* [[Trial pit|Trial Pits]] are relatively small hand or machine excavated tranches used to determine groundwater levels and take disturbed samples from.
* Hand/Machine Driven Auger. This sampler typically consists of a short cylinder with a cutting edge attached to a rod and handle.  The sampler is advanced by a combination of rotation and downward force. Samples taken this way are disturbed samples.
* Continuous Flight Auger. A method of sampling using an auger as a corkscrew. The auger is screwed into the ground then lifted out. Soil is retained on the blades of the auger and kept for testing. The soil sampled this way is considered disturbed.
* Split-spoon / SPT Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Test Method for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Split-Barrel Sampling of Soils' (ASTM D 1586&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/D1586.htm ASTM D1586-08a Standard Test Method for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Split-Barrel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). This sampler is typically an 18"-30" long, 2.0" outside diameter (OD) hollow tube split in half lengthwise. A hardened metal drive shoe with a 1.375" opening is attached to the bottom end, and a one-way valve and drill rod adapter at the sampler head. It is driven into the ground with a {{convert|140|lb|adj=on}} hammer falling 30".  The blow counts (hammer strikes) required to advance the sampler a total of 18" are counted and reported. Generally used for non-cohesive soils, samples taken this way are considered disturbed.
* Modified California Sampler.  in the 'Standard Practice for Thick Wall, Ring-Lined, Split Barrel, Drive Sampling ofSoils1' (ASTM D 3550). Similar in concept to the SPT sampler, the sampler barrel has a larger diameter and is usually lined with metal tubes to contain samples. Samples from the Modified California Sampler are considered disturbed due to the large area ratio of the sampler (sampler wall area/sample cross sectional area).
* Shelby Tube Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Practice for Thin-Walled Tube Sampling of Soils for Geotechnical Purposes' (ASTM D 1587&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/D1587.htm D1587 -08 Standard Practice for Thin-Walled Tube Sampling of Soils for Geotechnical&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;).  This sampler consists of a thin-walled tube with a cutting edge at the toe. A sampler head attaches the tube to the drill rod, and contains a check valve and pressure vents.  Generally used in cohesive soils, this sampler is advanced into the soil layer, generally 6" less than the length of the tube. The vacuum created by the check valve and cohesion of the sample in the tube cause the sample to be retained when the tube is withdrawn. Standard ASTM dimensions are; 2" OD, 36" long, 18 gauge thickness; 3" OD, 36" long, 16 gauge thickness; and 5" OD, 54" long, 11 gauge thickness. It should be noted that ASTM allows other diameters as long as they are proportional to the standardized tube designs, and tube length is to be suited for field conditions. Soil sampled in this manner is considered undisturbed.
* Piston samplers. These samplers are thin-walled metal tubes which contain a piston at the tip. The samplers are pushed into the bottom of a [[borehole]], with the piston remaining at the surface of the soil while the tube slides past it. These samplers will return undisturbed samples in soft soils, but are difficult to advance in sands and stiff clays, and can be damaged (compromising the sample) if gravel is encountered. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070328204138/http://lrc.geo.umn.edu/livingstone-bolivia.pdf Livingstone corer], developed by [[Daniel A. Livingstone|D. A. Livingstone]], is a commonly used piston sampler. A modification of the Livingstone corer with a serrated coring head allows it to be rotated to cut through subsurface vegetable matter such as small roots or buried twigs.
* Pitcher Barrel sampler. This sampler is similar to piston samplers, except that there is no piston. There are pressure-relief holes near the top of the sampler to prevent pressure buildup of water or air above the soil sample.

==In-situ tests==
* A [[standard penetration test]] is an in-situ dynamic penetration test designed to provide information on the properties of soil, while also collecting a disturbed soil sample for grain-size analysis and soil classification.
* A [[dynamic cone penetrometer test]] is an insitu test in which a weight is manually lifted and dropped on a cone which penetrates the ground. the number of mm per hit are recorded and this is used to estimate certain soil properties. This is a simple test method and usually needs backing up with lab data to get a good correlation.
* A [[cone penetration test]] is performed using an instrumented probe with a conical tip, pushed into the soil hydraulically at a constant rate. A basic CPT instrument reports tip resistance and shear resistance along the cylindrical barrel. CPT data has been correlated to soil properties. Sometimes instruments other than the basic CPT probe are used, including:
* A piezocone penetrometer probe is advanced using the same equipment as a regular CPT probe, but the probe has an additional instrument which measures the groundwater pressure as the probe is advanced.
* A seismic piezocone penetrometer probe is advanced using the same equipment as a CPT or CPTu probe, but the probe is also equipped with either geophones or accelerometers to detect shear waves and/or pressure waves produced by a source at the surface.
* Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes are used in extremely soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced in the same manner as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.
* Helical probe test soil exploration and compaction testing by the helical probe test (HPT) has become popular for providing a quick and accurate method of determining soil properties at relatively shallow depths. The HPT test is attractive for in-situ footing inspections because it is lightweight and can be conducted quickly by one person.  During testing, the probe is driven to the desired depth and the torque required to turn the probe is used as a measure to determine the soil's characteristics. Preliminary ASTM testing has determined that the HPT method correlates well to standard penetration testing (SPT) and cone penetration testing (CPT) with empirical calibration.

A flat plate dilatometer test (DMT) is a flat plate probe often advanced using CPT rigs, but can also be advanced from conventional drill rigs. A diaphragm on the plate applies a lateral force to the soil materials and measures the strain induced for various levels of applied stress at the desired depth interval.

In-situ gas tests can be carried out in the boreholes on completion and in probe holes made in the sides of the trial pits as part of the site investigation.  Testing is normally with a portable meter, which measures the methane content as its percentage volume in air.  The corresponding oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are also measured.  A more accurate method used to monitor over the longer term, consists of gas monitoring standpipes should be installed in boreholes.  These typically comprise slotted uPVC pipework surrounded by single sized gravel.  The top 0.5&amp;nbsp;m to 1.0&amp;nbsp;m of pipework is usually not slotted and is surrounded by [[bentonite]] pellets to seal the borehole.  Valves are fitted and the installations protected by lockable stopcock covers normally fitted flush with the ground.  Monitoring is again with a portable meter and is usually done on a fortnightly or monthly basis.

== Laboratory tests ==
A wide variety of laboratory tests can be performed on soils to measure a wide variety of soil properties. Some soil properties are intrinsic to the composition of the soil matrix and are not affected by sample disturbance, while other properties depend on the structure of the soil as well as its composition, and can only be effectively tested on relatively undisturbed samples. Some soil tests measure direct properties of the soil, while others measure "index properties" which provide useful information about the soil without directly measuring the property desired.

; [[Atterberg limits]] : The Atterberg limits define the boundaries of several states of consistency for plastic soils. The boundaries are defined by the amount of water a soil needs to be at one of those boundaries. The boundaries are called the plastic limit and the liquid limit, and the difference between them is called the plasticity index. The shrinkage limit is also a part of the Atterberg limits. The results of this test can be used to help predict other engineering properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D4318.htm |title=D4318-10 Standard Test Methods for Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils |work=[[ASTM International]] |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[California bearing ratio]] : ASTM D 1883. A test to determine the aptitude of a soil or aggregate sample as a road subgrade. A plunger is pushed into a compacted sample, and its resistance is measured.

; [[Direct shear test]] : ASTM D3080. The direct shear test determines the consolidated, drained strength properties of a sample. A constant strain rate is applied to a single shear plane under a normal load, and the load response is measured. If this test is performed with different normal loads, the common shear strength parameters can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/D3080.htm?E+mystore |title=D3080-04 Standard Test Method for Direct Shear Test of Soils Under Consolidated Drained Conditions |work=ASTM International |accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Oedometer tests|Oedometer test]] : This can be used to determine consolidation (ASTM D2435) and swelling (ASTM D4546) parameters.
; Particle-size analysis : This is done to determine the [[soil gradation]]. Coarser particles are separated in the [[sieve analysis]] portion, and the finer particles are analyzed with a [[hydrometer]]. The distinction between coarse and fine particles is usually made at 75 μm. The sieve analysis shakes the sample through progressively smaller meshes to determine its gradation. The hydrometer analysis uses the rate of sedimentation to determine particle gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D422.htm|title=D422-63(2007) Standard Test Method for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils |work=[[ASTM International]] |accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[R-Value (soils)|R-Value test]] : [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/ctms/CT_301.pdf California Test 301] This test measures the lateral response of a compacted sample of soil or aggregate to a vertically applied pressure under specific conditions. This test is used by Caltrans for pavement design, replacing the California bearing ratio test.
; [[Soil compaction]] tests : [[Proctor compaction test|Standard Proctor]] (ASTM D698),  Modified Proctor (ASTM D1557), and [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/ctms/CT_216.pdf California Test 216]. These tests are used to determine the maximum unit weight and optimal water content a soil can achieve for a given compaction effort.
; Soil suction tests : ASTM D5298.
; [[Triaxial shear tests]] : This is a type of test that is used to determine the shear strength properties of a soil. It can simulate the confining pressure a soil would see deep into the ground. It can also simulate drained and undrained conditions.
; Unconfined compression test : ASTM D2166. This test compresses a soil sample to measure its strength. The modifier "unconfined" contrasts this test to the triaxial shear test.
; [[Water content]] : This test provides the water content of the soil, normally expressed as a percentage of the weight of water to the dry weight of the soil.

'''Germanium tetrafluoride''' ('''GeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a chemical compound of [[germanium]] and [[fluorine]]. This colorless gas is formed by reacting germanium with fluorine or [[germanium dioxide]] (GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF).  [[Germanium difluoride]] can be synthesized by reacting germanium tetrafluoride with powdered germanium at 150–300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;

==Synthesis==
Germanium tetrafluoride can be prepared by reaction of germanium with fluorine or hydrogen fluoride:
: Ge + 2 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; GeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

It is also formed during the thermal decomposition of a complex salt, Ba[GeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]:&lt;ref name="Brauer"/&gt;
: Ba(GeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;rarr; GeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Properties==
Germanium tetrafluoride is a noncombustible, strongly fuming gas with a garlic odor. It reacts with water to form hydrofluoric acid and germanium dioxide. Molecular decomposition occurs at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=de/&gt;

Reaction of GeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with fluoride sources produces GeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anions with octahedral coordination around Ge atom due to polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;Mallouk, T.

[[File:Stonehenge Heel Stone - panoramio (2).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Southwest face of Heel Stone in May 2016]]
  
The '''Heel Stone''' is a single large block of [[sarsen]] stone standing within the [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]] outside the entrance of the [[Stonehenge]] earthwork, close to the main road ([[Highways Agency]] A344). In section it is sub-rectangular, with a minimum thickness of  2.4 [[metre]]s, rising to a tapered top about  4.7 metres high. [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]] has shown that a further 1.2 metres is buried in the ground.
It is 77.4 metres from the centre of Stonehenge circle. It leans towards the southwest nearly 27 degrees from the [[Vertical direction|vertical]]. The stone has an overall [[Girth (geometry)|girth]] of 7.6 metres and weighs about 35 tons. It is surrounded by the [[Heelstone Ditch]].

[[Mythology|Myths]] and legends of the [[Devil]] striking a "Friar's Heel" with a stone resulted in its eccentric name, ''Heel Stone''. Some{{Who|date=July 2014}} claim "Friar's Heel" is a corruption of "Freyja's He-ol" or "Freyja Sul", from the [[Continental Germanic mythology|Nordic]] goddess [[Freyja]] and (allegedly) the [[Wales|Welsh]] words for "way" and "Sunday" respectively.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  It is doubtful whether any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] standing stone has experienced as many name changes and interpretations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Only in the past three decades have [[scientist]]s used the name ''Heel Stone'' consistently.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 2007, HomeBioGas cofounder Yair Teller observed small biogas systems in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt; Leichman, Abigail Klein. [https://www.israel21c.org/backyard-unit-eats-trash-to-make-biofuel/ "Backyard Unit Eats Trash to Make Biofuel."] Israel21c. Israel21c, 14 May 2015. Web. 07 Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired, he traveled to other developing nations to learn more.
 
Teller, and cofounder Oshik Efrati, acquired many biogas systems from China and India. They installed them locally, quickly judging them to work poorly.
Particularly, Teller and Efrati believed these systems suffered from poor efficiency, unpleasant odors and insect infestations. 

In 2012, Teller and Efrati, now joined by final co-founder Erez Lancer, formally created HomeBiogas.&lt;ref&gt; Rabi, Idan.

==  Partnerships ==

Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, in 2014, purchased HomeBiogas units, distributing them to [[Umm Batin]] Bedouin village. Shortly afterwards, the Ministry purchased 25 additional systems and again distributed them to Umm Batin, and another Negev Bedouin village.&lt;ref&gt; Leichman, Abigail Klein.

Jpost Inc., 24 Aug. 2015. Web. 07 Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning of the Umm Batin program, multiple governments reached out to HomeBiogas. Prominent among them is the Dominican Republic, whose government purchased 50 HomeBiogas appliances in an effort to reduce citizen dependence on wood for heating.&lt;ref&gt; Leichman, Abigail Klein.

The [[European Union]] and the [[Peres Center for Peace]] contracted HomeBiogas to install HomeBiogas digesters in the central West Bank's Jordan Valley in 2015. Approximately 40 digesters were installed, with the European Union providing the 500,000 euros in funding.&lt;ref&gt; Lewis, Ori, and Elana Ringler.

'''Human power''' is [[work (physics)|work]] or [[energy]] that is produced from the [[human body]]. It can also refer to the [[power (physics)|power]] (rate of work per time) of a human. Power comes primarily from [[List of skeletal muscles of the human body|muscle]]s, but [[Thermoregulation|body heat]] is also used to do work like warming [[Shelter (building)|shelter]]s, food, or other humans.

World records of power performance by humans are of interest to work planners and work-process engineers. The average level of human power that can be maintained over a certain duration of time, say over the extent of one minute or one hour is interesting to engineers designing work operations in industry. Human power is occasionally used to generate and sometimes store electrical energy in batteries for use in the [[wilderness]].

==Available power==
Normal human metabolism produces heat at a [[basal metabolic rate]] of around 80 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R. &amp; Spencer, R. 2008. ''Sustainable gardens''. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Melbourne. {{ISBN|978-0-643-09422-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[bicycle]] race, an elite [[Cycling|cyclist]] can produce close to 400 [[watt]]s of [[mechanical power]] over an hour and in short bursts over double that&amp;nbsp;— 1000 to 1100 watts; modern racing bicycles have greater than 95% mechanical [[Energy_conversion_efficiency | efficiency]]. An adult of good fitness is more likely to average between 50 and 150 watts for an hour of vigorous exercise. Over an 8-hour work shift, an average, healthy, well-fed and motivated manual laborer may sustain an output of around 75 watts of [[work (physics)|work]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene A. Avallone et. al, (ed), ''Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers 11th Edition '', Mc-Graw Hill, New York 2007 {{ISBN|0-07-142867-4}} page 9-4&lt;/ref&gt; However, the potential yield of human electric power is decreased by the inefficiency of any generator device, since all real generators incur considerable losses during the [[Energy transformation|energy conversion]] process.

While attempts have been made to fit [[electric generator]]s to exercise equipment, the energy collected is of low value compared to the cost of the conversion equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Gibson, ''Turning sweat into watts'', ''IEEE Spectrum'' Volume 48 Number 7 July 2011, pp. 50-55. {{cite web|title=Turning sweat into watts|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5910449&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5910449|publisher=IEEE Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-powered transport ==
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
Several forms of [[transport]] utilize human power. They include the bicycle, [[wheelchair]], [[walking]], [[skateboard]], [[wheelbarrow]], [[rowing]], [[ski]]s, and [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]]. Some forms may utilize more than one person. The historical [[galley]] was propelled by freemen or citizens in ancient times, and by slaves captured by pirates in more recent times. The [[MacCready Gossamer Condor]] was the first [[History of human-powered aircraft|human-powered aircraft]] capable of controlled and sustained flight, making its first flight in 1977. In 2007, [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] of [[Expedition 360]] became the first person to circumnavigate the globe at non-polar latitudes using only human power&amp;nbsp;— walking, biking, and rollerblading across the landmasses; and swimming, kayaking, rowing, and using a 26-foot-long pedal-powered boat to cross the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guinness World Records|title=Human Powered Circumnavigations|url=http://www.expedition360.com/guinness_world_records_first_hpc.pdf|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdventureStats by Explorersweb|title=Global HPC - Human Powered Circumnavigations|url=http://www.adventurestats.com/tables/hpc.shtml|publisher=Explorersweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-powered equipment ==
Some equipment uses human power. It may directly use [[power (physics)#Mechanical power|mechanical power]] from muscles, or a generator may convert energy generated by the body into electrical power.
[[Image:Shaking Torch.jpg|thumb|A [[mechanically powered flashlight]]. This uses a linear generator and is charged by shaking along its long axis.]]

''Human-powered equipment'' consists of [[Small appliance|electrical appliance]]s which can be powered by electricity generated by human muscle power as an alternative to conventional sources of electricity such as disposable [[Primary cell|primary batteries]] and the [[electrical grid]]. Such devices contain electric generators or an [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] system to recharge their [[rechargeable battery|batteries]]. Separate crank-operated generators are now available to recharge battery-powered portable electronic devices such as [[mobile phone]]s. Others, such as [[mechanically powered flashlight]]s, have the generator integrated within the device.

An alternative to rechargeable batteries for electricity storage is [[supercapacitor]]s, now being used in some devices such as the mechanically powered flashlight shown here. Devices that store the energy mechanically, rather than electrically, include clockwork radios with a [[mainspring]], which is wound up by a crank and turns a generator to power the radio.

An early example of regular use of human-powered electrical equipment is in early [[telephone]] systems; current to ring the remote bell was provided by a subscriber cranking a handle on the telephone, which turned a small [[magneto]] generator. Human-powered devices are useful as emergency equipment, when [[natural disaster]], [[war]], or [[Civil disorder|civil disturbance]] make regular power supplies unavailable. They have also been seen as economical for use in poor countries, where batteries may be expensive and [[mains electricity]] unreliable or unavailable. They are also an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of disposable batteries, which are wasteful source of energy and may introduce [[heavy metals]] into the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Communication is a common application for the relatively small amount of electric power that can be generated by a human turning a generator.

===Survival radio===
[[File:GibsonGirlSurvivalRadio.agr.jpg|thumb|BC-778 "Gibson Girl" radio transmitter.]]
The World War II-era [[Survival_radio#The_Gibson_Girl|Gibson girl survival radio]] used a hand-cranked generator to provide power; this avoided the unreliable performance of dry-cell batteries that might be stored for months before they were needed, although it had the drawback that the survivor had to be fit enough to turn the crank. Survival radios were invented and deployed by both sides during the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://wftw.nl/gibsongirl/gibsongirl.html Gibson Girl retrieved 2012 April 26&lt;/ref&gt; The SCR-578 (and the similar post-war AN/CRT-3) survival radio transmitters carried by aircraft on over-water operations were given the nickname "[[Gibson Girl]]" because of their "hourglass" shape, which allowed them to be held stationary between the legs while the generator handle was turned.

===Military radio===
[[Image:US shore patrol group operating Signal Corps radios.jpg|thumb|U.S. soldiers during WWII powering radio set using GN-45 hand crank generator]]
During [[World War II]], U.S. troops sometimes employed hand crank generators, GN-35 and GN-45, to power [[Signal Corps Radio]] sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Army in World War II, Pictorial Record, War Against Germany: Europe and Adjacent Areas (Paper)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5ss7kbIbesC&amp;pg=PA85|year=1994|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-087334-8|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand cranking was laborious, but generated sufficient current for smaller radio sets, such as the SCR-131, SCR-161, SCR-171, [[SCR-284]], and [[SCR-694]].&lt;ref name="ThompsonHarris1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Raynor Thompson|author2=Dixie R.

Print. Off.&amp;#93;|pages=665–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Visible anchor|Windup radio}}===&lt;!-- Other articles link here --&gt;
[[Image:Clockwork Radio.JPG|thumb|The original Baygen clockwork radio with crank in winding position]]
A ''windup radio'' or ''clockwork radio'' is a [[radio receiver|radio]] that is powered by human muscle power rather than batteries or the electrical grid. In the most common arrangement, an internal electric generator is run by a mainspring, which is wound by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] on the case. Turning the crank winds the spring and a full winding will allow several hours of operation. Alternatively, the generator can charge an internal battery.

Radios powered by handcranked generators are not new, but their market was previously seen as limited to emergency or military organizations. The modern clockwork radio was designed and patented in 1991 by British inventor [[Trevor Baylis]] as a response to the [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis. He envisioned it as a radio for use by poor people in developing countries without access to batteries. In 1994, British accountant Chris Staines and his South African partner, Rory Stear, secured the worldwide license to the invention and cofounded Baygen Power Industries (now [[Freeplay Energy]] Ltd), which produced the first commercial model. The key to its design was the use of a constant velocity [[Spring (device)|spring]] to store the [[potential energy]], which are no longer in use. After Baylis lost control of his invention when Baygen became Freeplay, the Freeplay Energy units switched to disposable batteries charged by cheaper hand-crank generators.

Like other self-powered equipment, windup radios were intended for [[camping]], emergencies and for areas where there is no electrical grid and replacement batteries are hard to obtain, such as in developing countries or remote settlements. They are also useful where a radio is not used on a regular basis and batteries would deteriorate, such as at a vacation house or cabin.

Windup radios designed for emergency use often included [[flashlight]]s, blinking emergency lights, and emergency sirens. They also may include multiple alternate power sources, such as disposable or [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[Cigarette lighter receptacle]]s, and [[solar cell]]s.

===Pedal-powered transmitter===
[[File:Solitary Island Pedal Radio br 3.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Pedal radio being used in [[South Solitary Island Light|South Solitary Island lighthouse]], to communicate with [[Norah Head Light]]station, 1946]]
The ''Pedal Radio'' (or ''Pedal Wireless'') was a radio transmitter-receiver powered by a pedal-driven generator. It was developed by [[Alfred Traeger]] in 1929 as a way of providing [[radio]] [[Telecommunication|communication]]s to remote [[Crown Lands Act|homestead]]s in the [[Australia]]n [[outback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiqueradio.com/traeger|title=pedal 07-99.html The Pedal Radio of the Great Outback|author=|date=|website=antiqueradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no mains or generator power available at the time and batteries to provide the power required would have been too expensive. It is considered an important Australian invention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/100 years of innovations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">'''Incinerator bottom ash''' (IBA) is a form of [[ash]] produced in [[incineration]] facilities. This material is discharged from the moving grate of [[municipal solid waste]] incinerators. Following combustion the ash typically has a small amount of [[ferrous]] metals contained within it. This ash can be processed to standardize the material and remove [[contaminant]]s in order for it to be used as an [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. Following processing the material can be termed ''IBA aggregate'' or ''processed IBA''. The aggregate uses for the material include:

*Bulk fill
*[[Asphalt]] via re-melting at 1200 C to form [[slag]], but energy intensive.
*[[Cement]] bound materials
*Lightweight blocks
*Pavement [[concrete]]

Alternatively if there are no local markets for the IBA the material is typically disposed of in a [[landfill]].

==Risks==
If IBA is used as the aggregate in [[Foam Concrete|foam concrete]] in non-ventilated areas, [[hydrogen]] gas deposits may build up during the lifespan of the material and explode when brought into contact with sources of ignition, such as during cutting with grinding equipment.&lt;ref name="explodingIBA"&gt;

There are 28 '''Industrial Assessment Centers''' in the [[United States]] as of September 2018. These centers are located at universities across the US, and are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to spread ideas relating to industrial [[energy conservation]].

The centers conduct research into energy conservation techniques for industrial applications. This is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center. The IAC program has achieved over $4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;Nimbalkar, Presentation to the Industrial Energy Technology Conference, May 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Industrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program) were created by the [[Department of Commerce]] in 1976 and later moved to the DOE.  The IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/amo/advanced-manufacturing-office Advanced Manufacturing Office]&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]]. The Centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use, ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs Energy.gov IAC Site]&lt;/ref&gt; According to instructions from DOE, currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency. While this remains the primary focus of the assessments, waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended.

==Other Benefits==
In addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments, the IAC program offers several other important benefits. Apart from the routine energy audits which cover a broad scope of industrial settings and subsystems, the IACs provide technical material and workshops promoting energy efficiency. 

'''IAC Database'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rutgers University maintains a large databases of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector.  The database contains recommendations from every audit completed by an IAC dating back to 1980.  As of June 2016, the IAC program had finished 17,400 assessments and made over 132,000 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iac.university/ DOE EERE Industrial Assessment Centers Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  This database is free and open to the public.

'''IAC Alumni'''&lt;br /&gt;
The IAC program helps train the next generation of energy efficiency engineers.  Hundreds of students participate in the program each year,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iacforum.org/iac/metrics.jsp IAC Program Metrics]&lt;/ref&gt; and  over 56% of those students pursue careers in energy or energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iacforum.org/iac/pdf/New%20IAC%20Alumni%20Fact%20Sheet%20DRAFT%2010-4-2007.pdf IAC Alumni Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="734">In [[fluid mechanics]], '''internal flow''' is a flow for which the fluid is confined by a surface. Hence the [[boundary layer]] is unable to develop without eventually being constrained. The internal flow configuration represents a convenient geometry for heating and cooling fluids used in chemical processing, environmental control, and energy conversion technologies.

An example includes flow in a pipe.

'''Kiraitu Murungi''' (born 1 January 1952) is the current Governor of Meru County in Central Kenya. He is a former long-serving Member of Parliament for South Imenti constituency (1992-2013), former Cabinet Minister, and former Senator for Meru County.

==Education==
Kiraitu Murungi was born on 1 January 1952 in Kionyo village, Abogeta division of Meru District in Eastern Kenya Daniel M’Mwarania and Anjelika Kiajia. He attended Chuka High School before proceeding to [[Alliance High School (Kenya)|Alliance High School]]. Murungi graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the [[University of Nairobi]] in 1977 and attained a Master of Law in the same university in 1982. He attained another Master in 1991 of Law from [[Harvard Law School]] where he served two years in exile in the United States at the heyday of [[Daniel arap Moi]]'s one-party dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/cvs/kiraitumurungi.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307231620/http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/cvs/kiraitumurungi.htm |date=7 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Law==
Murungi was a partner in a law firm he founded with [[Gibson Kamau Kuria]] and [[Aaron Ringera]], where he practised law for ten years. His biggest case during this tenure was representing political prisoners of the [[Daniel Toroitich arap Moi|Moi]] government including [[Wanyiri Kihoro]] against the government itself.&lt;ref&gt;WANYIRI KIHORO vs ATTORNEY GENERAL [THE COURT OF APPEAL AT NAIROBI (GACHUHI, MASIME &amp; KWACH JJA) CIVIL APPEAL NO. 151 OF 1988 {{cite web|url=http://www.kituochakatiba.co.ug/wanyiri.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114065925/http://www.kituochakatiba.co.ug/wanyiri.htm |archivedate=14 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A case that is mentioned severally in Wanyiri Kihoro's book ''Never Say Die: The Chronicle of a Political Prisoner''&lt;ref&gt;Never Say Die: The Chronicle of a Political Prisoner By Wanyiri Kihoro Published by Michigan State Univ Pr, 1998 {{ISBN|9966-46-899-4}}, {{ISBN|978-9966-46-899-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the detention of Kuria in an attempt to cause the abandonment of the case, as well as a period in exile in various western countries for both Mr Murungi and Mr. Kuria.&lt;ref&gt;The Human Rights situation in Kenya under the leadership of Moi, The Internal and external contexts of Human Rights Practice in Kenya, Korwa G.

==Political career==
Upon his return from exile, Kiraitu joined the struggle for multi-party democracy in 1990 as one of Kenya's "Young Turks." Murungi joined the newly formed [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD) following Kenya's return to multi-party politics in 1991. He was elected to parliament on a FORD ticket during the first multi-party election in 1992, serving as MP for parliament for South Imenti Constituency, Meru. Kiraitu decamped from FORD to Democratic Party (DP) when FORD splintered in the aftermath of the demise of its leader, [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]], retaining the South Imenti seat during the 1997 general elections. As an opposition member of parliament between 1991 and 2002, Kiraitu served as the shadow Attorney-General and member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Corruption.

Murungi has been a member of parliament since 1992 and has formerly served as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and as the shadow [[Attorney General]]. In the [[Kenyan general election, 2002|2002 Kenya General Elections]] he won the [[South Imenti Constituency]] MP seat for the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] (NARC) party. After the Government's defeat in the 21 November 2005 constitutional referendum, he was appointed Minister of Energy. He was then reelected as a member of parliament under a Party of National Unity (PNU) ticket in the 2007 elections.

On 8 August 2017, he was elected the governor of Meru County under a [[Jubilee Party|Jubilee]] ticket, defeating the Incumbent Peter Munya an effectively becoming the second governor of the county since its inception. Prior to being the Governor Kiraitu served as the Senator for Meru County after winning the seat under the Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) ticket in the 2013 elections.

==Scandals and Controversies==
He is one of the closest allies of former Kenyan President [[Mwai Kibaki]]. He has been accused of attempting to cover-up in the [[Anglo Leasing Scandal]], which he once claimed that it was a "scandal that never was".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Question: Can the President Shake Off Men in the Eye of a Storm?|publisher=[[The Daily Nation]]|date=29 January 2006|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200601300340.html|accessdate=2006-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2006, the [[BBC World Service]] aired a conversation between Murungi and former Governance and Ethics Permanent Secretary [[John Githongo]] where he appears to be coercing Githongo to drop his investigations on the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He had promised that Anura Pereira would forgive a debt of KES 30 million owed by Githongo's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Taped evidence' in Kenya scandal|date=9 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4695354.stm|accessdate=2006-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murungi initially maintained that he would not resign his cabinet post despite the allegations of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan minister 'not resigning'|date=10 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4701048.stm|accessdate=2006-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that he was innocent and that Githongo's reports are mere propaganda. On the recording, he has commented: "I have listened to the alleged tape recorded evidence. It is truncated, inaudible, insufficient and inadmissible to form any credible proof of the allegations being orchestrated by Mr Githongo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kiraitu: 'BBC Tape Not Credible'|date=10 February 2006|publisher=[[Daily Nation]]|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200602100373.html|accessdate=2006-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2006, however, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] announced that Murungi had resigned to allow full investigation into the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan 'graft' ministers resign|date=13 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4710138.stm|accessdate=2006-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February 2006, a day after his resignation, Murungi has claimed that he played no role at all to cover-up the [[Anglo Leasing Scandal]]. He blamed his woes on the politics of [[National Rainbow Coalition]] (NARC) and the media. However, it later emerged that President [[Mwai Kibaki]] had asked him to resign from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Kibaki asked Kiraitu and Saitoti to quit|date=13 February 2006|publisher=[[Daily Nation]]|url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=2&amp;newsid=67252|accessdate=2006-02-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2006, Murungi issued a statement that was faxed to all Kenyan media houses questioning the intentions and motives of [[John Githongo]], in the form of 36 questions. Among the questions he asked is why [[John Githongo]] was recording his conversations with government officials and whether he was a spy for foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister Kiraitu's 36 questions to Githongo |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=36298 |date=10 February 2006 |publisher=Standard, Kenya |accessdate=2006-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029025133/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=36298 |archivedate=29 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2006 he was reinstated as Energy Minister by Kibaki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1163590381401B255 Kibaki reinstates ministers after scandal], ''IOL''&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in that position in the Cabinet appointed by Kibaki on 8 January 2008, following the controversial [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|December 2007 election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200801080673.html "Kenya: Kibaki Names Cabinet"], ''The East African Standard'' (allAfrica.com), 8 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, Murungi apologised for making a remark which was criticised as trivialising both rape and corruption. He had said that criticism from aid donors of corruption in Kenya was "like raping a woman who is already willing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan apology over rape remark|date=11 February 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4254343.stm|accessdate=2006-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cretaceous seaway.png|thumb|right|Laramidia, circa 100 MYA]]
'''Laramidia''' was an island continent that existed during the [[Late Cretaceous]] period (99.6–66 [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), when the [[Western Interior Seaway]] split the continent of [[North America]] in two. In the [[Mesozoic]] era, Laramidia was an island land mass separated from [[Appalachia (Mesozoic)|Appalachia]] to the east by the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The seaway eventually shrank, split across the [[Dakotas]], and retreated towards the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Hudson Bay]]. The masses joined to unite the [[North America]]n continent.

Laramidia is named for [[Laramie, Wyoming]], located in the former landmass. The name was coined by [[J. David Archibald]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Archibald |first=J.

==Fauna==
[[File:Dinosaurs from the west coast of Laramidia.png|thumb|left|Dinosaurs found on the western coast]]
{{Unreferenced section|date = November 2013}}

From the [[Turonian]] age of the Late Cretaceous to the very beginning of the [[Paleocene]], Laramidia was separated from Appalachia to the east. As a result, the fauna evolved differently on each land mass over that time. Geological conditions were generally favorable for the preservation of fossils in Laramidia, making the [[western United States]] one of the most productive fossil regions in the world. Less is known about Appalachian biodiversity in the Cretaceous as few fossiliferous deposits exist in the region today and half of the fossil beds in Appalachia were destroyed during the [[Pleistocene ice age]]. However, fossil beds which haven't been discovered yet could exist in areas of the former Appalachian continent.

In western North America during the Cretaceous the dominant theropods were the [[tyrannosaur]]s, huge predatory dinosaurs with proportionately massive heads built for ripping flesh from their prey. In Laramidia there were the theropods of [[Tyrannosaurinae]] such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', ''[[Nanuqsaurus hoglundi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony R. |last1=Fiorillo |first2=Ronald S. |last2=Tykoski |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091287 |title=A Diminutive New Tyrannosaur from the Top of the World |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=e91287 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0091287 |date=12 March 2014 |access-date=24 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daspletosaurus]]'', ''[[Teratophoneus]]'', and theropods of [[Albertosaurinae]] such as ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', all being included under the same family of [[Tyrannosauridae]] and not all contemporary. The bodies of tyrannosaurs exhibited huge heads and legs, in contrast to proportionally tiny arms. The teeth exhibited in this family are rather comparable to railroad spikes and would have helped inflict major damage on prey.

Another common group of North American dinosaurs were the [[hadrosaur]]s. The fossil record shows a staggering variety of hadrosaur forms in Laramidia.

Other differences in genera appear between the island land masses. [[Sauropods]] roamed Laramidia during the Cretaceous after apparently dying out in Appalachia. [[Nodosaur]]s, though, appear to have been more plentiful in Appalachia. Nodosaurs were large, herbivorous [[Ankylosauria|armored dinosaur]]s resembling [[armadillo]]s. They were scarce in Laramidia by the late Cretaceous, existing only in specialized forms like ''[[Edmontonia]]'' and ''[[Panoplosaurus]]'' while nodosaurs were thriving in Appalachia.

'''Llameros''' run [[llama]] caravans throughout the [[Andes]] of [[South America]].  In ancient times, llamero was a high-ranking position that involved both managing the emperor's llama and [[alpaca]] herds, and maintaining trade and communication throughout the empire.  Nowadays, roads have reduced the need for llameros, but llameros are still very important in more inaccessible mountain villages. &lt;ref group="Documentary"&gt;{{cite web|title=LE LLAMERO ET L'ENFANT AU LAMA BLANC|url=http://www.vodeo.tv/documentaire/le-llamero-et-l-enfant-au-lama-blanc|website=Vodeo.tv|publisher=Vodeo|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Density distribution==

In the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho (r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1~+~\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the "scale radius", ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', are parameters which vary from halo to halo.

The integrated mass within some radius ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[
\ln\left(\frac{R_s+R_\max}{R_s}\right)-\frac{R_\max}{R_s+R_\max}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to be the [[Virial theorem#Galaxies and cosmology .28virial mass and radius.29|virial radius,]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;vir&lt;/sub&gt;, which is related to the "concentration parameter", ''c'', and scale radius via

: &lt;math&gt;
R_\mathrm{vir}=cR_s
&lt;/math&gt;

The virial radius is often referred to as &lt;math&gt; R_{200} &lt;/math&gt;, and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In this case, the total mass in the halo within &lt;math&gt; R_\mathrm{vir} &lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\mathrm{vir}} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[\ln(1+c) - \frac{c}{1+c}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''c'' is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40
for halos of various sizes.

The integral of the ''squared density'' is

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r)^2 \, dr=\frac{4\pi}{3} R_s^3 \rho_0^2
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

so that the mean squared density inside of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\max}=\frac{R_s^3\rho_0^2}{R_\max^3}
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

which for the virial radius simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\mathrm{vir}}=\frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
\left[1-\frac{1}{(1+c)^3}\right]
\approx \frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_s}=\frac{7}{8}\rho_0^2
&lt;/math&gt;

===Gravitational potential===
Solving Poisson's equation gives the gravitational potential
: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi(r) = - \frac{4\pi G \rho_0 R_s^3}{r} \ln \left( 1+ \frac{r}{R_s} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
with the limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to \infty} \Phi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to 0} \Phi=-4\pi G\rho_0 R_s^2&lt;/math&gt; .

===Radius of the maximum circular velocity===
The radius of the maximum circular velocity (confusingly sometimes also referred to as &lt;math&gt;R_\max&lt;/math&gt;) can be found from the maximum of &lt;math&gt;M(r)/r&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt;
R^\max_{\mathrm{circ}} = \alpha R_s
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx 2.16258&lt;/math&gt; is the positive root of 
: &lt;math&gt;
\ln \left( 1 + \alpha \right) =  \frac{\alpha (1+2\alpha)}{(1+\alpha)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dark matter simulations==
Over a broad range of halo mass and redshift, the NFW profile approximates the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration of dark matter halos produced in simulations of [[collision]]less dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y. P. Jing|title=The Density Profile of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 May 2000|volume=535|issue=1|pages=30–36|bibcode=2000ApJ...535...30J|doi=10.1086/308809|arxiv=astro-ph/9901340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the dark matter [[virial theorem|virializes]], the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos.

Alternative models, in particular the [[Einasto profile]], have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile by including an additional third parameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Merritt, David |author-link=David Merritt|display-authors=4|author2=Graham, Alister|author3=Moore, Benjamin|author4=Diemand, Jurg|author5=Terzić, Balsa|title=Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=20 December 2006|volume=132|issue=6|pages=2685–2700|doi=10.1086/508988|arxiv=astro-ph/0509417|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2685M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merritt|first1=David|authorlink1=David Merritt|display-authors=etal|title=A Universal Density Profile for Dark and Luminous Matter?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=May 2005|volume=624|issue=2|pages=L85–L88|doi=10.1086/430636|arxiv=astro-ph/0502515|bibcode=2005ApJ...624L..85M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.

Simulations assuming different cosmological initial conditions produce halo populations in which the two parameters of the NFW profile follow different mass-concentration relations, depending on cosmological properties such as the density of the universe and the nature of the very early process which created all structure. Observational measurements of this relation thus offer a route to constraining these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Navarro, Julio |author-link=Julio Navarro |author2=Frenk, Carlos |author3=White, Simon |title=A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=1 December 1997 |volume=490 |issue=2 |pages=493-508 |doi=10.1086/304888 |arxiv=astro-ph/9611107 |bibcode=1997ApJ...490..493N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations of halos==
The dark matter density profiles of massive galaxy clusters can be measured directly by gravitational lensing and agree well with the NFW profiles predicted for cosmologies with the parameters inferred from other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okabe|first1=Nobuhiro|display-authors=etal|title=LoCuSS: The Mass Density Profile of Massive Galaxy Clusters at z = 0.2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=June 2013|volume=769|pages=L35–L40|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1302.2728|bibcode=2013ApJ...769L..35O}}&lt;/ref&gt; For lower mass halos, gravitational lensing is too noisy to give useful results for individual objects, but accurate measurements can still be made by averaging the profiles of many similar systems. For the main body of the halos, the agreement with the predictions remains good down to halo masses as small as those of the halos surrounding isolated galaxies like our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Wenting|display-authors=etal|title=A weak gravitational lensing recalibration of the scaling relations linking the gas properties of dark haloes to their mass|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=March 2016|volume=456|pages=2301-2320|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2809/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1509.05784|bibcode=2016MNRAS.456.2301W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner regions of halos are beyond the reach of lensing measurements, however, and other techniques give results which disagree with NFW predictions for the dark matter distribution inside 
the visible galaxies which lie at halo centers.

{{main|Navier–Stokes equation|Non-dimensionalization|Scale invariance}}
{{continuum mechanics}}

In [[fluid mechanics]], '''non-dimensionalization of the Navier–Stokes equations''' is the conversion of the [[Navier–Stokes equation]] to a [[nondimensionalization|nondimensional form]]. When skillfully performed, this eases the analysis of the problem which is at study, and reduces the number of [[free parameter]]s. Small or large sizes of certain dimensionless parameters indicate the importance of certain terms in the equations for the studied flow. This may provide possibilities to neglect terms in certain (areas of the) considered flow. Further, non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equations can be beneficial if one is posed with similar physical situations – that is problems where the only changes are those of the basic [[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of the system.

Scaling of Navier–Stokes equation refers to the process of selecting the proper [[spatial scale]]s – for a certain type of flow – to be used in the non-dimensionalization of the equation. Since the resulting equations need to be dimensionless, a suitable combination of parameters and constants of the equations and flow (domain) characteristics have to be found. As a result of this combination, the number of parameters to be analyzed is reduced and the results may be obtained [[scale invariance|in terms of the scaled variables]].

==Need for non-dimensionalization and scaling==
In addition to reducing the number of parameters, non-dimensionalized equation helps to gain a greater insight into the relative size of various terms present in the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Versteeg H.K, An introduction to computational fluid dynamics: the finite volume method, 2007, prentice hall, 9780131274983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patankar Suhas V. , Numerical heat transfer and fluid flow, 1980, Taylor &amp; Francis, 9780891165224&lt;/ref&gt;
Following appropriate selecting of scales for the non-dimensionalization process, this leads to identification of small terms in the equation. Neglecting the smaller terms against the bigger ones allows for the simplification of the situation. For the case of flow without [[heat transfer]], the non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equation depend only on the [[Reynolds Number]] and hence all physical realizations of the related experiment will have the same value of non-dimensionalized variables for the same Reynolds Number.&lt;ref&gt;Salvi Rodolfo, The Navier Stokes equation theory and numerical methods, 2002, M. Dekker, 9780824706722&lt;/ref&gt;

[[scale invariance|Scaling]] helps provide better understanding of the physical situation, with the variation in dimensions of the parameters involved in the equation. This allows for experiments to be conducted on smaller scale prototypes provided that any physical effects which are not included in the non-dimensionalized equation are unimportant.

==Non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equation==
The incompressible Navier–Stokes momentum equation is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac 1 \rho \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Robert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tritton|first=D.J. |pages=55&amp;ndash;58 |title=Physical fluid dynamics|year=1988|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0198544898|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ρ is the [[density]], ''p'' is the [[pressure]], &amp;nu; is the [[kinematic viscosity]], '''u''' is the [[flow velocity]], and '''g''' is the body acceleration field.

The above equation can be non-dimensionalized through selection of appropriate scales as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| Scale 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| dimensionless variable
|-
| [[Length]] ''L''
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r^*\ = \frac{\mathbf r}{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla^*\ = L\nabla&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Flow velocity]] ''U'' 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u^*\ = \frac{\mathbf u}{U}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Time]] ''L''/''U''
| &lt;math&gt;t^*\ = \frac{t}{L/U}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Pressure]]: there is no natural selection for the pressure scale.
| Where dynamic effects are dominant i.e. high velocity flows
:&lt;math&gt; p^* = \frac{p}{\rho U^2} &lt;/math&gt;
Where viscous effects are dominant i.e. creeping flows
:&lt;math&gt; p^* = \frac{p L}{\mu U} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Substituting the scales the non-dimensionalized equation obtained is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u^*}}{\partial t^*} + (\mathbf{u^*} \cdot \nabla^*) \mathbf{u^*}\ = -\nabla^* p^* + \frac{1}{Re} \nabla^{*2} \mathbf{u^*} +  \frac{1}{Fr^2} \hat{g}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name =Robert&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robert W.|author2=Alan T. McDonald |author3=Philip J. Pritchard  |title=Introduction to fluid mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780471735588|edition=6th|page=213&amp;ndash;215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''Fr'' is the [[Froude number]] and ''Re'' is the [[Reynolds number]].

=== Flows with large viscosity ===
For flows where [[Viscosity|viscous force]]s are dominant i.e. slow flows with large viscosity, a viscous pressure scale μ''U''/''L''  is used. In the absence of a free surface, the equation obtained is

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Re \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u^*}}{\partial t^*} + (\mathbf{u^*} \cdot \nabla^* )\mathbf{u^*} \right)\ = -\nabla^* p^* + \nabla^{*2} \mathbf{u^*}.&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

=== Stokes regime ===
{{see also|Stokes flow}}
Scaling of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be done, in a flow where inertia term is smaller than the viscous term i.e. when Re → 0 then inertia terms can be neglected, leaving the equation of a [[creeping motion]].

:&lt;math&gt;Re \frac{\mathrm{D} \mathbf{u^*}}{\mathrm{D} t^*} = -\nabla^* p^* + \nabla^{*2} \mathbf{u^*}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such flows tend to have influence of viscous interaction over large distances from an object.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} At low Reynolds number the same equation reduces to a [[diffusion equation]], named '''Stokes equation'''

:&lt;math&gt; -\nabla^* p^* + \nabla^{*2} \mathbf{u^*}= \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Euler regime ===
Similarly if Re → ∞ i.e. when the inertia forces dominates, the viscous force can be neglected by substituting μ = 0 in the equation.The non-dimensionalized [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equation]] for an [[inviscid flow]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u^*}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u^*} \cdot \nabla^* )\mathbf{u^*}\ = -\nabla^* p^*.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Frank M.|title=Fluid mechanics|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=9780072402179|edition=5th|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== When density varies due to both concentration and temperature ===
Density variation due to both concentration and temperature is an important field of study in [[Double diffusive convection]]"If density changes due to both temperature and salinity is taken into account then some more terms add to the Z-Component of momentum as follows:&lt;ref&gt;On the relationship between finger width, velocity, and ﬂuxes in thermohaline convection, 2009,  K.

Where ''S'' is the salinity of the fluid, β&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is the thermal expansion coefficient at constant pressure and β&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of saline expansion at constant pressure and temperature.

Non dimensionalizing using the scale:
:&lt;math&gt; S^* = \frac{S - S_B}{S_T - S_B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T^* = \frac{T - T_B}{T_T - T_B}&lt;/math&gt;
we get

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial W^*}{\partial t^*} + U^* \frac{\partial W^*}{\partial X^*} + W^* \frac{\partial W^*}{\partial Z^*}\ =  -\frac{\partial p_d}{\partial Z^*} + Pr \left(\frac{\partial^2 W^*}{\partial X^{*2}} + \frac{\partial^2 W^*}{\partial Z^{*2}}\right)\ - {Ra_s Pr_s S} + {Ra_T Pr_T T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the salinity and temperature at top layer, ''S&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the salinity and temperature at bottom layer, Ra is the [[Rayleigh Number]], and Pr is the [[Prandtl Number]]. The sign of Ra&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and Ra&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; will change depending on whether it stabilizes or destabilizes the system.

The '''Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy''' ('''EERE''') is an office within the [[United States Department of Energy]]. Formed from other energy agencies after the [[1973 energy crisis]], EERE's mission is to help support the development of clean, renewable and efficiency energy technologies to America and support a global clean energy economy. The Office of EERE is led by the Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, who oversees three technology sectors: [[renewable energy]], sustainable [[transportation]], and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]]. Within these sectors are 11 major technology offices and programs that support research, development, and outreach efforts.

==History==
EERE has been established from several previous agencies within the United States Executive branch following the [[1973 energy crisis]]. It has foundations in the former agencies [[Federal Energy Administration]], the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]], the Energy Resource Council, and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], all established prior to the establishment of Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977 ({{USStatute|95|91|91|565|1977|08|04}}).&lt;ref name=Relyea2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Relyea|first=Harold|title=The executive branch, creation and reorganization|year=2003|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=29|author2=Thomas P. Carr |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 [[National Energy Act]] consolidated several of the former agencies into the DOE, and created an office that focused on energy efficiency and renewable fuels. The agency had undergone several different names since 1978 to reflect its changing scope, including the Office of Conservation and Solar Applications (CSA), the Office of Conservation and Solar Energy (CSE), and the Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy (CRE). The agency gained its current name, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in 1993.

==Management and organization==
The EERE's mission is defined as "to create and sustain American leadership in the transition to a global clean energy economy." &lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/about-office-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy Office of EERE: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; The office also develops initiatives to advance specific technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-energy/office-of-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy?agencyid=7410 Allgov.com: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of EERE is led by the Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, who is appointed by the president and [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|confirmed by the U.S. Senate]]. The current Acting Assistant Secretary is Steve Chalk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://energy.gov/eere/downloads/office-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-organization-chart Office of EERE Organization Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power Analytics''' is a [[San Diego]], [[California]]-based software developer specializing in the field of model-validated analytics for complex electrical power infrastructure, an emerging branch of [[analytics]] focusing on the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] design and [[predictive analytics]] surrounding complex [[electric power]] infrastructure.  Analogous to [[business analytics]] – massive [[mathematical models]] and algorithms used to predict financial behavior and potential risks – in power infrastructure model-validated analytics use the data in the original CAD model of an electrical power system to assess the impending likelihood of a [[short circuit]], [[arc flash]], or other [[power engineering]] problems.

Model-validated analytics can also optimize power consumption [[energy conservation]] in mission-critical facilities by ensuring – like the [[engine management system]] in an [[automobile engine]] – that every component is operating within its as-designed operating specifications.  This component-by-component calibration results in what is effectively a 24/7, system-wide tune-up, that occurs every millisecond.  Thus they play a vital role in help organizations minimize their [[carbon footprint]] and work toward a [[carbon-neutral footprint]].

The trademark for "Power Analytics" was awarded to Power Analytics Corporation in 2006.

==Where model-validated analytics are used==

Model-validated analytics are used in mission-critical facilities (those requiring 99.9% [[uptime]] or better) marked by very dense electrical power usage, and where operational reliability is paramount.  Facilities who are candidates for employing power analytics include transaction-intensive [[data centers]], government and military installations, offshore [[oil platforms]], [[air traffic control]] hubs, [[hospitals]], [[casino]]s, and electric [[power generation]] and [[power transmission]] networks.  In such facilities, electrical power problems can have very costly consequences, costing millions of dollars (U.S.) per minutes.

==How they work==

Model-validated analytics employ and integrate three primary sources of power-related data:

* A [[power systems CAD]] model, containing symbols of electrical components (power cables, [[circuit breaker]]s, [[uninterruptible power supply]], [[electrical generator]]s, etc.) These components are connected to one another to form a virtual “power network,” in which a power system designer can easily test, trouble-shoot, and re-test the behavior of the system until no discernible design flaws remain.  This can be called “as-designed” data.
* A [[data acquisition]] system (or [[SCADA]] system, or [[Building Management System]]) that aggregates live operational data about the electrical power infrastructure in real-time.  This can be called “as-is” data.
* A diagnostics engine that continually (at millisecond speeds) compares the “as-is” values coming from the data acquisition system to the “as-designed” values encoded in the CAD model.

Once the system is deployed, the three software platforms interoperate with one another.  If there are no deviations between the “as-is” and “as-designed,” specifications, no actions are taken.  However, the instant  any “as-is” value begin to drift from the corresponding value specified in the CAD model, however slightly, the diagnostics engine immediately begins to isolate the deviation, assess its implications, devise a remedy, and alert the facility operator to the problem and its resolution. Because noticeable electrical power problems are frequently the result of minute anomalies that went undetected – and thus, worsened over time – model-validated analytics are recognized as a very effective technology for preempting serious power faults before they can pose a threat to the operational effectiveness of a facility.

'''Richard Yemm''' is the British inventor of the [[Pelamis Wave Energy Converter]] and was director of the former [[Pelamis Wave Power]], a company he founded in [[Edinburgh]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="ScotGov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2012"/&gt;  In 2014 he co-founded a new company, Quoceant, who are engineering consultants specializing in marine energy and technology innovation.

==Biography==
Yemm studied Mechanical Engineering at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1985 to 1989, gaining a first class honours degree.&lt;ref name="ScotOil"/&gt; As an undergraduate, he was also awarded a Half Blue for sailing in 1986–87 by the [[Edinburgh University Sports Union]], denoting performance to a very high standard.&lt;ref name="EUSU"/&gt; He completed his PhD in 1994&lt;ref name="ScotOil"/&gt; under Professor [[Stephen Salter]], former [[Saltire Prize]] medallist&lt;ref name="ScotGov"/&gt; and inventor of the [[Salter's duck|Edinburgh duck wave energy device]].

He went on to pursue a career as a self-employed design and development engineer on renewable energy projects,&lt;ref name="SIE"/&gt; gaining experience in the wind energy industry.&lt;ref name="EEI"/&gt; He invented the [[Pelamis Wave Energy Converter]] for generating electricity from marine waves, and established Ocean Power Delivery Ltd in 1998 to develop the product.&lt;ref name="SIE"/&gt; The company is now called Pelamis Wave Power Ltd. Yemm was CEO until August 2007, raising substantial investment and gaining commercial orders from 2005 onwards.&lt;ref name="EEI"/&gt; He then became CTO of the company.  

Yemm was Chairman of the Board of Scottish Renewables trade association for over five years,&lt;ref name="EEI"/&gt; and is active in promoting renewable and wave energy.

==Recognition==
In March 2012 Yemm was presented with the [[Saltire Prize]] medal by Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]]. The chief executive of [[Scottish Renewables]], Niall Stuart, said, "Richard Yemm will undoubtedly be looked upon as one of the most influential people to the development of Scotland's marine industry; from the drawing board to grid connected devices and making important steps to commercial scale projects."&lt;ref name="BBC2012"/&gt;

A '''sawbuck''' is a device for holding wood so that it may be cut into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='buck' n7. def. 1., 'sawbuck' def. 1.|work=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easily made in the field from rough material, it consists of an "X" form at each end which are joined by cross bars below the intersections of the X's. The stock to be cut is placed in the V's formed above the intersections of the X's.

A sawbuck is very simple to build. The five "V" sawbuck was designed with 10 vertical {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} [[Lumber#North American softwoods|2×4s]], and four horizontal, {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} [[Lumber#North American softwoods|2×6s]], secured with {{convert|3.5|in|abbr=in|order=flip}} wood screws. It was designed this way in order to cut two or more smaller pieces ({{convert|2|-|4|ft|1|abbr=in|order=flip|disp=or}} in length) of firewood in rapid succession. A sawbuck should be heavy enough to negate any kickback from the saw while cutting. Building a sawbuck that is too light could result in injury as it may tip over while cutting, especially with a chainsaw.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

In Canada and Britain, and the United States, a sawbuck is called a ''[[sawhorse]]'',{{cn|date=May 2015}} although this term also refers to a similar device used (often in pairs) to support wood planks.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==$10==
"Sawbuck" is also a slang term for a [[United States ten-dollar bill|U.S. $10 bill]], derived from the similarity between the shape of a sawbuck device and the [[Roman numeral]] X (10), which formerly appeared on $10 bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Investor Words|title=Sawbuck|accessdate=May 10, 2015|url=http://www.investorwords.com/6657/sawbuck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "double sawbuck"  is a twenty dollar bill.

==Naming and numbering==
Formerly it was named selenapyrylium.  However this is misleading, as "selena" indicates that selenium substitutes for a carbon atom, but actually selenium is substituted for the oxygen atom in [[pyrylium]].&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt; In the Hantzsch-Widman  system it is called seleninium. This is the name used by [[Chemical Abstracts]]. Replacement nomenclature would call this selenoniabenzene.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

Numbering in selenopyrylium starts with 1 on the selenium atom and counts up to 6 counter-clockwise on the carbon atoms. The positions adjacent to the chalcogen, numbered 2 and 6 can also be called α, the next two positions 3 and 5 can be termed "β" and the opposite carbon at position 4 can be called "γ".&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Because selenopyrylium is a positively charged cation, it takes the solid form as a salt with non-nucleophillic anions like [[perchlorate]], [[tetrafluoroborate]], [[fluorosulfate]], or [[hexafluorophosphate]].&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

==Formation==
Selenopyrylium and derivatives can be made from 1,5-diketones ([[glutaraldehyde]]), [[hydrogen selenide]] along with [[HCl]] as a catalyst in acetic acid solvent. A side product is 2,6-bis-(hydroseleno)selenacyclohexane.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

When 5-chloro-2,4-pentadienenitrile derivatives react with soidum hydroselenide, or sodium selenite, and is then treated with perchloric acid, a 2-amino-selenopyrilium perchlorate salt results.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

==Properties==
The positive charge is not confined to the selenium atom, but distributes on the ring in several resonance structures, so that the α and γ positions have some positive charge. A nucleophillic attack targets these carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

Selenopyrylium has two prominent absorption bands in the [[ultraviolet spectrum]], band I is at 3000&amp;nbsp;Å, and band II is at 2670&amp;nbsp;Å.  Band I, also known as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is from the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;←&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transition. The wavelength is longer and the band is much stronger than that of [[benzene]]. This is a bathochromic shift. The wavelength is longer than in thiopyrylium and pyrylium, but the intensity is weaker, due to selenium being less electronegative. Band II, also called &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is stronger and longer than that of benzene, thiopyrylium and pyrylium. Band II is polarized in the direction of Se-γ axis.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum shows a 10.98 ppm shift for H2 and 6, 8.77 for H3 and H5 and 9.03 for H4 (BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; salt dissolved in CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN).&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt; Compared to other pyryliums H2,6 is more than that of oxygen or sulfur, H3,5 is between  that of oxygen and sulfur, and H4 is very similar to thiopyrylium, but is slightly lower. NMR for &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C has the same trends as for the attached hydrogens.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

Solvents include [[trifluoroacetic acid]], [[methanol]], [[dichloromethane]], [[chloroform]] and [[acetonitrile]].&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

==Derivatives==
Many derivatives of selenopyrylium are known with side chains attached to carbons 2,3 or 6. Examples include 4-(''p''-dimethylaminophenyl)selenopyridinium, 2,6-diphenylselenopyridinium, 4-methyl-2,6-diphenylselenopyrylium,  2,4,6-triphenylselenopyrylium, 2,6-diphenyl-4-(''p''-dimethylaminophenyl)selenopyrylium. 2,6-di-''tert''-butylselenopyrylium.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

==Related==
When the ring is fused with other aromatic rings larger aromatic structures such as selenochromenylium, selenoflavylium, and selenoxanthylium result.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

The trend is towards fluid systems, [[wikt:pellet|pellet]]s, and increased use of masterbatches. There are monofunctional, bifunctional, and polyfunctional stabilizers. In economic terms the most important product groups on the market for stabilizers are compounds based on calcium (calcium-zinc and organo-calcium), lead, and tin stabilizers as well as liquid and light stabilizers (HALS, benzophenone, benzotriazole). Cadmium-based stabilizers largely vanished in the last years due to health and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Ceresana, Market Study Stabilizers, March 2014, http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/stabilizers/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymers==
{{main|Stabilizer for polymers}}
Some kinds of stabilizers are:
* [[antioxidant]]s these prevent [[autoxidation]] of materials and come in 3 primary forms.
** Oxygen scavengers (primarily [[phosphite ester]]s such as [[tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite]]) are commonly used during the initial processing of the plastic.
** Persistent [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] scavengers prevent or slow the [[photo-oxidation of polymers]]. Traditionally these are alkylataed phenols such as [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] but now also include [[hindered amine light stabilizers]] (HALS)
** [[Antiozonant]]s prevents or retards the degradation of polymers caused by [[ozone]] ([[ozone cracking]])
* [[sequestrant]]s, forming [[chelation|chelate complexes]] and inactivating traces of metal ions that would otherwise act as catalysts
* [[UV stabilizers in plastics|ultraviolet stabilizers]] are used to protect polymers from effects of [[ultraviolet]] radiation and come to 2 main types.
** UV absorbers which essentially act the same way as [[sunscreen]]s
** Quenchers, which dissipate the radiation energy as heat instead of letting it break chemical bonds; often organic [[nickel]] salts, e.g. nickel [[phenolate]]s

==Paints==
* [[emulsifier]]s and [[surfactant]]s, for stabilization of [[emulsion]]s

==Food==
In foods, stabilizers prevent spoilage.

The flow in many fluids varies with density and depends upon the gravity. Due to which the fluid with lower density is always above the fluid with higher density. '''Stratified flows''' are very common such as the Earth's ocean and its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;	http://www-vortex.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/strat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stratified fluid ==
A [[stratified fluid]] may be defined as the fluid with density variations in the vertical direction. For example, air and water; both are fluids and if we consider them together then they can be seen as a stratified fluid system. Density variations in the atmosphere profoundly affect the motion of water and air. Wave phenomena in air flow over the mountains and occurrence of smog are the examples of stratification effect in the atmosphere.
When a fluid system having a condition in which fluid density decreases with height, is disturbed, then the gravity and friction restore the undisturbed conditions. If however the fluid tends to be stable if density decreases with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Robert R.|title=Fluid film mechanics|journal=Film notes for stratified flows|volume=21618|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upstream motions in stratified flow ==
It is known that the sub critical flow of a stratified fluid past a barrier produce motions upstream of the barrier. Sub critical flow may be defined as a flow for which the [[Froude number]] based on channel height is less than 1/π, so that one
or more stationary [[lee waves]] would be present. Some of the upstream motions do not decompose with the distance upstream. These ‘[[columnar]]’ modes have zero frequency and a [[sinusoidal]] structure in the direction of the density gradient; they effectively lead to a continuous change in upstream conditions. If the barrier is two-dimensional (i.e. of infinite extent in the direction perpendicular to the upstream flow and the direction of density gradient), [[inviscid]] theories show that the length of the upstream
region affected by the columnar modes increases without bound as t-&gt;infinity. Non-zero viscosity (and/or diffusivity) will, however, limit the region affected, since the wave amplitudes will then slowly decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castro|first1=I.P.|last2=Snyder|first2=W.H.|title=J. Fluid Mech.|journal=Upstream motions in stratified flow|date=20 May 1986|volume=187|issue=5 August 1987)|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficient mixing in stratified flows ==
Turbulent mixing in stratified flows is described by mixing efficiency. This mixing efficiency compares the energy used in irreversible mixing, enlarging the minimum [[gravitational potential energy]] that can be kept in the density field, to the
entire change in [[mechanical energy]] during the mixing process. It can be defined either as an integral quantity, calculated between  inert initial and final conditions or as a fraction of the energy flux to mixing and the power into the system. These two definitions can give different values if the system is not in steady state. Mixing efficiency is especially important in oceanography as mixing is required to keep the overall stratification in a steady-state ocean. The entire amount of mixing in the oceans is equal to the product of the power input to the ocean and the mean mixing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies Wykes|first1=Megan S.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Stuart B.|title=J. Fluid Mech.|journal=Efficient mixing in stratified flows: experimental study of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable interface within an otherwise stable stratification|volume=756|page=1027|doi=10.1017/jfm.2014.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stability criteria for stratified flow ==
Wallis and Dobson (1973) estimate their criterion with transition observations that they call “Slugging” and note that empirically the stability limit is described by

                                                      &lt;math&gt;
                                                      j^* = 0.5 \alpha^{3/2}
                                                      &lt;/math&gt;

Here
&lt;math&gt; 
\alpha= {\left ( \frac{h_{G}}{H} \right )}
&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;
j^*= 	\left [ \frac{U_{G}\alpha{\sqrt{\rho_{G}}}}{\sqrt{gH(\rho_{L}-\rho_{G})}} \right ] \quad
&lt;/math&gt; 
where H is channel height and U, h and ρ denote the mean velocity, holdup and density respectively. The subscripts G and L stand for gas and liquid and g denotes Gravity.
Taitel and Dukler (1976) [TD] expanded the (Kelvin and helmholtz) KH analysis first to the case of a finite wave on a flat liquid sheet in horizontal channel flow and then to finite waves on stratified liquid in an Inclined pipe. In order to apply this criterion they need to provide the equilibrium liquid level hL (or liquid holdup). They calculate 
&lt;math&gt;
h_{L} 
&lt;/math&gt;through momentum balances in the gas and liquid phases (two fluid models) in which shear stresses are examine and assessed using conventional friction factors definitions. In two fluid models, the pipe geometry is taken into consideration through wetted perimeters by the gas and liquid phases, including the gas-liquid interface. This states that the wall resistance of the liquid is similar to that for [[open-channel flow]] and that of the gas to close-duct flow. This geometry analysis is general and could be applied not only to round pipes, but to any other possible shape. In this method, each pair of superficial gas and liquid velocity relates to a distinctive value of
&lt;math&gt;
h_{L} 
&lt;/math&gt;
. According to [TD], a finite wave will grow in a horizontal rectangular channel of height H, when
                                                         &lt;math&gt;
                                                         j^* &gt; {\left ( 1- \frac{h_{L}}{H} \right ) \alpha^{3/2}}
                                                         &lt;/math&gt;
or
                                                         &lt;math&gt;
                                                          U_{G} &gt; {\left (1- \frac{h_{L}}{H}\right)}{\left (\frac{(\rho_{L}-\rho_{G})g A_{G}}{\rho_{G}dA_{L}/dh_{L}}\right)^{1/2}}
                                                         &lt;/math&gt;
for inclined pipe. D is the pipe diameter and A is the cross section area.
Note that
&lt;math&gt; 
{\left ( 1- \frac{h_{L}}{H} \right )} = \alpha
&lt;/math&gt;.
If
&lt;math&gt;
{\left (\frac{h_{L}}{H} \right )}=0.5
&lt;/math&gt;
,
&lt;math&gt; 
{\left ( 1- \frac{h_{L}}{H} \right )}=0.5
&lt;/math&gt;
, and this is compatible with the result of Wallis and Dobson(1973) The [TD] overall procedure result to a weak dependence on viscosity, through the calculation of
&lt;math&gt;
h_{L} 
&lt;/math&gt;.
[TD] also identify two kinds of [[stratified flow]]: stratified smooth (SS) and stratified wavy (SW). These waves, as they say, “are produced by the gas flow under conditions where the velocity of gas is enough to cause waves to form, but slower than that needed for the quick wave growth which leads transition to intermittent or annular flow.” [TD] suggest a standard to predict the transition from stratified smooth to stratified wavy flow, based on Jeffreys’ (1925, 1926) ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mata|first1=C.|last2=Pereyra|first2=E.|last3=Trallero|first3=J. L.|last4=Joseph|first4=D. D.|title=Intevep|journal=Stability of stratified gas-liquid flows|date=March 2002|pages=5, 6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of stratification on diffusion ==
Density stratification has significant effect on diffusion in fluids. For example, smoke which is coming from a chimney diffuses turbulently if the earth atmosphere is not stably stratified. When the lower air is in stable condition, as in morning or early evening, the smoke comes out and become flat into a long, thin layer. Strong stratification, or inversions as they are called sometimes, restrict contaminants to the  lower regions of the earth atmosphere, and cause many of our current air-pollution problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Robert R.|title=Fluid film mechanics|journal=Film notes for stratified flows|volume=21618|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wavebob''' was a wave energy converter which was in development between 1999 and 2013 when the company was closed owing to funding difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downing|first=Louise|title=Wavebob Shuts Down After Failing to Raise Funds, Find Partner|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-03/wavebob-shuts-down-after-failing-to-raise-funds-find-partner.html|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It commenced the first of a number of sea trials in [[Galway Bay]] in [[Ireland]] during which it was tested as a 1/4 scale device for short periods at the SEAI 1/4 Scale Wave Power Testing facility&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.ie/Renewables/Ocean_Energy/Wave_Energy_Research_in_Ireland/ Description of Galway Bay Wave Test Facility from SEI Website]&lt;/ref&gt; which is located in the inner bay inside the natural [[Aran Islands]] breakwater and where devices under test are exposed to c.1/3 of the expected energy of the 'Full Atlantic Ocean'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.marine.ie/wave/default.aspx Ireland Wave Atlas Online GIS .

SEI Full Scale Model Test Site To Be Constructed and Located At -9.989W 54.164N] Coming Onstream 2011 or 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Wavebob used the lift and fall of ocean waves to drive generators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mouwen|first1=Franc|title=Presentation to Engineers Ireland 2008|url=https://www.engineersireland.ie/EngineersIreland/media/SiteMedia/groups/Divisions/new-energy/Wavebob-Development_of_a_Wave_Energy_Converter.pdf?ext=.pdf|website=Engineers Ireland|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wavebob consisted of two oscillating structures. These structures must be able to absorb in a variety of conditions and be robust to survive in the harsh marine environment. The structures are controlled by a damping system that can respond to predicted wave height, wave power and frequency. The tank structure (a semi-submerged body) uses captured sea water mass as the majority of its inertial mass. This significantly reduces the cost associated with structural materials.

Wavebob developed its business through an Open Innovation Model and was partnered with leading energy companies such as Chevron and Vattenfall. It briefly established a joint venture company with Vattenfall called Tonn Energy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonnenergy.ie  Tonn Energy ]&lt;/ref&gt; to develop commercial wave farms off the west coast of Ireland.

'''Wooden toy trains''' are [[toy trains]] that run on a wooden track system with grooves to guide the wheels of the [[rolling stock]]. While the trains, tracks and scenery accessories are made mainly of wood, the engines and cars connect to each other using metal hooks or small [[magnet]]s, and some use plastic wheels mounted on metal axles. Some trains are made to resemble [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphical]], [[fictional]], and [[prototypical]] [[railroad]] equipment.

==History==

=== Early companies in the United States ===
Marshal H. Larrabee II founded the [[Skaneateles Handicrafters]] in 1936. This toy company made wooden toy trains and wooden tracks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/issue0601.html Technology Club Newsletter from June 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The gauge was very similar to that used by most companies today. However, the connections for the track pieces were of a different design than the jigsaw style "peg and hole" system used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2254153 US patent 2254153] from 1940 concerning Marshal H. Larrabee's Wooden Toy Train system&lt;/ref&gt; The trains were made of [[maple]] and were often left unpainted and unstained.&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in this [https://books.google.com/books?id=s1QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Skaneateles+Handicrafters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M0R2NOS7LB&amp;sig=F_0Yu1JmpukAYErTkSyGIO4uRtU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iYHYSsL-GsqvsAaL1_3tBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Skaneateles%20Handicrafters&amp;f=false advertisement] in the LIFE issue from 28. Nov. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; They are compatible with many brands of modern wooden train track. [[Playskool]] took over the sales for Skaneateles Handicrafters in 1956. This company retained the design and track connecting system into the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Set by [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=253652 Skaneateles Handicrafters for Playskool] in the collection of the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in Sidney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshal H. Larrabee sold his company to the German-based [[Habermaaß GmbH]] in 1980. The company was renamed T.C. Timber and its products were manufactured in [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]]. The production line was closed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacny.org/technologist/2002/issue0902.html Technology Club Newsletter from September 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jack-Built Toy Manufacturing Company marketed its own range of wooden toy trains under the brand name "Jack Built Snap Trains" around 1956 to 1962. These were manufactured in Japan and used a snap system to join pieces of rolling stock and tracks. Rolling stock from Jack Built Snap Trains and [[Skaneateles Handicrafters]] could ride on either manufacturer's tracks. However, individual pieces of rolling stock and track from the two brands could not be combined. This is because the coupling systems for the tracks and trains were different.

California-based Ben Orel filed U.S. patent #2847798&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=tLdeAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2847798 US patent 2939245] from 1960 concerning Ben Orel's Wooden Toy Train "snap" coupling system&lt;/ref&gt; in 1956 and was granted the patent for his "snap coupling" system two years later. He describes how the track could be rotated to create a "rail" and a "road" side in U.S. patent #3013726&lt;ref name=Orel-1961&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=xWhEAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3013726 US patent 3013726]&lt;/ref&gt; submitted in 1960 and granted in 1961. This is similar to the idea that [[Learning Curve Brands|Learning Curve]] later used for their "[[Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway|Thomas &amp; Friends]]" range. He also submitted a patent for magnetic couplings in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=50lsAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2939245 US patent 2939245] granted 1960 concerning Ben Orel's Wooden Toy Train magnetic coupling system&lt;/ref&gt; This patent was granted in 1960. It may have been the earliest attempt to use magnets with a wooden toy train system. Production stopped in the mid-1960s and the company disappeared from the toy market.

===Early companies in Europe===
In 1957, [[BRIO]], based in [[Osby]] in southern Sweden, introduced its wooden toy train system with wooden tracks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRIOs History|url=http://www.brio.net/en/Toy_Museum/BRIOHistory.aspx|publisher=brio.net|accessdate=2012-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211004133/http://www.brio.net/en/Toy_Museum/BRIOHistory.aspx|archivedate=2011-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been the first company to use the "peg and hole" system to connect the track pieces in mass production. The metal hook system for the rolling stock has since been replaced by magnetic connectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=zOguAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3850310 US patent 3850310] filed 1973 concerning BRIO's "Coupling devices for toy vehicles"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.179.68.166/nb-cgi/getdoc.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Chida;DATEN=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cinv;THE=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cidx;USER=test;BAG=1;POS=17;DOK_TPL=foto_doc_ausw.tpl;LIST_TPL=foto_ausw.tpl;FCT=g;COOK=inv%20n0011960%3C%3Einv%20n0024334%3C%3Einv%20n1012511%3C%3Einv%20n0013757%3C%3Einv%20n0014310%3C%3Einv%20n0014458%3C%3Einv%20n0017264%3C%3Einv%20n0019107%3C%3Einv%20n0020094%3C%3Einv%20n0021890%3C%3Einv%20n0024184%3C%3Einv%20n0025561%3C%3Einv%20n0026811%3C%3Einv%20n0029329%3C%3Einv%20n0029351%3C%3Einv%20n0033088%3C%3Einv%20n0033809%3C%3Einv%20n1002509%3C%3Einv%20n1002970%3C%3Einv%20n1004284%3C%3Einv%20n1004285%3C%3Einv%20n1007721%3C%3Einv%20n1009617%3C%3Einv%20n1009619%3C%3Einv%20n1009620%3C%3Einv%20n1010543%3C%3Einv%20n1012510%3C%3Einv%20n1018155%3C%3Einv%20n1011851%3C%3Einv%20n1020065%3C%3Einv%20n1020066%3C%3Einv%20n1020067;KEY=inv%20n1002509; Brio figure eight train set with magnets before 1975], Spielzeug Museum Nürnberg, Number 1975.996&lt;/ref&gt; BRIO was also one of the first companies to use [[beech]]wood for such products.

Another Swedish company that started producing a similar toy at about this time was Micki Leksaker in [[Gemla]]. It apparently produced its first wooden train sets for a Swedish department store in 1956, thus predating Brio by a year or two.

There was a long tradition of [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains|wooden toy-making along the mountain forests surrounding Bohemia]]. [[Seiffen]] made wooden figures and Christmas decorations and Blumenau (today a part of [[Olbernhau]]) created building blocks and construction sets. Mass production techniques for polishing and coloring wooden toys were established and perfected in the Bohemian areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baukastensammler.de/technologie/trommelpolieren.html Description] of the production process at the [http://www.baukastensammler.de/ "Construction Toy Collector"] site of Joachim Kleindienst. English summary: Johann Schowanek of Georgental (Jiretin, part of Albrechtsdorf) in Bohemia, now within the Czech Republic, invented or perfected the process of polishing and coloring his wooden items in rotating drums starting with the production of wooden beads in 1908. He presented some of his toy products for the first time at the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1927. The toy companies of the Seiffen and Blumenau regions among others showed great interest and soon started similar developments of their own.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the early sets exhibited train designs that were later used for wooden track trains. In 1949, Hermann [[Eichhorn]], of the Eichhorn family that made the PEWESTI wooden toys in [[Steinach, Thuringia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baukastensammler.de/hersteller/hersteller_eichhorn.html Origin] of Hermann Eichhorn with a list of literature on the [http://www.baukastensammler.de/ "Construction Toy Collector"] site of Joachim Kleindienst&lt;/ref&gt; founded his company for wooden toys in the Bavarian town of [[Egglham]]. In 1961, he started producing his version of a wooden track railway system. Eichhorn claims that his company is the first to have systematically used the "vario system" for the connectors. Eichhorn applied for a U.S. patent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5427561.html US Patent 5,427,561 from Jun.27,1995]&lt;/ref&gt; for a "battery powered toy train" in 1994. In 1997 the company had to be sold to the [[Simba-Dickie-Group]], which moved production to [[Unhošť]], near Prague in the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://www.toy-net.ch/de/nostheide/branchenbrief/5-99.htm note] on the destruction of the old factory and the move of production to the Czech Republic in "Branchenbrief International - Spielzeugbranche aktuell" #5 of March 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998 the company was fully integrated into the Simba-Dickie-Group.&lt;ref&gt;Company [http://www.simbatoys.de/en/about_us.shtml history page] on the Website of Simba-Dickie.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999 two fires totally destroyed the old factory buildings in Egglham and consumed most of the company's archives and work models.&lt;ref&gt;Article in the PNP (Passauer Neue Presse) on tuesday February 16th 1999, "Lokalteil Pfarrkirchen, Großbrand bei der Firma Eichhorn" by Ronald Sterr ("Regional News of Pfarrkirchen, Large Fire at the Eichhorn Company").&lt;/ref&gt;

Heros (He+ros), the company of Hermann Rossberg of [[Lam, Germany|Lam]] in the [[Bavarian Forest]] near to the border of Bohemia, influenced train design in the Blumenau tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baukastensammler.de/sammlung/werbung/holzbaukasten/ereuter/fairycastlemain.html Advertising Sheet] from ca. 1935 from the company Baukastenfabrik E. Reuter,

In the 1970s the company experimented with plastic tracks based on the peg and hole design of the wooden tracks, but soon returned to normal wooden tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Set [http://213.179.68.166/nb-cgi/query1.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Chida;DATEN=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cinv;THE=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cidx;USER=test;BAG=1;POS=1;DOK_TPL=foto_list.tpl;LIST_TPL=foto_doc.tpl;FCT=g;i3370=;N_3370=0;R_3370=%3D;i499=;N_499=1;R_499=%3D;O_499=and;i2017=heros;N_2017=2;R_2017=%3D;O_2017=and;i140=;N_140=3;R_140=%3D;O_140=and;i353=;N_353=4;R_353=%3D;O_353=and;i360=;N_360=5;R_360=%3D;O_360=and;itext=;N_text=6;R_text=%3D;O_text=and;query=and:2017:=:heros*;result=11;KEY=inv%20n1002970; "Kleinstadt 4800"], Spielzeug Museum Nürnberg, Number 1977.43&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the company had to be sold to the [[Simba-Dickie-Group]]. The train lines where dropped and the focus shifted to wooden toy blocks and the constructor toy range while Eichhorn became the only supplier of toy trains on a wooden track system within the Simba-Dickie-Group.

===The 1990s, new companies and new ideas===

"[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]" is a character created by the [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' of children's books, first published in the U.K. in 1945. In 1984 a television series called ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]'' was made, adding to the popularity of the characters. It was first broadcast in the United States in 1989. John W. Lee founded the company "[[Learning Curve Brands|Learning Curve Toys]]" in November 1992 with a wooden railway system called "[[Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway|Thomas &amp; Friends]]" based on the Thomas the Tank Engine characters. This made the wooden toy trains even more popular than before. Learning Curve introduced some new designs for the track surface, such as the "Clickety Clack" rails patented 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5454513.html US Patent 5,454,513 from Oct.3,1995]&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer tracks in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6648237.html US Patent 6,648,237 B2 from Nov.18,2003]&lt;/ref&gt; with a relief to supply better traction grip for battery powered four wheel drive trains patented in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6089952.html US Patent 6089952 filed on Jan.28,1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the popularity of the toy system rising due to the success of ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'', new markets outside of the traditional groups and countries were opened. While companies such as Mapple Landmark adjusted its existing line of "Name Trains" to the gauge of the vario system in 1993, others such as [[Whittle Shortline]], established in 1997, started producing rolling stock based on the more realistic designs of existing American examples.&lt;ref&gt;This led to longer rolling stock with an own new bogie design, as [http://www.google.com/patents?id=lDYKAAAAEBAJ shown in a patent] granted to Michael W. Whitworth of Whittle Shortline in 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; While Brio and ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'' clearly favoured the steam engine era, Whittle Shortline expanded into heavy duty diesel engines of designs hardly known in Europe. In the product line "Trains of the World" shown in the Brio catalog of 1998, Brio presents several historic steam engines, such as the [[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]] or the [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]] along with several modern high speed trains such as the [[Shinkansen]], [[TGV]] or [[Intercity-Express|ICE]]. The only diesel unit is from the Santa Fe line. Another project based on real-life prototypes is the "New York City Subway Wooden Railway" by the company named "Munipals".

Other companies, such as Nilo and KidKraft, concentrated on related items like train tables, among other products. Suretrack sells its track securing clips, and Choo Choo Track &amp; Toy Co., founded in 1999, has concentrated on producing and designing tracks and accessories.

===Electronics and Asian Production Sites===

====Electronics====
Although the original push-along trains made mostly of wood still resemble the core idea of this system toy and as of 2006 form the base of all the involved companies' production lines, electronics have gained access to the wooden world. After introducing battery powered engines in the 1990s, remote control had been added by 2002, and so-called smart tracks introduced plastic parts to the wooden track pieces. In 2006 Brio even introduced a theme resembling electronic networking with some electronic gadgets. Altogether this has led to some new track designs allowing better traction for the self powered trains or means of communication between the tracks and trains using some magnetic or electronic gadget.

====Asian production====
As with other toys, many wooden trains and track have been manufactured in China and other Asian countries in the twenty-first century. The lead paint problems of 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://recalls.rc2.com/recalls_Wood_0607.html Lead paint recall of June 13th, 2007, by RC2 Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; brought this to public awareness. Manufacturing in Asia goes back a lot further though: already in the 1950s the Snap-Trains of Ben Orel were made in Japan.

Probably the first major brand that was manufactured in China was the Chicago-based "Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway". Some of the design, such as the character faces and the spoked wheels, have stayed unique to the brand while other attributes, such as the modular build of the units with a rectangular single block chassis holding the wheels and individual buildup on top, have become widespread designs in China and elsewhere. Another major brand is Maxim. Starting with traditional rather plain and abstract designs, Maxim sold products under the name "Tumble Tree Wood" for retail stores. They have since adopted their current design with a winged number on their rolling stock. The main supplier is a factory in [[Dongguan|Dong Guan]], China. The trains with the winged numbers are also sold by other brands such as Babalu in Germany. In 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18toys.html?pagewanted=print New York Times article of September 18, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Brio of Sweden moved most of their production to three factories in [[Guangdong]] Province, China. A more recent brand is Melissa &amp; Doug that is also produced in China. Smaller projects were the short-lived ventures of Remus and Europlay.

A producer that has sold its products under very many brands including its own name is Mentari Massen, with its main factory founded in 1988 in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia. Their items have been sold as sets or individually bundled under such brand names as elile, FunToys, Toytopia, The Toy Company, Bino, Snap on Tools and Bigjigs, as well as Mentari Toys or Mentari Group.

A quite prolific producer with its own clear design is Plantoys of Thailand. They have been making children's toys and furniture from rubber wood, which has since been adopted by other companies. They have a range of car and city related sets that could be used as accessories for the wooden toy train ranges of other producers. They had a joint venture with Brio in 2001–2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA225766.html?q=plan+toy Note] at the www.playthings.com site on the joint venture plans of Brio and Plan Toys from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. By 2007 they had started their own line of wooden trains, expanding it in 2008.

In 1985, Bigjigs Toys Ltd started out by selling a large range of wooden jigsaws. Then in the 1990s they moved into the wooden railway market with a small core range of wooden railway system items. In 2007 they re-launched their railway range under the brand Bigjigs Rail, in new blue sky and green hills packaging. There are, as of 2012, over 130 pieces in the Bigjigs Rail range including sets, track and a range of real life engines such as Mallard, Duchess of Hamilton and Bluebell.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==The track system==
Although the products of many companies are quite compatible with each other they may vary in make, the wood used and some basic measurements. Popular woods used and advertised thus are [[beech]], [[maple]] and [[rubber tree]].

=== The gauge ===
[[Image:Woodtrackprofil.png|right|thumb|Profiles of wooden tracks for toy trains]]
Track grooves are 3&amp;nbsp;mm deep, 5&amp;nbsp;mm wide and have 20&amp;nbsp;mm between them. The tracks themselves are 40&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 12&amp;nbsp;mm high. To be kept on track the system can be reduced to a shallow groove 30&amp;nbsp;mm wide, as in some road systems or small ramps that allow the vehicle to get on or off the track from the floor, or to a middle section 20&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 3&amp;nbsp;mm high, as in some beginners tracks or double track road systems. Most modern track systems have a somewhat sophisticated profile with varying degrees of slanted sides for the grooves or rounded edges. In the imperial system the tracks have been described as having grooves an eighth of an inch deep, a quarter of an inch wide and with three quarters of an inch between them. The tracks themselves are one and a half inches wide and half an inch high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pw1.netcom.com/~thoog/hnr/hnr.html Todd Hoogerland on the Gauge Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike other model railroading gauges, which have been formally defined by enthusiast groups such as the [[National Model Railroad Association]] or the [[Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen]], there is no agreed gauge for wooden trains. The actual cross sectional profile of any given manufacturer's track is usually patented, compelling new manufacturers to alter their track design enough to allow compatibility with other brands without committing patent infringement.

===Flipping track pieces===
Some track pieces such as curves and points have grooves on both sides so that they can be used from both sides. By flipping the piece around one can convert a left-hand curve or point to a right-handed one. Another possibility is to have the two grooves for trains on the one side and the single wide groove for roads on the other side. Ben Orel describes such a system in U.S. patent #3013726,&lt;ref name="Orel-1961" /&gt; which he submitted in 1960. Learning Curve made such tracks for their "Thomas the Tank Engine" theme.

===The Vario system===
When trying to document a layout with exact geometry one quickly notices that a lot of layouts one builds with real track do not work using a CAD system or some track layout program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodenrailway.info/track/trackmath.html John Mechalas on track layout geometry with the Vario System.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the so-called "vario system" which allows some play when joining the tracks, so that with some wiggling around one can make layouts line up perfectly with no danger of derailing trains which do not use the exact geometry of the pieces. This is achieved by making the pegs somewhat smaller than the holes. Sometimes the round part of the hole is not an exact circle but rather an ellipse, allowing the tracks to connect with a small gap between them. Also, the neck gap does not have a sharp edge at the end of the track, but is carved round. This may have started as a production loss or to make it easier for small children to join the tracks. Some sources{{who|date=July 2012}} state that Eichhorn was the first to design connections using this system.

===Some track and layout geometry===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Though not all manufacturers use the same system for their track piece designs some principle standards have evolved, as the geometry involved with track systems tends to pose the same problems to everyone. The first question may be how to divide the circle. The standard for wooden tracks is eight pieces. The next important length is the diameter of the circle made of a line along the center of the tracks. This length is useful for figures such as an eight with the crossing at right angles, a simple L-figure, a bulge to one side or a spectacles or Mickey Mouse head, to name the simplest.

A division in two gives a handy piece of straight track. For the figure eight one could use two straight pieces to go underneath and a bridge made to the same length to cross over the other straights. If one wants a crossing on the same level, the diameter can be divided by three and a crossing piece made with straights of that length. Of course one can also produce pieces of a quarter diameter length to put to the left and right of a central bridge piece that is half the length of the diameter. As one can see, it is useful to determine the length of the straight tracks by dividing the diameter of the circle made by the curves. Brio uses lengths of half, quarter and eighth as well as a third and sixth.

To solve problems of offset produced by points that branch out at the same angle producing parallel tracks, it is also useful to design such points and switches so that one of the short straights can compensate the offset. An easy way to design points is by tracing a long and a curved track to the same piece using the same connecting point as the origin. Such a merged piece can thus serve as a curve for one branch and a straight for the other while using the same dimensions as the other pieces.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Road systems===
Several approaches have been made over time to add a road system to the railway tracks. The first and still most widely used level crossings use simple ramps that enable vehicles to cross the thick tracks from whatever underground the tracks are placed on. The simplest way to add roads to this existing solution is to provide a layout printed on a paper or plastic sheet or even a carpet that uses the dimensions of the wooden tracks. Some companies have made thin track pieces out of plastic or other materials that can be joined by some connecting system and have special crossover pieces to allow playing together with a wooden railway system. The next step seems to have been road track pieces of similar thickness as the railway tracks but using some other connecting design. Using the same "peg and hole" system as the railway tracks seems to have come later. The "Thomas the Tank Engine" theme from Learning Curve used track pieces that had the traditional railway design on one side and a new road design on the other using a design invented by Ben Orel in 1960. These roads had the same profile and measurements as the railway tracks, except that the part between the grooves was missing so that the road was a broad "groove" with sidings or curbs. The road vehicles and the railway rolling stock could be used interchangeable on both systems. Brio had introduced a track with wider grooves that was used for trains aimed at a younger age group. These used the same connection system as the other tracks and had the same distance between the grooves. This made it possible for the normal trains to run on the wider tracks. When these wide grooves have the same width as the "Thomas the Tank Engine" road pieces they can be used as a two way road. Other companies have since adopted this system.

==The rolling stock and accessories==

=== Design origins and developments ===
[[Image:Heros Lok01.png|right|thumb|220px|3d Ldraw rendering of a wooden toy locomotive in the style of HEROS around 1970]]
Early sets such as of Skaneateles,&lt;ref&gt;Marshal H. Larrabee claiming a [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPATD128493 patent] for his original ornamental design in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Eichhorn and Brio all seem to have used rather simple and abstract designs. The pieces were not painted, so that trains and tracks had the same surface. The normal early trains had engines and wagons each carved from a single piece of wood and connected by hooks and eyes. Painted sets may have become common in the early 1970s, as did the use of magnets as connectors. Engines carved from a single block were commonly painted black in Europe with bright red funnels and wheels. The early trains made with construction sets and large pull-along trains may have influenced other early train designs that were built of several wood pieces ("cut broomstick design" among others). Normally each wooden piece had its own color, thus an engine, for example, could sport six different colors: one each for the base plate, the cylindrical boiler, the drivers cabin, the cabin roof, the funnels and the wheels. Sets with painted patterns seem to have become more popular in the late 1980s and 1990s. This may have been due to the success of the "Thomas the Tank Engine" series and the wish for more realistic real world designs.

As of 2007 there seem to be several design trends:
* One group seems to emphasize the material wood. Some are simple "back to the roots" designs, while others take a more artistic approach, searching for new ways to abstract the train theme.
* Another group tries to stay true to the material wood but use more realistic designs with series based on famous real life trains.
* A modern view is to use more and more plastic and build battery powered and remote controlled objects, with electronic devices gaining ground.
* Specialty trains for specific purposes like alphabet trains and name trains, as well as decoration sets like birthday trains with candles and promotional designs for special events.

Train tables are a popular way to set up trains and railways, with fixed versions often placed in waiting rooms at hospitals, doctors' offices, or other places where some entertainment for children may be offered. This way they stay off the ground and it is not necessary to take apart the track after it is built!  Wooden railway layouts based on the [[wTrak]] module standard have become part of [[model railroad]] shows in the [[United States]] - starting in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in 2009.

===Bridges and tunnels===
Early Skaneateles sets had rectangular supports that raised the track gradually. Due to the different connection system Skaneateles used at that time, tracks could be easily bent upwards at the connection point. The two-piece bridge with massive, self-supporting, ramps has been common since the 1960s. Provided with supports, this bridge could be easily elongated using normal straights. More modern bridge designs have used large amounts of plastic since the 1980s, reducing the amount of wood needed and thus producing lighter and cheaper designs. A sturdy basic bridge is the three-part bridge with the connections in the ramp section. Such designs seem to be aimed at the youngest players as they do not come apart easily. However, the design is not extendable. The two part bridge led to the development of some raised track pieces. First versions had [[viaduct]]-like designs or sported some sort of gadget like a [[drawbridge]]. Later ramps were track bent in an S-shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.179.68.166/nb-cgi/getdoc.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Chida;DATEN=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cinv;THE=c%3A%5Cdata%5Csp_nb%5Cidx;USER=test;BAG=1;POS=2;DOK_TPL=foto_doc_ausw.tpl;LIST_TPL=foto_ausw.tpl;FCT=g;COOK=inv%20n0011960%3C%3Einv%20n0024334%3C%3Einv%20n1012511%3C%3Einv%20n0013757%3C%3Einv%20n0014310%3C%3Einv%20n0014458%3C%3Einv%20n0017264%3C%3Einv%20n0019107%3C%3Einv%20n0020094%3C%3Einv%20n0021890%3C%3Einv%20n0024184%3C%3Einv%20n0025561%3C%3Einv%20n0026811%3C%3Einv%20n0029329%3C%3Einv%20n0029351%3C%3Einv%20n0033088%3C%3Einv%20n0033809%3C%3Einv%20n1002509%3C%3Einv%20n1002970%3C%3Einv%20n1004284%3C%3Einv%20n1004285%3C%3Einv%20n1007721%3C%3Einv%20n1009617%3C%3Einv%20n1009619%3C%3Einv%20n1009620%3C%3Einv%20n1010543%3C%3Einv%20n1012510%3C%3Einv%20n1018155%3C%3Einv%20n1011851%3C%3Einv%20n1020065%3C%3Einv%20n1020066%3C%3Einv%20n1020067;KEY=inv%20n1012511; Brio Bridge from before 1981], Spielzeug Museum Nürnberg, Number 1981.5111&lt;/ref&gt; As these were not self-supporting, new sorts of elevated track pieces were introduced. These consisted of a short piece of track raised by four legs. These supports were stackable and based on a square design, so that the direction could be changed by a right angle turn on the different levels.

===Buildings===
Early buildings had windows and doors made by drawing lines in a single color on simple rectangular blocks. Sometimes they had slanted roofs made with another piece of wood, painted another color, stacked on top. A common early station design consisted of a simple platform with a roof on two or three supports along the longer axis. Later buildings have printed multicolor patterns. There have always been building sets that were similar to the popular [[Toy block|wooden building blocks]], allowing lots of individual designs. Since the 1990s building designs have become more sophisticated and interaction with the trains has increased. Learning Curve may have made this approach popular with many designs based on the story plots of the ''Thomas the Tank'' series, such as a grain loader accessory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6592427.html based on a U.S. Patent filed on Feb. 11 1999] (Toy vehicle grain loader accessory)&lt;/ref&gt; or a logging mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6015329.html US Patent filed on Jan. 28 1998] (Toy vehicle logging mill accessory)&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s analogous to the [[W and Z bosons]], but corresponding to a new type of force predicted by the [[Georgi–Glashow model]], a [[grand unified theory]].

==Details==
The X and Y bosons couple [[quark]]s to [[lepton]]s, allowing violation of the conservation of [[baryon number]], and thus permitting [[proton decay]].

An X boson would have the following [[decay mode]]s:&lt;ref name="XY decay"&gt;

where the two decay products in each process have opposite [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]], {{Subatomic particle|Up quark}} is an [[up quark]],  {{Subatomic particle|Down antiquark}} is a [[down antiquark]] and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} is a [[positron]].

A Y boson would have the following [[decay mode]]s:&lt;ref name="XY decay"/&gt;

Similar decay products exist for the other [[Generation (particle physics)|quark-lepton generations]].

In these reactions, neither the [[lepton number]] (''L'') nor the [[baryon number]] (''B'') is conserved, but [[B−L|{{nowrap|''B'' − ''L''}}]] is. Different [[branching ratio]]s between the X boson and its antiparticle (as is the case with the [[K-meson]]) would explain [[baryogenesis]]. For instance, if an {{Subatomic particle|X Boson}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/{{Subatomic particle|X Boson}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; pair is created out of energy, and they follow the two branches described above: {{Subatomic particle|X Boson}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Subatomic particle|Up quark}} + {{Subatomic particle|Up quark}},  {{Subatomic particle|X Boson}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Subatomic particle|Down quark}} + {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}; re-grouping the result ( {{Subatomic particle|Up quark}} + {{Subatomic particle|Up quark}} + {{Subatomic particle|Down quark}} ) + {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} = {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Proton}} + {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} shows it to be a hydrogen atom.

'''Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority''', ('''ZESA''') officially called ZESA Holdings (Pvt) LTD., is a state-owned company whose task is to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity  in [[Zimbabwe]]. It has organized this task by delegation to its subsidiaries, the energy generating company '''Zimbabwe Power Company''' (ZPC) and the '''Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company''' (ZETDC). Other subsidiaries are investment branch '''ZESA Enterprises''' (ZENT) and internet provider '''PowerTel Communications (Pvt) ltd'''. ZESA is the only electricity generator and supplier for the public grid. For many years the company has failed to produce enough energy to meet demands. ZESA produced an estimated 8.89 bill kWh in 2007, while demand was estimated to 10.89 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/zi.html |title=CIA factbook - Zimbabwe |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZESA represents Zimbabwe in the [[Southern African Power Pool]].

== Current situation ==
In general the power generation capacity in Zimbabwe is too small to meet demand from the industry and private householdings. Import of electricity from surrounding countries has eased the situation somewhat, but [[Rolling blackout|load shedding]] is used on a routine basis and some rural areas do not have electricity over long periods. Zimbabwe’s difficult economic situation causes part of the problems, as coal for power stations may at times not be produced in sufficient amounts. On the other hand, the economy is hampered by the unforeseeable energy situation. Recently the revival of the economy has increased demand.

=== Situation for the power stations ===
ZESA owns the [[Kariba Power Station]] together with its Zambian counterpart, [[ZESCO]]. The station is part of the [[Kariba Dam]] project, damming the [[Zambezi]] river. The Zimbawean-owned capacity is said to be around 750 MW. ZESA also owns four thermal power stations, of which [[Hwange Thermal Power Station]] in the extreme west of the country is by far the largest with a theoretical capacity of about 920 MW. The other three at [[Harare]], [[Bulawayo]] and [[Munyati]] have a nominal capacity of 270 MW together. In the last years the thermal power stations have only been producing part or no electricity due to coal shortages and maintenance neglect. [[Botswana Power Corporation]] (BPC) and [[Namibia]]s [[NamPower]] have in 2009 made agreements to help ZESA to revive the capacity in exchange for power deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/botswana-namibia-to-ramp-up-zim-power-generation-2009-11-05 |title=Engineering News online: Botswana, Namibia to ramp up Zim power generation|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on Hwange has led to a better situation and the three minor stations are scheduled to be revived in the first quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zimbabwefood.blogspot.com/2011/01/zimbabwe-power-company.html|title=Zimbabwe Lifestyle: Zimbabwe Power Company|last=Lind|first=Odette H.|date=2011-01-10|website=Zimbabwe Lifestyle|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 China agreed to provide a $1.2 billion loan to add 600&amp;nbsp;MW of generating capacity to the Hwange station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esi-africa.com/news/zimbabwe-china-promises-1-2bn-loan-for-hwange-thermal-power-plant-upgrade/|title=Zimbabwe: China promises $1.2bn loan for Hwange thermal power plant upgrade|work=ESI-Africa.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
