      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8860">According to some sources, there was a "[[coup d'état]]" in 1993 in [[Turkey]], allegedly organised and carried out by elements of the Turkish military through covert means. Although the early 1990s were a period of great violence in Turkey due to the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]], 1993 saw a series of suspicious deaths: of President [[Turgut Özal]], leading military figures, and journalists. Particularly in the context of the [[Ergenekon trials]] from 2008 onwards and related investigations of the Turkish "[[Deep state in Turkey|deep state]]" and of suspicious deaths from this period, claims of a "covert coup" intended to prevent a peace settlement (and to protect the covert relationships between the Turkish military, intelligence services including [[JITEM]], [[Counter-Guerrilla]], Kurdish forces including [[Kurdish Hizbollah (Turkey)|Kurdish Hizbollah]], and the [[Turkish mafia]]) have been made.

[[Fikri Sağlar]], a former member of the parliamentary commission which investigated the [[Susurluk scandal]] which first began to shed light on the Turkish deep state, is one who has made such claims, describing "a covert military coup".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 26 April 2011, [http://www.sundayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=37B7FF35580EB1812D48824AD9E7C5FB?newsId=242005&amp;columnistId=0 Sağlar says he does not understand nomination of Ergenekon suspects].

These include the [[May 24, 1993 PKK ambush]], and the [[Sivas massacre]] and [[Başbağlar massacre]] in early July.

==Overview==
In the early 1990s, President [[Turgut Özal]] agreed to negotiations with the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK), the events of the 1991 [[Gulf War]] having changed some of the geopolitical dynamics in the region. Apart from Özal, himself half-Kurdish, few Turkish politicians were interested in a peace process, nor was more than a part of the PKK itself.&lt;ref&gt;en.internationalism.org, 10 April 2013, [http://en.internationalism.org/icconline/201304/7373/internationalism-only-response-kurdish-issue Internationalism is the only response to the Kurdish issue]. Accessed 2013-07-02.

With the PKK's ceasefire declaration in hand, Özal was planning to propose a major pro-Kurdish reform package at the next meeting of the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]]. The president's death on 17 April led to the postponement of that meeting, and the plans were never presented.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Gunter, "Turgut Özal and the Kurdish question", in Marlies Casier, Joost Jongerden (eds, 2010), ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey: Political Islam, Kemalism and the Kurdish Issue'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 9 Aug 2010 pp94-5&lt;/ref&gt; A month later the [[May 24, 1993 PKK ambush]] ensured the end of the peace process. Former PKK commander [[Şemdin Sakık]] maintains the attack was part of the [[Doğu Çalışma Grubu]]'s coup plans.&lt;ref name="TZ" /&gt; Under the new Presidency of [[Süleyman Demirel]] and Premiership of [[Tansu Çiller]], the [[Castle Plan]] (to use any and all means to solve the Kurdish question using violence), which Özal had opposed, was enacted, and the peace process abandoned.&lt;ref name=TIHV&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.tihv.org.tr/tihve/data/Yayinlar/Human_Rights_Reports/Ra1998HumanRigthsReport.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205022400/http://www.tihv.org.tr/tihve/data/Yayinlar/Human_Rights_Reports/Ra1998HumanRigthsReport.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-05|title=1998 Report |year=2000 |location=Ankara |publisher=[[Human Rights Foundation of Turkey]]|ref=CITEREFHRFT1998|format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further massacres (notably the [[Sivas massacre]] and [[Başbağlar massacre]] in early July) and assassinations ensured that the peace process was well and truly buried.

==Alleged incidents==

==Investigations==
Former General [[Levent Ersöz]], who was head of [[JITEM]], and is considered a key suspect in the [[Ergenekon trials]], was charged in 2013 with having had a role in the 1993 death of President [[Turgut Özal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 16 April 2013, [http://www.todayszaman.com/news-312837-court-accepts-indictment-seeking-life-for-ersoz-over-ozals-death.html Court accepts indictment seeking life for Ersöz over Özal's death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109114002/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-312837-court-accepts-indictment-seeking-life-for-ersoz-over-ozals-death.html |date=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also had a [[tumour]] on the knee, and several broken bones from climbing trees.&lt;ref name="TST"/&gt; She grew up in Kensington and attended St Michael's Catholic Primary school in North Melbourne. She has stated that she "grew up with 42 nationalities", explaining that her [[primary school]] of 150 children was very [[multicultural]].

She lived 100 metres from the beach and it was while at the beach where she was scouted by Chic Management's Kathy Ward,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the model scout that also discovered [[Miranda Kerr]] and [[Samantha Harris (model)|Samantha Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/13/237621_gossip-news.html|title=Kathy Ward nurtures Miranda Kerr, Harris and McNeil|last=Strebe|first=Sacha|date=13 July 2010|publisher=Goldcoast|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She signed with Chic Management within weeks.&lt;ref name="New York Fashion Magazine"/&gt;

==Career==

===2007–2009===
In 2007, Kershaw signed with Next Management and by March had moved to New York City.&lt;ref name="New York Fashion Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/fashion/models/alee/abbeylee/ |title= Abbey Lee |publisher= [[New York Magazine]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December, Models.com named her the "Next Superstar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://models.com/oftheminute/?p=2322|title=Next Superstar Alert|last=wayne|date=11 December 2007|publisher=Models.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw made her debut in the 2008 [[New York Fashion Week]], managing to walk a total of 29 shows for designers such as [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Halston]], and notably closing for [[Rodarte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/02/all_fashion_week_weve_pitted.html|title=Karlie Kloss Is Fashion Week’s Top Model|date=11 February 2008|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her first time in [[Milan Fashion Week]], she was booked as a [[Gucci]] exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/02/gucci_books_abbey_lee_exclusiv.html|title=Gucci Books Abbey Lee Exclusive|last=Herbst|first=Kendall|date=19 February 2008|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in September, she fell in her high heels at the [[Rodarte]] show in [[New York Fashion Week|New York]].&lt;ref name="stumble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2008/09/blasblog-abby-lees-stumble-and-fall/|title=Blasblog: Abby Lee’s Stumble And Fall|last=Blasberg|first=Derek|date=9 September 2008|work=Style File blog|publisher=[[Style.com]]|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, a month later in [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], she fainted at the [[Alexander McQueen]] show from wearing a very tight leather corset.&lt;ref name="catwalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/2008/10/abbey_lee_kersh.html|title=Abbey Lee Kershaw faints on catwalk at Alexander McQueen|last=Foster|first=Kimberley|date=7 October 2008|website=|publisher=catwalkqueen.tv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214113321/http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/2008/10/abbey_lee_kersh.html|archive-date=14 February 2009|dead-url=Yes|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of these two incidents, it did not affect her from booking more runways shows.&lt;ref name="stumble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="catwalk"/&gt; Kershaw was one of new faces to appear on one of the fourteen covers of ''[[V (American magazine)|V magazine's]]'' Autumn issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/09/v_mag_slideshow.html |title=Ogle ‘V’ Magazine’s Fourteen New Cover Models |last=Lim |first=James |date=10 September 2008 |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018081307/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/09/v_mag_slideshow.html |archivedate=18 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2008, in [[Miami]], she made her international TV appearance at the [[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show]], modelling in the ''Pink Planet'' segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vsholic.com/gallery/2008/|title=Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2008 Gallery|access-date=27 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603225723/http://vsholic.com/gallery/2008/|archive-date=3 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his defense, Kershaw said, "Terry doesn't force girls to do anything they don't want to. He puts you in a [[G-string]] in a pile of mud because you want to do it. You touch yourself because you want to. For me, that shoot was the truth about how things were between us both, and I felt good doing it.

'''''Alaska v. Amerada Hess et al.''''', officially known as '''State v. Amerada Hess et al.''' (1JU-77-877) was a 15-year-long [[civil lawsuit]] levied by the state of Alaska against 17 of the world's largest [[oil]] companies for underpayment of oil production [[royalties]]. The case was named after [[Amerada Hess]], the first company in the alphabetical list of defendants. The case cost the state more than $100 million to [[prosecute]], and all 17 companies [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] out of court rather than face trial. The total settlements amounted to just over $600 million of the $902 million the state alleged had been underpaid. Additional settlements covering underpaid natural gas royalties and refining royalties amounted to another $400 million.

Under a law passed by the [[Alaska Legislature]], the settlement money was invested in a separate account of the [[Alaska Permanent Fund]]. The Amerada Hess account, worth more than $424 million as of June 30, 2013, may not be used for the payment of [[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]s and instead is used for infrastructure projects. Since the case was settled, it has been used as an example of oil industry malfeasance in political and popular arguments.

==Background==
In 1955, representatives from across Alaska met at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks|University of Alaska]] to draft the [[Alaska Constitution]], a document that would not become effective until 1959, when [[Alaska Statehood Act|Alaska became a state]]. Many of the delegates were aware that the new state would be heavily dependent upon development of its natural resources, an attitude typified by a speech made by [[Bob Bartlett]], then Alaska's non-voting delegate to Congress: "The financial welfare of the future state and the well-being of its present and unborn citizens depend upon the wise administration and oversight of these [resource] development activities, [and] without adequate safeguards, the state of Alaska will wend a precarious way along the road that leads eventually to financial insolvency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Doogan|Doogan, G. Michael]]. "Alaska Mineral Revenues," ''Alaska Geographic'' 9, No. 4 (1982), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the concerns of Bartlett and others, the resulting constitution requires the Alaska Legislature to maximize resource development for the "benefit of its people." To provide a concrete tool for that goal, the constitution authorizes legislators to "provide for the leasing of ... any part of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;''Alaska Constitution'', Article VIII, sections 1, 2, and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most governments at the time raised revenue through production taxes, conservation taxes, income taxes and property taxes, allowing the leasing of public land meant the state could also garner bonuses, rent, and royalties from anyone leasing public land for development. In Alaska, especially in relation to oil production, a bonus is the amount paid by a company for the right to lease a piece of property. Rent is the amount paid on a regular basis to maintain that lease. A royalty is a portion of anything produced by that piece of land.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

After statehood, one of the first actions of the Alaska Legislature was to pass the Alaska Lands Act, which established the framework for Alaska's oil revenue system. The Alaska Lands Act created a bonus and rent system and established that the state must collect a royalty of at least 12.5 percent from its leased public land.&lt;ref name="B81"&gt;Bleakley, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; To implement the Alaska Lands Act, the state created a master lease agreement, named DL-1. Under the terms of the agreement, the royalty (which could be paid in oil or cash value) was to be assessed on the value of the oil "at the well."&lt;ref name="B81"/&gt;

In 1964, oil companies began exploring state land on Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] for oil deposits. On. December 26, 1967, the 40-person crew of Prudhoe Bay State No. 1 well heard a noise that one geologist said sounded like the rumbling of four jumbo jets. It was an enormous plume of natural gas signifying the discovery of the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, pp. 569-574.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 1969, the state held an oil lease sale for Prudhoe Bay and netted more than $900 million. Eight years and [[Construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|one of the world's largest construction projects]] later, the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was ready to ship its first oil to [[Valdez, Alaska]] and shipment outside the state.

In the weeks before shipments began, the state learned that the oil companies had a different interpretation of the terms of DL-1 than the state did. The state sent letters and proposals to resolve the agreement, then set a deadline of September 1, 1977, for them to respond. When no response was received, the state filed a formal court complaint in Alaska Superior Court against all 18 companies leasing oil-producing ground on the North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
In its complaint against the oil companies, the state said the oil companies were interpreting the phrase "at the well" incorrectly and were thus violating the terms of the Prudhoe Bay lease agreement. This came to be known as the "where" argument. At Prudhoe Bay, [[crude oil]] comes out of the ground thick, under great pressure, and mixed with substances including water, [[butane]] and [[pentane]]. During the [[crude oil production]] process, the pressure must be reduced and suspended substances must be removed. Only once this has taken place does the oil enter the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system at Pump Station No. 1. At the pump station are "Lease Automatic Custody Meters" that measure the flow through the pipeline.&lt;ref name="Johnson, pp. 44-47"&gt;Johnson, pp. 44-47&lt;/ref&gt; The state argued that the proper place to measure the royalty oil was at the LACT meters, after it had been purified and readied for transport. This oil was worth more than the raw crude oil, and the oil companies favored a measuring point before purification. Such a measurement would lower their royalty payments to the state because the oil would be worth less.&lt;ref name="Johnson, pp. 44-47"/&gt;

The state also said producers were incorrectly valuing the royalty oil in their reports to the state and improperly "determining, allocating, computing or otherwise accounting" for expenses that could be deducted from royalty payments.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; According to the master lease, the state's royalty value was supposed to be the highest of three formulas: the actual market price at the well; the posted price at the field; or the prevailing price other producers got at the well. None of those methods worked at Prudhoe Bay because there were no buyers on the North Slope. In place of those formulas, the state figured out a "netback" pricing formula to determine the value of the oil at the oil well by subtracting transportation costs from a hypothetical value at one of two markets, the West Coast or the Gulf Coast. The state alleged that the oil companies understated the value of their oil and overstated their transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, George. "Oil-fees battle to court: Amerada Hess suit a fight for royalties," ''Anchorage Daily News''. April 13, 1992. Page B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Where' argument==
In November 1977, the state of Alaska filed for [[summary judgment]] on the first count of its lawsuit, the so-called "where" argument. The state argued that using the LACT meters as a measuring point was an appropriate interpretation of "at the well," because before that point, the oil was not marketable and ready for transport. In oral arguments before Alaska Superior Court judge [[Allen Compton]] in December 1978, the state compared oil extraction to the logging industry. When a tree is cut down, it must first be stripped of branches and bark before it is taken to a mill for refinement into lumber. The state also pointed to the fact that oil fields on the [[Kenai Peninsula]] and [[Cook Inlet]] had used LACT meters as the definition of "at the well" with no prior argument.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil companies responded that using the LACT meters was a practice inspired by federal rules, and when the state crafted its constitution, it had intended to move away from federal rules. Therefore, it was not appropriate to base Prudhoe Bay royalties on prior practices established in southern Alaska before statehood.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1979, Compton ruled in favor of the state, saying the LACT meters were the appropriate point for measurement and that it was improper to take deductions before that point. Following his initial ruling, however, the process of reviewing his decision turned into a 17-month affair that ended in August 1980 when the litigants agreed to settle the issue out of court. Both sides agreed that the LACT meters were the correct location for measurement, but the state agreed to allow a field cost deduction of 42 cents per barrel for pre-1980 oil and 42 cents times the result of the Producer Price Index for the previous year, divided by the PPI for June 1977, for post-1980 oil.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delays==
In the years that followed the settlement on count one of the lawsuit, the case was repeatedly delayed by the legal maneuvering of both parties. Contemporary and historical accounts, however, place most of the blame for the delays on the oil companies. "The disputed millions of dollars, after all, were literally in [the oil companies'] pockets; they were making interest on it, and they were in no hurry to get rid of it," wrote William Johnson in a history of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Compton stepped down from the case due to personal reasons and was replaced by Rodger Pegues in 1982. Soon after his appointment, it was revealed that he had worked for several oil companies as an attorney in Alaska. This created a potential conflict of interest, and Superior Court Judge [[Walter Carpeneti]] replaced Pegues on September 9, 1983.&lt;ref name="J82"&gt;Johnson, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1982, [[Bill Sheffield]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], replaced [[Jay Hammond]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] as [[governor of Alaska]].  Under the new administration, the state became more aggressive about prosecuting its case.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1983, the state amended its lawsuit with a claim for damages, saying producers had shorted it $902 million between 1977 and 1986. Since six years of royalties were contested, the state was persuaded that it was owed a sizable amount.&lt;ref name="J82"/&gt;

As the case moved into its [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] phase, the state requested several years' worth of oil company records but was met with stern opposition. The companies involved believed that those records could provide an advantage to their competitors if they were made public. In 1984, the state agreed to a protective order: The records taken in discovery could be labeled either confidential or "highly confidential." Under the former designation, they were kept with normal courtroom secrecy. Under the latter designation, the documents were kept under tighter protection determined by both sides in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal court==
In 1987, one day before Judge Carpeneti was to set a trial date, [[Standard Oil]], [[Chevron Corporation]] and Exxon asked to transfer the case to federal court. Based on the existence of the Alaska Permanent Fund, they claimed that they could not receive a fair trial in Alaska because any potential jurors were potential recipients of the proceeds of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Permanent Fund, established by governor Hammond to receive profits from the state's oil taxation and royalty system, is designed to distribute an annual dividend payment to all Alaska residents who have lived in the state for at least one year. In their complaint, the companies said a trial could result in a $2 billion windfall for the state, worth $1,200 per Alaskan if distributed through the Permanent Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Patti. "Oil companies want trial moved," ''Anchorage Daily News''. November 3, 1987. Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal district court judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]] heard the case but recused himself because he was an Alaska resident and thus a Permanent Fund Dividend recipient. The [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] assigned [[Robert Belloni]], a non-Alaskan, to the case. In June 1988, he ruled that the case could go forward but that there were constitutional concerns that needed to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The oil companies appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in an attempt to have the lawsuit thrown out, based on Belloni's findings, but the court ruled that would be premature without giving the state time to respond. In 1989 and again in 1991, the Alaska Legislature passed legislation that required any proceeds from the ''Amerada Hess'' case be set aside in a separate account of the Permanent Fund, inaccessible to the dividend program.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 118, 133&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decided not to hear an appeal of the Ninth Circuit's decision, and the case returned to Alaska Superior Court, where it moved toward trial.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, George. "Exxon motion denied," ''Anchorage Daily News''. March 13, 1992. Page B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==
Starting in 1989, the oil companies sued by the state of Alaska began to settle out of court rather than face a trial. Amerada Hess Corp. was the pioneer of this approach, agreeing in December 1989 to pay the state $319,000 to settle its part of the lawsuit, the full amount claimed by the state plus costs, interest and attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Patti. "Oil company settles dispute with state," ''Anchorage Daily News''. December 22, 1989. Page D2.&lt;/ref&gt; ARCO, which was accused of shorting the state of more than $320 million in royalty payments and interest, was the second company to settle. It paid $287 million, about 60 percent of the amount the state was seeking, and the state agreed to drop a $100 million fraud lawsuit against ARCO as well.&lt;ref&gt;Fararo, Kim. "State, ARCO settle dispute over royalties," ''Anchorage Daily News''. September 12, 1990. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fararo, Kim and Postman, David. "ARCO antes up $287 million in disputed royalties," ''Anchorage Daily News''. September 13, 1990. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two settlements set a precedent, and one by one, other producers settled with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, David. "Oil company, state apt to settle royalty dispute," ''Anchorage Daily News''. October 6, 1990. Page B5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postman, David. "Another oil firm settles," Anchorage Daily News. October 11, 1990. Page D5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, George. "$185 million settles BP's tiff with state," ''Anchorage Daily News''. December 27, 1991. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The lone holdout was Exxon, which was alleged to owe $170 million. It waited until the day jury selection began before agreeing to pay $128.5 million to close the case.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, George. "Oil royalty suit reported to be settled," ''Anchorage Daily News''. April 14, 1992. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Exxon was the last of the defendants in the original Amerada Hess case, the state spent four more years prosecuting lawsuits against subsidiary companies affected by the issue. These included refineries and companies that produced or transported [[liquefied natural gas]] products through the Trans-Alaska pipeline system.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ralph. "MAPCO to pay $95 million to state," ''Anchorage Daily News''. September 2, 1994. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these cases was settled out of court in April 1995, putting an end to the last aspects of the Amerada Hess case.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ralph. "State settles oil fight," ''Anchorage Daily News''. April 7, 1995. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the lawsuit==
In total, the state spent nearly $100 million building its lawsuit and earned about $1 billion in total settlements.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;Alaska Office of Management and Budget. [https://omb.alaska.gov/ombfiles/06_budget/AmeradaHess.pdf "Amerada Hess Royalty Oil Dispute and Settlement,"] 2006. Retrieved September 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of the case have been contested as either a victory for the oil companies or for the state. While Alaska's government received almost $1 billion in windfall revenue, it gave up hundreds of millions of dollars to achieve that settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the case and the time needed to achieve a result has resulted in it becoming a common example of the need in Alaska politics to keep a careful watch on oil company activities.&lt;ref&gt;Stigall, Russell, [http://juneauempire.com/local/2012-03-30/senate-leader-advises-wary-friendship-oil-and-gas-industry "Senate leader advises wary friendship with oil and gas industry,"] ''Juneau Empire''. March 30, 2012. Retrieved September 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1991 legislation approved by the Alaska Legislature, 75 percent of the Amerada Hess proceeds were deposited in the Alaska Constitutional Budget Reserve. The remaining quarter was deposited in a special account of the Alaska Permanent Fund.&lt;ref name="OMB"/&gt; According to the 2013 annual report of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, the Hess account had a balance of $424,399,000 as of June 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation.

'''Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility''' is a non-profit, anti-nuclear, public interest organization founded in 2005, and based in San Luis Obispo, California. It is focused on public citizen activism and public participation with regard to the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]], also known as the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everythingnuclear.org/|title=Everything Nuclear, The Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility|website=everythingnuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the group is primarily on using leverage at the level of state agencies such as the [[California Public Utilities Commission]]. Concurrent jurisdiction of their concern also includes the [[California Coastal Commission]], which certifies compliance of all action within the coastal zone which thus includes the plant. Their posture is primarily oppositional. Other venues for activism include the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], [[California Energy Commission]], Regional Water Quality Control Board, SLO County, the California legislature, the office of the state attorney general, and the US Congress, of which they are in the 23rd District.&lt;ref&gt;Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Rochelle Becker is a co-founder and the current executive director, and has contended experience on nuclear safety issues for 35 years. According to the Alliance website, she is on a California state review committee analyzing water-related impacts from aging reactors, and has met with NRC Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] to discuss the position of the Alliance. She is also active on issues pertaining to the [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station]] (SONGS). 

David Weisman is also active with the Alliance, and recently has interviewed widely with respect to the Fukushima aftermath. Mr. Weisman asserts that the Alliance is pro-labor and in support of jobs, and that nuclear power is not economical. The Alliance distinguishes itself in this regard from organizations such as the [[Sierra Club]], which are primarily focused on the environmental impacts of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nukefree.org/node/181|title=The Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility leads successful effort to retain California’s nuclear safeguard laws.|website=www.nukefree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recently appeared at a Nuclear Regulatory Commission presentations, in the San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties on June 15 and 16th, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors Archived Minutes - upgraded citation pending&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] have traditionally been skeptical of or vehemently opposed to [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Nicolas_Walter__Anarchism_and_Religion.html Nicolas Walter. "Anarchism and Religion"]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some anarchists have provided religious interpretations and approaches to anarchism, including the idea that glorification of the state is a form of sinful [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, Alexandre (March 2010). "A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State". Political Studies Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, Alexandre (2010). Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel. Exeter: Imprint Academic. p. 254. "The state as idolatry"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchist clashes with religion==
[[File:Facciamo breccia 2008 by Stefano Bolognini18.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Members of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] marching in an [[anticlerical]] demonstration. The banner reads "Free from dogmas, always [[heresy|heretics]]"]]Anarchists "are generally [[Irreligion|non-religious]] and are frequently [[Antireligion|anti-religious]], and the standard anarchist slogan is the phrase coined by a non-anarchist, the socialist [[Auguste Blanqui]] in 1880: ‘Ni Dieu ni maître!’ (Neither God nor master!)...The argument for a negative connection is that religion supports politics, the Church supports the State, opponents of political authority also oppose religious authority".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

[[William Godwin]], "the author of the ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' (1793), the first systematic text of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] politics, was a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister who began by rejecting [[Christianity]], and passed through [[deism]] to [[atheism]] and then what was later called [[agnosticism]]."&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; The pioneering German [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Max Stirner]], "began as a [[Left-Hegelianism|left-Hegelian]], post-[[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbachian]] atheist, rejecting the ‘spooks’ of religion as well as of politics including the spook of ‘humanity’".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], "the first person to call himself an anarchist, who was well known for saying, ‘[[Property is theft!|Property is theft]]’, also said, ‘God is evil’ and ‘God is the eternal X’".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

Published posthumously in [[French language|French]] in 1882, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s ''[[God and the State]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |year=1916 |author=Michael Bakunin |accessdate=2010-05-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430101122/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html| archivedate= 30 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first anarchist treatises on religion. Bakunin expounds his philosophy of religion's place in history and its relationship to the modern political state. It was later published in [[English language|English]] by [[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth Publications]] in 1916. [[Anarcho-communism]]'s main theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]], "was a child of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, and assumed that religion would be replaced by science and that the Church as well as the State would be abolished; he was particularly concerned with the development of a secular system of ethics which replaced supernatural theology with natural biology".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

[[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Carlo Cafiero]], "the main founders of the Italian anarchist movement, both came from [[freethinking]] families (and Cafiero was involved with the [[National Secular Society]] when he visited London during the 1870s)".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; In the [[French anarchist movement]] [[Élisée Reclus|Eliseé Reclus]] was a son of a Calvinist minister, and began by rejecting religion before moving on to anarchism.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; [[Sebastien Faure]], "the most active speaker and writer in the French movement for half a century"&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; wrote an essay titled ''Twelve Proofs of God's Inexistence''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_archives//bright/faure/does_god_exist.pdf Sebastien Faure. Twelve Proofs of God's Inexistence.]&lt;/ref&gt; German [[insurrectionary anarchist]] [[Johann Most]] wrote an article called "The God Pestilence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Johann_Most__The_God_Pestilence.html Johann Most. "The God Pestilence"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist [[George MacDonald]] was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''".&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf [[Wendy McElroy]]. "The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America"]&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Late 19th century/early 20th Century anarchists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] were often associated with the [[freethinkers]] movement, advocating [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairine.org/bio.html |title=Exquisite Rebel: Voltairine de Cleyre |publisher=Voltairine.org |date= |author=Sharon Presley |accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)''  Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 143]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain [[atheist]] and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)''  Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 152]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] in the early 20th century were responsible for burning several [[church (building)|church]]es, though many of the church burnings were actually carried out by members of the [[Radical Party (Spain)|Radical Party]] while anarchists were blamed. The implicit and/or explicit support by church leaders for the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|National Faction]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] greatly contributed to [[antireligion|anti-religious]] sentiment.

[[Emma Goldman]] wrote in ''Anarchism: What It Really Stands For'':
{{quote|Anarchism has declared war on the pernicious influences which have so far prevented the harmonious blending of [[Individualism|individual]] and social instincts, the individual and society. Religion, the dominion of the human mind; Property, the dominion of human needs; and Government, the dominion of human conduct, represent the stronghold of man's enslavement and all the horrors it entails.&lt;ref&gt;{{anarchives|goldman/aando/anarchism.html|"Anarchism: What It Really Stands For"}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Anarchism in China|Chinese anarchists]] led the opposition to Christianity in the early 20th century, but the most prominent of them, [[Li Shizeng]], made it clear that he opposed not only Christianity but all religion as such. When he became president of the Anti-Christian Movement of 1922 he told the Beijing Atheists' League: "Religion is intrinsically old and corrupt: history has passed it by" and asked "Why are we of the twentieth century... even debating this nonsense from primitive ages?"{{sfnb|Zarrow|1990|p=156-157}}

==Religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions==
Religious anarchists view organised religion mostly as authoritarian and hierarchical that has strayed from its [[Humility|humble]] origins, as [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] explains:
{{quote|The original message of the great religious teachers to live a [[simple living|simple life]], to share the wealth of the earth, to treat each other with love and respect, to tolerate others and to live in peace invariably gets lost as worldly institutions take over. Religious leaders, like their political counterparts, accrue power to themselves, draw up [[dogma]]s, and wage war on [[dissenter]]s in their own ranks and the followers of other religions. They seek protection from temporal rulers, bestowing on them in return a supernatural legitimacy and magical aura. They weave webs of mystery and mystification around naked power; they join the sword with the cross and the crescent. As a result, in nearly all cases organised religions have lost the peaceful and tolerant message of their founding fathers, whether it be [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]] or [[Muhammad|Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious Anarchism: New Perspectives|year=2011|page=xx|author=Peter Marshall|editor=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos|quote=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist anarchism}}
{{Related articles|Uchiyama Gudō}}
Many Westerners who call themselves Buddhists regard the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, in contrast to most other world faiths, as [[nontheistic]], humanistic and experientially-based. Most Buddhist schools, they point out, see the Buddha as the embodied proof that [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|transcendence]] and ultimate happiness is possible for all, without exception. They note that Buddhist scriptures such as the [[Kalama Sutta]] have an inherently [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] emphasis, placing a priority on the questioning of all [[authority]] and dogma, with properly informed personal choice as final arbiter.

The Indian revolutionary and self-declared atheist [[Har Dayal]], much influenced by [[Marx]] and [[Bakunin]], who sought to expel British rule from the subcontinent, was a striking instance of someone who in the early 20th century tried to synthesize anarchist and Buddhist ideas. Having moved to the [[United States]], in 1912 he went so far as to establish in [[Oakland]]  the Bakunin Institute of California, which he described as "the first monastery of anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchist Portraits]]''  by Paul Avrich, Princeton University Press, 1988, p30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy'' by Karish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian anarchism}}
[[File:Jesus wanted poster.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by [[socialist]] cartoonist, [[Art Young]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1917.]]
According to some, [[Christianity]] began primarily as a [[anarcho-pacifism|pacifist and anarchist]] movement. Jesus is said, in this view, to have come to empower individuals and free people from an oppressive religious standard in the [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]]; he taught that the only rightful authority was God, not Man, evolving the law into the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] (see also [[liberal Christianity]]).

According to [[:Category:Christian anarchists|Christian anarchists]], there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of [[God]] as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. Christian anarchists believe that [[Privacy#Types of privacy#Privacy from government interference|freedom from government]] or Church is justified spiritually and will only be guided by the grace of God if Man shows compassion to others and [[turn the other cheek|turns the other cheek]] when confronted with violence.

As per [[Christian communism]], anarchism is not necessarily opposed by the [[Catholic Church]]. Indeed, [[Distributism]] in [[Catholic social teaching]] such as [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' and [[Pope Pius XI]]'s ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Allitt|Allitt, Patrick]] (2000). ''Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome''. [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8663-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; resembles a [[Mutualism (movement)|Mutualist]] society based on [[Cooperatives]], while [[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states "She (the Church) has...refused to accept, in the practice of "capitalism," individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human labor. Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace fails social justice". Notable Catholic anarchists include [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Peter Maurin]] who founded the [[Catholic Worker Movement]].

The [[Quaker]] church, or the Religious Society of Friends, is organized along anarchist lines.  All decisions are made locally in a community of equals where every members voice has equal weight.  While there are no formal linkages between Quakerism and anarchism and Quakers as a whole hold a wide variety of political opinions, the long tradition of Quaker involvement in social-justice work and similar outlooks on how power should be structured and decisions should be reached has led to significant crossover in membership and influence between Christian anarchists and Quakers.  The Quaker influence was particularly pronounced in the [[anti-nuclear movement]] of the 1980s and in the North American [[anti-globalization movement]], both of which included many thousands of anarchists and self-consciously adopted secular, consensus-based aspects of Quaker decision making.

===Gnosticism===
The discovery of the ancient Gnostic texts at [[Nag Hammadi Library|Nag Hammadi]] coupled with the writings of the science fiction writer [[Philip K. Dick]], especially with regard to his concept of the [[Black Iron Prison]], has led to the development of Anarcho-Gnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Radical Tradition: Philosophy, Metapolitics &amp; the Conservative Revolution'', edited by Troy Southgate, Primordial Traditions, 2011, pages 123-125 http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Publications/TheRadicalTradition.aspx{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient forms of Gnosticism had many things in common with modern ideas of anarchism: their members lived on communes with little to no private property and they practiced ceremonies led by people chosen each time by lots rather than hierarchical authority. Some Gnostic groups also practiced equality among the sexes and people of various sexual orientation; some were vegetarians. Central to all Gnostic philosophy was an individual attainment of spiritual understanding and experience rather than one based on dogma. They often had decentralized church structure and, given that Gnostics believed we are all divine and one within the "fullness," they placed a strong emphasis on equality. Gnostics saw themselves in opposition to spiritual entities called "archons," a word which means "ruler"; the word "anarchy" comes from, "anarkhos," meaning, "without rulers," and so in many ways the goal of Gnosticism is literally anarchy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Islam===
{{Main|Islam and anarchism}}
There have been anti-authoritarian traits throughout the history of [[Islam]], often related to [[Sufism]]. The end of the 20th century brought the syncretism of Islam and anarchism into a non-violent, anti-authoritarian philosophy espoused by people like [[Hakim Bey]] and Islam Hadari.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Anarchism and Orthodox Judaism|Jewish anarchism}}
While many [[Jewish anarchism|Jewish anarchists]] were irreligious or sometimes vehemently anti-religious, there were also a few religious anarchists and pro-anarchist thinkers, who combined contemporary radical ideas with traditional Judaism. Some secular anarchists, such as [[Abba Gordin]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also noticed remarkable similarity between anarchism and many [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] ideas, especially in their [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] interpretation. Some Jewish mystical groups were based on anti-authoritarian principles, somewhat similar to the Christian [[Quakers]] and [[Dukhobors]]. [[Martin Buber]], a deeply religious philosopher, had frequently referred to the Hasidic tradition.

The [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Kabbalist]] rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]] believed in a religious version of [[libertarian communism]], based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called [[altruist communism]]. Ashlag supported the [[Kibbutz]] movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] communes, who would eventually ''annul the brute-force regime completely, for "every man did that which was right in his own eyes."'', because ''there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baal HaSulam |url=http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811 |title=Building the Future Society |publisher=World Wide Kabbalah Academy |date= |accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A British Orthodox rabbi, [[Yankev-Meyer Zalkind]], was an [[communist anarchism|anarcho-communist]] and very active anti-militarist. Rabbi Zalkind was a close friend of [[Rudolf Rocker]], a prolific [[Yiddish]] writer and a prominent [[Torah]] scholar. He argued, that the ethics of the [[Talmud]], if properly understood, is closely related to anarchism.

One contemporary movement in Judaism with anarchist tendencies is [[Jewish Renewal]]. The movement is trans-denominational, including Orthodox, non-Orthodox, [[Jewish Buddhist|Judeo-Buddhists]] and [[Judeo-Paganism|Judeo-Pagans]], and focusing on feminism, environmentalism and pacifism.

===Neopaganism===
[[File:Anarcho Black Sun.svg|thumb|100px|right|[[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] with inscribed anarchy symbol.]]
[[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|Neopaganism]], with its focus on the sanctity of nature and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has led to a number of Neopagan inspired anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both Neopaganism and activism.

===Dysnomianism===
One religion known as "Dysnomianism" seeks to fuse Anarchism with religion and Occult practices, its primary text "The Chronicles of Anarchy" (released on [[The Pirate Bay]]) presents a broad overview of the connections between Anarchism and various traditional spiritual philosophies from around the world, especially those with a magickal and occult leaning. This book attempts to blend all the most Anarchist aspects of world spirituality into one coherent practical Anarchist spirituality which sees Dysnomia, the Greek goddess of Lawlessness as its central deity. Often utilizing psychedelic drugs and Anarchist tactics of direct action, those who follow this path are known as "Dysnomians" and utilizing the principles of neuroplasticity, they seek to free their brains/minds of all hierarchical and legalistic conditioning to arrive at a state known as "Anarkhos."

===Taoism===
Many early [[Taoism|Taoists]] such as the influential [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] were critical of authority and advised rulers that the less controlling they were, the more stable and effective their rule would be. There is debate among contemporary anarchists about whether or not this counts as an anarchist view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/josh-anarchism-and-taoism|title=Anarchism and Taoism|last1=Josh|work=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known, however, that some less influential Taoists such as [[Pao Ching-yen]] explicitly advocated anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Robert|date=2005|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume 1: From Anarchy To Anarchism (300CE-1939)|publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=1551642514}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th and 21st century anarchists such as [[Liu Shifu]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. le Guin]] have also identified as Taoists.

[[File:ACC stamp 1990 B2.jpg|thumb|Baghdad, February 16th of 1989, on an Iraqi stamp: the Arab leaders Salih of (North) Yemen, Husain I. of Jordan, Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Mubarak of Egypt (f.l.t.r.) after they established the ACC]]
The '''Arab Cooperation Council''' ('''ACC''') was founded in February 1989 by [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]].

The ACC was created partly in response to the four countries being left out of the Gulf Cooperation Council ([[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]]), partly out of a desire to foster closer economic cooperation and integration among its members, and partly as an Egyptian step to rejoin mainstream Arab politics after years of ostracism following its peace treaty with Israel.
The members of the ACC, unlike the GCC states, appeared uncomfortable with the grouping's exclusion of other Arab states; the ACC charter explicitly states that "Membership in the ACC shall be open to every Arab state wishing to join it." The short-lived organization held at least 17 formal meetings at the summit or ministerial level in 1989 alone, in addition to dozens of working-level sessions. This level of institutionalization was more extensive than most Arab subregional gatherings had exhibited. Somalia and Djibouti showed interest to join the ACC but were asked to wait until the ACC would be consolidated.

However, the organization did not survive the crisis that followed Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] on August 2, 1990. In part, this can be attributed to the four countries' lack of common geopolitical interests, the absence of a true shared identity (beyond common status as Arab states), and tensions between Egypt and Iraq. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Egypt in particular opposed Iraqi actions—actually joining the coalition that sent troops to Saudi Arabia and eventually liberated Kuwait. In retrospect, Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] said that the security aspects of the ACC were probably designed by Iraq to lure Cairo into backing [[Saddam Hussein]]'s foray into Kuwait {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

Within weeks of the invasion of Kuwait, the ACC's Secretariat canceled upcoming organizational events and the grouping ceased to exist in anything but name.&lt;ref&gt;''What do they have in common?'', The world of the Arabs: A special report on the Arab world, The Economist, Jul 23rd 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt officially suspended its membership in the ACC in early 1994.

The ACC's failure was no surprise to many observers. Arab political pundit [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]] wrote in his book ''Illusions of Triumph'' (1992) that "The four leaders of the Arab Cooperation Council came [from] different and contradictory worlds, with outlooks so varied that they seemed improbable partners."

[[File:Attila Kotanyi Obituary Notice copy.jpg|thumb|right|Attila Kotányi's obituary notice.]]
'''Attila Kotányi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɒtillɒ ˈkotaːɲi|lang}}; 1924, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] – 18 October 2003, [[Düsseldorf]]) was a poet, philosopher, [[writer]] and [[architect]]-urbanist.

In his early years in [[Budapest]], Attila Kotányi belonged to the intellectual circle of philosopher [[Lajos Szabó]] (with whom he maintained a philosophical conversation for 20 years) and [[Béla Hamvas]]. In 1956, after the failed [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]], he emigrated with his family to [[Brussels]] where he continued studying and eventually graduated in [[urbanism]]. In the early 1960s he became a member of the [[Situationist International]] where for the two following years worked in the editors' committee of the S.I. bulletin and entered in close friendship with [[Guy Debord]]. His contributions to the bulletin include ''Gangland and Philosophy'' (1961), ''Programme élémentaire du bureau d'urbanisme unitaire'' (1961) co-authored with [[Raoul Vaneigem]] and ''Theses on the Paris Commune'' co-authored with Guy Debord and [[Raoul Vaneigem]] (1962). He was excommunicated by Debord in 1962 for his alleged "Christian mysticism".  Later he moved to Düsseldorf, Germany, where he taught for 12 years at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Art Academy]]. Beyond poetry and philosophical conversations he also painted and did smaller architectural works. In the 1990s he returned to Budapest where he pursued the last active period of his life, gathering a steady circle of young intellectuals in his Saturday afternoon conversations where he was elaborating on his Sabbath-theory, the radical suspension of activity. He died in Düsseldorf due to complications of a stroke.

[[Image:Gabalear.PNG|thumb|right|GAB sticker]]

'''Balearic Anticolonialist Group''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Grup Anticolonialista Balear'') was a political organization in the [[Balearic Islands]] founded on January 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronologia de les Illes Balears al segle XX'', vol. VI, Centre d'Estudis i Documentació Contemporània&lt;/ref&gt; It was yet one more short-lived minority agent in the agitated political context of the [[Spanish Transition]] to democracy. 

GAB campaigned for independence of the Balearic Islands from [[Spain]], but, contrary to the typical view of radical nationalist left groups, it did not ask for the hypothetical independent Balearic islands to become a part of an equally hypothetical independent [[Catalan Countries|Països Catalans]].

GAB was politically tied to the [[Communist Party of Spain (international) (1975)|Communist Party of Spain (international)]] (PCE(i)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10256">{{short description|German legal term}}
'''''Befehlsnotstand''''' (English: [[Necessity (criminal law)|Necessity]] to obey orders) is a German legal term that refers to a situation in which a certain action is ordered that violates law, but where the refusal to carry out such an order would lead to drastic consequences, specifically danger to life or body, for the person refusing to carry out the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechtslexikon.net/d/befehlsnotstand/befehlsnotstand.htm|title=Befehlsnotstand|publisher=www.rechtslexikon.net|date=|language=German|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of ''Befehlsnotstand'' was successfully used as a defence in World War II-related war crimes trials in Germany in the 1950s and 1960s&lt;ref name="Welt 2015" /&gt; but research into the subject since has proven that ''Befehlsnotstand'' as such did not exist, meaning German soldiers did not actually face drastic consequences if refusing such an order during the war.&lt;ref name="Welt 2014" /&gt; 

==Etymology==
''Befehlsnotstand'' is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]], made up of the German words ''[[wikt:Befehl|Befehl]]'' (command or order) and ''[[wikt:Notstand|Notstand]]'' (emergency). 

The term has been translated into English by various sources as "necessity to obey order",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Sofsky| url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ClmQ8PPjF44C&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;dq=befehlsnotstand+necessity+to+obey+orders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PypN2kslp2&amp;sig=vVE9IrgAvzRjV0cboCxIaKS5p7E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYrvaqpp_eAhVL6Y8KHcG7B7YQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=befehlsnotstand%20necessity%20to%20obey%20orders&amp;f=false |title=The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp |page=334| publisher=|date=|language=|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a compulsion to obey orders"&lt;ref name="Translation" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.langenscheidt.com/german-english/befehlsnotstand|title=Befehlsnotstand|publisher=[[Langenscheidt]]|date=|language=German|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "crisis created as a result of following orders".{{sfn|Lewy|2017|p=108}}

''Notstand'' in German law can be compared to [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]&lt;ref name="Sliedregt" /&gt; in the criminal law of other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/n/necessity/|title=Necessity Law and Legal Definition|publisher=www.uslegal.com|date=|language=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Germany==
===Background===
In German law, the situation ''Befehlsnotstand'' arises when a person refusing to carry out an unlawful order would have to face drastic consequences. In this situation, the person could not be prosecuted for carrying out the order.&lt;ref name="Welt 2015" /&gt; Drastic consequences, in German law, are defined as a danger to life or body, and are not defined as loss of rank, incarceration or removal to a [[Penal military unit|penal unit]], like a ''[[Strafbataillon]]''.&lt;ref name="Bundesarchiv" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtg/mitteilungen3_2008/befehlsnotstand.pdf|title=NS-Verbrechen, totalitäre Herrschaft und individuelle Verantwortlichkeit: Das Problem des sog. Befehlsnotstandes| trans-title=Nazi crimes, totalitarian regime and individual responsibility: The problem of the so called ''Befehlsnotstand'' |publisher=[[German Federal Archives]]|date=|language=German|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi Germany===
The term is commonly, but not exclusively, associated with German war crimes and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] where ''Befehlsnotstand'' was used as line of defence by the accused in subsequent post-war trials. In the 1950s and 1960s the use of ''Befehlsnotstand'' as a defence in war crimes trials in Germany was quite successful as it generally protected the accused from punishment. With the formation of the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] this changed as a historical research by the organisation revealed that no known case could be established where refusing an unlawful order did result in severe punishment. More commonly, military personnel refusing such an order were transferred to a different unit.&lt;ref name="Welt 2015" &gt;{{cite news |last=Kellerhoff |first=Sven Felix |author-link=Sven Felix Kellerhoff |date=15 July 2015|title=Hatten SS-Mitglieder damals wirklich „keine Wahl“?|trans-title=Did SS members really have no choice?|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article144067359/Hatten-SS-Mitglieder-damals-wirklich-keine-Wahl.html|language=German |work=[[Die Welt]] |location= |access-date=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example for this was Wehrmacht Captain Otto Freyer who was transferred towards the end of the war to the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]].

In practice, refusing a [[Superior orders|superior order]] to participate in war crimes by German soldiers of the [[Wehrmacht]] or [[Waffen-SS]] almost never led to consequences for the refusing person, and punishment, if any, was very mild.&lt;ref name="Cologne" &gt;{{cite web|last=Bruners|first=Jan |url=https://eden.one/pdf/2212.pdf|title=Strafverfolgung von NS-Verbrechen| trans-title=Criminal prosecution of Nazi crimes |publisher=[[Universität Köln]]|date=|language=German|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; German historian [[Sven Felix Kellerhoff]] argued that, instead of fear of punishment the participants were more afraid of peer pressure and the possibility of exclusion from their group.&lt;ref name="Welt 2014" &gt;{{cite news |last=Kellerhoff |first=Sven Felix |author-link=Sven Felix Kellerhoff |date=14 January 2014|title=Warum junge Männer im Akkord morden|trans-title=Why young men murdered ceaselessly|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article123835471/Warum-junge-Maenner-im-Akkord-morden.html|language=German |work=[[Die Welt]] |location= |access-date=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellerhoff further argued that the situation of German soldiers taking part in massacres did not even constitute the lesser ''Putativnotstand'',&lt;ref name="Welt 2014" /&gt; a state where the individual mistakenly believes their life is in danger if the disobeyed when, in reality, no such danger exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechtslexikon.net/d/putativnotstand/putativnotstand.htm|title=Putativnotstand|publisher=www.rechtslexikon.net|date=|language=German|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Germany===
''Befehlsnotstand'' was also used as a defence by former East German border guards, tried after the [[German reunification]] in the ''{{ill|Mauerschützenprozesse|de}}'', the trials of East German borders guards accused of unlawful killings of escapees at the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Inner German border]] as part of the ''[[Schießbefehl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/deutsche-einheit/kontraste/42470/schiessbefehl-und-mauertote|title=Wer trägt die Schuld? - Schießbefehl und Mauertote|trans-title=Who is guilty? - Order to shoot and wall dead|publisher=[[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]]|date=30 September 2005|language=German|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current German law===
In current German law, articles [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__34.html § 34] and [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__35.html § 35] of the German penal code, the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'', govern the law on ''Notstand''. Formerly it was governed by articles § 52 and 54.{{sfn|Lewy|2017|p=108}}

Article 34 deals with ''Rechtfertigender Notstand'', [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] as justification, while article 35 deals with ''Entschuldigender Notstand'', necessity as excuse.&lt;ref name="Sliedregt" &gt;van Sliedregt, 2012, Notes 162 &amp; 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
===Argentina===
The [[Law of Due Obedience]] ({{lang-es|Ley de obediencia debida}}), a law passed by the National Congress of Argentina after the end of the military dictatorship, translated in German as the ''Befehlsnotstandsgesetz'' (''Gesetz'' meaning law in German), protected all officers and their subordinates of the armed forces and security forces from prosecution for most crimes committed during the dictatorship but was eventually annulled in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/apuz/29474/vergangenheitspolitik-in-chile-argentinien-und-uruguay?p=all|title=Vergangenheitspolitik in Chile, Argentinien und Uruguay|trans-title=Political history in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay|publisher=[[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]]|date=9 October 2006|language=German|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource}}
'''''Berger v. New York''''', 388 U.S. 41 (1967), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision invalidating a New York law under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], because the statute authorized electronic eavesdropping without required procedural safeguards.

==Background==
Under New York Code of Criminal Procedure § 813-a, police obtained an [[ex parte]] order to [[Covert listening device|bug]] the office of [[Lawyer|attorney]] Ralph Berger. Based on evidence obtained by the [[surveillance]], Berger was convicted of conspiracy to bribe a public official. The statute allowed electronic eavesdropping for up to two months upon a standard of "a reasonable ground to believe that evidence of a crime may be thus obtained." Further two-month extensions of the original order could be granted if investigators made a showing that such surveillance would be in the public interest. The statute required neither notice to the person surveilled nor any justification of such secrecy. The communications sought did not have to be described with any particularity; surveillance requests had to identify only the person targeted and the phone number to be tapped. Finally, the statute did not require a return on the warrant, so law enforcement officers did not have to account to a judge for their use of evidence gathered.

==Opinion of the Court==
In an opinion written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[Tom C. Clark]], the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that section 813-a violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], made enforceable against the states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], because it lacked "adequate judicial supervision [and] protective procedures." Notably, the Court invalidated the law on its face rather than as applied to the petitioner. The Court likened such an indiscriminate grant of authority to search for any evidence of any crime to a [[general warrant]], a tool used by British authorities in colonial America that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] was enacted to outlaw. The Court held that conversations are protected by the Fourth Amendment, and that the use of electronic devices to capture conversations thus constituted a "search." This holding predates by several months the more famous case of ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', which extended Fourth Amendment protection to a conversation in a public phone booth based on the speaker's [[reasonable expectation of privacy]].

Such posts are manned by [[border guard]]s and are at all times connected by [[radio communication]] with ongoing border patrols in their [[region]] and the force headquarters in the interior of the country for their day-to-day functioning, passing on [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and for requesting supplies and any needed reinforcements in emergencies.

Depending on the length and breath of a country's borders and geography, are located in a wide variety of terrain, including the inhospitable areas that often mark political boundaries.

==Layout==
Border outposts, where available, are built on strategic locations which are usually elevated at the highest points in the local terrain and where possible on hilltops along the border.

Depending upon [[international relations]] with the neighboring country and local [[Military strategy|strategic]] needs, BOPs are sometimes built with an assortment of a few administration and residential buildings or [[tent]]s, an [[Armory (military)|armory]], [[trenches]], [[bunkers]], [[wire obstacle]]s and fortified [[machine gun]] positions with a [[watchtower]].

A [[flagpole]] flying the country's [[national flag]] may be located on the premise along with a [[Antenna (radio)|Wireless Communication Antenna]] and a designated clearing as a make-do [[helipad]].

==Peacetime function==
Border outposts are manned in peacetime by the border guard to check [[smuggling]], [[Espionage|infiltration]] by [[spy|spies]] of untrusted neighboring countries, [[insurgents]] bent on smuggling weapons and explosives for [[terrorist]] attacks and [[subversive]] activities, [[illegal immigration]] and [[human trafficking]] etc.. They usually have [[watchtower]]s where soldiers are posted day and night on [[General Orders for Sentries|Sentry duty]] looking for intruders and illegal cross-border activity of any kind. Patrols go out regularly to patrol the international border to check illegal crossings and track any footprints of those who may have crossed over illegally or attempted to. In case intrusion by foreign elements is confirmed, it is the responsibility of the Border guard based on the BOP to trace the intruders by checking the nearby settlements, villages and towns and inform the law enforcement agencies, Customs and Police authorities.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"&gt;Indian [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'' (1997) made with the official assistance of the [[Border Security Force]] (BSF), [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Airforce]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Refugee (2000)"&gt;Indian Bollywood film ''[[Refugee (2000 film)|Refugee]]'' (2000) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime function==
During [[war]]time however the Border guard, the special forces tasked with patrolling the border in peacetime, withdraw from the Border outposts and provide assistance in a limited capacity to the country's regular [[Army]] which then comes and mans all the border outposts at the international border facing the enemy neighboring country. Wartime assistance of the Border guard to the Army is essential as they are familiar with the local terrain having patrolled it on a daily basis during peacetime. During [[war]]s these BOPs are reworked into well [[fortification|fortified]] dug-in positions from where regular [[Army (unit)|Army unit]]s can operate to defend the territorial integrity of the country.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"/&gt;

'''Calculation in kind''' or '''calculation in nature''' is a way of valuating resources and a system of accounting that uses disaggregated [[Physical quantity|physical magnitudes]] as opposed to a common unit of calculation. As the basis for a [[socialist]] economy it was proposed to replace [[money]] and financial calculation.&lt;ref name="Steele 1992 123"&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele |first= David |title= From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court Publishing Company |year= 1992|isbn= 978-0875484495|pages = 123|quote=The term ‘calculation in kind’ is normally reserved for attempts to dispense with any general unit of calculation. It is usually not taken to include cases where a general unit of calculation is arrived at without reference to money or markets. Thus it is not applied to Taylor-Lange accounting prices, nor to notional ‘prices’ ascribed to all commodities in an attempt to replace the market by solving a large number of simultaneous equations, nor to the use of labor time as a measure of cost.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation in kind would value each commodity based only on its [[use value]], for purposes of economic accounting. By contrast, in money-based economies, a commodity's value includes an [[exchange value]].

Calculation in kind would quantify the utility of an object ''directly'' without recourse to a general unit of calculation. This differs from other proposed methods of socialist calculation, such as simultaneous equations, Taylor-Lange accounting prices, and the use of labor time as a measure of cost.&lt;ref name="Steele 1992 123"/&gt;

Calculation in kind was strongly advocated by the positivist philosopher and political economist [[Otto Neurath]] when employed by the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. This led to a discussion in the early 1920s, in which much of the discussion about socialism centered on whether [[economic planning]] should be based on physical quantities or monetary accounting. Neurath was the most forceful advocate of ''physical planning'' (economic planning using calculation-in-kind) in contrast to [[market socialist]] neoclassical economists who advocated use of notional prices computed by solving simultaneous equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feinstein|first= C.H. |title= Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth: Essays Presented to Maurice Dobb |publisher= Cambridge University Press|date=September 1969|isbn= 978-0521049870|page = 168|quote= In the years between 1917 and 1925 Viennese socialists were heavily engaged in disputes about these themes. Among the main contributors were O. Neurath, K. Polanyi, O. Baur, O. Leichter and  W. Schiff... Much of this early discussion turned round the question whether planning should be in physical quantities or whether monetary accounting should be used. Otto Neurath, a remarkable personality, was a forceful advocate of physical planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian school]] critics of socialism, particularly [[Ludwig von Mises]], based his critique of socialism on the [[calculation problem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Otto Neurath's concepts of socialization and economic calculation and his socialist critics''. Retrieved July 05, 2010: http://www.chaloupek.eu/work/NeurathFin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of in-kind calculation argue that the use of a common medium like money distorts information about the utility of an object. Socialists in favor of calculation in kind argued that, in a system of in-kind calculation, waste associated with the monetary system would be eliminated, and in particular objects would no longer be desired for functionally useless purposes like resale and [[speculation]] - they would only be desired for their use-value.&lt;ref&gt;''The Alternative to Capitalism''. Retrieved July 05, 2010, from wspus.org "The disappearance of economic value would mean the end of economic calculation in the sense of calculation in units of value whether measured by money or directly in some unit of labour-time. It would mean that there was no longer any common unit of calculation for making decisions regarding the production of goods...Calculation in kind is an essential aspect of the production of goods in any society, including capitalism. A commodity is, as we saw, a good which by virtue of being produced for sale has acquired in addition to its physical use value a socially-determined exchange value. Correspondingly, the process of production under capitalism is both a process of production of exchange values and a process of production of use values, involving two different kinds of calculation. For the former, the unit of calculation is money, but for the latter there is no single unit but a whole series of different units for measuring the quantity and quality of specific goods used in the process of producing other specific goods (tonnes of steel, kilowatt-hours of electricity, person-hours of work and so on). The disappearance of economic or value calculation in socialism would by no means involve the disappearance of all rational calculation, since the calculations in kind connected with producing specific quantities of goods as physical use values would continue."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''coalition of the willing''' generally refers to the US-led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq]]. One early use was by President [[Bill Clinton]] in June 1994 in relation to possible operations against [[North Korea]], at the height of the 1994 stand-off with that country over [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref  name=ib&gt;Ibiblio.org (originally official [[White House]] release), [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/archives/whitehouse-papers/1994/Jun/1994-06-05-Presidents-ABC-Interview-on-USS-George-Washington Interview with the President by Sam Donaldson ABC], June 5, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been applied to the [[Australia]]n-led [[INTERFET]] operation in [[East Timor]].

Bush]], visiting [[Europe]] for a [[NATO]] summit, declared that "should Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] choose not to disarm, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush: Join 'coalition of willing' |publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/11/20/prague.bush.nato/ |date=2002-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] briefly used "coalition of the willing" to refer to the countries who supported, militarily or politically, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent military presence in [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|post-invasion Iraq]]. The original list released in March 2003 included 46 members.&lt;ref name="ahas"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.clinecenter.illinois.edu/research/affiliated/airbrush/|title = Airbrushing History, American Style|last = Althaus|first = Scott|last2 = Leetaru|first2 = Kalev|authorlink2 = Kalev Leetaru|date = November 25, 2008|work = University of Illinois Cline Center for Democracy|accessdate = 13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2003, the list was updated to include 49 countries, though it was reduced to 48 after Costa Rica objected&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/10/world/fg-rica10|title=Costa Rica Asks to Be Taken Off U.S. List of Iraq Coalition Partners|date=10 September 2004|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its inclusion. Of the 48 countries on the list, three contributed troops to the invasion force (the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Poland]]). An additional 37 countries provided some number of troops to support military operations after the invasion was complete.

The list of coalition members provided by the White House included several nations that did not intend to participate in actual military operations. Some of them, such as [[Marshall Islands]], [[Micronesia]], [[Palau]] and [[Solomon Islands]], did not have standing armies. However, through the [[Compact of Free Association]], citizens of the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Palau]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] are guaranteed US national status and therefore are allowed to serve in the US military. The members of these island nations have deployed in a combined Pacific force consisting of [[Guam]]anian, [[Hawaii]]an and [[American Samoa|Samoan]] reserve units. They have been deployed twice to Iraq. The government of one country, the [[Solomon Islands]], listed by the White House as a member of the coalition, was apparently unaware of any such membership and promptly denied it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/527/follow_up_the_coalition_of_the_willing_to_be_paid_minus_two Perrott, A.: "Coalition of the Willing? Not us, say Solomon islanders". ''The New Zealand Herald'', March 27, 2003.].&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 study, the Federal States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau (and Tonga and the Solomon Islands to a lesser extent) were all economically dependent on economic aid from the United States, and thus had an economic incentive to join the Coalition of the Willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wivel|first=Anders|date=2010|title=Security, profit or shadow of the past?

In December 2008, [[University of Illinois]] Professor Scott Althaus reported that he had learned that the [[White House]] was editing and back-dating revisions to the list of countries in the coalition.&lt;ref name=DailyIllini&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2008/12/05/News/White.House.Documents.Found.To.Be.Altered-571806.shtml|title=White House documents found to be altered|work=[[Daily Illini]]|author=Kelly Gibbs|date=2008-12-05|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheRawStory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2008/White_House_altered_documents_on_coalition_1205.html|title=White House altered, deleted press releases on 'coalition of the willing'|work=[[The Raw Story]]|first=John |last=Byrne|date=December 5, 2008|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Althaus found that some versions of the list had been entirely removed from the record, and that others contradicted one another, as opposed to the procedure of archiving original documents and supplementing them with later revisions and updates.&lt;ref name="ahas" /&gt;

By August 2009, all non-U.S./UK coalition members had withdrawn from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/9010_Report_to_CongressJul09.pdf |title=United States Department of Defense |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902090645/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/9010_Report_to_CongressJul09.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Multinational Force – Iraq]] was renamed and reorganized to [[United States Forces – Iraq]] as of January 1, 2010. Thus the Coalition of the Willing came to an official end.

==Criticism of use==
Specific uses of the phrase in the context of disarming Iraq began appearing in mid-2001.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Salon.com]] columnist Laura McClure, noting the large amounts of [[foreign aid]] being offered in exchange for supporting the Iraq War, referred to Bush's coalition as the "Coalition of the billing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Coalition of the billing -- or unwilling? | work=Salon.com | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/03/12/foreign_aid/ | date=2003-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; British activist [[Tariq Ali]] made a similar point, describing it as a "coalition of the shilling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://araustralia.org/2004/040704.htm Alternative Radio Australia - Tariq Ali] Retrieved September 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second debate in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] questioned the size of the coalition participating in the initial invasion, saying, "...when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand coalition. We can do better". Bush responded by saying, "Well, actually, he forgot Poland.  And now there're 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops". The phrase "[[United States presidential debates, 2004#"You forgot Poland"|You forgot Poland]]" subsequently became a sarcastic shorthand for the perception that most members of the coalition were not contributing much to the war effort compared to the main three allies. The majority of the population in most countries involved did not, according to surveys, support the endeavour or their nation's participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup-international.com/ContentFiles/survey.asp?id=10 Iraq Poll 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126150127/http://www.gallup-international.com/ContentFiles/survey.asp?id=10 |date=2009-01-26 }} Gallup International Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Late [[United States Senate|U.S. Sen]]. [[Robert Byrd]], then ranking [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] on the [[Senate Appropriations Committee]], referred to the coalition by the [[acronym]] COW, expressing his concern that the United States was being "milked" as a "[[cash cow]]". A [[House of Commons of Canada|Canadian Member of Parliament]], [[Carolyn Parrish]], referred to [[National Missile Defence in Canada|Canadian support]] for the U.S. [[national missile defense]] program as the "Coalition of the Idiots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/missile-defence-for-coalition-of-the-idiots-liberal-mp-1.506659|title=Missile defence for 'coalition of the idiots': Liberal MP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Dude, Where's My Country?]]'', [[Michael Moore]] argues that the very idea of a "coalition of the willing" was inaccurate.  In making his case, Moore notes that most of the countries contributing troops to the coalition were small countries with practically no economic clout, and that the countries' general populations opposed the invasion.

[[File:RO collectivization end medal.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Medal granted in 1962 at the completion of collectivization in Romania]]
{{Communist Romania}}
The '''collectivization of agriculture in [[Romania]]''' took place in the early years of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]]. The initiative sought to bring about a thorough transformation in the property regime and organization of labour in agriculture. According to some authors, such as [[United States|US]] anthropologist David Kideckel, [[agricultural collectivization]] was a "response to the objective circumstances" in postwar Romania, rather than an ideologically motivated enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] model [[Collectivization in the USSR|applied]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s, the collectivization was not achieved by mass liquidation of wealthy peasants, starvation or agricultural sabotage, but was accomplished gradually. This often included significant violence and destruction as employed by cadres, or Party representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Kligman &amp; Verdery&lt;/ref&gt; 

The program was launched at the plenary of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]] of 3–5 March 1949, where a resolution regarding socialist transformation of agriculture was adopted along the lines of the Soviet [[kolkhoz]]. The collectivization strategy covered two directions: model collective structures were set up, such as ''Gospodării Agricole Colective'' (GAC; Collective Agricultural Institutions) and ''Gospodării Agricole de Stat'' (GAS; State Agricultural Institutions), aimed at attracting peasants; and the full propaganda system (newspapers, radio, mobile caravans, brochures, direct action by agitators) was put in motion in order to convince peasants to form [[collective farming]] units. A problem that the Party encountered with written propaganda was the high rate of illiteracy amongst the Romanian peasantry. In order to combat this, the Party engaged in a campaign to increase literacy amongst the peasants.

The [[communist ideology]] clashed with the [[Romanian traditions|traditional]] hierarchical structures of the Romanian villages, which were not [[egalitarian]]. Many of the village elites were godparents or patrons for poor peasants, providing them access to land in return for their labor. Many in the lower classes aspired to join the educated elite, and prosperity was seen as a sign of virtue and hard work. &lt;ref&gt;Kligman &amp; Verdery, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial collectivization drive was accompanied by an intensification of the [[class struggle]] in the villages, through the elimination of wealthy peasants (''chiaburi'', also referred to by the Russian term ''[[kulak]]s''); members of this class were intimidated, beaten, arrested and imprisoned, on the grounds that they had employed the labour of poor peasants to work their land. On the grassroots level, the U.S.S.R. used Cadres, members of the proletarian and peasant class who were paid or often coerced to promote communism amongst the general public.    

The party-state used various tactics to convince peasants of the benefits of collectivization, including propaganda such as films and operas, denunciations of suspected class enemies and saboteurs, and encouraging peasants to write petitions in order to inculcate them in socialist norms. Violent means were also used against poor or "mid-level" peasants and in general against all those who refused to sign up willingly for tillage associations (''întovărășiri'') or join the collective. Much attention was devoted to involving members of the rural elite (teachers, priests, well-off peasants), who often had to choose between GAC and prison under an accusation of sabotage. Peasants entered a GAC not only with their land, but also their buildings (barns, villas, warehouses), farm vehicles and tools, carts and [[working animal]]s. Collectivization was accompanied by peasant revolts that broke out when brutal "arguments" were employed as a means of persuasion by the party, and also due to abusive measures such as obligatory quotas taking away part of the production of individual plots (while GAC that had already been set up were excused from such requirements). 

[[Romanian Police|Militia]] and [[Securitate]] troops quelled the revolts, the leaders of which were arrested and harshly punished. According to data supplied by the Communist authorities, 50,000 peasants were arrested and imprisoned, many of them being tried publicly and sentenced to long prison terms. 

A warning against the use of violent means in the process of collectivization was issued by Communist leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] in 1951. Moreover, after the marginalization of [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Vasile Luca]], he accused the two of instigating provocative measures and "trampling on the free consent by the peasants" during the process. In 1961 the Romanian leader also condemned the large number of public trials against peasants "in the name of the struggle against Kulaks" during the first phase of collectivization.&lt;ref&gt;Jowitt, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these warnings, Party cadres were employed and trained on strategies to recruit support for collectivization. These individuals were chosen among the normal peasant population. Upon completion of their training, they would travel the country speaking to peasant farmers about the party and its efforts at collectivization. This usually included efforts to persuade the peasants to agree to collectivization and to the goals of the Party. Because this work was extremely difficult and tiring, it was often ineffective. In addition, many cadres did not themselves believe in the cause they were soliciting support for. Moreover, the work of the cadres often turned violent, with systems of terror employed to coerce peasants to agree. &lt;ref&gt;Kligman &amp; Verdery&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress was slow at first, as Romania lagged behind all [[Eastern bloc]] countries in 1952. In 1957, however, the party decided to accelerate the process, attributed by [[Kenneth Jowitt]] to the leadership's desire to prove its independence from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery 2003, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; (The Soviet leader at the time, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], opposed the program.)&lt;ref&gt;Jowitt, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; At an extraordinary session of the [[Great National Assembly]] held between 27 and 30 April 1962, General Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej announced the end of the collectivization programme; 96% of the country's arable surface and 93.4% of its agricultural land had been included in collective structures. At the same session, he criticized the "Muscovite faction" of the Workers' Party.

Collectivization seriously harmed the Romanian village, according to Romanian historian Stan Stoica: he cites the loss of "independence, dignity and identity" by the peasants; a decline in the rural population that accelerated when young people migrated to the cities (forced industrialization was going on at the same time); and the fact that families were "wrecked" by poverty, while interest in work plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Stoica, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comptroller General of Chile''' (General Accounting Office) is a constitutionally autonomous body of the [[Politics of Chile|Government of Chile]] based on chapter 10 of the [[Constitution of Chile]]&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Chile#CHAPTER_X_OFFICE_OF_COMPTROLLER-GENERAL_OF_THE_REPUBLIC&lt;/ref&gt; and it is in charge of the control of the legal aspects, management, preaudit and postaudit functions of all the activities of the centralized and decentralized civil service, whatever its forms of organization may be, as well as of other powers granted by law.

==History ==
The Office of Comptroller General of the Republic (Oficina de la Contraloría General de la República) was designed partially following the recommendations of a Mission of US economic advisers led by [[Edwin Walter Kemmerer]]. The office was finally established during the administration of Carlos Ibáñez in 1927. The first head of the office was the lawyer Pablo Ramírez who simultaneously served as Minister of Finance. In 1943 the office was upgraded to an autonomous government organ through an amendment to the constitution (Law 7,727) and was retained as such in the constitution of 1980.

== Functions ==
Charged with serving as the government's auditor, it must take part in the approval or rejection of the revenue and investment accounts of public funds, scrutinizes the collection and expenditure of government funds by the National Treasury, the municipalities, and other state services as determined by law.

The office also performs a legality review function called "toma de razón". Exercising this ex-ante review power, the comptroller scrutinises, on constitutional and legal grounds, executive decisions and regulations prior to their official publication or communication. In practice, this checking procedure may represent an effective veto point in the Chilean administrative process. Another aspect of the legal control function of the office consists in its power to issue legally binding opinions on issues concerning the laws that govern administrative bodies and procedures. Both public entities and private parties can request the office to clarify any point of law arising from the functioning of public services. The access to the office is therefore remarkably broad. In practice, the exercise of the interpretive power has entailed that many practitioner use the office as an administrative tribunal which work alongside the ordinary judiciary in the country.

== Transparency ==
Over the years, the agency gained a reputation for insisting on strict conformity to the law, instilling respect in career officials and elected officials alike.

2009 the General Accounting Office of the Republic was ranked fourth in the VI Barometer of Access to Public Information, study reflecting the perception the media has in terms of transparency and cooperation of various Agencies of public importance in the country. In 2008 the position of the Contraloría was five places lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contraloria.cl/NewPortal2/portal2/appmanager/portalCGR/v3ENG?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P18604440991288028142267&amp;node=/BEA%20Repository/English/News/2009/NOT_ENG11_231109_01 |title=General Comptroller Office Republic of Chile |publisher=Contraloria.cl |date=2009-11-23 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conference on National Reconciliation in Somalia''' was an attempt to end the [[Somali Civil War]]. It led to the signing of the '''[[Addis Ababa Agreement (1993)]]''', on March 27, 1993. Fifteen different warring factions agreed to the principles of [[Disarmament in Somalia|reconciliation and disarmament]], but the agreement was shoaled by continued violence in Somalia. It was preceded by the [[Informal Preparatory Meeting on National Reconciliation]].

'''Farmer Research Committees''' (also known in Latin America as '''Comites de Investigacion Agropecuario Local''' or CIALs ) are an approach to [[community organizing]] and [[agricultural extension]] that provides rural communities and farmer organizations in developing countries with an adaptive research and technology testing service run by volunteer farmers. This approach to agricultural innovation is used in [[international development]] and [[rural community development]] for improving adoption of [[appropriate technology]] and the development of [[sustainable agriculture]]. The approach involves collaboration and joint decision-making among extension agents, farmers and researchers to develop locally acceptable farming practices and accelerate their adoption. Farmer Research Committees also produce a broad set of benefits that are generally referred to as [[empowerment]],including the increased self-esteem and effectiveness of farmers to organise and negotiate with extension service and agricultural input providers, market chain actors, banks and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhancing Accountability and Impacts of Agricultural Research Systems in Developing Countries|url=http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/symposia/4/5/1133_byerleed.htm|publisher=Crop Science Congress|accessdate=27 March 2012|author=Derek Byerlee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer Research Committees do adaptive research experiments to help farmers manage the risk of trying something new that extension has not validated under local conditions. In Latin America, numerous Farmer Research Committees have been particularly effective in evaluating and selecting new varieties and multiplying seed, enabling large numbers of farmers to access a new variety at low cost, improve their [[food security]], generate employment and increase their income. On a lesser scale, Farmer Research Committees have worked on small machinery, fertilisers or pest and disease control regimes, enabling the adoption of cost-effective strategies in which local farmers have confidence. Farmer Research Committees may have an important role to play in rural communities' adaptation of their [[agriculture]] to [[climate change]] and [[globalization]] because they increase community-level innovative and adaptive capacity by strengthening its human and [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing Farmers|url=http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/downloads/pdf/Investing_farmers.pdf|work=ciat.cgiar.org |accessdate=27 March 2012|authors=Jaquiline Ashby, Ann Braun, Teresa Gracia, Maria del Pilar Guerrero, Luis Hernandez, Carlos Quiros, and Jose Roa|year=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Farmer Field Schools which are intended to transmit proven extension recommendations to farmers using experimentation for discovery learning, Farmer Research Committees set out to generate new recommendations.Their results are usually a novel blend of what was already known and what was unknown, drawing on both [[indigenous technical knowledge]] and external resources. Farmer research committees and farmer field schools can be highly complementary, as is discussed in more detail below

== Costs ==
Most of the costs of establishing a Farmer Research Committee are a one-off investment incurred during the first year for training and a petty cash or inputs fund for operations.
* Training of a facilitator, who may be a salaried extension professional or a para-professional farmer, involves a 5-day, on-site course and then follow-up visits by trainers to reinforce field practice. In Latin America, trainers use cellphones and the internet to mentor trainees. Numerous professionals experienced in Farmer Research Committee training exist in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;For further information see Andean Change Program (Cambio Andino) Directory of Trainers http://www.cambioandino.org/directoriocapacitadores.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* Training a Farmer Research Committee involves learning by doing: in the first planting season (usually 4–6 months in the tropics), the facilitator mentors the Committee through a six step process.In the second season, the majority of steps in the process are delegated to the committee, the facilitator’s visits are reduced significantly and costs drop by as much as 50 percent. By the third planting system, a Committee is mature and can run its own process with minimal contact with a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, J.A., Gracia, A.T., Del Pilar Guerrero, M., Quiros, C.A., Roa, J.I. and Beltran, J.A. 1995. Institutionalizing farmer participation in adaptive technology testing with the “CIAL.” ODI Agricultural Research and Extension Network. Network Paper 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mature Committees in Latin America have been running their own process in this way for over 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Ashby, A. Braun, T. Gracia, M.P. Guerrero, L.A. Hernandez, C.A. Quiros &amp; J.I. Roa. 2001.Investing in Farmers as Researchers: Experience with Local Agricultural Research Committees in Latin America. CIAT, Cali, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Latin America the start-up fund for Committee operations can range from US$25 to US$200 in cash or kind, depending on the costs of experimental inputs not available locally.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby et al., 1995;http://go.worldbank.org/Z5B4XVXP00 World Bank Agriculture Investment Sourcebook. Module 2 - Local Agricultural Research Committees&lt;/ref&gt; The average yearly cost for running a Committee was estimated at US $325 over six years in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Braun, G. Thiele and M. Fernandez.2000. Farmer field schools and local agricultural Research committees: complementary platforms for integrated decision-making in Sustainable agriculture. ODI Agricultural Research and Extension Network .Network Paper No.105:12&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 50% of the 200 or so farmer research committees established in Latin America by 2003, 50 percent had maintained or increased the size of this fund, in some cases by selling seed of new varieties they were recommending, in other cases from local contributions.

Farmer Research Committees need a lively and sustained [[communication]] with external sources of information and technology to keepon bringing innovations into their experiments. When cellphone coverage exists this can be achieved through cellphone contact and this helps to reduce costs further. A facilitator can support from 20 to 50 mature Farmer Research Committees, depending on distances between them and the availability of cell phones.

== Reduced cost ==
Farmer Research Committees enable a research and extension program to improve its relevance and at the same time, expand its coverage at low cost, or reduce its costs for existing coverage. Extension costs can be reduced while quality improves because the Committee is a mechanism which encourages farmers to assume some of the costs of adaptive testing and extension of technologies. After training, a Farmer Research Committee takes over the implementation and evaluation of on-farm trials over a multi-year period with minimal outside facilitation, and assumes the job of informing its community of its results on a regular basis. When Farmer Research Committees recommend locally-proven seed and input-use practices, they and their neighbors know they can have confidence in this information, and this accelerates adoption and innovation. At least 200 pilots of this methodology in Latin America demonstrate the type of support needed to keep a mature farmer research committee running over time and how this enables a small number of technical professionals to accelerate and expand acees of the poor to innovation.

Why are farmers organized in farmer Research Committees willing to assume some of the costs of adaptive testing and extension? The answer lies in thousands of studies of agricultural technology adoption by poor farmers in developing countries. These show how some farmers in a community will always conduct small-scale experiments on their farms&lt;ref&gt;Richards, P. 1985. ''Indigenous Agricultural Revolution.Ecology and food production in West Africa. London'':Hutchinson; B. Haverkort, J. van der Kampand A. Waters-Bayer (eds) 1991. ''Joining Farmers’Experiments: Experiences in participatory technology development''. London: Intermediate Technology Publications&lt;/ref&gt; to check out whether a blanket recommendation or a technology package from an extension agent actually works in their conditions These studies also show how other farmers will wait to see how these experimenters fare before they too take the risk of innovating. This makes sense because the poor are usually farming in highly unpredictable and risky production environments, for which it is extremely expensive for an extension system to develop precise recommendations. The best these services can do is to come up with technologies that, on the average, are likely to do well. But poor farmers need–and practise—[[precision farming]]: they deliberately maximise diversity within small areas on their farms to protect themselves from the risk of a bad season in one micro-environment, or one disease or pest or crop or variety. As a result, farmers are rightly cautious about adopting blanket recommendations, and they do their own on-farm testing to check these recommendations out.

Farmer Research Committees harness a huge, underutilized resource: the time and money poor farmers spend tinkering with technologies they don’t fully trust or understand. This is why experimenting farmers willingly volunteer as Committee members, even if they are very poor, and why they are willing to absorb the costs of adaptive testing done in Committee. A Farmer Research Committee socializes the local experimentation that is ongoing on every farm to some degree, and makes this activity more systematic, better informed and more efficient for a larger number of beneficiaries.  Farmers who volunteer and are elected to be members of Farmer Research Committees are nominated by their communities because they are known to be already investing in a lot of their own local experimentation. When these farmers experiment in a group, they can replicate their experiments and learn much faster, so the return on their time and other investments increases in group experimentation compared with the idiosyncratic experimentation they do on their own.

== Function ==
A Farmer Research Committee can be elected by any kind of client group or organizations wanting to test and adapt agricultural technology: for example, a community, a rural self-help group,a producer association or a cooperative. The Committee enables the farmers it serves to express their demand for new technology and to participate in setting priorities for local testing, as well as in designing, evaluating and disseminating appropriate technologies. Because a Committee is elected (and members can be replaced) and has to report back regularly on its results and its use of funds to its clients, this service is accountable and so ensures that only appropriate technologies are recommended locally.

===Formation===
The proper motivation of client groups and the nomination of committee members are crucial to success. Like all group formation processes in rural communities, Farmer Research Committees are vulnerable to being captured by an elite unless the appropriate precautions are taken to ensure a Committee represents a reasonably homogeneous set of interests in a shared agro-ecological recommendation domain. A committee can include a few as four or as many as 40 members, depending on the socio-cultural context. Members who do not put in the time or effort considered necessary by the community or client group can be replaced.

Planning Farmer Research Committees can be greatly assisted by combining the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) with wealth ranking, a [[participatory rural appraisal]] (PRA) tool. An extension system should have at least one Farmer Research Committee per recommendation domain and organize regular contact among Committees for exchange of results.

===Diagnosis and planning===
Once elected, a committee organizes a diagnostic process in which all its clients participate to identify a local priority for research.Topics include for example, testing crop varieties, pest control regimes, fertilisers, livestock feeding strategies, producing and marketing new products or alternate soil erosion control technologies. The most important feature of a Committee's research topic is that it tries to solve an important local problem and that there is no readily-available and reliable knowledge of how to solve it already in existence. The diagnostic process involves the Committee in talking to experienced farmers in their locality and visiting experiment stations, agricultural input suppliers and extension offices.By the end of the diagnosis they either have found a solution to the problem or have found several alternative solutions and are not sure which one will be best.

===Experimentation===
If the Committee finds that locally-proven technologies are available, it asks farmers experienced with the technology to help them with community-wide training. If however, Committee members are not sure about what will work locally, then they then work with their facilitator or extension agent to design an experiment that will compare several unproven solutions. These may be of local or external origin. Farmer Research Committee experiments typically begin with several treatments compared with local practice tested on a very small scale. Over time, the number of treatments is reduced and the size of the experimental plots is increased until one or more technologies are being validated at commercial scale.  Committee experiments are usually replicated on the members own farms but the Committee members may also ask other farmers to join in and plant or evaluate experiments.

Farmer Research Committee experiments are evaluated using methodology for farmer evaluation of technology (Guererro, Ashby &amp; Gracia, 1993). This can be applied by farmers to very large or small numbers of treatments to generate a qualitative ranking based on their own criteria for evaluation. The ranking is easy for farmers to understand and report back to the Committee’s clients. At the same time a statistical packagefro the analysis of rankings is available for use by technical extension staff, if desired.

===Reporting back===
Reporting back involves a Farmer Research Committee in making a regular, formal report on its activities, its results and how it has used its funds to its community or client group.  This is a crucial activity that socializes what has been learned from the diagnosis and experimentation by the Farmer Research Committee. Sometimes facilitators neglect this step and focus on developing the capabilities of the committee members, but this gravely under-exploits the Committee’s potential for wider impact and means that dissemination of the knowledge they generate is unnecessarily restricted to the Committee. In addition, reporting back is essential for keeping the Committee accountable for its use of funds and relevant to local priorities.

Committees that are reporting back often invite extension, local politicians, input suppliers, business people and experiment station researchers to this meeting. This is especially useful once a Farmer Committee has validated technology at commercial scale and farmers want to expand production. Some Committees have in this way, convinced local politicians to contribute to their operational costs or to sponsor more committees. Some Committee members have been elected as local political representatives, expanding the credibility of Farmer Committees and demand for their services.

===Farmer Field Schools===
The principal mechanisms for dissemination of Farmer Research Committee's results and recommendations are their day-to-day contact with neighbors and their Report Back meeting. However, local farmers may need training in how to implement the Committee’s recommendations or if the Committee finds a solution that needs no further experimentation, nobody in the community may know how to use it.  Running Farmer Field Schools to provide training using Farmer Research Committee recommendations is highly advantageous as it gets locally-relevant, locally validated knowledge out to a larger number of farmers than the Committee can usually contact on its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6214">'''Fred A. Wilcox''' is a retired associate professor in the writing department at [[Ithaca College]].  He is the author of six books on issues including the  [[Vietnam War]], [[nuclear power]], and the [[Plowshares Movement]].&lt;ref name= "Ithaca"&gt;[http://faculty.ithaca.edu/fwilcox/ Ithaca College: Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his books discuss the effects of [[Agent Orange]], a [[defoliant]] used extensively during the war.

==Life and career==
Wilcox was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. He graduated from the [[University of Iowa]] where he studied Sociology and English.  He earned an MFA from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] and a doctorate in English and Expository Writing from [[SUNY Albany]].&lt;ref name="Ithaca" /&gt;

==Books on Agent Orange==

His first book on the subject, ''Waiting for an Army to Die'' ({{ISBN|978-0932020680}}), recounts the effects of the chemical defoliant [[Agent Orange]] on US troops during and after the Vietnam War. The chemical was used to eliminate the dense foliage of the forests in [[Vietnam]], which the US military believed provided cover to enemy fighters. Wilcox follows the lives of US veterans who argue that the chemical was toxic, citing health conditions including cancer and fetal deformations. The book helped bring to light the issue of Agent Orange in the United States when it was first published in 1983.&lt;ref name="prwatch"&gt;Rebekah Wilce, [http://www.prwatch.org/news/2011/09/10983/through-toxic-mirror-vietnamese-and-americans-continue-suffer-effects-agent-orang "Through the Toxic Mirror: Vietnamese and Americans Continue to Suffer Effects of Agent Orange"] PRWatch. September 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon W. Mitchell wrote in ''[[The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus]]'': "In 1989, Fred A. Wilcox chronicled the struggles that US veterans faced in receiving recognition for their exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in the book ''Waiting For An Army to Die.'' Twenty-two years later, the title still encapsulates the attitude adopted by the Pentagon and the VA towards former service members citing exposure to dioxins on Okinawa."{{cn|date=September 2017}}
George Claxton, Chair Emeritus of the National Agent Orange/Dioxin Committee of [[Vietnam Veterans of America]], wrote in a book review in Agent Orange Zone, "In the past thirty three years I have read every book published on the tragedy of Agent Orange and dioxin. Beyond a doubt, ''Scorched Earth'' ... is one of the most informative works of truth released on the market." &lt;ref name="Agent Orange Zone"&gt;[http://agentorangezone.blogspot.com/2011/09/book-review-scorched-earth-by-fred.html George Claxton]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Wilcox published ''Scorched Earth'' ({{ISBN|978-1609801380}}),  a continuation of the issues he addressed in ''Waiting for an Army to Die''.  In it he examines the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese people and their natural environment. Wilcox traveled with his son, Brendan Wilcox, whose photos accompany Wilcox's text, to Vietnam to interview individuals and families suffering from many health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. The conditions include [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[chloracne]], severe birth-defects and various types of [[cancer]], among others.

About the book, Evaggelos Vallianatos wrote in ''The World Post'' (a partnership of [[The Huffington Post]] and [[Berggruen Institute on Governance]],"It is eloquent, thought provoking, absorbing, daring, moral, and necessary. It is a jolt to historical amnesia. It tells what chemical warfare did to Vietnam -- and, to a lesser degree, America."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evaggelos-vallianatos/vietnam-in-the-aftermath-_b_2989215.html] Evaggelos Vallianatos, "Vietnam in the Aftermath of a Chemical Holocaust."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on peace and activism==
Wilcox's 1991 book ''Uncommon Martyrs: The Plowshares Movement and the Catholic Left'' is a portrait of some of the primary figures in the movement named from the biblical command to "beat swords into plowshares." Led by radical priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan, it included many well-known Catholic peace activists who engaged in many acts of civil disobedience in their attempts to stop the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Kirkus"&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/fred-wilcox/uncommon-martyrs/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilcox cowrote [http://www.openisbn.com/isbn/9781567511000/#review ''Fighting the Lamb's War,''] ({{ISBN|1-56751-101-5}}) the autobiography of Philip Berrigan, published in 1996.

==Other works==

Wilcox is also the author of a novel, ''Secrets'', a memoir, ''Chasing Shadows: Memoirs of a Sixties Survivor'', and shorter essays and nonfiction works.

Policy positions unrelated to the environment taken by the party would arguably{{according to whom|date=May 2018}} place it on the left wing in Ontario politics. The party calls for increased welfare and disability funding to reflect the actual cost of living in Ontario, eliminating tuition fees at Ontario universities, raising the minimum wage in Ontario to reflect cost of living in Ontario, subsidizing affordable housing, increasing funding for public transportation, and eliminating public funding for religious schools.&lt;ref name="VEPMurti"/&gt; Like many minor political parties, Go Vegan calls for a change in the electoral system from a [[First past the post]] to a system involving [[Proportional representation]].&lt;ref name="VEPMurti"/&gt;

'''Government Center Tower''' is a building located in the city of [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]]. It houses the offices of the Ministry of the Interior.

Designed by French-born Salvadoran architect Manuel Roberto Meléndez Bischitz (1934-2011), its construction began during the tenure of Colonel [[Arturo Armando Molina]] and became operational during the tenure of President General [[Carlos Humberto Romero]] in 1980. Various government offices were housed in the tower.

In 1999, President [[Francisco Flores Pérez]] decided to allocate the tower exclusively to the Interior Ministry. The tower has 14 floors above street level and three underground and has a height of 65 meters (213.2&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.laprensa.com.sv/20070220/dominical/edificios.swf]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal protection of [[human rights]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] is guaranteed by Chapter I of the [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands]].  The wording is broadly taken from documents such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], although there is a greater emphasis on the [[right of self-determination]].

The '''Industrial Policy Framework for the State of Telangana''' recognizes that [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] is recognized as a key source of the economic growth and development of the Indian state of [[Telangana]]. This framework came into force on December 1, 2014.

== Vision==

The stated vision for industrialization is: ''"Research to [[Innovation]], Innovation to Industry and Industry to prosperity."'' The policy encompasses fourteen thrust areas with a plan to develop six industrial corridors and common infrastructure. The cornerstone to the policy is zero graft and zero corruption - in pursuit of a secure and progressive business environment. While large companies such as ITC, [[Tata Motors]] and [[Mahindra Group|Mahindra]] are planning to expand their business in the newly developed state(s), this policy has also gained significance in the investment community.

==History==

On May 5, 2011 the [[Andhra Pradesh]] administration introduced guidelines to drive industrial promotion in the state. This policy was successful in attracting corporations such as [[PEPSI]] and the Siri City project. This also boosted the growth of the service sector in [[Hyderabad]], transforming it into anIT [[logistics]] hub. After bifurcation, both states sought investments that could increase employment and standard living. Telangana's policy framework was introduced on November 27, 2014 and came into effect on December 1, 2014. Telangana govt sets a record with new industrial policy and clears 17 projects worth Rs 1500 crore within 15 days of the launch.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/telangana-govt-sets-record-with-new-industrial-policy-clears-17-projects-worth-rs-2000-crores-in-10-days/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core values==
* Fecilitate industrial growth.
* Increase employment rates. 
* Inclusively fecilitate social equality.
* Marginally effect the socially disadvantaged sections.

=== Minimum inspection/maximum facilitation ===

Each industrial unit is to be inspected once every nine months; as established in advance. Occasional random inspections may occur with written permission of the department manager. Maximum facilitation encompasses an effective system beyond a single window anchor. Self-certification and automatic renewal will be encouraged along with an online E-Help line system.

=== Single window mechanism ===
Main article: [[TS-iPASS]]

The industrial clearance system shall be beyond a single window system, and shall be called Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS). This operates at three levels: very large projects, large industries and SMEs.

==Thrust areas==

Core Sectors Include:

* Life Sciences
* IT hardware including bio-medical devices, electronics, and cellular communication
* Precision engineering including aviation and aerospace 
* Food processing
* Automobiles, tractors and farm equipment
* Textiles and apparels
* Plastics and polymers
* [[Fast-moving consumer goods]] and domestic appliances
* Engineering and capital goods
* Gems and jewelry
* Waste management and green technologies
* Renewable energy and solar parks
* Mine-based and wood-based industries 
* Transportation, logistic hub, and inland ports

=== Special support ===

A very low proportion of the population is owned by Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and women entrepreneurs. Policies like TS-PRIDE shall be implemented to encourage Dalit entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcb83eb0-2188-11e4-b145-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3NrMa6G7u]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gibbons''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Environmental movement|environmental]] campaigner and the founder of the climatechange.ie [[website]]. He also co-founded the healthcare publishing and communications specialists MedMedia Group.

==Journalism==
For two years Gibbons contributed a weekly column to ''[[The Irish Times]]'', analysing aspects of [[climate change]] and [[sustainability]].  The newspaper dropped the column in February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabite.org/article_-Balancing--the-Climate-Consensus---Part-1_760894276.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212831/http://www.mediabite.org/article_-Balancing--the-Climate-Consensus---Part-1_760894276.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it continued to publish articles by Gibbons. His work has also appeared in 'The Guardian' and ''[[Sunday Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Gibbons (25 July 2010). [http://www.tribune.ie/article/2010/jul/25/2020-vision-why-we-have-10-years-to-save-our-plane/?q=gibbons 2020 vision why we have 10 years to save our planet]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Sunday Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of Irish response to environmental problems==
Citing evidence that global media coverage of climate change in 2010 fell to levels not seen since 2005, Gibbons argues that there is a similar trend in Ireland. He accuses Irish newspapers and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ) of "giving too much coverage to 'anti-science' climate change deniers and failing to convey the gravity of the threat, making readers and viewers apathetic".&lt;ref name="Monaghan_Times"&gt;{{cite news

Gibbons has argued that global economic recovery will be constrained by energy shortages, and he points out that the Irish economy, with its relatively high ''per capita'' use of energy, is particularly vulnerable to "[[peak oil]]", the anticipated decline in global oil production.&lt;ref name="Peak_oil"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24642">The '''Land Ordinance of 1785''' was adopted by the [[United States]] [[Congress of the Confederation]] on May 20, 1785. It set up a standardized system whereby settlers could purchase title to farmland in the undeveloped west.  Congress at the time did not have the power to raise revenue by direct taxation, so land sales provided an important revenue stream.  The Ordinance set up a survey system that eventually covered over 3/4 of the area of the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Carstensen, "Patterns on the American Land." ''Journal of Federalism,'' (1987) 18#4 pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier [[Ordinance of 1784]] was a resolution written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] calling for Congress to take action. The land west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], north of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] was to be divided into ten separate states.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McCormick, "The 'Ordinance' of 1784?," ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' Jan 1993, Vol. 50 Issue 1, pp 112–22&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1784 resolution did not define the mechanism by which the land would become states, or how the territories would be governed or settled before they became states. The Ordinance of 1785 put the 1784 resolution in operation by providing a mechanism for selling and settling the land,&lt;ref name=text&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lljc&amp;fileName=028/lljc028.db&amp;recNum=386 Journal of Continental Congress, Vol. 28, p. 375, May 20, 1785] [[Library of congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 addressed political needs.

The 1785 ordinance laid the foundations of land policy until passage of the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862. The Land Ordinance established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]]. The initial surveying was performed by [[Thomas Hutchins]]. After he died in 1789, responsibility for surveying was transferred to the Surveyor General. Land was to be systematically surveyed into square [[Survey township|township]]s, {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} on a side, each divided into thirty-six [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]]s of {{convert|1|mi2|km2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|640|acre|ha|abbr=on|lk=on}}. These sections could then be subdivided for re-sale by settlers and land speculators.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. Albert. ''A History of the Rectangular Survey System ''(Bureau of Land Management, 1983){{pageneeded|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinance was also significant for establishing a mechanism for funding public education. Section 16 in each township was reserved for the maintenance of public schools. Many schools today are still located in section sixteen of their respective townships,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} although a great many of the school sections were sold to raise money for public education. In later States, section 36 of each township was also designated as a "school section".&lt;ref&gt;White, ''A History of the Rectangular Survey System''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#will80|Williamson 1880]] : 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oregon Territory Act (August 14, 1848) {{USStat|9|323}} initiated practice of setting aside section 36 for schools: Section 20 "And be it further enacted, That when the lands in the said Territory shall be surveyed under the direction of the Government of the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into market, sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in each township in said Territory shall be, and the same is hereby, reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said Territory, and in the States and Territories hereafter to be erected out of the same."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey|Point of Beginning]] for the 1785 survey was where Ohio (as the easternmost part of the Northwest Territory), [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]) met, on the north shore of the [[Ohio River]] near [[East Liverpool, Ohio]]. There is a historical marker just north of the site, at the state line where [[Ohio State Route 39]] becomes Pennsylvania Route 68.

==History==
The [[Confederation Congress]] appointed a committee consisting of the following men:

* [[Thomas Jefferson]] ([[Virginia]])
* [[Hugh Williamson]] ([[North Carolina]])
* [[David Howell (jurist)|David Howell]] ([[Rhode Island]])
* [[Elbridge Gerry]] ([[Massachusetts]])
* [[Jacob Read]] ([[South Carolina]])

On May 7, 1784, the committee reported "An ordinance for ascertaining the mode of  locating and disposing of lands in the western territories, and for other purposes therein mentioned."  The ordinance required the land be divided into "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]] of ten [[geographical mile]]s square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot" and "sub-divided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 and 4-10ths of an acre",&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lljc&amp;fileName=027/lljc027.db&amp;recNum=83 Journal of Continental Congress, Vol. 27, p. 446, May 28, 1784] [[Library of congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; numbered starting in the northwest corner, proceeding from west to east, and east to west, consecutively.  After debate and amendment, the ordinance was reported to Congress April 26, 1785.  It required surveyors "to divide the said territory into townships seven miles square,  by lines running due north and south, and others crossing these at right angles. —  The plats of the townships, respectively, shall be marked into sections of one mile square, or 640 acres."  This is the first recorded use of the terms "township" and "section."&lt;ref name=subpub/&gt;

On May 3, 1785, [[William Grayson]] of Virginia made a motion seconded by [[James Monroe]] to change "seven miles square" to "six miles square."  The ordinance was passed on May 20, 1785.  The sections were to be numbered starting at 1 in the southeast and running south to north in each tier to 36 in the northwest.  The surveys were to be performed under the direction of the Geographer of the United States, (Thomas Hutchins).&lt;ref name=subpub/&gt; The [[Seven Ranges]], the privately surveyed [[Symmes Purchase]], and, with some modification, the privately surveyed [[Ohio Company of Associates]], all of the [[Ohio Lands]] were the surveys completed with this section numbering.&lt;ref name=ohiosub&gt;[[#pet18|Peters 1918]] : 58&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:uses 1785 numbering.png|left|thumb|Locations in Ohio using Land Ordinance of 1785 Section Numbering|250px]]

The Act of May 18, 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|464}} – Text of Act of May 18, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; provided for the appointment of a surveyor-general to replace the office of Geographer of the United States, and that "sections shall be numbered, respectively, beginning with number one in the northeast section, and proceeding west and east alternately, through the township, with progressive numbers till the thirty-sixth be completed."  All subsequent surveys were completed with this [[boustrophedon]]ical section numbering system, except the [[United States Military District]] of the [[Ohio Lands]] which had five mile (8&amp;nbsp;km) square townships as provided by the Act of June 1, 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|490}} – Text of Act of June 1, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; and amended by the Act of March 1, 1800.&lt;ref name=subpub&gt;[[#hig87|Higgins 1887]] : 33–34, 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|14}} – Text of Act of March 1, 1800 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Howe and others give Thomas Hutchins credit for conceiving the rectangular system of  lots of one square mile in 1764 while a captain in the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|Sixtieth, or, Royal American]], Regiment, and engineer to the expedition under Col. [[Henry Bouquet]] to the forks of the [[Muskingum River|Muskingum]], in what is now [[Coshocton County, Ohio]].  It formed part of his plan for military colonies north of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], as a protection against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]].  The law of 1785 embraced most of the new system.&lt;ref name=howe&gt;[[#howe07|Howe 1907]] : 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Treat, on the other hand, notes that tiers of townships were familiar in New England, and insisted on by the New England legislators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#tre10|Treat 1910]] : 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public education==
*Public Education reservations of the Land Ordinance of 1785 Background:*

The Land Ordinance of 1785, adopted May 20, 1785 by the Continental Congress, set the stage for an organized and community-based westward expansion in the United States in the years after the American Revolution. 
Under the 1785 act, section 16 of each township was set aside for school purposes, and as such was often called the school section. Section 36 was also subsequently added as a school section in western states. The various states and counties ignored, altered or amended this provision in their own ways, but the general (intended) effect was a guarantee that local schools would have an income and that the community schoolhouses would be centrally located for all children. An example of land allotments made specifically for higher education is Ohio's College Township.

==Layout of townships==
Each western township contained thirty-six square miles of land, planned as a square measuring six miles on each side, which was further subdivided into thirty six lots, each lot containing one square mile of land. The mathematical precision of the planning was the concerted effort of surveyors. Each township contained dedicated space for public education and other government uses, as five of the thirty six lots were reserved for government or public purposes. The thirty six lots of each township were numbered accordingly on each township's survey. The centermost land of each township corresponded to lot numbers 15, 16, 21 and 22 on the township survey, with lot number 16 dedicated specifically to public education. As the Land Ordinance of 1785 stated: "There shall be reserved the lot No. 16, of every township, for the maintenance of public schools within the said township."&lt;ref&gt;http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/twiki/bin/view/AmLegalHist/PublicEducationInLandGrantsSGrenbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

Knepper notes: "Sections number 8, 11, 26, and 29 in every township were reserved for future sale by the federal government when, it was hoped, they would bring higher prices because of developed land around them. Congress also reserved one third part of all gold, silver, lead, and copper mines to its own use, a bit of wishful thinking as regards Ohio lands."&lt;ref&gt;[[#knep02|Knepper 2002]] : 9&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance also said "That three townships adjacent to [[Lake Erie]] be reserved, to be hereafter disposed of by Congress, for the use of the officers, men, and others, refugees from [[Canada]], and the refugees from [[Nova Scotia]], who are or may be entitled to grants of land under resolutions of Congress now existing." This was not possible, as the area next to Lake Erie was [[Connecticut Western Reserve|property of Connecticut]], so the Canadians had to wait until the establishment of the [[Refugee Tract]] in 1798.&lt;ref name=officialohio&gt;[[#knep02|Knepper 2002]] : 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Many historians recognize the influences of the colonial experience in the land ordinances of the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;See Payson Jackson Treat. The National Land System. William S Hein and Co., 2003. and Jonathan Hughes "The Great Land Ordinances." Minnesota Legal History Project http://www.minnesotalegalhistoryproject.org/assets/hughes.pdf (accessed March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The committees that formulated these ordinances were inspired by the individual colonial experiences of the states that they represented. The committees attempted to implement the best practices of such states to solve the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Treat, pp. 22–23"&gt;Treat, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyed townships of the Land Ordinance of 1785, writes historian Jonathan Hughes, "represented an amalgam of the colonial experience and ideals."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Two geographically and ideologically distinct colonial land systems were competing at such time in history – the New England system and the Southern system.&lt;ref name="Treat, pp. 22–23"/&gt; While the primary influence on the Land Ordinance of 1785 was the New England land system of the colonial era, marked by its emphasis on community development and systematic planning, the exceedingly individualistic Southern land system also played a role.

Even though Jefferson's committee had a Southern majority, it recommended the New England survey system.&lt;ref&gt;Treat p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The highly planned and surveyed western townships established in the Land Ordinance of 1785, were heavily influenced by the New England settlements of the colonial era, particularly the land grant provisions of the Ordinances which dedicated land towards public education and other government uses. In colonial times, New England settlements contained dedicated public space for schools and churches, which often held a central role in the community. For instance, the 1751 royal charter for Marlboro Vermont provides: "one Shear [share] for the First Settled Minister one Shear for the benefit of the School forever."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; By time of the Land Ordinance of 1785 was enacted, the New England states had used land grants for over a century to support public education and build new schools. The clause in the Land Ordinance of 1785 which dedicated "Lot Number 16" of each western township for public education reflected this regional New England experience.&lt;ref&gt;David Carleton, Landmark Congressional Laws on Education. Connecticut, Greenwood Press, 2002. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the use of surveyors to precisely chart out the new townships in the westward expansion was directly influenced by the New England land system, which similarly relied on surveyors and local committees to clearly delineate property boundaries. Defined property boundary lines and an established land title system, provided colonials with a sense of security in their land ownership, by minimizing the likelihood of ownership or boundary disputes. This was an important consideration in the Land Ordinance of 1785. One of the primary purposes of the Ordinance was to raise funds for the increasingly insolvent government. Providing land speculators security in their purchases encouraged additional demand for the western lands. In addition, the organized and communal nature of the western settlements, allowed the government to reserve a number of well-defined plots of land for future government development. Since the rest of the township would have been developed by the time the government decided to develop such reserved lands, there was an already built-in assurance of land value appreciation for the reserved lands. This had the effect of increasing the value of government assets without much further investment by the government.

The New England land system, while the primary influence on the great land ordinances of the 1780s, was not the only land system influence. The Southern land system, marked by individualism and personal initiative, also helped shape the ordinance. While the New England land system was premised on community-based development, the Southern land system was premised on individual frontiersman appropriating undeveloped land to call their own. The Southern pioneer claimed property and the local surveyor would demarcate it for him. The system did not protect people from competing claims or set up an orderly chain of title. The process was called 'indiscriminate location". This system encouraged individuals to amass large plantations instead of settling into dense communal development. This system was supported by the use of slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;See Treat p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the committee's resistance against indiscriminate location and support for limited and disciplined land settlement was an implicit attempt to create a structural barrier to developing a plantation economy that was dependent on slave labor. The committee could have been attempting to effectively eradicate slavery in the West after Jefferson failed to outlaw it in the Land Ordinance of 1784.

While the Land Ordinance of 1785 created a New England style land system, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 determined how the townships would be administered. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, like the Land Ordinance of 1785, was inspired by the New England colonial settlements, and manifested this influence by further encouraging the worship of religion and the spread of education. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 stated, "Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."&lt;ref&gt;The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Article 3. http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=8 (Accessed March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also contained Southern characteristics of municipal governance. The Southern influence can be felt in the Western townships in that once the federal land was dedicated to the particular township, the township was relatively free of the influence of the federal government, and the local municipality was left to govern itself. This manifested itself in public education as well. Once the land was dedicated, the actual development of the public schools was the responsibility of the local township or the particular state.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Usher, "Public Schools in the Original Federal Land Grant Program" The Center on Education Policy; April 2011 p. 8 http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED518388&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED518388 (Accessed March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the great Ordinances of the 1780s set the framework for a national system of schools by dedicating land across the West, the devolved development and administration by the state and local government led to unique results.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motive==
Retaining central land in each township ensured that these lands would create value for the federal government and the safety of the people. Instead of disbursing funds to the new states to create public education systems, dedicating a central lot in each township provided the new townships with the means to develop educational institutions without any transfer of funds. This was a practical and necessary way to achieve the committee's goal in a pre-Constitution America. Aside from raising funds for a financially struggling government, the westward expansion outlined in the Land Ordinances of the 1780s also provided a framework for spreading democratic ideals. Jefferson proposed an article in the Ordinance of 1784 that would have outlawed slavery in the new states after the year 1800. However he could not amass enough votes to pass the anti-slavery article. Later Jefferson did succeed, however, in ensuring public funding of education by dedicating land to education in the Land Ordinance of 1785. Public education was an ideal already developed in the New England colonial settlements. New Englanders provided for public education in their land grants due to a belief that public education could be used to further unite the young nation and spread democratic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Carleton, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic and highly organized westward settlements, with their local governments and central square dedicated towards public education, were a concerted effort to inspire civic duty and participation in the democratic process. Usher relates this initiative to "the Supreme Court in Cooper v. Roberts (1855), 'plant in the heart of every community the same sentiments of grateful reverence for the wisdom, forecast, and magnanimous statesmanship of those who framed the institutions of these new States." &lt;ref&gt;Usher, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The westward expansion therefore was not only a tool for raising much needed funds, but also a tool in a grand socializing experiment to inoculate the settlers to democratic ideals. The hope was that the unique planning of each township with a public school centrally located, coupled with the obligation of each township's local citizens to take part in the civic process of governing the township, teaching and building the schools, and maintaining order, would instill the democratic ideals crucial to the nation's success.

{{for|the land question elsewhere|land reform}}
The ''''Land Question'''', as it pertains to the history of [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada, related to the question of the system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst the tenants preferred a system of [[Freehold (law)|freehold]]. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their [[quitrent]]s. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in [[Colonial Office]] intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor [[Walter Patterson (governor)|Walter Patterson]], who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.

In 1797, the Escheat Movement was born with the goal of convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the [[General Assembly of Prince Edward Island]], but their attempts to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at [[civil disobedience]] in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the [[Canadian Confederation]] on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.

== Background ==
In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] resulted in the transfer of Prince Edward Island from France to the United Kingdom. In 1767, a system of land ownership was established in which the island was divided into 67 lots of about {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} each, with settlers living on parcels of this land rented out by the proprietors, or the owners of the lots of land. Ownership of the lots of land was determined by a lottery held in London, the winners of which were mostly political, business and military figures with connections to those in the British government. In 1769, under pressure from the proprietors who worried that a [[Nova Scotia]] legislature would force them to give up their property rights, the British government granted Prince Edward Island autonomy.&lt;ref name=jrank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/7914/Prince-Edward-Island-land-question.html|title=Prince Edward Island land question|last=Robertson|first=Ian|year=2011|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/pei-land-question/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt;|title=Land Question, PEI|last=Bumsted|first=J. M.|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial conflict ==
Almost immediately after the establishment of the new system, conflict arose. The [[American Revolutionary War]] drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for proprietors to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per {{convert|200|acre}} within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that the proprietors were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that the proprietors were unable, or at least not willing, to pay the required [[quitrent]] to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and the proprietors. As the lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of the proprietors were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of the proprietors did not actually live in [[British North America]]. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.&lt;ref name=jrank/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1774, the [[government of Prince Edward Island]] passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, the government, led by Governor [[Walter Patterson (governor)|Walter Patterson]], compulsorily acquired approximately half of the island using a process known as [[escheat]].&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/original/assemblytimelin.pdf|title=Timeline of The Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=125&amp;art=765|title=History and Politics of Prince Edward Island|last=Driscoll|first=Fred|work=Canadian Parliamentary Review|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Escheat Movement ==
In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under the scheme proposed by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won a large majority in the [[General Assembly of Prince Edward Island]] in 1802, and in 1803 a law to implement escheat was passed by the legislature. However, the government of the United Kingdom would not abandon its principle of supporting property rights and refused to grant the bill [[Royal Assent]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1832, a tax was placed on land owned by the proprietors. In exchange for collecting the tax, the government promised to abandon its attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] led the [[Privy Council]] to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island with the introduction of these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], but he was turned away without a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island]] that the government would not recommend assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

== Settlement (Sulivan and Stewart) ==
In 1851, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] gained office on Prince Edward Island. They immediately went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because [[Samuel Cunard]], who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell any of his land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so the government of the island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled.&lt;ref name=jrank/&gt; It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ANhhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FJEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6925,4902104|title=The Irish in America|last=Maguire|first=John|date=March 6, 1868|work=The [[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=6|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, many of the proprietors pulled out of the real estate market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the [[Canadian Confederation]]. One of the terms of the Island joining the Confederation was the sale of the estates of land to their occupiers. The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal [[government of Canada]] could provide a grant of up to [[Canadian dollar|CA]]$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.&lt;ref name=jrank/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The two largest landholders to be 'bought-out' by the new Canadian province, in 1875, did not readily agree with their forced sale, facilitated by the articles of the [[Land Purchase Act (1875)]].  On Monday, August 23rd, 1875, The ‘Commission of Enquiry’ began its enquiry of the largest estate, of an 'absentee' landowner, that of ([[Laurence Sulivan]]) Charlotte Antonia Sulivan of some 66,937 acres.  She being awarded: $81,500 CAD 1875, at $1.22 per acre, Miss Sulivan challenged the authority of the Commissioners in their proceedings against her, she seeing the award set aside on appeal to the Supreme Court of PEI.  She claiming $239,185 CAD 1875, the Province, appealing, for The Commissioner of Public Lands, took her challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada, it being The Court’s first case, [[Kelly v Sulivan]], sustained the forced sale and award. &lt;ref&gt;Margaret E.

On Friday, August 27th, 1875, The ‘Commission of Enquiry’ enquired as to the estate of Robert Bruce Stewart, then the largest ‘resident’ proprietor on PEI, owning some 66,727 acres.  Upon his father's death in 1852, Robert Bruce Stewart inherited, by title, Lots 7, 10, 12, and 30 as well as parts of Lots 27, 46, and 47.  He having fought long and hard against the legislation enabling the Land Purchase Act 1875, against a claim of $240,905, the ‘Commission of Enquiry’ awarded him just $76,500 CAD 1875, the lowest per acre award, at $1.15 per acre.  &lt;ref&gt;Archives Council of Prince Edward Island, Results for Fonds Acc2316, Stewart Family.

"'''Liar Liar GE2017'''" is a [[protest song]] performed by the British [[ska]]/[[reggae]] band [[Captain SKA]]. Released on 26 May 2017 by Captain's Records in association with the [[People's Assembly Against Austerity]], and in anticipation of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]],&lt;ref name="Canary Sykes"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song is critical of Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], remarking upon her cuts to various government agencies and programmes, as well as her political positions. The song is a remake of a previous version of the song, "'''Liar Liar'''", which was released in 2010, and similarly critical of the previous [[coalition government]] led by [[David Cameron]].

By 31 May 2017,  "Liar Liar GE17" had become the most-purchased song in the United Kingdom on [[Amazon Music]] and [[iTunes Store]], and on 2 June 2017 it charted at #4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Proceeds from sales of the single until 8 June 2017 (the day of the election) were to be donated to support [[food bank]]s and the People's Assembly.

Despite the strong media attention and sales that the song achieved, it had done so without [[radio]] airplay; due to concerns that it could run afoul of broadcasting regulations requiring [[impartiality]] in coverage of elections during the campaign period, British radio stations refused to play "Liar Liar GE17". The band was particularly critical of [[BBC Radio]]'s attempts to suppress the song on both radio and their associated digital platforms, as they felt that the broadcaster was attempting to inhibit "critical thinking or debate" rather than act in the public interest.

== Composition and release ==

The song accuses current British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative politician]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] of being a liar who cannot be trusted, and its [[lyric video]] highlights the plight of nurses working for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) having to resort to using [[food banks]]; and cuts to [[education]], the NHS, [[social care]], [[policing]], and [[welfare benefits]] such as [[Disability Living Allowance]], under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' rule.&lt;ref name="Independent Khan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyRecord Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Official Video YouTube" /&gt; The video also points out May's political [[U-turns]] on [[Brexit]], the so-called "[[Social care in England|dementia tax]]", and calling a [[snap election]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Weaver"&gt;{{cite web

==Airplay==
Despite its chart performance, radio stations in the United Kingdom, including [[BBC Radio]] as well as commercial stations, widely refused to play "Liar Liar GE17", due to concerns that airplay of the song could violate broadcasting regulations in force during election campaign periods.&lt;ref name="Independent Khan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost Bowden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Newsbeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-liarliar"&gt;{{cite web|date=31 May 2017|last=Taylor|first=Adam|title=A song that calls Britain’s Theresa May a liar is climbing the charts — but it isn’t being played on the radio|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|website=Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100420/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|archive-date=11 June 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Representation of the People Act 1983]], as well as the code of [[Ofcom]], the United Kingdom's broadcasting regulator, contain rules regulating and restricting the media coverage of elections, effective upon the dissolution of Parliament following an election call.

The '''American Liberty Dollar''' ('''ALD''') was a [[private currency]] produced in the United States.

The currency was issued in minted metal rounds (similar to coins), gold and silver certificates and electronic currency (eLD). ALD certificates are "warehouse receipts" for real gold and silver owned by the bearer. According to court documents there were about 250,000 holders of Liberty Dollar certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lach |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Feds Seeking $7M Worth Of {{Sic|hide=y|Privately|-}}Minted 'Liberty Dollars' |work=Talking Points Memo |date=April 4, 2011 |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/04/feds_seeking_7m_worth_of_privately-minted_liberty.php |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal was warehoused at [[Sunshine Minting]] in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], prior to a November 2007 raid by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] (USSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.reason.com/blog/show/123553.html |title=Your Liberty Dollar Raid Update |date=November 16, 2007 |publisher=Reason Magazine |first=Jeff |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until July 2009, the Liberty Dollar was distributed by Liberty Services (formerly known as "National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code" or NORFED), based in [[Evansville, Indiana]].

In May 2009, von NotHaus and others were charged with federal crimes in connection with the Liberty Dollar and, on July 31, 2009, von NotHaus announced that he had closed the Liberty Dollar operation, pending resolution of the criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/pr_nl/07_31_2009.htm |date=July 2009 |title=Liberty Dollar Closed |publisher=Liberty Dollar}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was pronounced guilty of "making coins resembling and similar to United States coins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Defendant Convicted of Minting His Own Currency |publisher=[[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney's Office]] |date=March 18, 2011 |location=[[United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/charlotte/press-releases/2011/defendant-convicted-of-minting-his-own-currency |archivedate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CygqRiVv?url=http://www.fbi.gov/charlotte/press-releases/2011/defendant-convicted-of-minting-his-own-currency |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Lovett |title=Local Liberty Dollar 'Architect' Bernard von NotHaus convicted |date=March 19, 2011 |publisher=Evansville Courier &amp; Press |url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/mar/19/local-liberty-dollar-architect-found-guilty/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Liberty Dollars seized in the 2007 FBI/ USSS operation should be returned to their owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Gilkes |title=Federal government to return millions of dollars in Liberty Dollars seized by authorities in 2007 |date=August 19, 2015 |publisher=CoinWorld.com |url= http://www.coinworld.com/news/precious-metals/2015/08/federal-government-to-return-millions-in-liberty-dollars-.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

=== Exchange service ===
From 1998 to July 2009, Liberty Services exchanged [[Federal Reserve Notes]] (US dollars) for silver Liberty Dollars (and later gold and copper), as well as for Warehouse Receipts in both paper and digital forms.

=== Currency reform ===
Liberty Services' original name was "National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code" (NORFED). Since its founding, the organization asserted that the Federal Reserve was unconstitutional and harmful. The company engaged in a series of legal battles both defending their exchange service and challenging exclusivity assertions made by the US Mint (see [[#Legal issues|Legal issues]]).

== Function ==

=== Differences from other alternative currencies ===
A number of alternative currencies exist in the United States, including Phoenix Dollars, Baltimore's BNote, [[Ithaca Hours]], [[Bitcoin]] and [[digital gold currency]]. Unlike some other alternative currencies, both Liberty Dollars and Phoenix Dollars were denominated by weight and backed by a commodity. Liberty Dollars used gold, silver, [[platinum]], or copper. Other private currencies use different bases, such as tying their value to a specific unit of time; i.e., 1 hour = 1 Time Dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timebanks.org |title=Time Dollars}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the most simplistic version of that model, the future value of the currency would depend on the willingness of people to swap their labor, regardless of the market value of the labor provided. However, systems such as [[Ithaca Hours]] have introduced more sophisticated models that allow for variations in market value of labor. Liberty Dollars also differed from other alternative currencies in that they carried a suggested US dollar face value.

The only laws against counterfeiting private currencies, whether they are printed or minted, are ordinary statutes against fraud. Coining is more technologically difficult than is printing, and inclusion of precious metal in coins has long been seen as a means of "embedding" value in them. The Liberty Dollar consisted of both coins and printed notes. Liberty Dollars were backed by a physical commodity—a weight in precious metal.

=== Liberty Dollar base values, discounts, and commissions ===
The Liberty Dollar "base value" was created by Bernard von NotHaus. {{as of|2009}}, the base value of the Liberty Dollar was $20 Liberty Dollars to one ounce of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/information/pdfs/color-brochure.pdf |title=2009 Brochure |publisher=Liberty Dollar |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Liberty Dollar operation was closed, one ounce Liberty Dollar gold pieces were denominated $1,000 with a maximum charge of 10% over spot price with membership. The previous base values were $10 silver ounce, $20 silver ounce and $500 gold ounce. Non-members paid full face value for all currency except for certain Special and Numismatic items. Members' discounts ranged from 0% to 50%+ (actually, for short periods during crossovers it was possible that even members could not buy Liberty Dollars at face value or less).

Liberty Dollar associates and merchants used to exchange for Liberty Dollars at a discount, so they could "make money when [they] spend money."{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} To further distinguish how the Liberty Dollar worked, von NotHaus transitioned to a commission structure in June 2007 where associates and merchants received a commission in the form of extra Liberty Dollars when they placed their orders. Regional currency officers received larger discounts; they were the regional distributors and official representatives of Liberty Services.

The Liberty Dollar associate and merchant discounts ranged from 0.0%–50%+ (zero to more than fifty percent) depending on where the price of silver was, relative to the Liberty Dollar base value, the Liberty Dollar base value crossover points, and the time periods during which the price stayed above varying moving-day averages over 30, 60 or 90 days in a fluctuating market, based on Liberty Dollar formulas worked out by von NotHaus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/about/liberty-dollar-doubles.htm |title=Liberty Dollar DOUBLES The Story of the Inflation Proof Currency: Moves Up to the $20 Silver Base |publisher=Liberty Dollar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional currency office ===
A "regional currency office" was a kind of distributor of Liberty Dollars. In exchange for a fee paid to Liberty Dollar they could purchase Liberty dollars for resale at a discount. They were also authorized to purchase, convert, or perhaps exchange Liberty Dollars for Federal Reserve Notes.&lt;ref&gt;http://libertydollar.org/ld/rco/index.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027133402/http://libertydollar.org/ld/rco/index.htm |date=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==

=== Federal Government response ===
Numerous individuals within the U.S. Government have been interviewed regarding the Liberty Dollar. The Liberty Dollar organization asserts that one Secret Service agent has stated "It's not counterfeit money"&lt;ref name="norfed.org"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.norfed.org/news-stories/pdfs/libertybucks.pdf |title=American Liberty Bucks |first=Cletus |last=Nelson |publisher=EYE magazine |date=February 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621083943/http://www.norfed.org/news-stories/pdfs/libertybucks.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while remaining "skeptical" of NORFED. Another agent is reported to have warned that the Liberty Dollar "appears to be in violation of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|514}}."&lt;ref name="norfed.org"/&gt; The minting of Liberty dollars also appears to be in violation of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|486}}:{{quote|Whoever, except as authorized by law, makes or utters or passes, or attempts to utter or pass, any coins of gold or silver or other metal, or alloys of metals, intended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries, or of original design, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.}}

The promoter of the Liberty Dollar asserts that Claudia Dickens, spokeswoman for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department's]] [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], had previously said American Liberty Currency is legitimate. Dickens was quoted as having said "There's nothing illegal about this", after the Treasury Department's legal team reviewed the currency. "As long as it doesn't say 'legal tender' there's nothing wrong with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.norfed.org/news-stories/pdfs/y2klooming.pdf |title=As Y2K looms, Estero man offers silver-back currency |first=Chad |last=Gillis |date=May 3, 1999 |publisher=The Naples Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621083945/http://www.norfed.org/news-stories/pdfs/y2klooming.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the U.S. Mint issued a press release stating that prosecutors at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had determined that using Liberty Dollars as circulating money is a federal crime. The press release also stated that the "Liberty Dollars" are meant to compete with the circulating coinage (currency) of the United States and such competition consequently is a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?flash=yes&amp;action=press_release&amp;id=710 |title=Justice Determines Use of Liberty Dollar Medallions as Money is a Crime |date=September 14, 2006 |publisher=United States Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department also stated that the Liberty Dollar was confusingly similar to actual U.S. currency, and the language used on NORFED's website was deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.usmint.gov/consumer/?action=archives#NORFED |title=NORFED's "Liberty Dollars" |publisher=United States Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberty Dollar organization responded to the Mint's press release by stating that "[t]he Liberty Dollar &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; has claimed to be, does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; claim to be, is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;, and does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; purport to be, ''[[legal tender]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/press-kit/usmint-allegations.htm |title=The US Mint News Story in Perspective |publisher=Liberty Dollar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promoters of the Liberty Dollar have asserted that the Liberty Dollar is not legal tender, and that legal tender and [[barter]] are mutually exclusive concepts. The promoter asserts that the Liberty Dollar is a numismatic piece or medallion which may be used voluntarily as barter.

=== Bernard von NotHaus v. the U.S. Mint ===
On March 20, 2007, Liberty Services owner Bernard von NotHaus filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of [[Indiana]] against the U.S. Mint's claims regarding the Liberty Dollar. Defendants include [[Henry M. Paulson]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]]; [[Alberto R. Gonzales]], former [[Attorney General of the United States]]; and [[Edmund C. Moy]], Director of the Mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Government Documents |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/legal/lawsuit.htm |publisher=Liberty Dollar |accessdate=June 19, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501094659/http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/legal/lawsuit.htm |archivedate = May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit seeks a declaratory judgment that circulating Liberty Dollars as a voluntary barter currency is not a federal crime and an injunction barring the Defendants from publicly or privately declaring the Liberty Dollar an illegal currency and to remove any such declarations from the U.S. Mint's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/legal/legalissues.htm |title=Legal Issues |publisher=Liberty Dollar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI / Secret Service raid ===
The Liberty Dollar offices were raided by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) on November 14, 2007. Bernard von NotHaus, the owner of Liberty Services, sent an email to customers and supporters saying that the agents took all the gold, silver, and platinum, and almost two tons of [[Ron Paul]] Dollars. The agents also seized computers and files and froze the Liberty Dollar bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.rabidquill.com/2007/11/15/frontal-assault-on-freedom-fbi-raids-liberty-dollar/ |publisher=The Rabid Quill |title=Frontal Assault on Freedom: FBI Raids Liberty Dollar |date=November 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117060339/http://www.rabidquill.com/2007/11/15/frontal-assault-on-freedom-fbi-raids-liberty-dollar/ |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Von NotHaus's email linked to a signup page for a class action lawsuit so that the victims might recover their assets. At the same time, all forms on his website relating to purchases of Liberty Dollars became nonfunctional.

Copies of the email and the warrant documents have been posted to the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/ld/legal/raid.htm |title=Government vs. Liberty Dollar |publisher=Liberty Dollar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seizure warrant was issued for [[money laundering]], [[mail fraud]], [[wire fraud]], [[counterfeiting]], and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.johnlocke.org/site-docs/meckdeck/pdfs/USAVLibdoll.pdf |title=Seizure Warrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libertydollar.org/legal/pdf/seizure_warrant_20071114.pdf |title=Seizure Warrant (Copy)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local Evansville ''[[Evansville Courier &amp;amp; Press|Courier &amp;amp; Press]]'' reported the email, stating that "FBI Agent Wendy Osborne, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Indianapolis office, directed all questions on the raid to the Western District of North Carolina U.S. Attorney's Office. A spokeswoman there said she had no information on the investigation. Bernard von NotHaus, the group's monetary architect and the author of the email, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lesnick, Gavin|title=Liberty Dollar office raided|work=Evansville Courier &amp;amp; Press|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=February 8, 2008|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2007/nov/15/liberty-dollar-office-raided/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press quoted von NotHaus on November 16, 2007, as saying that the federal government was "running scared right now and they had to do something .... I'm volunteering to meet the agents and get arrested so we can thrash this out in court."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/11/16/1101904-feds-raid-liberty-dollar-hq-in-ind |first=Ryan |last=Lenz |title=Feds raid 'Liberty Dollar' HQ in Ind. |date=November 16, 2007 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indictment===
A federal grand jury brought an indictment against von NotHaus and three others in May 2009 in United States District Court in Statesville, North Carolina,&lt;ref name="Indictment 2009"&gt;Indictment, docket entry 3, May 19, 2009, case no. 5:09-cr-00027-RLV-DCK-1, ''United States v. Bernard von NotHaus et al.'', U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (Statesville Div.).&lt;/ref&gt; and von NotHaus was arrested on June 6, 2009. Bernard von NotHaus is charged with one count of conspiracy to possess and sell coins in resemblance and similitude of coins of a denomination higher than five cents, and silver coins in resemblance of genuine coins of the United States in denominations of five dollars and greater, in violation of {{usc|18|485}}, {{usc|18|486}}, and {{usc|18|371}}; one count of mail fraud in violation of {{usc|18|1341}} and {{usc|18|2}}; one count of selling, and possessing with intent to defraud, coins of resemblance and similitude of United States coins in denominations of five cents and higher, in violation of {{usc|18|485}} and {{usc|18|2}}; and one count of uttering, passing, and attempting to utter and pass, silver coins in resemblance of genuine U.S. coins in denominations of five dollars or greater, in violation of {{usc|18|486}} and {{usc|18|2}}.&lt;ref name="Indictment 2009"/&gt;

On July 28, 2009, von NotHaus entered a plea of not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Waiver of Personal Appearance at Arraignment and Entry of Plea of Not Guilty, docket entry 36, July 28, 2009, case no. 5:09-cr-00027-RLV-DCK-1, ''United States v. Bernard von NotHaus et al.'', U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (Statesville Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction===
On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was convicted of "making, possessing and selling his own coins", after a jury in [[Statesville, North Carolina]] deliberated for less than two hours.&lt;ref name="WBTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=14279992|title=NC man convicted of illegally minting US coins|date=March 18, 2011|publisher=WBTV|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found him guilty of one count under {{usc|18|485}} and {{usc|18|2}}, one count of violating {{usc|18|486}} and {{usc|18|2}}, and one count of conspiracy, under {{usc|18|371}}, to violate sections 485 and 486.&lt;ref&gt;See Jury Verdict, March 18, 2011, docket entry 191, ''United States v. von NotHaus'', case no. 5:09-cr-00027-RLV-DCK.&lt;/ref&gt; He faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and may be forced to give $7 million worth of minted coins and precious metals to the government, weighing 16,000 pounds.&lt;ref name="WBTV"/&gt; Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina|Western District of North Carolina]], Anne M. Tompkins, described the Liberty Dollar as "a unique form of domestic terrorism" that is trying "to undermine the legitimate currency of this country".&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/editorials/a-unique-form-of-terrorism/87269/ |title=Editorial: A ‘Unique’ Form of ‘Terrorism’ |work=The New York Sun |date=March 20, 2011 |archivedate=March 25, 2011 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325052709/http://www.nysun.com/editorials/a-unique-form-of-terrorism/87269/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department press release quotes her as saying: "While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country."&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt;

According to the Associated Press, "Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word "dollar" and the motto "Trust in God," similar to the "In God We Trust" that appears on U.S. coins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_liberty_dollars_raid#mwpphu-post-form |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429231739/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_liberty_dollars_raid |archivedate=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction was appealed.

==Post-conviction==
Since his trial, ''[[The New York Times]]'' has said that some people describe von NotHaus as "the [[Rosa Parks]] of the constitutional currency movement."

He appealed his conviction but his appeal was denied on 10 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gata.org/files/VonNotHausOrder-Nov-10-2014.pdf North Carolina District Court Criminal Docket no.: 5:09CR27-RLV]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov 11th, 2014 Judge Voorhees denied von NotHaus' Motion for Acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertydollarnews.org/11102014/court%20_order_BVNH_sentencing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 2014, despite prosecutor demands that he serve as much as 23 years in federal prison, he was sentenced to 6 months house arrest, with 3 years probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nysun.com/editorials/beyond-bernard-von-nothaus/88958/&lt;/ref&gt;As part of his reasoning for delivering a greatly reduced sentence from what Federal Prosecutors demanded, Judge Richard L. Voorhees considered von NotHaus' appeal, which stated:

:...if anything is clear from the evidence presented at trial, it is that the last thing Mr. von NotHaus wanted was for Liberty Dollars [to] be confused with coins issued by the United States government...His intention – to protest the Federal Reserve system – has always been plain. The jury's verdict conflates a program created to function as an alternative to the Federal Reserve system with one designed to [deceive] people into believing it was the very thing Mr. von NotHaus was protesting in the first place...the Liberty Dollars was not a counterfeit and was not intended to function as such. The verdict is a perversion of the counterfeiting statutes and should be set aside.

The conviction, which was seen as a victory for the government, has now defined  {{usc|18|486}} as prohibiting the use of silver bullion, or any other metal coin or bar not issued under government authority, from being used in commerce. The Silver Certificates issued by Liberty Services were not considered any form of counterfeiting or violation of law. 

Bernard von NotHaus' probation officer suggested he file for early release from probation after one year, and recommended the early termination to the court. Termination of probation was formally granted December 9, 2015 by U.S. District Judge Richard L. Voorhees: http://www.libertydollarnews.org/2015dec/BVNH_pt.pdf

When asked about the government's motive for accusing him of terrorism, von NotHaus scoffed, "This is the United States government. It's got all the guns, all the surveillance, all the tanks, it has nuclear weapons, and it's worried about some ex-surfer guy making his own money? Give me a break!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prison May Be the Next Stop on a Gold Currency Journey |last=Feuer |first=Alan |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/us/liberty-dollar-creator-awaits-his-fate-behind-bars.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |location=[[Malibu, California]] |archivedate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CydWCZca?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/us/liberty-dollar-creator-awaits-his-fate-behind-bars.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all |access-date=February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberty Dollars are returned===
In 2017, a significant number of seized Liberty Dollars were returned to their owners after petitions were made to the court for this return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coinworld.com/news/precious-metals/2017/11/returned-liberty-dollars-being-hallmarked.all.html|title=Returned Liberty Dollars being hallmarked|work=Coin World|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard von NotHaus continues to honor redemption of silver to this day.

The '''Medicare Part D coverage gap''' (informally known as the '''Medicare doughnut hole''') is a period of consumer payment for prescription medication costs which lies between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic-coverage threshold, when the consumer is a member of a [[Medicare Part D]] [[prescription drug|prescription-drug]] program administered by the [[Government of the United States|United States federal government]]. The gap is reached after shared insurer payment - consumer payment for all covered prescription drugs reaches a government-set amount, and is left only after the consumer has paid full, unshared costs of an additional amount for the same prescriptions.  Upon entering the gap, the prescription payments to date are re-set to $0 and continue until the maximum amount of the gap is reached OR the current annual period lapses: copayments made by the consumer up to the point of entering the gap are specifically ''not'' counted toward payment of the costs accruing while in the gap.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 gradually phase out the coverage gap, eliminating it by 2020.&lt;ref name="medicare.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf|title=Closing the Coverage Gap—Medicare Prescription Drugs Are Becoming More Affordable|author=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|date=January 2015|website=Medicare.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221002940/https://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf|archive-date=February 21, 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

== Details ==
In 2006, the first year of operation for Medicare Part D, the doughnut hole in the defined standard benefit covered a range in true [[out-of-pocket expenses]] (TrOOP) costs from $750 to $3,600.  (The first $750 of TrOOP comes from a $250 [[deductible]] phase, and $500 in the initial coverage limit, in which the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) covers 75 percent of the next $2,000.) In the first year of operation, there was a substantial reduction in out-of-pocket costs and a moderate increase in medication utilization among Medicare beneficiaries, although there was no evidence of improvement in emergency department use, hospitalizations, or preference-based health utility for those eligible for Part D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Liu FX, Alexander GC, Crawford SY, Pickard AS, Hedeker D, Walton SM |title= Impact of Medicare Part D on Emergency Department Use, Hospitalizations, and Preference-based Health Utility |journal= Health Services Research|volume=46 |issue= |pages=1104–1123 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21609328 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2011.01273.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2011.01273.x/full |url-access=subscription |pmc=3165180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dollar limits increase yearly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The costs shown in the table above represent the 2018 defined standard Medicare Part D prescription drug plan parameters released by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) in April 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Individual Medicare Part D plans may choose to offer more generous benefits but must meet the minimum standards established by the defined standard benefit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The 2018 Medicare Part D standard benefit includes a deductible of $405 (the amount that beneficiaries must pay out of pocket before their insurance benefits kick in) and a 25% co-insurance up to the initial coverage maximum of $3,750. Once the total annual drug costs exceed $3750, patients reach the coverage gap, also known as the "doughnut hole".  During the coverage gap stage, beneficiaries pay a larger percentage out of pocket until their total out-of-pocket spending reaches $5000. At $5000 of out of pocket spending, beneficiaries reach catastrophic coverage, where they pay either 5% of total drug cost or $3.35 for generics and $8.35 for brand-name drugs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Low Income Subsidy ==
The Low-Income Subsidy (LIS), also known as "Extra Help" provides additional cost-sharing and premium assistance for eligible low-income Medicare Part D beneficiaries with incomes below 150% the [[Federal poverty level|Federal Poverty Level]] and limited assets.  Individuals who qualify for the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) or who are also enrolled in [[Medicaid]] do not have a coverage gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://q1medicare.com/PartD-Medicare-Medicaid-Extra-Help-LIS.php|title=Medicaid, Extra Help and LIS|last=LLC|first=Q1GROUP|website=q1medicare.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for the LIS, Medicare beneficiaries must qualify for full Medicaid benefits, be enrolled in Medicare Savings Programs (MSP), and receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These individuals automatically qualify for the subsidy and do not have to apply separately. Others may qualify after applying through their state Medicaid programs or through the [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and fulfill income and asset requirements. In a marketplace review conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2010, only 40% of eligible low-income beneficiaries who did not automatically qualify for the LIS actually received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8094.pdf|title=THE MEDICARE PART D LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY PROGRAM: Experience to Date and Policy Issues for Consideration|last=Summer|first=Laura|date=|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the LIS will pay no premiums or deductibles and no more than $8.25 for each drug that their plan covers. In addition, beneficiaries with Extra Help are not penalized for late enrollment in a Part D plan. LIS recipients also benefit from a Continuous Special Enrollment Period to join or switch plans during any time of the year. They do not need to wait for the formal Annual Enrollment Period. Any changes made to their plans will be applied the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncoa.org/economic-security/benefits/prescriptions/lis-extrahelp/|title=Low Income Subsidy (LIS) - Medicare Extra Help {{!}} NCOA|date=2015-05-07|work=NCOA|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Medicare beneficiaries ==
{{Update|section|reason=it does not reflect benefit changes following passage of the ''[[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010''|date=September 2017}}
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] estimates that more than a quarter of Part D participants stop following their prescribed regimen of drugs when they hit the doughnut hole.&lt;ref name="fostersaug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100812/GJNEWS_01/708129744/0/FOSNEWS|title=Medicare 'Doughnut Hole' Checks in the Mail|last=Claffey|first=Jason|date=August 14, 2010|website=[[Foster's Daily Democrat]]|publisher=Gatehouse Media|access-date=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Part D plan sponsor must offer at least one basic Part D plan.  They may also offer enhanced plans that provide additional benefits.  For 2008, the percentage of stand-alone Part D (PDP) plans  offering some form of coverage within the doughnut hole rose to 29 percent, up from 15 percent in 2006.  The percentage of Medicare Advantage/Part D plans (MA-PD) plans offering some form of coverage in the coverage gap is 51 percent, up from 28 percent in 2006.  The most common forms of gap coverage cover generic drugs only.&lt;ref name="The Coverage Gap - 2008"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Hoadley |first1=Jack |last2=Thompson |first2=Jennifer |last3=Hargrave |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Merrell |first4=Katie |last5=Cubanski |first5=Juliette |last6=Neuman |first6=Tricia |date=October 30, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-part-d-2008-data-spotlight-the/ |title=Medicare Part D 2008 Data Spotlight: The Coverage Gap |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Medicare Part D enrollees in 2007 who were not eligible for the low-income subsidies, 26 percent had spending high enough to reach the coverage gap.  Fifteen percent of those reaching the coverage gap (four percent overall) had spending high enough to reach the catastrophic coverage level.  Enrollees reaching the coverage gap stayed in the gap for just over four months on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Hoadley |first1=Jack |last2=Hargrave |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Cubanski |first3=Juliette |last4=Neuman |first4=Tricia |date=August 21, 2008 |url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7811.pdf |title=The Medicare Part D Coverage Gap: Costs and Consequences in 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |access-date=December 26, 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215230954/http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7811.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study done in 2007, premiums for plans offering gap coverage are roughly double those of defined standard plans.  The average monthly premium for stand-alone Part D plans (PDPs) with basic benefits that do not offer gap coverage are $30.14. The average monthly premium for plans that do offer some gap coverage is $63.29.  In 2007, eight percent of beneficiaries enrolled in a PDP chose one with some gap coverage.  Among beneficiaries in MA-PD plans, enrollment in plans offering gap coverage was 33 percent (up from 27 percent in 2006).&lt;ref name="The Coverage Gap - 2008"/&gt;

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was passed in 2010, ensured that the coverage gap or, so-called "doughnut hole", would be closing for patients on Medicare Part D. From 2017 to 2020, brand-name drug manufacturers and the federal government will be responsible for providing subsidies to patients in the doughnut hole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrank|first=William H.|last2=Choudhry|first2=Niteesh K.|date=2011-02-17|title=Time to Fill the Doughnuts — Health Care Reform and Medicare Part D|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1011625|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=364|issue=7|pages=598–601|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1011625|issn=0028-4793|pmid=21247308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to close the coverage cap, in 2010, the Affordable Care Act provided a $250 rebate check for individuals whose drug expenses took them into the doughnut hole. The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] began mailing rebate checks in 2010.&lt;ref name="fostersaug" /&gt; Starting in 2011 until 2020, the coinsurance paid for prescriptions while in the coverage gap will decrease at a rate of 7% annually until beneficiaries will pay no more than 25% of the drug cost for their generic and brand name prescription purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://q1medicare.com/PartD-MedicarePartD_DonutHole_Discount.php|title=The Medicare Part D Donut Hole Discount (2011 to 2020)|last=LLC|first=Q1GROUP|website=q1medicare.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a 50% mark down off brand-name medications financed by the manufacturer and a 7% mark down off generic drugs by the government was introduced in 2011 for patients in the doughnut hole. These reductions on generic drug costs will continue to incrementally rise at a rate of 7% until 2019. The following year in 2020, an extra cost reduction will be imposed at 12%, equating to a total of 75% of the generic drug cost covered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, for brand name drugs, the government will provide a subsidy at a rate of 2.5% beginning in 2013 and escalating to 25% in 2020. Thus, by 2020, Medicare Part D patients will only be responsible for paying 25% of the cost of covered generic and brand name prescription medications following payment of their deductible that year. Moreover, once patients enter the catastrophic threshold, they are only responsible for 5% of the drug cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{clear}}

'''Microphone blocker''' is anti-audio hacking device, a hardware accessory for a smartphone,laptop,PDA, or similar device, that is intended to disable the internal microphone, also there is android software ( Anti Spyware) with same name, that disables microphone. Microphone blocker can be called also "mic blocker" or "mic lock". Physically a microphone blocker is a dummy plug that is inserted into the external microphone socket of a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/story/remove-the-mic-from-your-phone/ How to rip the mics out of you macbook and iphone]&lt;/ref&gt; The blocker disables the signal from the internal microphone, by tricking the device into thinking that a external microphone is already plugged in&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/story/remove-the-mic-from-your-phone/ How to rip the mics out of you macbook and iphone]&lt;/ref&gt;.Successful operation of microphone blocker depends on internal scheme of mobile device, that may fully block microphone without possibility of recover or just disregard signal from internal microphone with possibility of recording if needed.

==Background ==
Microphone blocker is cheap, simple for use accessory that is providing protection against [[Eavesdropping]],[[Cellphone surveillance]],[[Audio hacking]].There are variety of available spyware programs that can turn on remotely microphone of mobile device , vast majority of devices does not have internal hardware protection preventing [[eavesdropping]].

Software anti spy tool - microphone protection , that can not fully guarantee that it will disable and block microphone , if device is attacked by one of Top internet security threats - [[spyware]], [[malware]] since attacking programs are constantly changing and improving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">'''Moral diplomacy''' is a form of [[diplomacy]] proposed by [[US President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] in his 1912 election. Moral diplomacy is the system in which support is given only to countries whose moral beliefs are analogous to that of the nation. This promotes the growth of the nation's ideals and damages nations with different ideologies.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Woodrow Wilson's Address at Independence Hall: "The Meaning of Liberty July 4, 1914 Address http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=65381&lt;/ref&gt;
It was used by Woodrow Wilson to support countries with [[democratic governments]] and to economically injure non-democratic countries (seen as possible threats to the U.S.). He also hoped to increase the number of democratic nations, particularly in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice4darfur.org/moral-diplomacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130710200154/http://www.justice4darfur.org/moral-diplomacy.html |archivedate=2013-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

[[Woodrow Wilson]] was of the belief that [[democracy]] is the most essential aspect of a stable and prospering nation. He also believed that the United States had to play the pioneering role in promoting democracy and peace throughout the world. Several nations, especially in Latin-America, were under the influence of [[imperialism]], something that Wilson opposed. In order to curb the growth of imperialism, and spread democracy, Wilson came up with the idea of moral diplomacy.

Wilson's moral diplomacy replaced the [[dollar diplomacy]] of [[William Howard Taft]], which highlighted the importance of economic support to improve bilateral ties between two nations. Taft's dollar diplomacy was based on economic support, while Wilson's moral diplomacy was based on economic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsusd.k12.ca.us/users/scottsh/Wilson%20and%20Moral%20Diplomacy.htm | title=Wilson and Moral Diplomacy | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510233833/http://www.dsusd.k12.ca.us/users/scottsh/Wilson%20and%20Moral%20Diplomacy.htm | archivedate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American exceptionalism===
{{Main|American exceptionalism}}
Many of Woodrow Wilson's ideas about moral diplomacy and America's role in the world come from [[American exceptionalism]]. American exceptionalism is the proposition that the United States is different from other countries in that it has a specific world mission to spread liberty and democracy.
&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Fluck et al (2011). Re-Framing the Transnational Turn in American Studies. UP New England. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this view, America's [[exceptionalism]] stems from its emergence from a revolution and developing a uniquely American ideology, based on liberty, egalitarianism, [[individualism]], [[populism]] and [[laissez-faire]]. This observation can be traced to [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], the first writer to describe the United States as "exceptional" in 1831 and 1840.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville, Alexis. Democracy in America (1840), part 2, page 36: "The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."&lt;/ref&gt;
In Woodrow Wilson's 1914 address on "The Meaning of Liberty" he alludes to Americas potential to be "the light which will shine unto all generations and guide the feet of mankind to the goal of justice and liberty and peace"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and he later puts those ideas into action through moral diplomacy.

==International effects==

Wilson frequently intervened in the affairs of other countries, specifically Latin America, saying in 1913: "I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horgan, Great River: the Rio Grande in North American History (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1984), 913&lt;/ref&gt; These interventions included Mexico in 1914, [[Haiti]] from 1915–1934, [[Dominican Republic]] in 1916, [[Cuba]] in 1917, and [[Panama]] in 1918. The U.S. maintained troops in Nicaragua throughout the Wilson administration and used them to select the president of Nicaragua. American troops in Haiti, under the command of the federal government, forced the Haitian legislature to choose as Haitian president the candidate Wilson selected.
Wilson felt that the US had a duty to spread democracy, and used aggressive moral diplomacy to ensure this objective.

Wilson had international problems, particularly in [[Mexico]]. Mexico had seen a series of [[Mexican Revolution|revolutions]] since 1910. Americans with mining and other interests in Mexico wanted immediate U.S. intervention to protect their property. When [[Victoriano Huerta]] gained control of Mexico in 1913 Wilson refused to recognize him, despite most Americans and many foreign powers supporting him, because he had illegally seized power. Other countries supported Huerta mainly due to his open policies toward foreign investment. 
In April 1914, Mexican officials in Tampico arrested a few American sailors who blundered into a prohibited area, and Wilson used the incident to justify ordering the U.S. Navy to occupy the port city of [[Veracruz]]. The move greatly weakened Huerta's control, and he abandoned power to [[Venustiano Carranza]], whom Wilson immediately recognized as the president of Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19297">This article is about the '''National security of China'''. It includes the coordination of a variety of organizations, including [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], [[military]], [[paramilitary]], [[government]]al, and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] whose aim is to protect China's [[national security]].

== Armed forces overview ==
The [[armed forces]] of China are officially and collectively known as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA). The [[ground forces]] are referred to simply as the PLA, but the [[navy]] is called the [[PLA Navy]] and the [[air force]] is known as the [[PLA Air Force]]. The PLA's independent strategic missile forces are often referred to as the PLA [[Rocket Forces]]. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) [[Central Military Commission]] sets policy for the PLA. The commission, which is chaired by [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] (Party [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]]), has two or three vice chairmen, each a general in the PLA ground forces, and seven members representing various components of the PLA. Operational control is administered dually by the CCP Central Military Commission and the State Central Military Commission and the [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of National Defense]]. PLA headquarters is organized into the [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|General Staff Department]], [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]], [[General Logistics Department]], and [[General Armaments Department]]. In 2005 China announced that it downsized its military by 200,000 troops in order to optimize force structures and increase combat capabilities. The active-duty troop numbers declined to 2.3 million, compared to 3.2 million in 1987. The changes included eliminating layers in the command hierarchy, reducing noncombat units, such as schools and farms, and reprogramming officer duties. The number of ground forces was reduced by the largest margin, while the navy, air force, and Second Artillery Corps were strengthened. An estimated 1.7 million military personnel are in the ground forces, 250,000 in the navy (including 26,000 naval aviation, 10,000 marines, and 28,000 coastal defense forces), an estimated 400,000 to 420,000 in the air force, and 90,000–100,000 in the strategic missile forces. Reservists number an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 and paramilitary forces in the [[People's Armed Police]] an estimated 1.5 million.

The Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China is constitutionally different from the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. According to Article 93 of the state constitution, the state Central Military Commission directs the armed forces of the country and is composed of a chairman, vice chairmen, and members whose terms run concurrently with the [[National People's Congress]]. The commission is responsible to the NPC and its Standing Committee.

== Foreign military relations ==
China sold US$9,000{{citation needed|reason=Unreasonably small figure|date=April 2016}} worth of [[Weapons|arms]] and [[military equipment]] to a variety of nations in 2002, making it the world's fifth largest arms supplier after the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]], and [[France]]. Among its principal clients have been [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Kuwait]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Yemen]]. China also provides military assistance to other countries, such as [[Fiji]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Tonga]], and [[Vanuatu]]. The China North Industries Group Corporation (CNGC, often called [[NORINCO]]), China's main defense producer, has some 100 joint ventures and more than 80 overseas offices and branches in 30 countries and regions involved in [[military technology|military]] and [[dual-use technology]] production and sales. Further, China is also a major arms buyer, mostly naval and air force equipment from Russia. In 2004 China gave unprecedented access to senior foreign military officers at a military demonstration in [[Henan]] Province. Officers from 15 Asian nations and Russia were present. In 2005 China and Russia held joint eight-day "[[Peace Mission 2005]]" military maneuvers near [[Vladisvostok]] and in [[Shandong]] Province and nearby waters. Air, land, and amphibious exercises were held.

China is a member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), a joint effort with Russia, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. The SCO was established as the Shanghai Five when the partners signed agreements on strengthening mutual trust in military fields in border areas in 1996 and on mutual reduction of military forces in border areas in 1997. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and the entry of U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) forces into [[Central Asia]], the SCO was formed and members began to hold joint [[counterterrorism]] military exercises. In 2004 the SCO initiated a regional antiterrorism structure to crack down on various transnational terrorist and criminal activities. China also has held joint naval and counterterrorism exercises with Pakistan. The naval exercise, which occurred in the [[East China Sea]], was the first such drill with a foreign counterpart, as Chinese sources put it, "in a non-traditional security field." The antiterrorism exercise, which was held in [[Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region]], involved border guards from both sides.

== External threat ==
Even while embroiled in the problems of territorial disputes with its neighbors and the dangers of periodic tensions on the [[Korean Peninsula]] and across the [[Taiwan Strait]], China perceives the [[United States]] as its major threat. Beijing believes that the United States still maintains its [[Cold War]] policy toward China and the Asia-Pacific region and stresses ideological differences and their relationship to security issues of concern in the region. In China’s view, Washington’s attitude exacerbates tensions, which, in turn, lead to international turmoil. Post-Soviet Russia is now fairly benign in China’s view, and relations have improved significantly from the days of border conflicts and high-level tension. Concerns about the [[remilitarization of Japan]] also resurface on occasion, often as a legacy of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II enmity]]. [[Transnational crime]], [[terrorism]], [[separatism]], and contradictions among nations all contribute to China’s security concerns.

== Defense budget ==
{{main|Military budget of China}}

Although China claims that the share of [[defense spending]] as a percentage of the overall state budget has declined from 17.4 percent in 1979 to 9.5 percent in 1994 and 7.7 percent in 2004, the government has announced double-digit increases in military spending nearly every year for more than a decade. The defense budget for 2006 is expected to reach US$35.1 billion, the largest increase in four years and 16 percent higher than 2005 (estimated at US$29.5 billion). The report submitted in March 2006 at the Fourth Session of the 10th National People’s Congress (NPC) contained a request for a budget increase to strengthen China’s defensive capability and ability to respond to emergencies and to raise officer and enlisted [[salary|pay levels]]. The NPC stated that China’s military spending is still low compared to the [[Military budget of the United States|United States]], [[Military budget of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Military budget of France|France]], [[Military budget of Germany|Germany]], and [[Military budget of Japan|Japan]]. However, the actual defense budget is likely to be higher than expected because of the inclusion of defense-related items in nondefense budgets.

== Major military units ==
The ground forces are organized into [[PLA Military Regions|seven military regions]] (headquartered in [[Shenyang]] in the northeast, [[Beijing]] in the north, [[Lanzhou]] in the west, [[Chengdu]] in the southwest, [[Guangzhou]] in the south, [[Jinan]] in central China, and [[Nanjing]] in the east), 28 provincial [[military district]]s, four centrally controlled [[garrison]] commands (coinciding with the centrally administered municipalities of [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Chongqing]]), and 21 integrated [[group armies]]. The group armies have strengths between 30,000 and 65,000 troops. Each group army typically has two or three [[infantry]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], one [[armoured warfare|armored]] division or [[brigade]], one [[artillery]] division or brigade, and one joint [[surface-to-air missile]] or [[antiaircraft]] artillery brigade or simply an antiaircraft artillery brigade.

The navy is organized into [[North Sea Fleet|North Sea]] (headquartered at [[Qingdao]], Shandong Province), [[East Sea Fleet|East Sea]] (headquartered at [[Ningbo]], Zhejiang Province), and [[South Sea Fleet|South Sea]] (headquartered at [[Zhanjiang]], Guangdong Province) fleets. Each fleet has [[destroyer]], [[submarine]], and coastal patrol [[flotilla]]s, possibly even [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] flotillas, and [[naval air station]]s. There are numerous major naval bases: the North Sea Fleet has seven, the East Sea Fleet eight, and the South Sea Fleet 16.

The air force has five air corps and 32 air divisions. The major air force headquarters coincide with the seven military regions. The air force has more than 140 air bases and airfields, including ready access to China’s major regional and international airports.

The strategic missile forces, or [[Second Artillery Corps]], are organized into seven missile divisions based in the military regions, with the central headquarters at [[Qinghe Subdistrict, Beijing|Qinghe]], north of Beijing. There also are training and testing bases. The six operational bases had some 21 launch brigades in 2005.

== Major military equipment ==
The major ground forces equipment includes an estimated 7,000 [[main battle tank]]s, 1,200 light tanks, 5,000 [[armored personnel carrier]]s, 14,000 pieces of [[tow]]ed [[artillery]], 1,700 pieces of [[self-propelled artillery]], 2,400 [[multiple rocket launcher]]s, 7,700 [[air defense]] [[gun]]s, 6,500 [[antitank guided weapon]]s, and unspecified numbers of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[surface-to-surface]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s, [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]s, and [[antitank]] guns. The ground forces also have an estimated 321 [[helicopter]]s and an unspecified number of [[unmanned air vehicle]]s and [[surveillance aircraft]].

Among its principal [[combatant ship]]s, the navy has 68 submarines (many of which are slated for decommissioning in the mid-2000s). One is a [[Type 092 submarine|Xia class]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SSBN) force strategic-capability submarine. There are plans for more advanced SSBNs by the end of the decade. The navy also has an estimated 21 [[destroyers]] and 42 [[frigates]], as well as 368 [[fast-attack craft]], 39 [[mine warfare ship]]s, 10 [[hovercraft]], 6 troop transports, 19 landing-ship/tank ships, 37 medium landing ships, 45 utility landing craft, 10 air-cushioned landing craft, 163 support and miscellaneous craft, 8 submarine support ships, 4 salvage and repair ships, 29 supply ships, 1 multirole aviation ship, and about 700 land-based combat aircraft and 45 armed helicopters. China also has plans to launch a 40,000-ton [[aircraft carrier]] by 2010.

The air force has some 1,900 combat aircraft, including armed helicopters. The inventory includes 180 bombers, more than 950 fighters and 838 [[ground attack]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, an estimated 290 [[reconnaissance]]/[[electronic intelligence]] aircraft, an estimated 513 transports, an estimated 170 helicopters, some 200 training aircraft, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Weapons include air-to-air missiles and ground-based air defense artillery using surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft artillery.

The strategic missile forces have in their inventory 20 or more intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), between 130 and 150 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, one Xia class submarine carrying 12 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and about 335 or more short-range ballistic missiles.

== Military service ==
There is selective [[conscription]] of two years for all the services starting at age 18 for males. In 2004 there were some 136,000 women in the [[armed forces]].

== Paramilitary Forces ==
{{main|Paramilitary forces of China}}

The principal [[paramilitary]] organization is the [[People's Armed Police Force]]. There are [[militia]] forces of indeterminate strength under the control of the Chinese Communist Party] (CCP). Once a critical part of Mao Zedong’s "[[people's war]]" strategy, militia units are no longer an essential part of China’s military and have mostly disbanded.

== Military Forces Abroad ==

In 2004 China deployed 95 riot police officers as part of a 125-member unit to [[Haiti]] for the [[United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti|United Nations (UN) Stabilization Mission in Haiti]], a nation with which Beijing does not have [[diplomatic relations]]. As of that time, China had deployed 297 peacekeepers to five other nations, including [[East Timor]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Liberia]], [[Afghanistan]], and the autonomous province of [[Kosovo]] in [[Serbia]]. China also has sent peacekeeping observers to [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], various [[Middle East]]ern countries, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Western Sahara]]. It is a formal participant in the [[UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara]], [[UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[UN Mission in Sierra Leone]], [[UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]], and [[UN Mission in Liberia]].

== Police and Internal Security==
The security apparatus is made up of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] and the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]], the [[People's Armed Police]], the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), and the state [[Judicial system of China|judicial]], [[Supreme People's Procuratorate|procuratorial]], and [[Penal system in China|penal system]]s. The Ministry of Public Security oversees all domestic [[police]] activity in China, including the People’s Armed Police Force. The ministry is responsible for police operations and prisons and has dedicated departments for internal political, [[economic security|economic]], and [[communications security]]. Its lowest organizational units are public security stations, which maintain close day-to-day contact with the public. The People’s Armed Police Force, which sustains an estimated total strength of 1.5 million personnel, is organized into 45 divisions: [[internal security]] police, [[border defense]] personnel, guards for government buildings and embassies, and police communications specialists.

The Ministry of State Security was established in 1983 to ensure “the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China’s socialist system.” The ministry is guided by a series of laws enacted in 1993, 1994, and 1997 that replaced the “counterrevolutionary” crime statutes. The ministry’s operations include intelligence collection, both domestic and foreign.

China has developed an efficient, well-funded internal security apparatus which is tasked with stability maintenance, or “weiwen”. &lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Well-Oiled Security Apparatus in China Stifles Calls for Change |author=Andrew Jacobs |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2=Jonathan Ansfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/world/asia/01china.html?ref=todayspaper |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by [[Tsinghua University]], based on published police budgets, $77 billion, (514 billion yuan) was appropriated for internal security in 2009, a budget item which is rapidly increasing.&lt;ref name = "Tsinghua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinaelectionsblog.net/?p=5220 |title=New thinking on stability maintenance|first= |last= |author=Social Development Research Group, Tsinghua University Department of Sociology |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= April 2010  |work= |publisher=Tsinghua University |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language=English|trans-title=long-term social stability via institutionalised expression of interests  |format=translation |doi= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wuW5KBHz |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |quote=According to statistics, this year’s budget for internal security has reached 514 billion yuan.

== Internal Threat and Terrorism==
{{main|Terrorism in China}}

Muslim separatists in [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region present China with its most significant terrorist threat, which emerged in the late 1980s. In 2003 Beijing published an “East Turkistan Terrorist List,” which labeled organizations such as the World Uighur Youth Congress and the East Turkistan Information Center as terrorist entities. These groups openly advocate independence for “East Turkestan,” and, although they have not been publicly linked to violent activity, the separatists have resorted to violence, bomb attacks, assassinations, and street fighting, which Beijing responds to with police and military action.

During the summer of 2004, elite troops from China and Pakistan held joint antiterrorism exercises in Xinjiang that were aimed at the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, an organization listed as terrorist by China, the United States, and the United Nations (UN). This and other Uygur separatist groups were trained in Afghanistan to fight with the [[Taliban]] and [[al Qaeda]]. The [[East Turkistan Islamic Movement]] was established in 1990 and has links to the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]], which operates throughout [[Central Asia]]. Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] joined leaders of other Asian and European nations in Hanoi for the October 2004 [[Asia-Europe Meeting]] (ASEM) in [[Hanoi]], where the delegates reaffirmed their call for a [[War on Terrorism]] led by the UN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">'''Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions''' is one of six [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research institutes at [[Duke University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.duke.edu/interdisciplinary/about/&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Founded in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theredddesk.org/resources/organisations/nicholas_institute_for_environmental_policy_solutions&lt;/ref&gt; it became the first environmental-policy-centered Institute with a Duke University affiliation.

The Nicholas Institute was established in 2005. In its first decade, it has led a variety of influential projects. The Nicholas Institute advised California on several aspects of the design of the country’s first economy-wide cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases. The Nicholas Institute brought attention to one of the world’s most critical environmental problems by providing the first estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions from the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems. Through the seminal report, ''A Silent Tsunami'', the Nicholas Institute provided a material contribution to legislation aimed at dramatically improving access to clean water and sanitation around the world. And the Nicholas Institute helped natural resource managers connect their decisions to things people care about with the first guidebook to present a scientifically defensible approach to ecosystem services assessment.

Tim Profeta is founding director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111209/solver1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nctechnews.com/2011/05/18/environmental-green-tech/nicholas-institute-expands-board-of-advisors/5078/&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute’s other program directors include Brian Murray, Jonas Monast, Amy Pickle, John Virdin, Martin Doyle, and Lydia Olander.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9689">{{United States constitutional law}}
The '''No Religious Test Clause''' of the [[United States Constitution]] is a [[Dependent clause|clause]] within [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], Clause 3. By its plain terms, no federal officeholder or employee can be required to adhere to or accept any particular [[religion]] or [[doctrine]] as a prerequisite to holding a federal office or a [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] job. It immediately follows a [[Independent clause|clause]] requiring all federal and [[U.S. state|state]] officers to take an  [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] to support the Constitution. This clause contains the only explicit reference to religion in the original seven articles of the U.S. Constitution.

The ban on religious tests contained in this clause protects only federal officeholders and employees. It does not apply to the states, many of which imposed religious tests at the time of the nation's founding. State tests limited public offices to Christians or, in some states, only to Protestants. The national government, on the other hand, could not impose any religious test whatsoever. National offices would be open to everyone. No federal official has ever been subjected to a formal religious test for holding office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Bradley |first= Gerard V. |title= Essays on Article VI: Religious Test | work= The Heritage Guide to The Constitution |url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/6/essays/135/religious-test |publisher= [[The Heritage Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This clause is cited by advocates of [[separation of church and state]] as an example of the "[[originalism|original intent]]" of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers of the Constitution]] to avoid any entanglement between church and state, or involving the [[government]] in any way as a determiner of religious beliefs or practices.  This is significant because this clause represents the words of the original Framers, even prior to the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

==Text==
{{quote|...; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.}}

==Background==
{{See also|Test Act}}
A variety of [[Test Act]]s were instituted in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. Their main purpose was to exclude anyone not a member of the [[Church of England]]—the official [[state religion]]—from holding government office, notably [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]s and [[English Dissenters|"nonconforming" Protestants]].  Government officials were required to swear oaths, such as the [[Oath of Supremacy]], that the [[monarch of England]] was the head of the Church and that they possessed no other foreign loyalties, such as to the [[Pope]]. Later acts required officials to disavow [[transubstantiation]] and the [[veneration]] of saints. Such laws were common throughout Europe, where numerous countries had a state religion.

{{cns|date=June 2018|text=Many colonists of the [[Colonial history of the United States|Thirteen Colonies]] had left England in part to gain a measure of religious freedom.}}  With the royal government's religious favoritism fresh in their memory, the Founders sought to prevent the return of the Test Acts by adding this clause to the Constitution. Specifically, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], delegate from South Carolina where a Protestant denomination was the established state religion, introduced the clause to Article VI and it passed with little opposition.&lt;ref&gt;''Drawn from original source'': {{cite book|url=http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/rel_liberty/history/overview.aspx|chapter=overview: history of religious liberty in America|author=Charles C.

==Forced oaths==
The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision broadly, saying that ''any'' required oath to serve anything other than the Constitution is invalid.  In the case of ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', the Court overturned a loyalty oath that the government had tried to apply to pardoned Confederate officials.  As the officials had already received full presidential pardons (negating an argument based on their potential status as criminals), the Court ruled that forcing officials and judges to swear loyalty oaths was unconstitutional.

Earlier in [[U.S. history]], the doctrine of [[states' rights]] allowed individual states complete discretion regarding the inclusion of a religious test in their [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]]. Such religious tests have in recent decades been deemed to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] by the extension of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] provisions to the states (via the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]).

Eight states do include language in their constitutions either requiring state officeholders to have particular religious beliefs or specifically protecting those who do:
#[[Arkansas]] (Article 19 Section 1)
#[[Maryland]] (Declaration of Rights, Article 37)
#[[Mississippi]] (Article 14, Section 265)
#[[North Carolina]] (Article 6 Section 8)
#[[Pennsylvania]] (Article 1 Section 4)&lt;br&gt;Specifically protects officeholders with religious belief but is silent on whether those without such beliefs are also protected.&lt;ref name=StateConst&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm |title=Religious discrimination in state constitutions |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required beliefs include belief in a Supreme Being, and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments.
#[[South Carolina]] (Article 17 Section 4)
#[[Tennessee]] (Article 9 Section 2)
#[[Texas]] (Article 1 Section 4)

Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words "so help me God". In some cases, these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required also of [[jury|jurors]], witnesses in court, [[Notary public|notaries public]], and state employees. In the 1961 case ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that such language in state constitutions was in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the [[United States Constitution]]. Citing the Supreme Court's interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]] in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' and linking this to ''Torcaso v. Watkins'' Justice [[Hugo Black]] stated for the Court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person "to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion." Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court however did not rule on the applicability of Article VI, stating that "Because we are reversing the judgment on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to consider appellant's contention that this provision applies to state as well as federal offices."

In the 1997 case of ''[[Silverman v. Campbell]]''&lt;ref&gt;486 SE.2d 1, 326 S.C. 208 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] ruled that the state constitution requiring an oath to God for employment in the public sector violated Article VI of the federal constitution, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore could not be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/silverman.htm |title=Coverage of the Inevitable Apocalypso |publisher=Positiveatheism.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other seven states still have similar provisions in their constitutions, but they are not enforced in modern times because it is taken for granted they would be held to be unconstitutional if challenged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">'''''Pinko''''' is a pejorative coined in 1925 in the United States to describe a person regarded as being sympathetic to [[communism]], though not necessarily a [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] member. It has since come to be used to describe anyone perceived to have leftist or socialist sympathies.

The term has its origins in the notion that ''pink'' is a lighter shade of ''red,'' a color associated with communism. Thus ''pink'' could describe a "lighter form of communism," purportedly promoted by supporters of [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] who were not themselves actual or [[Card-carrying Communist|"card carrying" communists]]. The term pinko has a pejorative sense, whereas 'pink' in this definition can be used in a purely descriptive sense, such as in the term [[pink tide]].

==History==

===Politics===
One of the first recorded uses of ''pinko'' was in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1925 as a variant on the noun and adjective ''pink'', which had been used along with ''parlor pink'' since the beginning of the 20th century to refer to those of leftish sympathies, usually with an implication of effeteness.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Firebaugh, "The Vocabulary of 'Time' Magazine", ''American Speech'', 15, 3, October 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, for example, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial described supporters of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] politician [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.|Robert La Follette]] as “visionaries, ne’er do wells, parlor pinks, reds, [[hyphenated Americans|hyphenates]] [Americans with divided allegiance], soft handed agriculturalists and working men who have never seen a shovel.”&lt;ref&gt;"Mirrors of Washington", ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 26, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pinko'' was widely used during the [[Cold War]] to label individuals accused of supporting the [[Soviet Union]], including many supporters of former vice president [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 U.S. presidential campaign]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. Many unscrupulous politicians, like Richard Nixon, exploited the fear of communism by referring to their opponents as "pinkos". The word was predominantly used in the United States, where opposition to Communism grew strong among the population, especially during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]. It was also in common use in [[South Africa]] during the [[apartheid]] era. In his two presidential campaigns, [[Alabama]] governor [[George Wallace]] often railed at what he called "the left-wing pinko press" and "pseudo-pinko-intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;"Wallace Campaign Aims at McCarthy Elements", ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 23, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Wallace Challenge -- and Opportunity", ''The Wall Street Journal'', March 13, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most infamous uses of the term ''pink'' came during future president [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1950 Senate campaign against [[Helen Gahagan|Helen Gahagan Douglas]]: "She's pink right down to her underwear!" — a play on the fact that, at the time, pink was the usual color of women's undergarments. Nixon regularly referred to her as "the Pink Lady", and his campaign distributed political flyers printed on sheets of pink paper.

One of the most famous uses of the term in popular culture was the ironic use by singer [[Charlie Daniels]] in his breakthrough 1972 hit "[[Uneasy Rider]]."  The dope-running hippie narrator is stuck with a flat tire in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Attempting to avoid a beatdown by the locals, he attempts to deflect attention to one of the locals by accusing him of being "a friend of them long haired, hippie-type, pinko fags" sent by the FBI to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Archie Bunker]], the patriarch of the Bunker family in the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'', often derisively used the term 'pinko' when referring to his liberal son-in-law [[Michael Stivic|Michael "Meathead" Stivic]] or Michael's friends.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the sitcom ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' the recurring character Colonel Flagg often uses the term pinko and other comments to question the patriotism of the doctors when they do not help him in his undercover operations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Tabloid-TV talk show host [[Morton Downey Jr.]] was famous for using the term to berate nearly anyone who disagreed with him.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the musical ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', Velma von Tussle calls heroine Tracy Turnblad a pinko during the song “Velma’s Revenge,” because Tracy dreams of integrating television.

American television show ''[[Frasier]]'' ([[List of Frasier episodes#Season 7 (1999–2000)|Season 7, Episode 10, Series 154, "Back Talk"]] ) makes reference to the word Pinko. Reading a vintage newspaper from the day of his birth given to him by his father [[Martin Crane]] as a birthday gift, [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] reads the headline aloud, "Suspected Pinko ousted from Crossing Guard Post." Frasier then responds sarcastically, "What a jolly world I was born into." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kacl780.net/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_10/back_talk_1.html|title=Back Talk 1 — Frasier Transcripts Season 7 Episode 10 — The Frasier Archives|website=www.kacl780.net|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 video game [[Postal 2]] has the protagonist, The Postal Dude, attempting to get signatures for a petition. Occasionally, residents will respond with the jeer "No way, you freaking pinko!" when refusing to sign.

The political abuse of the power entrusted to physicians, and particularly psychiatrists, has a long and abundant history, for example during the Nazi era and the Soviet rule when political dissenters were labeled as "mentally ill" and subjected to inhumane "treatments".&lt;ref name=Shah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Ruchita|last2=Basu|first2=Debasish|title=Coercion in psychiatric care: Global and Indian perspective|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=July–September 2010|volume=52|issue=3|pages=203–206|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.70971|pmid=21180403|pmc=2990818}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be systematic in the [[Soviet Union]], and occasional in other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in psychiatric hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.&lt;ref name="Declan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Declan|first1=Lyons|last2=Art|first2=O'Malley|title=The labelling of dissent&amp;nbsp;— politics and psychiatry behind the Great Wall|journal=The Psychiatrist|year=2002|pages=443–444|doi=10.1192/pb.26.12.443|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/26/12/443.full|volume=26|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="van Voren 2010"/&gt; Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]" in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes.&lt;ref name="Katona"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katona|first1=Cornelius|last2=Robertson|first2=Mary|title=Psychiatry at a glance|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2404-0|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSJRHpAtqPUC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}}

== By country==

=== Canada ===

The [[Duplessis Orphans]] were several thousand orphaned children that were falsely certified as mentally ill by the government of the province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and confined to psychiatric institutions.

[[Donald Ewen Cameron]]'s operation was running from what is today known as the [[Allen Memorial Institute]] (AMI), part of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]], and not to be confused with the non-governmental organization based in Montreal, AMI-Québec Agir contre la maladie mentale.

=== China ===

In 2002, [[Human Rights Watch]] published the book ''Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and its Origins in the Mao Era'' written by [[Robin Munro]] and based on the documents obtained by him.&lt;ref name="Munro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro|first=Robin|title=Dangerous minds: political psychiatry in China today and its origins in the Mao era|year=2002|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=1-56432-278-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ek8BtI3moPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover}} (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro HTML"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro|first=Robin|title=Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and its Origins in the Mao Era|year=2002|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=1-56432-278-5|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3deb868a1.html}} (HTML)&lt;/ref&gt; The British researcher Robin Munro, a sinologist who was writing his dissertation in London after a long sojourn in China, had traveled to China several times to survey libraries in provincial towns and had gathered a large amount of literature which bore the stamp 'secret' but at the same time was openly available.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Voren|first=Robert|title=On Dissidents and Madness: From the Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev to the "Soviet Union" of Vladimir Putin|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam—New York|isbn=978-90-420-2585-1|pages=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyDIKu8XsgcC&amp;pg=PA242}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|242}} This literature included even historical analyses going back to the days of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and concerned articles and reports on the number of people who were taken to mental hospitals because they complained of a series of issues.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|242}} It was found, according to Munro, that the involuntary confinement of religious groups, political dissidents, and whistleblowers had a lengthy history in China.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=M|title=Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and Its Origin in the Mao Era|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=October 2003|volume=54|pages=1418–1419|url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/54/10/1418-a|accessdate=10 December 2010|issue=10|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.54.10.1418-a}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse had begun in the 1950s and 1960s, and had grown extremely throughout the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|242}} During the period of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, it achieved its apogee, then under the reign of [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Gang of Four]], which established a very repressive and harsh regime.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt; No deviance or opposition in thought or in practice was tolerated.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;

The documents told of a massive abuse of psychiatry for political purposes during the leadership of Mao Zedong, during which millions of people had been declared mentally sick.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|242}} In the 1980s, according to the official documents, there was political connotation to fifteen percent of all forensic psychiatric cases.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|242}} In the early 1990s, the numbers had dropped to five percent, but with beginning of the campaign against [[Falun Gong]], the percentage had again increased quite rapidly.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|242}}

Chinese official psychiatric literature testifies distinctly that the Communist Party's notion of 'political dangerousness' was long since institutionally engrafted in the diagnostic armory of China's psychiatry and included in the main concept of psychiatric dangerousness.&lt;ref name="Munro"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Despite international criticism, the People's Republic of China seems to be continuing its political abuse of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2010"/&gt; Political abuse of psychiatry in the People's Republic of China is high on the agenda and has produced recurring disputes in the international psychiatric community.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2010"/&gt; The abuses there appear to be even more widespread than in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and involve the incarceration of 'petitioners', human rights workers, trade union activists, followers of the Falun Gong movement, and people complaining against injustices by local authorities.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2010"/&gt;

It also seemed that, China had hardly known high security forensic institutions until 1989.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} However, since then, the Chinese authorities have constructed the entire network of special forensic mental hospitals called ''[[Ankang (asylum)|Ankang]]'' which in Chinese is for 'Peace and Health'.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} By that time, China had had 20 Ankang institutions with the staff employed by the Ministry of State Security.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} The psychiatrists who worked there were wearing uniforms under their white coats.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}}

The political abuse of psychiatry in China seems to take place only in the institutions under the authority of the police and the Ministry of State Security but not in those belonging to other governmental sectors.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} Psychiatric care in China falls into four sectors that hardly connect up with each other.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} These are Ankang institutions of the Ministry of State Security; those belonging to the police; those that fall under the authority of the Ministry of Social Affairs; those belonging to the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} Both the sectors belonging to the police and the Ministry of State Security are the closed sectors, and, consequently, information hardly ever leaks out.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} In the hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health, psychiatrists do not contact with the Ankang institutions and, actually, had no idea of what occurred there, and could, thereby, sincerely state that they were not informed of political abuse of psychiatry in China.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}}

In China, the structure of forensic psychiatry was to a great extent identical to that in the USSR.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} On its own, it is not so strange, since psychiatrists of the [[Moscow Serbsky Institute]] visited [[Beijing]] in 1957 to help their Chinese 'brethren', the same psychiatrists who promoted the system of political abuse of psychiatry in their own USSR.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|243}} As a consequence, diagnostics were not much different than in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|244}} The only difference was that the Soviets preferred '[[sluggish schizophrenia]]' as a diagnosis, and the Chinese generally cleaved to the diagnosis '[[paranoia]]' or '[[paranoid schizophrenia]]'.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|244}} However, the results were the same: long hospitalization in a mental hospital, involuntary treatment with [[neuroleptics]], torture, abuse, all aimed at breaking the victim's will.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|244}}

In accordance with Chinese law that contains the concept of "political harm to society" as legally dangerous mentally ill behavior, police take into mental hospitals "political maniacs", defined as persons who write reactionary letters, make anti-government speeches, or "express opinions on important domestic and international affairs".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Contortions of Psychiatry in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/opinion/contortions-of-psychiatry-in-china.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists are frequently caught involved in such cases, unable and unwilling to challenge the police, according to psychiatry professor at the [[Peking University]] Yu Xin.&lt;ref name=Demick&gt;{{cite news|last=Demick|first=Barbara|title=China poised to limit use of mental hospitals to curb dissent|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-psychiatric-20120317,0,1464909,print.story|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Liu's database suggests, today's most frequent victims of psychiatric abuse are political dissidents, petitioners, and Falun Gong members.&lt;ref name="LaFraniere"&gt;{{cite news|last1=LaFraniere|first1=Sharon|last2=Levin|first2=Dan|title=Assertive Chinese Held in Mental Wards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/world/asia/12psych.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the 2000s, Human Rights Watch accused China of locking up Falun Gong members and dissidents in a number of Chinese mental hospitals managed by the Public Security Bureau.&lt;ref name="LaFraniere"/&gt; Access to the hospitals was requested by the [[World Psychiatric Association]] (WPA), but denied by China, and the controversy subsided.&lt;ref name="LaFraniere"/&gt;

The WPA attempted to confine the problem by presenting it as Falung Gong issue and, at the same time, make the impression that the members of the movement were likely not mentally sound, that it was a sect which likely brainwashed its members, etc.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|245}} There was even a diagnosis of 'qigong syndrome' which was used reflecting on the exercises practiced by Falung Gong.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|245}} It was the unfair game aiming to avoid the political abuse of psychiatry from dominating the WPA agenda.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|245}}

=== Cuba ===
{{see also|Political abuse of psychiatry in Cuba}}
Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after the dictator [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the political abuse of psychiatry in this country emerged before the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|74}} [[Americas Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] published reports alluding to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in [[Havana]].&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} In 1977, a report on alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba presenting cases of ill-treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the United States.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} It presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana where they undergo ill-treatment including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] without  [[muscle relaxants]] or [[anaesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner&amp;nbsp;— in some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}}

In August 1981, the Marxist historian Ariel Hidalgo was apprehended and accused of 'incitement against the social order, international solidarity and the Socialist State' and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|75}} In September 1981, he was transported from State Security Headquarters to the Carbó-Serviá (forensic) ward of Havana Psychiatric Hospital where he stayed for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

=== India ===
It was reported in June, 2012, that the [[Indian Government]] has approached [[NIMHANS]], a well known mental health establishment in [[South India]], to assist in suppressing anti-nuclear protests regards to building of the [[Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant]]. The government was in talks with NIMHANS representatives to chalk up a plan to dispatch psychiatrists to [[Kudankulam]], for counselling protesters opposed to the building of the plant. To fulfill this, [[NIMHANS]] developed a team of 6 members, all of them, from the Department of Social Psychiatry. The psychiatrists were sent to get a "peek into the protesters' minds" and help them learn the importance of the plant according to one news source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/article525233.ece|title=Centre to deal anti-nuke mind-set with NIMHANS|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=2 June 2012|author=Veena Joshi Datta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsOthers/No-margin-for-error/Article1-865997.aspx|title=No margin for error|work=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107075059/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsOthers/No-margin-for-error/Article1-865997.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2014|deadurl=yes|author=Praful Bidwai|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=238299|title=Demonising anti-nuclear protests|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=The Daily Star|author=Praful Bidwai|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article546418.ece|title=Koodankulam counselling for protestors flayed|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=15 June 2015|author=Veena Joshi Datta|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/article546439.ece|title=Plan to counsel anti-nuclear protesters draws flak|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=15 June 2015|author=Veena Joshi Datta|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japanese psychiatric hospitals during the country's imperial era reported an abnormally large number of patient deaths, peaking in 1945 after the surrender of Japan to Allied forces.&lt;ref name="Totsuka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Totsuka|first=Etsuro|title=The history of Japanese psychiatry and the rights of mental patients|journal=The Psychiatrist|year=1990|volume=14|issue=4|pages=193–200|pmid=|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/14/4/193.full.pdf|accessdate=19 March 2012|doi=10.1192/pb.14.4.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients of these institutions were mistreated mainly because they were considered a hindrance to society. Under the Imperial Japanese government, citizens were expected to contribute in one way or another to the war effort, and the mentally ill were unable to do so, and as such were looked down upon and abused. The main cause of death for these patients was starvation, as caretakers did not supply the patients with adequate food, likely as a form of torture and a method of sedation.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} Because mentally ill patients were kept secluded from the outside world, the large number of deaths went unnoticed by the general public. After the end of Allied occupation, the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet of Japan]] passed the {{nihongo|Mental Hygiene Act|精神衛生法,|Seishin Eisei Hō}} in 1950, which improved the status of the mentally ill and prohibited the domestic containment of mental patients in medical institutions. However, the Mental Hygiene Act had unforeseen consequences. Along with many other reforms, the law prevented the mentally ill from being charged with any sort of crime in Japanese courts. Anyone who was found to be mentally unstable by a qualified psychiatrist was required to be hospitalized rather than incarcerated, regardless of the severity of any crime that person may have committed. The Ministry of Justice tried several times to amend the law, but was met with opposition from those who believed the legal system should not interfere with medical science.&lt;ref name="Totsuka"/&gt; After almost four decades, the {{nihongo|Mental Health Act|精神保健法,|Seishin Hoken Hō}} was finally passed in 1987. The new law corrected the flaws of the Mental Hygiene Act by allowing the Ministry of Health and Welfare to set regulations on the treatment of mental patients in both medical and legal settings. With the new law, the mentally ill have the right to voluntary hospitalization, the ability to be charged with a crime, and right to use the insanity defense in court, and the right to pursue legal action in the event of abuse or negligence on the part of medical professionals.

=== Norway ===
There have been a few accusations about abuse of psychiatry in Norway.  See [[Arnold Juklerød]] and [[Knut Hamsun]].

=== Romania ===
In Romania, there have been allegations of some particular cases of psychiatric abuse during over a decade.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|73}} In addition to particular cases, there is evidence that mental hospitals were utilized as short-term detainment centers.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|73}} For instance, before the 1982 [[Universiade|International University Sports 'Olympiad']], over 600 dissidents were detained and kept out of public view in mental hospitals.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|73}} Like in the [[Soviet Union]], on the eve of Communist holidays, potential "troublemakers" were sent to mental hospitals by busloads and discharged when the holidays had passed.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2010"/&gt;

=== Soviet Union ===
{{main|Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
In 1971 detailed reports about the inmates of Soviet psychiatric hospitals who had been detained for political reasons began to reach the West.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2015/09/22/18-1-political-prisoners-in-psychiatric-hospitals-a-survey-of-documents/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' 18.1, 5 March 1971, "Political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals".]&lt;/ref&gt; These showed that the periodic use of incarceration in psychiatric institutions during the 1960s (see the biography of [[Vladimir Bukovsky]]) had started to become a systematic way of dealing with dissent, political or religious.&lt;ref name="Bonnie"/&gt;

In March 1971 Vladimir Bukovsky sent detailed diagnoses of six individuals ([[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] among them) to psychiatrists in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/56-65-khts-1980-1982-r/1971-e-nos-18-22/commentary-19/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' 19, 30 April 1971, Commentary No 19, Notes on "The Arrest of Vladimir Bukovsky".]&lt;/ref&gt; They responded &lt;ref&gt;[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/22-3-materials-concerning-the-forthcoming-international-congress-of-psychiatrists/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' 22.3, 10 December 1971, "Materials for the forthcoming international Congress of Psychiatrists".]&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next 13 years activists inside the USSR and support groups in Britain, Europe and North America conducted a sustained campaign to expose psychiatric abuses.&lt;ref&gt;See Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway, ''Russia's political hospitals'', London, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 the [[World Psychiatric Association]] (WPA) condemned the USSR for this practice. Six years later, the Soviet All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists seceded from the WPA rather than face almost certain expulsion.&lt;ref name="Bonnie"/&gt;

During this period reports of continuous repression multiplied, but Soviet psychiatric officials refused to allow international bodies to see the hospitals and patients in question. They denied the charges of abuse.&lt;ref name="Bonnie"/&gt; In February 1989, however, at the height of [[perestroika]] and over the opposition of the psychiatric establishment, the Soviet government permitted a delegation of psychiatrists from the United States, representing the U.S. government, to carry out extensive interviews of suspected victims of abuse.&lt;ref name="Bonnie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

The delegation was able systematically to interview and assess present and past involuntarily admitted mental patients chosen by the visiting team, as well as to talk over procedures and methods of treatment with some of the patients, their friends, relatives and, sometimes, their treating psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|69}} The delegation originally sought interviews with 48 persons, but saw only 15 hospitalized and 12 discharged patients.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|69}} About half of the hospitalized patients were released in the two months between the submission of the initial list of names to the Soviet authorities and the departure from the Soviet Union of the US delegation.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|69}} The delegation concluded that nine of the 15 hospitalized patients had disorders which would be classified in the United States as serious psychoses, diagnoses corresponding broadly with those used by the Soviet psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|69}} One of the hospitalized patients had been diagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]] although the US team saw no evidence of mental disorder.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Among the 12 discharged patients examined, the US delegation found that nine had no evidence of any current or past mental disorder; the remaining three had comparatively slight symptoms which would not usually warrant involuntary commitment in Western countries.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|70}} According to medical records, all these patients had diagnoses of psychopathology or schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

Returning home after a visit of more than two weeks, the delegation members wrote a report which was highly damaging to the Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|125}} The delegation established that there had been systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the past and that it had not yet come to an end. Victims continued to be held in mental hospitals, while the Soviet authorities and the Soviet Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists in particular still denied that psychiatry had been employed as a method of repression.&lt;ref name="van Voren 2009"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

The American report and other pressures, domestic and external, led the [[Politburo]] to pass a resolution (15 November 1989) "On improvements in Soviet law concerning procedures for the treatment of psychiatric patients".&lt;ref&gt;

* According to journalist [[Jonathan Turley]] and [[Newsweek magazine|''Newsweek'' magazine]], in June 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Richard M. Berman]] ordered conservative film maker and activist [[Dinesh D'Souza]] to continue psychological counseling for a four-year period despite numerous recommendations to the contrary by well-respected private and court appointed mental health personnel. D'Souza pleaded guilty to a single count of making illegal contributions in the name of others as part of the campaign of Wendy Long for New York Senate. This occurred during a post-confinenment hearing. D'Souza was seeking to reduce the four-year community service sentence by reference to his home confinement period. Berman balked and said that he said the two periods as distinct—a position that courts would likely take in similar cases.  In referring to the psychological counseling aspect, D'Souza's counsel submitted evidence that the court-ordered psychiatrist found no indication of depression or reason for medication. His own retained psychologist also provided a written statement concluding there was no need to continue the consultation. However, Judge Berman disagreed and said that he thought more counseling will help while noting that this is not punishment: "I only insisted on psychological counseling as part of Mr. D'Souza's sentence because I wanted to be helpful. I am requiring Mr. D'Souza to see a new psychological counselor and to continue the weekly psychological consultation not as part of his punishment or to be retributive." The court insisted "I'm not singling out Mr. D'Souza to pick on him. A requirement for psychological counseling often comes up in my hearings in cases where I find it hard to understand why someone did what they did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Turley, Jonathan|title=Federal Judge Orders Dinesh D'Souza To Continue Psychological Counseling Despite Contrary Expert Recommendation|url=http://jonathanturley.org/2015/07/15/federal-judge-orders-dinesh-dsouza-to-continue-psychological-counseling-despite-contrary-recommendations-from-experts/|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walker, Lauren|title=Judge Orders Anti-Obama Filmmaker D'Souza Receive Psychological Counseling|journal=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/judge-orders-dsouza-receive-psychological-counseling-353554|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''potable water diver''' works in a [[potable]] [[water tank]] performing inspection and cleaning tasks.{{citation needed|reason=Is there an occupation, registration or qualification formally titled "potable water diver"|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Harveysburg Water tower.jpg|thumb|right|Inspection of the interior of a municipal [[water tower]] requires specialized training and safety equipment.]]

Divers can inspect water storage tanks, towers and clearwells without draining them or taking them out of service. The work is classified as commercial diving and diver qualifications, equipment and dive team composition will generally be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Perrin, ''Inspecting &amp; Cleaning Potable Water Storage'' Xlibris Corporation, {{ISBN|1477160760}}, page 112{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Water Works Association]] (AWWA) publishes a [[technical standard]], C652, that outlines recommendations for divers in potable water facilities.&lt;ref&gt;American Water Works Association, ''Disinfection of Water-Storage Facilities'', ANSI/AWWA C652-11, section 4.4.5&lt;/ref&gt; The diver is totally encapsulated (no part of the diver's body touches the water) in a drysuit and helmet, and then washed down with a 200 [[parts per million|ppm]] [[chlorine]] solution prior to entry into the tank. All diving dress is to be used exclusively in drinking water. This meets AWWA standards for entering a public water system.  The diver is able to move about the tank to perform inspections or clean the tank. AWWA recommends removing sediment accumulations over {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} deep from the floor of a drinking water tank because it can harbor bacteria and/or other contaminants which could adversely affect water quality. Using a specially equipped pump or [[airlift pump|airlift system]] the diver can remove loose sediment without damaging painted surfaces.  This allows the chlorine in the system to function more effectively. Divers are an effective means to clean and inspect potable water storage tanks because all of the maintenance can be done while the tank remains in-service and full of water, though it may be necessary to close all inlet and outlet valves during the operation as they may present an unacceptable pressure difference hazard, and most of the interior surfaces of the tank can be easily accessed.

Diving in a tank presents hazards, particularly in all water towers (EST) and ground tanks (GST) above {{convert|100000|USgal|liter}}. Divers require [[confined space|confined-space training]] and working at heights certification. In the USA commercial diving operations require at least one trained tender, a diver, and a supervisor. Surface-supplied air with two-way voice communications with the diver and a safety rope are preferred. The [[Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration]] regulation 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T allows scuba with a rope for basic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&amp;p_id=4995 |title=CPL 02-00-151 - 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T – Commercial Diving Operations |date=13 June 2011 |publisher=[[US Department of Labor]] |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diver should wear a harness, connected to a safety rope, so that in case of an emergency the dive tender can pull the diver up. Diving contractors always need to check the safety legislation appropriate to their local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Tank Maintenance, Field Technician&lt;/ref&gt;

It was signed on 20 July 1933 by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], who later became [[Pope]] Pius XII, on behalf of Pope [[Pius XI]] and Vice Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] on behalf of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date onward. The treaty guarantees the rights of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Germany]]. When bishops take office Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the [[Reich|German Reich]] established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical of Pope [[Pius XI]]. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;Coppa, Frank J. Editor Controversial Concordats, 1999, p. 143, {{ISBN|0-8132-0920-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reichskonkordat'' is the most controversial of several concordats that the Vatican negotiated during the pontificate of Pius XI. It is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the [[Holocaust]]. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime soon after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had acquired quasi-[[dictator]]ial powers through the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party. Rome became the first legal partner to Hitler's regime.

The treaty places constraints on the political activity of German clergy of the Catholic Church. Following the passage of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] for example, a policy of nonintervention was followed. The majority of the German church hierarchy regarded the treaty as a symbol of peace between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Griech-Polelle,  Bishop von Galen,  Roman Catholicism and Nazi Germany. p. 51, 53&lt;/ref&gt; From a Roman Catholic church perspective it has been argued that the Concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 2008, pp 245-246. Shirer,1990, pp 234-5, Hamm, 1997,p. 136, Gill, 1994, p.57, Kershaw, 2008, p. 332, Paul Oshea; A Cross Too Heavy, Rosenberg Publishing, p. 234-5 {{ISBN|978-1-877058-71-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some German bishops were unenthusiastic, and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of [[World War II]] felt it inappropriate, Pope Pius XII successfully argued to keep the concordat in force. It is still in force today.

{{See also|Germany–Holy See relations|Apostolic Nuncio to Germany}}

The 'Reichskonkordat' between Germany and the [[Holy See]] was signed on July 20, 1933 and ratified in September of that year. The treaty was an extension of existing [[concordat]]s already signed with Prussia and Bavaria&lt;ref name="Peter Hebblethwaite p.118" /&gt; Concordats have been used to create binding agreements to safeguard church interests and its freedom to act, particularly in countries that do not have strong jurisprudence guaranteeing government non-interference in religious matters or where the church seeks a privileged position under government patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxpU0ex09JEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Reichskonkordat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbqPjc4J_dAhXDJt8KHV8WDKwQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Reichskonkordat&amp;f=false|title=Pope and Devil: The Vatican's Archives and the Third Reich|last=Wolf|first=Hubert|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674050815|location=|pages=81-223|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Kulturkampf''
{{Main|Kulturkampf}}
[[File:Otto Fürst von Bismarck.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Otto von Bismarck]] became [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor of Germany]] in 1871 and launched the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' Culture Struggle against the [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic Church in Germany]].]]

Accounts of 20th-century diplomatic relations between Germany and the Vatican commonly take as their starting point the political scene in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;e.g Lewy, 1964, p. 15-16; Carroll, 2002, p. 490; Falconi, 1967, p. 76; "A History of Christianity", Paul Johnson, 1976, p. 481; Coppa, 1999, p. 121; see also Lapide 1967, p. 99, 104, for clergy making comparisons between Nazi actions and Kulturkampf&lt;/ref&gt; German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' ("Battle for Culture") of 1871–78 saw an attempt to assert a Protestant vision of nationalism over the new German Empire, and fused anticlericalism with suspicion of the Catholic population, whose loyalty was presumed to lie with Austria and France. The [[Catholic Centre Party]] had formed in 1870, initially to represent the religious interests of Catholics and Protestants, but was transformed by the ''Kulturkampf'' into the "political voice of Catholics".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Baranowski; ''Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler''; Cambridge University Press; 2011; pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck's ''Culture Struggle'' was largely a failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%20693.pdf Yad Vashem – ''The German Churches in the Third Reich''] by Franklin F. Littell&lt;/ref&gt;

Bismarck sought to restrict the power of the Catholic Church in Germany. He regarded the Roman Church as "the enemy within". His ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' included the disbanding of Catholic organizations, confiscation of church property, banishment or imprisonment of clergy and an ongoing feud with the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 2002, p. 485–488&lt;/ref&gt; According to novelist [[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]], the end of ''Kulturkampf'' signaled "that the Church had successfully resisted to his face the man [Bismarck] who, according to an admiring [[Henry Kissinger]], was 'outmaneuvered' by nobody."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 2002, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's firm resistance to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] and ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', including passive resistance by the Church in general and the excommunication of collaborating priests, has been used as benchmark for assessing the Church's response to the Nazis from the early 1930s through World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 2002, p. 487, 490&lt;/ref&gt;

;End of World War I
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}

A formal realignment of Church and state relationships was considered desirable in the aftermath of the political instability of 1918 and the adoption of the Weimar constitution for the Reich along with the new constitutions in the German states in 1919.&lt;ref name="lewy7"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues that the Church hoped to resolve related to state subsidies to the Church, support for Catholic schools, the appointment of bishops and the legal position of the clergy.&lt;ref name="lewy7"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The Reich government, in turn, wished for reasons of foreign policy to have friendly relations with the Holy See. Also, Germany wanted to prevent new diocesan boundaries being established which would dilute Germany's ties to ceded German territories in the east such as Danzig and Upper Silesia.&lt;ref name="lewy6"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations relating to specific points, rather than a general concordat, took place between 1919 and 1922. But even after subsequent feelers were put out between the two parties the negotiations failed, primarily because both the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] were dominated by non-Catholic majorities who, for a variety of reasons, did not want a formal pact with the Vatican.&lt;ref name="lewy6"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of an agreement relating to particular areas of concern with the Reich, the Holy See concluded more wide-ranging concordats with three German states where Catholics were concentrated: Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1932).&lt;ref name="lewy6"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pope Pius XI
{{Main|Pope Pius XI}}

[[Pius XI]] was elected Pope in 1922. His pontificate coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. The old European monarchies had been largely swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power.&lt;ref name="EBOPiusXI"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online: "Pius XI"; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius's major diplomatic approach was to make [[concordat]]s. However, wrote Hebblethwaite, these concordats did not prove "durable or creditable" and "wholly failed in their aim of safeguarding the institutional rights of the Church" for "Europe was entering a period in which such agreements were regarded as mere scraps of paper".&lt;ref name="Peter Hebblethwaite p.118"&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite, ''Paul VI: The First Modern Pope''.

In 1929, Pius signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] and a concordat with Italy, confirming the existence of an independent [[Vatican City]] state, in return for recognition of the Kingdom of Italy and an undertaking for the papacy to be neutral in world conflicts.&lt;ref name="EBOPiusXI" /&gt; In Article 24 of the concordat, the papacy undertook "to remain outside temporal conflicts unless the parties concerned jointly appealed for the pacifying mission of the Holy See".&lt;ref name="Peter Hebblethwaite p.124"&gt;Hebblethwaite, p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Other major concordats included those signed with Germany (1933), Austria (1935), Yugoslavia (1935) and Latvia (1938).&lt;ref name="Peter Hebblethwaite p.118"/&gt; The concordats were generally observed by the countries involved, with the exception of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, p. 91; who also notes that these concordats appear to have strengthened the anti-Zionist faction with the Roman curia (p. 91); example given of the curia pressurizing the Italian authorities to stop an official who was suspected of Zionist sympathies from being appointed the Jerusalem Consul&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1929, General Groener pushed the German Foreign Ministry to resolve an issue with the Vatican regarding military [[chaplain]]s who lacked the ability to administer the sacraments of baptism or matrimony without first obtaining the permission of the local priest or bishop.&lt;ref name="lewy6"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Groener wanted the military to have their own bishop rather than rely on local ordinaries and it was this particular issue that was to mark an important step in the discussions that would ultimately be realized in the concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref name="lewy6"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1930, the new Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, gave indications that the Vatican would be interested in a concordat with the Reich in the event of any reforms of the Reich's constitution having an adverse effect on the validity of the concordats already agreed between the German states and the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions between the two parties took place between 1931 and 1932 and at one point representatives of the Reich pointed out that Italy had an army Archbishop with Cardinal Pacelli indicating that was because Italy had signed a comprehensive concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The German negotiators continued to discuss solely on the basis of particular points rather than a general concordat during 1931 but even these were felt to be unlikely to be passed by the Reichstag or the Reichsrat, no matter their political or theological leanings.&lt;ref name="lewy4"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi period==
===Nazis take power===
In January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor. The passing of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 23 March, in part, removed the Reichstag as an obstacle to concluding a concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref name="lewy4"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: "It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace".&lt;ref name="Alan Bullock p.147-48"&gt;Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; The Act, allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenberg remained President.&lt;ref&gt;Ventresca, Robert, L. "Soldier of Christ The Life of Pius XII" pp.&amp;nbsp;78–81 {{ISBN|978-0-674-04961-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Catholics were wary of the new government:&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Catholic Church ... had generally viewed the Nazi Party with fear and suspicion. It had felt threatened by a radical ultranationalist ideology that regarded the papacy as a sinister, alien institution, that opposed denominational separatism in education and culture, and that at times appeared to promote a return to Nordic paganism. The establishment of the Third Reich seemed to portend the coming of a bitter conflict between church and state|Extract from Theodore S. Hamerow's ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler''}}

In early 1933, Hitler told [[Hermann Rauschning]] that Bismarck had been stupid in starting a ''Kulturkampf'' and outlined his own strategy for dealing with the clergy which would be based initially on a policy of toleration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We should trap the priests by their notorious greed and self-indulgence. We shall thus be able to settle everything with them in perfect peace and harmony. I shall give them a few years reprieve. Why should we quarrel ? They will swallow anything in order to keep their material advantages. Matters will never come to a head. They will recognise a firm will, and we need only show them once or twice who is the master. They will know which way the wind blows.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An initially mainly sporadic [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]] followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler was [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|hostile to the Catholic Church]], but for political reasons, was prepared to restrain his [[anticlericalism]] and did not allow himself to be drawn into attacking the Church publicly as other Nazis would have liked him to do.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Kershaw wrote that, following the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor by President von Hindenberg, the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite "continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations".&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.295"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: A Biography''; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton &amp; Co; London; p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1933 The British Roman Catholic periodical ''The Tablet'' in an article titled "The Ides of March" asserted: &lt;blockquote&gt; [Hitler's] Dictatorship is a usurpation and his enforcement of it is a brutality. While we write these lines, with news of more arrests and repressions coming to us every hour, we remember that we have reached the Ides of March and the anniversary of a neverforgotten assassination. But Nazism's daggers cannot slay what is noblest and best in Germany. The Church, now that the Centre is no longer the key-group in German politics, may be persecuted ; but HITLER will not succeed where BISMARCK failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/18th-march-1933/6/the-ides-of-march "The Ides of March", ''The Tablet'', 18 March 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Ventresca wrote that ''because'' of increasing harassment of Catholics and Catholic clergy, Cardinal Pacelli sought a quick ratification of a treaty with the government, seeking in this way to protect the German Church. When Vice-Chancellor Papen and Ambassador [[Diego von Bergen]] met Pacelli in late June 1933 they found him "visibly influenced" by reports of actions being taken against German Catholic interests.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Ventresca, ''Soldier of Christ'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some thoughts that the Church was keen on coming to terms with Hitler as he represented a strong resistance against Communism: the Papal Nuncio in Berlin (Cesare Osenigo) is reported to have been "jubilant" about Hitler's rise to power and that the new government would soon be offering the same concessions to the Church that Mussolini thought necessary to do previously in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Historian, Michael Phayer, balances Lewy and author journalist, John Cormwell stating:&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, Michael, ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930–1965)'', 2000, Indiana Univ. Press, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| John Cornwell in ''Hitler's Pope'' argues that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary votes to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (Enabling Act of March 23, 1933). This is historically inaccurate. According to "Papen Fails to Get Vatican's Support for Hitler's Plans. Pope Refuses Reconstruction of Centrist Party in Reich and General Concordat. Civil Service is Purged, German Decree Ousts Non-Aryans and Leftists and Excludes Their Admission in the Future," (The New York Times, April 13, 1933), von Papen and Goering were received by Pius XI in April 1933, but their mission was understood to have been a failure. They had wanted to obtain Vatican support for a scheme to reconstruct the Centre party to insure its stable support of the Hitler government and to conclude a general concordat between the Holy See and the Reich to replace the three present concordats with Prussia Bavaria and Baden. Neither suggestion was approved by the Pope. The failure was interpreted as evidence of the Vatican's lack of confidence in the durability of the Nazi government. The Vatican was likewise reticent to abandon the existing concordats with Prussia, Bavaria and Baden for a general concordat with the Reich. However, there is no question about Pius XII's tenacious insistence on the Concordat retention before, during and after the Second World War.}}

===Negotiations===
The Catholic bishops in Germany had generally shown opposition to Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power. When the [[Nazi Party]] polled six million votes during the [[German federal election, 1930|14 September 1930 election]], the Catholic hierarchy called on its people to examine their consciences. During the next two years, though there had been softening by some, the bishops continued to pronounce against unacceptable policies of the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, 1966, p. 193; Ian Kershaw notes "the high level of relative immunity to Nazism which prevailed before 1933 in Catholic circles." Kershaw, ''The Hitler Myth'', Oxford, reissued 2001, p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Reichskanzler|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933, the bishops maintained support for the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] (''Zentrum''), which in turn refused to assent to a proposal that would allow Hitler to assume full power. On 12 March 1933 Pope Pius XI received the German Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber|Faulhaber]] in Rome. On his return Faulhaber reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After my recent experience in Rome in the highest circles, which I cannot reveal here, I must say that I found, despite everything, a greater tolerance with regard to the new government. ... Let us meditate on the words of the Holy Father, who in a consistory, without mentioning his name, indicated before the whole world in Adolf Hitler the statesman who first, after the Pope himself, has raised his voice against Bolshevism.&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, 1966, p. 194; Falconi notes that the German bishops would remember this "papal eulogy" in a joint memorandum to Hitler on 20 August 1935 which stated "In the face of this proclamation of the Pope's confidence, millions of men abroad, both Catholics and non-Catholics, have overcome their initial mistrust and accorded credit to your Government." p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a cabinet meeting on 20 March 1933 Hitler "confidently reported" that the Centre Party had now seen the necessity of the Enabling Act and that "the acceptance of the Enabling Act also by the Zentrum would signify a strengthening prestige with regard to foreign countries."&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Early in March 1933 the bishops recommended that Catholics vote for the Centre Party in the [[German federal election, March 1933|elections scheduled for 5 March 1933]]. However, two weeks later the Catholic hierarchy reversed its previous policy – the bishops now allowed the Centre Party and the Bavarian Catholic Party to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] which gave Hitler dictatorial powers on 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, 1966, p. 193; the Catholic Zentrum Party share of the vote (11.2%) was only slightly down on the previous November poll result. (Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 277)&lt;/ref&gt; German Catholic theologian Robert Grosche described the Enabling Act in terms of the 1870 decree on the infallibility of the Pope, and stated that the Church had "anticipated on a higher level, that historical decision which is made today on the political level: for the Pope and against the sovereignty of the Council; for the Fuhrer and against the Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James. ''Constantine's Sword'' p. 512, 2002, Houghton Mifflin (Mariner books ed), {{ISBN|978-0-618-21908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 1933 Cardinal Pacelli sent word to the German bishops to the effect that they must now change their position with regard to National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Biesinger, Joseph A. essay in ''Controversial Concordats'' (Coppa Frank J. ed.). p. 128, fn 26, CUA Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-8132-0920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 1933, the bishops themselves took up a position favourable to Hitler. According to Falconi (1966) the about-turn came through the influence and instructions of the Vatican. Pope Pius XI indicated in ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' (1937) that the Germans had asked for the concordat, and Pope Pius XII affirmed this in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Falconi viewed the Church's realignment as motivated by the desire to avoid being left alone in opposition and to avert reprisals. After the leader of the Centre Party, Monsignor [[Ludwig Kaas|Kaas]], had persuaded the party members to vote for Hitler and the Enabling Act, he left immediately for Rome and on his return on 31 March he was received by Hitler. He returned to Rome accompanied by the Catholic Vice-chancellor von Papen on 7 April with a mandate from Hitler to sound out a concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref name="rhodes1"&gt;Rhodes, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; On the day they set out for Rome to prepare the way for the concordat the first two anti-Semitic laws ([[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|excluding non-Aryans from public office]] and from the legal profession) were issued in Germany, but this did not impede the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, p. 207; Lapide (p. 99) notes that on 30 April the leader of an interfaith group asked Cardinal Bertram to help against the boycott of Jewish businesses but was refused because it was purely an economic matter and because Jews had not spoken out when the Church was persecuted.&lt;/ref&gt; Papen recorded in his memoirs that on his arrival in Rome, the Pope "greeted me with paternal affection, expressing his pleasure that at the head of the German State was a man like Hitler, on whose banner the uncompromising struggle against Communism and Nihilism was inscribed."&lt;ref name="rhodes1"&gt;Rhodes, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In Falconi's opinion the concordat was the price paid by Hitler in order to obtain the support of the German episcopate and the Catholic parties.&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, 1966, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Kershaw]] viewed the loss of political Catholicism as the sacrifice needed to protect the position of the Catholic Church in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Michael Phayer, the view "that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary vote of the Catholic Center Party to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (the Enabling Act of March 1933).... is historically inaccurate".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, Michael, ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930–1965)'', 2000, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Faulhaber wrote to Cardinal Pacelli on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong "because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves"&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;[[Martin Rhonheimer]], [http://www.firstthings.com/article/2003/11/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said "''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''"] First Things Magazine, November 2003. Retrieved 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;— the latter assertion based on the outcome of the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|April boycott]], which was seen{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as a defeat for the Nazis.

On 22 April 1933 the British Minister to the Vatican recounted what the Vatican Under-Secretary of State had told him: "The Holy See is not interested in the Centre Party. We are more concerned with the mass of Catholic voters in Germany than in the Catholic deputies who represent them in the Reichstag."&lt;ref name="rhodes1"&gt;Rhodes, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, as part of the agreement surrounding the 1929 Lateran Treaty with the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] government in Italy, the Vatican had consented to the dissolution of the Catholic political [[Partito Popolare Italiano|Partito Popolare]] party&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 2002, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; which dissolved in 1926.

At a 26 April meeting with Bishop Wilhelm Berning of Osnabrück, representative of the German Bishops' Conference, Hitler declared:{{quote|I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.}} The notes of the meeting do not record any response by Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]], who cites the above transcript, "This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions."&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt; [[Saul Friedländer]] interpreted Hitler's comments as an attempt to "blunt possible Catholic criticism of his anti-Jewish policies and to shift the burden of the arguments onto the Church itself.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edith Stein]] wrote a letter to Pius XI in April 1933 about the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany. The text of the letter is easily accessible on the internet. She never asked him to issue an encyclical on the matter, as some have contended. The letter was answered by Cardinal Pacelli. See William William, "Edith Stein's Letter," Inside the Vatican, March 2003, 22-31. (Edith Stein died in the gas chamber at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on August 9, 1942.

The issue of the concordat prolonged Kaas's stay in Rome, leaving the Centre Party without a chairman, and on 5 May Kaas finally resigned from his post. The party then elected [[Heinrich Brüning]] as its chairman. At that time, the Centre party was subject to increasing pressure in the wake of the process of [[Gleichschaltung]] and after all the other parties had dissolved (or were banned, like the SPD). The Centre Party dissolved itself on 5 July 1933, as the concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis had dealt it a decisive blow by exchanging a ban on the political activities of priests for the continuation of Catholic education. Cardinal Pacelli and von Papen initialled the concordat in Rome three days later, with signing taking place on 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives'', [[Alan Bullock]], p. 355, Harper Collins, 1991, {{ISBN|0-00-215494-3}}; Lapide, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July the Vatican daily newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' insisted that the concordat wasn't an endorsement of Nazi teachings.&lt;ref name="constantine505"&gt;Carroll, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July a British Minister had an interview with Cardinal Pacelli and reported: "His Eminence said that the Vatican really viewed with indifference the dissolution of the Centre Party."&lt;ref name="rhodes1"&gt;Rhodes, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14 July cabinet meeting Hitler brushed aside any debate on the details of the concordat, expressing the view "that one should only consider it as a great achievement. The concordat gave Germany an opportunity and created an area of trust which was particularly significant in the developing struggle against international Jewry."&lt;ref name="friedlander49"&gt;Friedländer, Saul. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews'' Vol 1, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Friedländer]] speculates that Hitler may have countenanced in this "area of trust" what he perceived as the Christian Church's traditional theological antipathy towards Jews, (see Hitler's comments above to Berning on 26 April), converging with Nazi aims.&lt;ref name="friedlander49"/&gt; Hitler "underlined the triumph" that the Concordat meant for the Nazi regime. Only a short time earlier he had expressed doubts that "the church would be ready to commit the Bishops to this state. That this has happened, was without doubt an unreserved recognition of the present regime."&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler'' p. 295, Penguin, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 1933 von Papen attended a meeting of the Catholic Academic Union, during which he first made the connection between the dissolution of the Centre Party and the concordat. He said the Pope was particularly pleased at the promised destruction of [[Bolshevism]] and that Pius XI had agreed to the treaty "in the recognition that the new Germany had fought a decisive battle against Bolshevism and the atheist movement."&lt;ref name="constantine520"&gt;Carroll, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Papen noted that there was "an undeniable inner connection between the dissolution of the German Center party that has just taken place and the conclusion of the Concordat" and ended his speech with a call for German Catholicism to put away former resentments and to help build the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="lewy"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Herwegen told the meeting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What the liturgical movement is to the religious realm, fascism is to the political realm. The German stands and acts under authority, under leadership—whoever does not follow endangers society. Let us say 'yes' wholeheartedly to the new form of the total State, which is analogous throughout to the incarnation of the Church. The Church stands in the world as Germany stands in politics today.&lt;ref name="constantine520"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 23 July a British minister met Cardinal Pacelli, who appeared "very satisfied" with the signing of the concordat. The cardinal expressed the view that, with the guarantees given relating to Catholic education, this concordat was an improvement over the 1929 agreement with Prussia.&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;Rhodes, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Pacelli did sound a note of caution in that his satisfaction was based on the assumption that the German Government "remained true to its undertaking", but noted also that Hitler "was becoming increasingly moderate".&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;Rhodes, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July Cardinal Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that "For Germany's prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance."&lt;ref name="lapide1"&gt;Lapide, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1933 the British Minister reported "in conversations I have had with Cardinal Pacelli and Monsignor Pizzardo, neither gave me the feeling of the slightest regret at the eclipse of the Centre [Party], and its consequent loss of influence in German politics".&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 176; On 23 June 1939 von Bergen wrote "Cardinal Pacelli told me that the fate of the Concordat depends upon the handling of the Germans' wish for diminution of the political work by priests." (Rhodes, p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August [[Ivone Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] had a further discussion with Cardinal Pacelli in which he expressed his "disgust and abhorrence" at Hitler's reign of terror to the diplomat. Pacelli said "I had to choose between an agreement on their lines and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich".&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Pacelli also told Kirkpatrick that he deplored the persecution of the Jews, but a pistol had been held to his head and that he had no alternative, being given only one week to decide.&lt;ref name="lapide"&gt;Lapide, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Pinchas Lapide notes that whilst negotiations for concordat were taking place, pressure had been put on the Vatican by the arrest of ninety-two priests, the searching of Catholic youth-club premises, and the closing down of nine Catholic publications.&lt;ref name="lapide"&gt;Lapide, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi newspaper ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' wrote "By her signature the Catholic Church has recognised National Socialism in the most solemn manner. ... This fact constitutes an enormous moral strengthening of our government and its prestige."&lt;ref name="lapide1"/&gt;

The concordat was ratified on 10 September 1933 and Cardinal Pacelli took the opportunity to send a note to the Germans raising the topic of the social and economic condition of Jews who had converted to Catholicism but of not Jews in general.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, p. 47, see also Lapide (p. 104) who also gives a date of 9 September for ratification&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, although the Protestant churches, being local congregations, remained unaffected by restrictions on foreign support, Hitler's government negotiated other agreements with them which in essence put Nazi officials, most of whom were Catholics, into positions of influence or outright authority over Protestant churches. Foreseeing the potential for outright State control of their churches which these agreements portended, many Protestant church [[leader]]s simply reorganized their congregations out of the agreements, causing a schism within the Protestant Churches. These Protestant resisters attempted to rally Catholic prelates to the dangers portended by these agreements but were simply rebuffed when the ''Reichskonkordat'' was ratified. Many of the Protestant clergy who opposed the Nazi religious program (''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' or Confessing Church), later suffered imprisonment or execution.

Church leaders were realistic about the concordat's supposed protections.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Review |first=John Jay |last=Hughes |title=An Antidotal History |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2013-08-29 |url=http://nationalreview.com/articles/220212/antidotal-history/john-jay-hughes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101185416/http://nationalreview.com/articles/220212/antidotal-history/john-jay-hughes |archivedate=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Faulhaber is reported to have said "With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1438 "The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler"] Catholic Culture&lt;/ref&gt; After the signing of the concordat the papal nuncio exhorted the German bishops to support Hitler's régime.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops told their flocks to try to get along with the Nazi régime.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Phayer, the concordat prevented Pius XI from speaking out against the Nazi [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and though he did intend to speak out after the nationwide [[Kristallnacht|pogrom of 1938]], Cardinal Pacelli dissuaded him from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 1935 the Catholic Bishops conference at Fulda reminded Hitler that Pius XI had:
&lt;blockquote&gt;exchanged the handshake of trust with you through the concordat—the first foreign sovereign to do so. ... Pope Pius spoke high praise of you. ... Millions in foreign countries, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, have overcome their original mistrust because of this expression of papal trust, and have placed their trust in your regime."&lt;ref name="constantine505"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a sermon given in Munich during 1937 Cardinal Faulhaber declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At a time when the heads of the major nations in the world faced the new Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its confidence in the new German government. This was a deed of immeasurable significance for the reputation of the new government abroad.&lt;ref name="constantine505"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The concordat===
The Treaty with Additional Protocol [in brackets] was signed July 20, 1933. It was ratified and in force starting September 10, 1933 and remains in force today. The text of the concordat was released 22 July 1933 and began with a preamble that set out the common desire of both parties for friendly relations set-out in a solemn agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preamble'''

His Holliness Pope Pius XI and the President of the [[German Reich]] [''Paul von Hindenburg''], led by their common desire to consolidate and enhance the existing friendly relations between the Catholic Church and the state in the whole territory of the German Reich in a stable and satisfactory manner for both parties, have decided to conclude a solemn agreement which will supplement the concordats already concluded with some particular German States (Laender) and secure for the others the principles of a uniform treatment of the questions involved.

His Holiness Pope Pius XI has appointed as his plenipotentiary [''a diplomat granted full power to represent''] His Eminence the Most Revered Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, His Holiness' Secretary of State; and the President of the German Reich [''Paul von Hindenburg''] has appointed as plenipotentiary the Vice-Chairman of the German Reich, Herr Franz von Papen; who, having exchanged their proper form have agreed to the following articles.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and edited by Sidney Z.

When the signing of the concordat concluded today between the Holy See and the German Reich, the undersigned, being duly empowered to do so, have formulated the following explanations which form an integral part of the concordat itself.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"&gt;Translated and edited by Sidney Z. Ehler and John B. Morall (Westminster, Maryland, The Newman Press, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Article 1''' The [[German Reich]] guarantees freedom of profession and public practice of the Catholic religion. It recognizes the right of the Catholic Church to regulate and manage her own affairs independently within the limits of the law applicable to all and to issue – within the framework of her own competence – laws and ordinances binding on her members.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and edited by Sidney Z. Ehler and John B. Morall,(Westminster, Maryland, The Newman Press, 1954) pp. 487-496&lt;/ref&gt;

The vagueness of the article would later lead to contradictory interpretations.&lt;ref name="lewy9"&gt;Lewy, 1964, pp. 80–85&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Article 2''' The concordats concluded with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1932) and the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church recognized therein remain unchanged within the territory of the States (Laender) concerned. For the rest of the states provisions of the present concordat shall be fully applicable. These provisions shall also be binding for the said three states in so far as they are relative to matters not regulated by the concordats concluded with those states, or in so far as they complete the arrangements already made.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Affirms the state concordats, Länderkonkordate, with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929), and [[Baden]] (1932) remain valid.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 3''' In order to foster good relations between the Holy See and the German Reich, an apostolic nuncio will continue to reside, as hitherto, in the capital of the German Reich and an ambassador of the German Reich will reside with the Holy See. {With regard to Art. 3. In accordance to the exchange between the apostolic nunciature and the Reich foreign office on the 11 and 12 March respectively, the apostolic nuncio to the German Reich shall be the [[Diplomatic Corps#Dean of the Diplomatic Corps|dean of the diplomatic corps]] accredited in Berlin.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Confirms the Vatican having a Papal Nuncio {diplomat) in Berlin and the German government having an ambassador in Rome.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 4''' The Holy See shall enjoy full freedom in its contact and correspondence with the bishops, clergy and all other members of the Catholic Church in Germany. The same applies to the bishops and other diocesan authorities in their contact with the faithful in all matters of their pastoral office. Instructions, ordinances, pastoral letters, official diocesan gazettes and other enactments concerning the spiritual guidance of the faithful, issued by the ecclesiastical authorities within the framework of their competence, may be published without hindrance and made known to the faithful in the ways heretofore usual.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 4 assures the Holy See of full freedom to communicate with the German clergy and for the German bishops to communicate with the laity "in all matters of their pastoral office." The words of qualification in this clause would later be interpreted by the Nazis in its most narrow meaning to limit the Church communications to worship and ritual only.&lt;ref name="lewy9b"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Article 5''' The clergy enjoy in the discharge of their spiritual activities the same protection of the state as state officials. The state will proceed according to general provisions of its law in case of any outrage directed against any clergy personally or against their ecclesiastical character or in case of any interference with duties of their office and, if necessary, will provide official protection.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 6''' Clerics and religious are exempt from the obligation to undertake public offices and such obligations as are incompatible with their clerical or religious status. This applies particularly to the office of magistrate, member of a jury in law courts, membership of taxation committees or membership of the fiscal tribunal.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 7''' A member of the clergy can accept an official function or appointment in the state or in any publicly constituted corporation dependent on the state only after having received the [[Nihil obstat]] of his diocesan ordinary [''bishop''], as well as that of the ordinary competent for the place where the seat of the corporation is situated. For important reasons in which the interests of the Church are involved, the nihil obstat can be withdrawn at any time.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 8''' The official income of the clergy is exempt from distraint to the same extent as the official salary of the civil servants of the Reich and of the states.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 9''' The judicial and other authorities cannot ask the clergy to give information about matters which have been entrusted to them while exercising the care of souls and which are consequently covered by the obligation of pastoral secrecy.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 10''' The wearing of clerical dress or of a religious habit by lay persons or by clerics or religious who have been forbidden to wear it on the strength of a final and valid decision of the competent Church authority – officially communicated to the state authorities – shall be punished by the state with the same penalties as the misuse of a military uniform.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Articles 5–10 dealt with the status of the clergy under German law. Priests were given protection against any interference in their spiritual activities as well as protection against malicious slander or misuse of clerical dress.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; Exemption from jury service, and like obligations, was guaranteed and the secrecy of the confessional guaranteed. Members of the clergy could only accept a state appointment so long as the bishop approved and this permission could be withdrawn at any time for important reasons.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 11''' The present organization and delimitation [''boundaries''] of the Roman Catholic dioceses in the German Reich remains at it is. If, however, the rearrangement of a bishopric or of an ecclesiastical province, or any other changes in the delimitation of diocese appear necessary in the future, they will be subject to agreement with the government of the state concerned in case that they involve changes only with boundaries of one German state (Land). In case of rearrangement of changes which exceed the boundaries of one German state, the agreement is to be made with the Reich government, to whose care it shall be left secure the consent of the state governments in question. The same applies to the establishment of new ecclesiastical provinces or alterations therein if these involve several German states. The foregoing provisions are not applicable to the shifting of boundaries which is made only with regard to the local care of souls. In case of a wider reorganization within the German reich, the Reich government shall consult with the Holy See with a view to such regrouping of dioceses and to their delimitation.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 12''' Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 11, ecclesiastical offices can be freely established and altered if no subsidy is asked for from the state funds. The co-operation of the state in establishing and changing the parish communities shall proceed according to the rules which have been arranged with the diocesan bishops; the Reich government will endeavor to achieve a uniform formulation by the state governments of their rules as far as possible.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Articles 11–12 specified that diocesan boundaries had to be made subject to government approval and that ecclesiastical offices could be established if no state funding was involved.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 13''' Catholic parishes and diocesan associations, episcopal sees, bishoprics and chapters, religious orders and congregations, as well as institutions, foundations and property of the Catholic Church administered by ecclesiastical authorities, shall retain or acquire respectively juridical personality, recognized by the State according to the general provisions of civil law. They shall remain publicly recognized corporations as far as they have been such hitherto; the same rights may be granted to the others in accordance with the general law applicable to all. {With regard to Art. 13. It is understood that the right of the Church to levy taxes is guaranteed.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 13 gave to parishes, Episcopal sees, religious orders etc. juridical personality and granted the same rights as any other publicly recognised body "in accordance with the general law as applicable to all" which subjected the church's prerogatives' to legal regulation under civil law. [[Guenter Lewy]] viewed this qualification as establishing "a pandora's box of troubles" when the law was effectively in the hands of a regime who wanted to control the church.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 14''' As a rule, the Church has the right to appoint freely to all the Church dignities and benefices without any co-operation on the part of the state or of the civil corporations, unless any other arrangement has been made in previous concordats mentioned in Article 2. As far as the appointment to the metropolitan see of Freiburg, in the diocese of the Upper Rhine, shall be applicable to the two suffragan [''subordinate''] bishoprics of Rottenburg and Mainz, as well as to the bishoprics of Meissen. The same applies in the said two suffragan bishoprics as regards the appointments to the cathedral chapters and the settlement of the rights of patronage. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the following points. (i) Catholic clerics who enjoy a spiritual office in Germany or exercise there a pastoral or educational activity, must: (a) be German citizens; (b) have obtained a school certificate (certificate of maturity) entitling them to study at a higher German school; (c) have studied philosophy and theology for at least three years at a German state university, an academic ecclesiastical college in Germany or a papal high school in Rome. (ii) [[Papal bulls|The Bulls]] containing appointments of archbishops, bishops, coadjutors cum iure successionis [''right of succession''] or of a prelatus nullis [ ''a bishop who has jurisdiction independent of a diocese''] will not be issued before the name of the selected has been communicated to the [[Reichsstatthalter]] in the State (Land) in question, and before it has been ascertained that there are no objections of a general political nature against such a person. The conditions laid down above (i) par (a), (b), (c), can be discarded by mutual agreement between Church and state. {With regard to Art. 14, par. 2, sect. 2. It is understood that if objection of a general political nature exist, they shall be presented as soon as possible. Should they not be presented within twenty days, the Holy See will be entitled to believe there are no objections against the candidate in question. Before an official announcement of the appointment is made, secrecy shall be kept about the candidates concerned. '''This article does not establish for the state a right to veto.'''}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 14 specified appointments of a bishop by the Pope was subject to mutual agreement and communication with the regime that no [general] political impediment existed,&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; while affirming appointments are free to make without any co-operation on the part of the state or civil corporations.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

* '''Article 15''' Religious orders and congregations are not subject, on the part of the state, to any particular restrictions as far as their foundation, their various establishments, the number of their members and their qualifications (save, however, for the previsions of art. 15 par. 2), their pastoral or educational activity, their care of the sick and charitable work, the management of their affairs and the administration of their property are concerned. Superiors of religious orders who have their official residence, within the German Reich must have German citizenship. Provincials and superiors whose official residence is situated outside the German territory have the right of visitation of their establishments in Germany, even if they have a foreign citizenship. The Holy See will see to it that the organization of the provinces of various religious orders, as regards their establishments in Germany, should be such as to avoid – so far as it can be done – the subordination of German establishments to foreign provincials. Exceptions therefrom may be admitted by mutual agreement with the Reich government, particularly in cases where the small number of establishments in Germany makes the formation of German province impracticable or where special reasons exist for the maintenance of a provincial organization rooted in history and working well in practice.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 15 guaranteed religious orders freedom for pastoral, charitable and educational work.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 16''' Before taking possession of their diocese, the ''bishops'' shall take an oath of loyalty either between the hands of the [[Reichsstatthalter]] in the state (Land) in question or between those of the president of the Reich, the formula of which shall be the following: "Before God and on the Holy Gospel I swear and promise, as becomes a bishop, loyalty to the [[German Reich]] and to the Land of [''name of Land''] I swear and promise to respect the government established '''according to the constitution''' and to cause the clergy of my diocese to respect it. In the due solicitude for the welfare and the interests of the German Reich, I will endeavor, while performing the spiritual office bestowed upon me, to prevent anything which might threaten to be detrimental to it."&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 16 specified Bishops must take an oath of loyalty and respect to either the Reich governor of the state concerned or to the President of the Reich.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; as established by the constitution.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt; When the treaty was signed and ratified the word [[Reich]], or the phrase, [[German Reich]], is not in reference to the [[Third Reich]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Reich&lt;/ref&gt; but rather, as it applies to the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] which did not officially and fully collapse until the death of President Paul von Hindenburg [[Nazi Germany|August 2, 1934]] with the passing of a [[German referendum, 1934|national referendum]] vote August 19, 1934 consolidating the Office of Chancellor and President, thereby, declaring Adolf Hitler [[Führer]] of Germany.

* '''Article 17''' The property and all other proprietary rights of the publicly recognized corporations, institutions, foundations and associations of the Catholic Church will be guaranteed according to the common law of the state. No building used for public worship can be demolished under any pretext or for any reason whatsoever, except if a mutual agreement has been reached beforehand with the competent ecclesiastical authority. {With regard to Art. 17. In so far as building or land belonging to the state have been devoted to ecclesiastical purposes, they will continue to be devoted to them, with due regard, however, to the contracts which might have been concluded about them.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 17 guaranteed, according to the common law, the properties of the church.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 18''' Should the state payments in kind or money, which are made to the Catholic Church, whether based on law, contract, or any other special legal title, be discontinued, the Holy See and the Reich will proceed in due time beforehand to set up amicable agreement the principles according to which the discontinuation is to be carried out. In this connection, a right derived from a legitimate traditional custom is to be considered as a special legal title. Such discontinuation, implying the cessation of a state payment or obligation, must be adequately compensated in favor of the claimant.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 18 assured the Church that it would be consulted should the Nazi regime [''or existing government''] try to discontinue its subsidies to the German Catholic church.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; or other legal title without compensation as specified in Article 138 of the [[Weimar Constitution]] for all religious organizations.

* '''Article 19''' Catholic theological faculties in state universities shall be maintained. Their relationship to the Church authorities will be regulated by the provisions of the respective concordats and by the protocols annexed to them, with due regard to the ecclesiastical laws relative to these faculties. The Reich will endeavor to secure for all German Catholic faculties in question a uniform regime in accordance with the general spirit of the regulations concerned. {With regard to Art. 19, sent. 2. The basis referred to consists, at the time when this concordat is being concluded, especially of the [http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/4/4.1/4.1.2.pdf Apostolic Constitution Deus scienitarum dominus] 24 May 1931, and the Instruction of 7 May July 1932.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 20''' The Church has the right unless there is some other agreement, to establish theological and philosophical colleges for the training of clergy; if no state subsidies are claimed for these institutions, they will be dependent solely on the ecclesiastical authorities. The establishment, management and administration of seminaries and hostels for clerical students pertains exclusively, within the limits of the law applicable to all, to ecclesiastical authorities. {With regard to Art. 20. Hostels connected with high and secondary schools and administered by the Church will be recognized, form the taxation stand-point, as being in practice ecclesiastical institutions in the proper sense of the word, and as of diocesan origin.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 21''' Catholic religious instruction in primary, vocational, secondary and higher schools is a regular subject of tuition and is to be taught in accordance with the principles of the Catholic Church. In religious instruction the patriotic, civic and social consciousness and sense of duty will be particularly stressed and cultivated, as this is generally done in the school training. The teaching program of religious education and the selection of text books will be settled with by agreement with the higher ecclesiastical authorities. These authorities will be given the opportunity to control, in harmony with the school authorities, whether pupils are receiving religious instruction in accordance with the teaching and requirements of the Church.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 22''' Mutual agreements shall be arrived at between the bishops and the governments of German states (Laender) with regard to the appointment of the teachers of religion. Teachers who have been declared by the bishop unfit for the further exercise of their teaching function, either for pedagogical reasons or on account of their moral behavior, must not be employed as teachers of religion as long as the obstacle remains.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 23''' The maintenance of the existing Catholic confessional schools and the establishment of new ones is hereby guaranteed. In all localities where parents or guardians request it, Catholic primary schools will be established if the number of their prospective pupils, considered from the point of view of the local school conditions, appears to be sufficient for the establishment of a school corresponding to the standards prescribed by the state legislation.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
*'''Article 24''' Only members of the Catholic Church who can be trusted that they will correspond to the special requirements of a Catholic confessional school, can be employed as teachers in all Catholic primary schools. Within the frame work of the professional training of teachers, arrangements will be made to guarantee the education and training of Catholic teachers capable of fulfilling the special requirements of Catholic confessional schools. {With regard to Art. 24. In so far private institutions are able to satisfy, after the new regulations regarding the education of teachers, the general applicable requirements of the state, the existing establishments of religious orders and congregations will be given due consideration in the accordance of recognition.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 25''' Religious orders and congregations have the right to establish and run private schools within the limits of the general legislation and conditions laid down by the law. The same qualifications as in state schools can be acquired in these private schools if they follow the teaching program prescribed for state schools. Members of religious orders and congregations are subject, with regard to their employment in private schools, to the general conditions applicable to all.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Articles 19–25 gave protection to the Catholic educational system (Hitler in due course would disregard them).&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 26''' Pending a later and more detail settlement of matters regarding matrimonial law, it is understood that a church wedding may proceed the civil marriage ceremony not only in the case of a grave illness of one of the finances which does not permit any delay, but in the case of great moral emergency (which, however, must be confirmed by the competent episcopal authority). In such cases, the parish priest is bound to report the matter at once to the registrar's office. {With regard to Art. 26. A great moral emergency is considered existing if the procuring of time of documents necessary for the wedding meets with obstacles which are either insuperable or whose removal would be disproportionately costly.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 26 allowed that a church wedding could precede a civil marriage ceremony.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 27''' A special and exempt pastoral ministry is conceded to the officers, employees and men of the Germany army and to their families. An army bishop will be in charge of this pastoral care. His ecclesiastical appointment will be effected by the Holy See after contact has been made with the Reich government in order to select, by mutual agreement, a suitable candidate. The ecclesiastical appointment of the military chaplains and other military clergy will be made by the military bishop after previous consultation with the competent authorities of the Reich. The army bishop can, however, appoint as military chaplains only such priest who have obtained, form their ordinary, permission to engage in military pastoral work and who have obtained an appropriate certificate of fitness. Military chaplains have the rights of parish priests with regard to the troops and other army personnel assigned to their care. An apostolic brief will be issued to regulate in detail the Catholic care of souls in the army. Regulations about the position of army chaplains as state officials will be issued by the Reich government. {With regard to Art. 27, sent. 2. Catholic army officers, personnel and men, as well as their families, do not belong to the local parish communities and are not to contribute to their maintenance. With regard to sent. 4. The apostolic brief will be issued in agreement of the Reich government.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 27 regulated the appointment of military chaplains.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 28''' The Church will be admitted to pastoral visits and to the holding of divine service in hospitals, prisons, and similar public institutions. If a regular care of souls, requiring appointment of clergy as state or public officials, is introduced in such institutions, this will be made by agreement with the higher Church authorities.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 28 assured the Church the right to pastoral care in hospitals, prisons and like institutions, which would be violated later by the Nazi regime when it refused the Church's request to carry out services in concentration camps.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 29''' Catholic members of non-German national minorities living within the Reich will not be placed in a worse status with regard to the use of their mother tongue in divine service, religious instruction and Church societies, than is the corresponding legal and practical position of the population of German origin and speech living in the territory of the corresponding foreign state. {With regard to Art. 29. Since the Reich government has shown itself ready to make concessions with regard to non-German minorities, the Holy See declares – confirming hereby the principles which it has constantly maintained regarding the right of using the vernacular in the pastoral ministry, religious instruction and in the activities of Catholic associations – that it will keep in mind, when concluding future concordats with other countries, the inclusion in them of provisions of a similar value for the rights of German minorities there.}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Article 29 granted the same rights to national minorities, with respect to the use of the mother tongue in divine services, as were enjoyed by the German population in the corresponding foreign state.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

* '''Article 30''' On Sundays and Holy Days a prayer will be said for the welfare of the [[German Reich]] and its people in episcopal, parish, affiliated and conventional churches in the German Reich, immediately after the High Mass and according to the rules of the Church liturgy.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 31''' Catholic organizations and associations whose activity is devoted exclusively to religious, purely cultural and charitable purposes and which are, as such, subordinated to Church authorities, are protected as to their institution and activities. Catholic organizations which, apart from religious cultural or charitable purposes, have other tasks such as social or professional aims, shall also enjoy the protection of this article 31, paragraph 1, even though their organization may be disposed in associations corresponding to states (Laender), '''provided they guarantee to develop their activities outside political parties'''. It is reserved to the Reich government and the German episcopate [''bishops''] to determine by mutual agreement, the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article. {With regard to Art. 31, par.4. The principles laid down in par. 4 of this article are equally valid for the labor service.}&lt;ref name = "trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 32''' With regard to the special conditions existing in Germany and with regard to the provisions of the present concordat guaranteeing legislation to protect the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church in the Reich and its states (Laender), the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the '''clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf'''. {With regard to Art. 32. It is understood that the same provisions, regarding activity in political parties, will be enacted by the Reich for the non-Catholic confessions. '''The conduct which has been stipulated as a duty for the German clergy and members of religious in Art. 32 does not mean any restriction on their preaching and exposition of the dogmatic and moral teachings and principles of the Church, as it is their duty to do.'''}&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;

Articles 31–32 relate to the issue of Catholic organizations "devoted exclusively to religious, cultural and charitable purposes" and empowered the Reich government and German episcopate to "determine, by mutual agreement, the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article." Organizations [sponsored by the Catholic Church] that had any political aims no longer had any place in the new Germany; this went without saying and not even mentioned.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; Article 32 gave to Hitler one of his principal objectives: the exclusion of the clergy from politics such that "the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf." &lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; Catholic laity, however, were free to form, engage and propagate political parties and seek political office. The Additional Protocol provisions make clear this prohibition of clergy from political activism does not mean they can not preach on moral teachings and principles of the Church "as it is their duty to do."

* '''Article 33''' All matters regarding clerical persons or Church affairs which have not been mentioned in the preceding articles will be settled, for the sphere of the Church, according to canon law in force. Should a divergence arise, in the future, as to the interpretation or application of any provisions of this concordat, the Holy See and the German Reich will arrive at an amicable solution by mutual agreement.&lt;ref name="trans_1954"/&gt;
* '''Article 34''' This Concordat, whose German and Italian texts shall have equal binding force, shall be ratified and the certificates of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible. It will be enforced from the day of exchange. In witness hereof the plenipotentiaries [representatives] have signed this Concordat. Signed in the two original exemplars, in the Vatican City, July 30, 1933. Signed: '''Eugenio, Cardinal Pacelli'''. Signed: '''Franz von Papen'''.

Article 33 makes provision for settling any difficulties in interpretation of the concordat through "amicable solution by mutual agreement."&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt; Article 34 calls for the speedy ratification of the concordat. As the document states '''It was not in force until its ratification September 10, 1933.'''

Additional protocol was added at its signing. When the concordat was ratified September 10, 1933 it granted Catholic clergy certain exemptions from any future universal army conscription call-ups. As Article 27 states, "A special and exempt ministry is conceded . . . ." As the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had forbidden Germany from raising a large army. This provision may have been seen by Hitler as the Vatican giving its tacit approval to German rearmament.&lt;ref name="constantine505"/&gt; Papen wrote to Hitler regarding this secret provision and concluded his brief with "I hope this agreement will therefore be pleasing to you".&lt;ref name="constantine505"/&gt; The provisions of the annexe were inserted at the request of the German Bishops Fulda Conference and the contents were kept so secret that [[Ernst von Weizsacker]], State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry from 1938, did not know of it until informed by the Papal Nuncio Orsenigo in 1939.&lt;ref name="lewy9"/&gt;

===Reception===
The British Roman Catholic periodical ''The Tablet'' reported the signing of the concordat:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Already it is being said that THE POPE OF ROME thinks of nobody save his own adherents and that he does not care how Lutherans are dragooned and how Jews are harried so long as Popish bishops, monastic orders, confessional schools, and Catholic associations are allowed full freedom. We beg our Protestant and Jewish friends to put away such suspicions. As we suggested at the outset of this brief article, the Catholic Church could have done little for other denominations in Germany if she had begun thrusting out wild hands to help them while her own feet were slipping under her. By patience and reasonableness she has succeeded in re-establishing herself, more firmly than before, on a Concordat which does not surrender one feather's weight of essential Catholic principle. She will straightway set about her sacred task, an important part of which will be the casting out of those devils which have been raging—and are raging still—in the Reich. But "this sort" of devil is not cast out save by prayer. Political action (from which the German clergy are debarred under the Concordat) by the Church would drive matters from bad to worse. We are confident, however, that Catholics will abhor the idea of enjoying complete toleration while Protestants and Jews are under the harrow, and that, quietly but strongly, the Catholic influence will be exerted in the right direction. One German out of three is a Catholic ; and Catholic prestige is high in Germany's public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/29th-july-1933/5/pro-ecclesia-dri-pro-rege-et-patria ''The Tablet'', 29 July 1933, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Criticism of the concordat was initially from those countries who viewed Germany as a potential threat. ''[[Le Temps]]'' wrote "This is a triumph for the National Socialist government. It took Mussolini five years to achieve this; Germany has done it in a week."&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;Rhodes, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Ere Nouvelle'' wrote "The contradiction of a system preaching universalism making an agreement with a highly nationalistic state has been repeated throughout Vatican history. The Church never attacks existing institutions, even if they are bad. It prefers to wait for their collapse, hoping for the emergence of a higher morality.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Poland|Polish]] newspaper ''Kurjer Poranny'' wrote on 19 July 1933 "Once again we see the methods of the Vatican—intransigent with the passive and amenable, but accommodating with the high-handed and ruthless. In the last century it rewarded its persecutor, Bismarck, with the highest [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal decoration]], the Order of Christ. ... The Centre Party, which most courageously resisted the Nazis, has been disowned by the Vatican.&lt;ref name="rhodes2"&gt;Rhodes, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Chancellor Bruning reported that 300 Protestant pastors who had been on the verge of joining the Catholic Church on account of the stand it had taken against the Nazis abandoned the plan after the signing of the concordat.&lt;ref name="rhodes2"&gt;Rhodes, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July, the Nazi newspaper ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The provocative agitation which for years was conducted against the NSDAP because of its alleged hostility to religion has now been refuted by the Church itself. This fact signifies a tremendous moral strengthening of the National Socialist government of the Reich and its reputation.&lt;ref name="lewy"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 26 and 27 July 1933, the Vatican daily newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' stressed the advantages gained by the church through the concordat but also insisted that the church had not given up her traditional neutrality towards different forms of political government nor did it endorse a "specific trend of political doctrines or ideas."&lt;ref name="lewy5"&gt;Lewy, 1964, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis replied through the German press on 30 July by correcting perceived false interpretations of the concordat and "reminding the Vatican" that the concordat had been signed with the German Reich which "as Rome should know, is completely dominated by the National Socialist trend" and therefore "the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' recognition of the National Socialist government" was signaled by the concordat.&lt;ref name="lewy5"/&gt; The Vatican demanded that the German government dissociate itself from these remarks but agreed eventually to forget its complaints so long as the German press refrained from any further "harping on the great victory" achieved by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="lewy5"/&gt;

===Violations===
{{See also|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII#Germany}}

Nazi violations of the concordat commenced almost immediately after it was signed. The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies.&lt;ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 136"&gt;[[Theodore S. Hamerow]]; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler had a "blatant disregard" for the concordat, wrote Paul O'Shea, and its signing was to him merely a first step in the "gradual suppression of the Catholic Church in Germany".&lt;ref name="O'Shea"&gt;Paul O'Shea; ''A Cross Too Heavy''; Rosenberg Publishing; pp. 234–35 {{ISBN|978-1-877058-71-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Gill]] wrote that "with his usual irresistible, bullying technique, Hitler then proceeded to take a mile where he had been given an inch" and closed all Catholic institutions whose functions weren't strictly religious:&lt;ref&gt;Gill, 1994, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It quickly became clear that [Hitler] intended to imprison the Catholics, as it were, in their own churches. They could celebrate mass and retain their rituals as much as they liked, but they could have nothing at all to do with German society otherwise. Catholic schools and newspapers were closed, and a propaganda campaign against the Catholics was launched.|Extract from ''An Honourable Defeat'' by [[Anton Gill]]}}

Almost immediately after signing the concordat, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law—the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]]—an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5"&gt;[[William L. Shirer]]; ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]''; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 234–35&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or "immorality".&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5"/&gt; Priests were watched closely and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Paul Berben p. 142"&gt;Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; {{ISBN|0-85211-009-X}}; p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940, a dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|Clergy Barracks]] had been established at [[Dachau concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; {{ISBN|0-85211-009-X}}; p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Intimidation of clergy was widespread. [[Cardinal Faulhaber]] was shot at. [[Cardinal Innitzer]] had his Vienna residence ransacked in October 1938 and [[Bishop Sproll]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Rottenburg]] was jostled and his home vandalised.&lt;ref name="catholiceducation0033"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholiceducation.org/articles/history/world/wh0033.html|title=Nazi Policy and the Catholic Church|work=Catholiceducation.org|accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shirer]] wrote that the German people were not greatly aroused by the persecution of the churches by the Nazi Government. The great majority were not moved to face death or imprisonment for the sake of freedom of worship, being too impressed by Hitler's early foreign policy successes and the restoration of the German economy. Few, he said, paused to reflect that the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists."&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p240"&gt;William L. Shirer; ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich''; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Nazi sentiment grew in Catholic circles as the Nazi government increased its repressive measures against their activities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206|title=The German Churches and the Nazi State|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his history of the German Resistance, Hoffmann writes that, from the beginning:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hoffmann; ''The History of the German Resistance 1933–1945''; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald &amp; Jane's; London; 1977; p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The Catholic Church] could not silently accept the general persecution, regimentation or oppression, nor in particular the sterilization law of summer 1933. Over the years until the outbreak of war Catholic resistance stiffened until finally its most eminent spokesman was the Pope himself with his encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''&amp;nbsp;... of 14 March 1937, read from all German Catholic pulpits ...}}

After constant confrontations, by late 1935, Bishop [[August von Galen]] of Munich was urging a joint pastoral letter protesting an "underground war" against the church.&lt;ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 139"/&gt; By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical—accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 concordat, and further that it was sowing the "tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church".&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5"/&gt; The Nazis responded with, an intensification of the Church Struggle, beginning around April.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: A Biography''; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton &amp; Co; London; pp. 381–82&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Nazi government violated the concordat (in particular Article 31), the bishops and the Papacy protested against these violations. Pius XI considered terminating the concordat, but his secretary of state and members of the curia, who feared the impact upon German Catholics, dissuaded him, as they believed it would result in the loss of a protective shield. Cardinal Pacelli acknowledged his role in its retention after the war.&lt;ref&gt;"Between morality and diplomacy: the Vatican's 'silence' during the Holocaust", Coppa, Frank J., ''[[Journal of Church and State]]'', 22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The flourishing Catholic press of Germany faced censorship and closure. Finally in March 1941, Goebbels banned all Church press, on the pretext of a "paper shortage".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Taylor; ''The Goebbells Diaries 1939–1941''; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982 pp. 278, 294&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic schools were a major battleground in the [[kirchenkampf]] campaign against the Church. When in 1933, the Nazi school superintendent of Munster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the "demoralising power" of the "people of Israel", Bishop August von Galen of Munich refused, writing that such interference in curriculum was a breach of the concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their "obligation to act with charity to all men" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel.&lt;ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 139"&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Often Galen protested directly to Hitler over violations of the concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in school, protest by Galen led to public demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, 1994, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the "racially unfit". Parents were coerced into removing their children from Catholic schools.

===World War II===
{{See also|Catholic Church and Nazi Germany}}

From 1940, the Gestapo launched an intense persecution of the monasteries; invading, searching and appropriating them. The Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, [[Laurentius Siemer]], a spiritual leader of the German Resistance was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically.&lt;ref name="Laurentius Siemer"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Laurentius Siemer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;[http://www.dw.de/memory-of-spiritual-leader-in-german-resistance-lives-on/a-2206790 Memory of Spiritual Leader in German Resistance Lives On]; [[Deutsche Welle]] online; 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With the expansion of the war in the East from 1941, there came also an expansion of the regime's attack on the churches. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. "Hostility to the state" was another common cause give for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole. The Jesuits were especially targeted.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Conway; ''The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945''; Regent College Publishing; p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo and Cardinal Bertram complained constantly to the authorities but were told to expect more requisitions owing to war-time needs.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Conway; ''The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945''; Regent College Publishing; p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures like Bishops [[August von Galen]] and [[Konrad von Preysing]] attempted to protect German priests from arrest. In Galen's famous 1941 [[Catholic Church and Nazi euthanasia|anti-euthanasia sermons]], he denounced the confiscations of church properties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online: "Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen"; web Apr 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He attacked the Gestapo for converting church properties to their own purposes—including use as cinemas and brothels.&lt;ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60"&gt;Gill, 1994, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; He protested the mistreatment of Catholics in Germany: the arrests and imprisonment without legal process, the suppression of the monasteries and the expulsion of religious orders.&lt;ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 289-90"&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p.&amp;nbsp;289–90&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on "The Struggle against Christianity and the Church".&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Fest; ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933–1945''; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; London; p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of "unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church", despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholic soldiers:&lt;ref name="Catholic Church p.74-80"&gt;''The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church''; [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|National Catholic Welfare Conference]]; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 74–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For years a war has raged in our Fatherland against Christianity and the Church, and has never been conducted with such bitterness. Repeatedly the German bishops have asked the Reich Government to discontinue this fatal struggle; but unfortunately our appeals and our endeavours were without success.}}

In July 1942, Hitler said he viewed the concordat as obsolete, and intended to abolish it after the war, and only hesitated to withdraw Germany's representative from the Vatican out of "military reasons connected with the war":&lt;ref name="Hitler p.551-556"&gt;''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944'': ch "A Hungarian Request"; Cameron &amp; Stevens; Enigma Books pp. 551–56&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Once the war is over, we will put a swift end to the Concordat. It will give me the greatest personal pleasure to point out to the Church all those occasions on which it has broken the terms of it. One need only recall the close co-operation between the Church and the killers of [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]]. Catholic priests not only allowed them to hide in a church on the outskirts of Prague, but even allowed them to entrench themselves in the sanctuary of the altar.}}

(This accusation by Hitler is unjustified, as the [[Reinhard Heydrich#Aftermath|protectors of Heydrich's killers]] were actually Orthodox.)

==After World War II==
Pius XII put a high priority on preserving the concordat from the Nazi era, although the bishops were unenthusiastic about it and the Allies considered the request inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the concordat remained in place and the Catholic church was restored to its previous position.&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;Ehler, Sidney Z.; Morrall, John B. ''Church and state through the centuries'' p. 518-519, org pub 1954, reissued 1988, Biblo &amp; Tannen, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-8196-0189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lower Saxony]] passed a new school law, the Holy See complained that it violated the terms of the concordat. The federal government called upon the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') for clarification. In its ruling of 26 March 1957, the court decided that the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the concordat did not invalidate it.&lt;ref name="unibe.ch"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv006309.html | title = BVerfGE 6, 309 – Reichskonkordat | publisher = servat.unibe.ch | date = 1957-03-26 | accessdate = 2013-11-23 | language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declaring its lack of jurisdiction in matters of public international law and considering the fact that the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] grants authority in school matters to the [[States of Germany|state governments]], the Constitutional Court ruled that the federal government had no authority to intervene. So while the federal government was obligated by the concordat, the court could not enforce its application in all areas because said court lacks legal authority to do so.&lt;ref name="unibe.ch"/&gt;

Critics also say that the concordat undermined the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="concordatwatch-german-principle"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=858&amp;kb_header_id=12971 | title = The German principle of "church autonomy" | accessdate = 2013-11-23 | publisher = concordatwatch.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weimar constitution]] (some of whose regulations, namely articles 136–139 and 141 were re-enacted in article 140 of the current German constitution) does not speak of a "separation", but rather rules out any state religion while protecting religious freedom, religious holidays and leaving open the possibility of cooperation. However, there was a continual conflict between article 18 of the concordat and article 138 of the Weimar constitution.

==Assessment==
[[Anthony Rhodes]] regarded Hitler's desire for a concordat with the Vatican as being driven principally by the prestige and respectability it brought to his regime abroad whilst at the same time eliminating the opposition of the Centre Party.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes took the view that if the survival of Catholic education and youth organisations was taken to be the principal aim of papal diplomacy during this period then the signing of the concordat to prevent greater evils was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 182; Rhodes quotes from an allocution given by Pius XII on 2 June 1945 which lends weight to this interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Centre Party deputies were priests who had not been afraid to raise their voices in the past and would almost certainly have voted against Hitler's assumption of dictatorial powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The voluntary dissolution of the Centre Party removed that obstacle and Hitler now had absolute power and brought respectability to the state: "within six months of its birth, the Third Reich had been given full approval by the highest spiritual power on earth".&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;Rhodes, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Kershaw]] considered the role of the Centre Party in Hitler's removal of almost all constitutional restraints as "particularly ignominious."&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler'' p. 282. Penguin, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] views Cardinal Pacelli as being an example of a "fellow traveller" of the Nazis who, through the concordat, was willing to accept the generosity of Hitler in the educational sphere (more schools, teachers and student slots), so long as the Church withdrew from the social and political sphere, at the same time as Jews were being dismissed from universities and Jewish student slots were being reduced. He argues that the Catholic Centre Party vote was decisive in the adoption of dictatorial powers by Hitler and that the party's subsequent dissolution was at Pacelli's prompting.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, John. Review of ''Hitler's Priests: Catholic Clergy and National Socialism'' by Kevin P. Spicer in ''Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture'', Volume 78, Issue March 2009, pp 235–237. Published [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=4261876 online] by Cambridge University Press, 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Phayer]] is of the opinion that the concordat conditioned German bishops to avoid speaking out against anything that was not strictly related to church matters, leading to a muted response to the attacks on Mosaic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic church and the Holocaust", 2000, p. 74; this book has for its cover a painting "The Concordat" by Fritz Hirschberger, a Holocaust survivor, which depicts a priest and Nazi soldier standing on the body of a Jew (p. x, see also "The End of the Pius Wars", [[Joseph Bottum (author)|Joseph Bottum]], ''First Things'' Magazine, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo Falconi described the concordat as "The Devil's Pact with Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;Falconi, 1967, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] in private conversation relating to the concordat said "Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time?"&lt;ref&gt;When Einstein was told how Pius XII directed a Polish priest to keep silent about the murder of Jews, because of the concordat the Holy See had signed with Nazi Germany "obliged the Church to tread softly", he replied "There are cosmic laws, Dr. Hermanns. They cannot be bribed by prayers or incense. What an insult to the principles of creation. But remember, that for God a thousand years is a day. This power maneuver of the Church, these Concordats through the centuries with worldly powers... the Church has to pay for it." Hermanns, William. ''Einstein and the poet: in search of the cosmic man'' pp. 65–66, Branden Books, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-8283-1873-0}}; see also [[Albert Einstein's religious views]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Goldhagen]] recalled how Hitler had said "To attain our aim we should stop at nothing even if we must join forces with the devil ..." and that, in Goldhagen's view, is what Hitler did in agreeing the concordat with the church.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhagen, Daniel. ''A Moral Reckoning'' pp. 115–116. 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-349-11693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Zahn]] felt that though the signing of the concordat was distasteful for Cardinal Pacelli it had spared the church in Germany from greater hardship and persecution.&lt;ref name="lapide1"&gt;Lapide, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siege of the International Legations''' occurred in the summer of 1900 in [[Beijing|Peking]] (today Beijing), the capital of the [[Qing Empire]], during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Menaced by the Boxers, an anti-Christian, anti-foreign peasant movement, 900 soldiers, marines, and civilians, largely from Europe, Japan, and the United States, and about 2,800 Chinese Christians took refuge in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Peking Legation Quarter]]. The Qing government took the side of the Boxers. The foreigners and Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter survived a 55-day siege by the Qing Army and Boxers. The siege was broken by an international military force which marched from the coast of China, defeated the Qing army, and occupied Beijing. The siege was called by the [[The Sun (New York)|New York ''Sun'']] "the most exciting episode ever known to civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton. ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, pp. 1, 83–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legation Quarter ==
[[File:Legation Quarter defenses.tif|thumb|left|Map of the Legation Quarter, showing the defensive lines. Most civilians took refuge in the British Legation.]]

The Legation Quarter was approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide. It was located in the area of the city designated by the Qing government for [[Diplomatic mission|foreign legations]]. In 1900, there were 11 legations located in the quarter as well as a number of foreign businesses and banks. Ethnic Chinese-occupied houses and businesses were also scattered about the quarter. The 12 or so Christian [[missionary]] organizations in Beijing were not located in the Legation Quarter, but rather dispersed around the city. In total, there were about 500 citizens of Western countries and Japan residing in the city. The northern end of the Legation quarter was near the [[Imperial City, Beijing|Imperial City]] where the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] resided. The southern end was bounded by the massive Tartar Wall which ringed the entire city of Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 29–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern and western ends were major streets.

==Rising tensions==
By 1900 the [[great powers]] had been chipping away at Chinese sovereignty for 60 years. They had forced China to allow the import of [[History of opium in China|opium]], which caused widespread addiction; defeated China in several wars; asserted a right to promote Christianity; and imposed [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges and immunities from Chinese law. Thus the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] or [[Manchu people|Manchu]] dynasty that had ruled China for more than two centuries was crumbling, and Chinese culture was under religious and secular assault by a powerful alien culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boxer movement===
Authorities differ as to the origin of the Boxers, but they became prominent in [[Shandong]] in 1898 and spread northward toward Beijing. They were an indigenous peasant movement, related to the secret societies that had flourished in China for centuries—and which, on occasion, had threatened Chinese central governments. The Boxers were named—probably by American missionary [[Arthur Henderson Smith|Arthur H. Smith]]—for their acrobatic rituals which included martial arts, twirling swords, prayers and incantations.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, Richard. ''The Spirit Soldiers: A Historical Narrative of the Boxer Rebellion''. New York: Putnams, 1973, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to other anti-Western [[millenarian]]ism movements around the world, such as the [[Ghost Dance]] in the US, the Boxers believed that with the proper ritual they would become invulnerable to Western bullets. The religious and magical practices of the Boxers had "as a paramount goal the affording of protection and emotional security in the face of a future... that was fraught with danger and risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Paul | last = Cohen | editor1-last = Bickers | editor1-first = Robert | editor2-last = Tiedemann | editor2-first = RG | title = The Boxers, China, and the World | place = Lanham, MD | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | year = 2007 | pages = 183, 192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boxers had no central organization but appear to have been organized on the village level. They were anti-foreign and anti-missionary. Their slogan was "Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreigner!".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul A. ''History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event, Experience, and Myth''. New York: Columbia U Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially feared as a possible threat by the Chinese government, they slowly gained the support of influential politicians in Beijing, who saw the Boxers as a movement that could be used to eliminate foreign influence in China.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

=== Boxers attack Christians ===
[[File:Empress-Dowager-Cixi1.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the historical oil paintings by Western artists depicting Empress Dowager Cixi]] [[File:BoxerRevolutionarybyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Boxer arrayed in his finery. Most were armed only with spears and swords.]]  

In the spring of 1900 the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. Two missionaries, Protestant [[William Scott Ament]] and Catholic [[Pierre-Marie-Alphonse Favier|Bishop Favier]], reported to the diplomatic ministers (Ambassadors) about the growing threat.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Henry D. ''William Scott Ament: Missionary of the American Board to China''. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1911, pp. 175–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United States'', 1900, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; American Minister [[Edwin H. Conger]] cabled Washington, "The whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers." Requesting a warship to be stationed offshore of Tianjin, the nearest port to Beijing, he reported, "Situation becoming serious."&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United States'', 1900, Washington: GPO, pp. 122, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 30, 1900, the diplomats, led by British Minister [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations and the citizens of their countries. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day more than 400 soldiers from eight countries disembarked from warships and traveled by train to Beijing from Tianjin. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Dr. George E. "The Siege of the Peking Legations" ''The Living Age'', Nov 17, 24 and Dec 1, 8, and 15, 1900, p.475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June{{nbsp}}5 the railroad line to Tianjin was cut by Boxers in the countryside and Beijing was isolated. On June{{nbsp}}13 a Japanese diplomat, Sugiyama Akira, was murdered by soldiers of Gen. [[Dong Fuxiang]] and that same day the first Boxer, dressed in his finery, was seen in the Legation Quarter. The German Minister, [[Clemens von Ketteler]], and German soldiers captured a Boxer boy and inexplicably executed him.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, B. L. ([[Bertram Lenox Simpson]]), ''Indiscreet Letters from Peking.'' New York: Dodd, Mead, 1907, pp. 50–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, that afternoon thousands of Boxers burst into the walled city of Beijing and burned most of the Christian churches and cathedrals in the city, killing many Chinese Christians and several Catholic priests. The Chinese Christians were accused of collaborating with the foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=sugiyama+akira&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h_3_TLrBCIP88Aar4rnzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=provocations%20by%20foreigners&amp;f=false |title= Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military |author=Robert B.

Soldiers at the British embassy and German legations shot and killed several Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dilemma of the Chinese Government ==
[[File:SirClaudeMacdonald.jpg|thumb|upright|British Minister Sir Claude MacDonald]]
In mid-June 1900 the Chinese government was still indecisive about the Boxers. Some officials—[[Ronglu]], for example—counseled the Empress Dowager that the Boxers were "rabble" who would be easily defeated by foreign soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Der Ling, Princess. ''Two Years in the Forbidden City''. New York: Moffat, Yard, 1911, p.. 161&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the question were anti-foreign officials who advised cooperation with the Boxers. "The Court appears to be in a dilemma," said [[Sir Robert Hart]]. "If the Boxers are not suppressed, the Legations threaten to take action—if the attempt to suppress them is made, this intensely patriotic organization will be converted into an anti-dynastic movement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sterling Seagrave|Seagrave, Sterling]]. ''Dragon Lady: the Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China''. New York: Vantage, 1992, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; The event that irrevocably pushed the Chinese government to the side of the Boxers was the attack by foreign warships on the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu forts]] on June 17. The attack was made to try to maintain communications with Tianjin and aid an army under the command of Adm. [[Edward Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Seymour]] in its attempt to march to Beijing during the [[Seymour Expedition]] and reinforce the Legations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]]. ''The Siege at Peking''. New York: Harper, 1959, pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19 the Empress Dowager sent a diplomatic note to each of the legations in Beijing informing them of the attack on Dagu and ordering all foreigners to depart Beijing for Tianjin within 24 hours. Otherwise, said the note, "China will find it a difficult matter to give complete protection."&lt;ref&gt;Davids, Jules, ed. ''American Diplomatic and State Papers: The United States and China: Boxer Uprising''. Series 3, Vol. 5, Wilmington, DE: Scholarly Resources, 1981, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receipt of the note, the diplomats convened and agreed it would be suicidal to leave the Legation Quarter and travel to the coast in an unfriendly countryside. The next morning, June 20, [[Clemens von Ketteler|Baron von Ketteler]], the German Minister, proposed to take up the matter with the [[Zongli Yamen]], the Chinese Foreign Ministry, but he was murdered by a Manchu officer, Capt. En Hai of the [[Hushenying]], while en route to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yaOknKJ3bNgC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=En+Hai+ketteler&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mETQTPfIH8OblgeNrtCrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=En%20Hai%20ketteler&amp;f=false |title = Protection of officials of foreign states according to international law |author=Franciszek Przetacznik |year=1983 |publisher=BRILL |page = 229 |ISBN = 90-247-2721-9 |accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Ministers informed all their citizens in Beijing to take refuge in the Legation Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Arthur H. ''China in Convulsion''. 2 Vols. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1901, pp. 243–255&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the 55-day siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Imperial_Decree_on_Day_Nineteen_of_May%28lunar_calendar%29#Decree_3Imperial |title = Imperial Decree on Day Nineteen of May (lunar calendar) |publisher = En.wikisource.org |accessdate = October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Besieged==
[[File:Frank Gamewell.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Gamewell (second from left, standing) and the "Fighting Parsons" built fortifications to protect the British Legation from Chinese attacks.]]
The British, American, French, German, Japanese, and Russian military guards each took responsibility for the defense of their respective legations. The Austrians and Italians abandoned their isolated legations. The Austrians joined the French and the Italians collaborated with the Japanese. The Japanese and Italian force established defense lines in the Fu – a large palace and park where most of the estimated 2,800 Chinese Christians taking refuge were housed. The [[United States Marine Corps|American]] and German marines held positions on the Tartar Wall behind their legations. The 409 guards had the job of defending a line that snaked through {{convert|2176|yd|m|abbr=on}} of urban terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, James H., M.D. "The Defense of the Legations in Peking". ''The Independent''. Dec 3 and 10, 1900, p. 3030&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of foreign civilians took refuge in the British Embassy, the largest and most defensible of the diplomatic legations. A census of civilians counted 473 people: 245 men, 149 women, and 79 children. About 150 of the men volunteered to participate, to a greater or lesser extent, in the defense. The civilians included at least 19 nationalities of which British and Americans were the most numerous. Large numbers of Chinese Christians were conscripted for labor, especially for building barricades.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 83–85, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Minister [[Claude MacDonald]] was selected as the commander of the defense and [[Herbert G. Squiers]], an American diplomat, became his chief of staff. The guards of the different countries, however, operated semi-independently and MacDonald could only suggest, not order, coordinated action.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The guards were not well armed. Only the American marines had sufficient ammunition. The defenders had three machine guns. The Italians had a small cannon. Fortunately, an old cannon barrel and ammunition was found in the Legation Quarter and from it a serviceable artillery piece was constructed that the Americans called "Betsy" and others called "the International".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rev. Roland ''The Siege of the Peking Legations''. London: Smith, Elder, 1901, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreigners ransacked the Legation Quarter for food and other supplies. Food and water were adequate, although the foreigners without private food stocks subsisted on a steady diet of horsemeat and musty rice. However, the Chinese Christians, especially the Catholics, had a much harder time of it and by the end of the siege were starving. The Protestant missionaries took care of their converts, but the Chinese Catholics were mostly neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 256; Fenn, Rev. Courtnay Hughes, "The American Marines in the Siege of Peking". ''The Independent''. Dec 6, 2000. pp. 2919–2920&lt;/ref&gt; Medical supplies were scarce but a sizeable number of doctors and nurses, mostly missionaries, were present.&lt;ref&gt;Ransome, Jessie. ''The Story of the Siege Hospital''. London: SPCK, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

American missionaries took over management of most necessities for life in the Legation Quarter, including food, water, sanitation, and health. MacDonald’s most important appointment was Methodist Missionary [[Francis Dunlap Gamewell|Frank Gamewell]] as chief of the Fortifications Committee. Gamewell and his crew of "fighting parsons" were universally acclaimed for their defensive works surrounding the British Legation.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, 142–143; Smith, 743–747&lt;/ref&gt;

About three miles distant from the Legation Quarter a similar siege took place at the [[Beitang Church|Beitang]] or North Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church.  Thirty-three priests and nuns, 43 French and Italian soldiers, and more than 3,000 Chinese Christians held off the Chinese army and Boxers.  There was no communication during the siege between the Beitang and the Legation Quarter.

==Chinese attacks and resolve==
For several days after June 20—the official beginning of the siege—neither the foreigners inside the Legation Quarter nor the Chinese soldiers outside it had any coherent plan for defense or attack. The number of Chinese soldiers ringing the legations is uncertain, but certainly numbered in the thousands. On the west were the [[Gansu]] Muslim soldiers of Dong Fuxiang&lt;ref name="Dillon2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=China's Muslim Hui Community: Migration, Settlement and Sects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAZeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Disown+me+as+a+Muslim+if+I+deceive+you.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSsIHL-O7LAhVH6yYKHQ53B1gQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Disown%20me%20as%20a%20Muslim%20if%20I%20deceive%20you.&amp;f=false|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-80933-0|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the east were units of the Peking Field Army. The overall commander of the Chinese forces was Ronglu—who was anti-Boxer and disapproved of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 127, 226–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese policy equivocated between belligerence and conciliation during the 55-day siege. Several attempts by Ronglu to effect a cease-fire failed because of suspicions and misunderstandings on both sides.&lt;ref name="Fleming, pp. 228-229"&gt;Fleming, pp. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BaronRongluJung-LubyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|upright|Ronglu, childhood friend of the Empress and the reluctant commander of the Chinese forces pressing the siege. George S. Stuart Gallery of Historical Figures]]

The Chinese first attempted to extinguish the foreigners in the Legation Quarter by fire. For several days at the beginning of the siege they set fires in the buildings around the British Legation. On June 23, most of the buildings of the [[Hanlin Academy]], the national library of China, and its books, many irreplaceable, burned. Both sides blamed the other for its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Smith | pages = 282–3 | title = Boxer Rebellion, 1900 | publisher=Historik Orders | url = http://www.historikorders.com/chinaboxer.html | accessdate = Sep 30, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Army then turned its attention to the Fu, the refuge for most of the Chinese Christians, and the domain of Lt. Col. [[Shiba Gorō|Goro Shiba]], the most admired military officer in the siege. Shiba, with his small group of Japanese soldiers, mounted a skillful defense against the Chinese who advanced behind walls built ever-closer to the Japanese, gradually threatening to surround them in a vise-like grip. British soldiers were often detailed to reinforce the Japanese during attacks and all admired Shiba's work.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, 126&lt;/ref&gt; The most desperate fighting took place near the French Legation, where 78 French and Austrians and 17 volunteers were under assault in convoluted urban terrain, in which the front lines were only {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} from each other. The French also feared that Chinese [[sapper]]s were digging tunnels for mines beneath their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans and the Americans occupied perhaps the most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding the top of the {{convert |45|ft|m|abbr = on}} tall and {{convert |40|ft|m|abbr = on}} wide Wall was vital. If it fell to the Chinese, they would have an unobstructed field of fire into the Legation Quarter. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and {{convert |400|yd|m|abbr= on}} west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades ever-closer. It was a claustrophobic existence for the soldiers on the wall. "The men all feel they are in a trap," said the American commander, Capt. [[John Twiggs Myers|John T. Myers]], "and simply await the hour of execution."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, pp. 542–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the daily advances of the Chinese were the nightly serenades of rifle and artillery fire and firecrackers designed to keep the foreigners awake and alert. "From June 20 to July 17 we had nightly attacks," said a missionary woman. American Minister Conger said "that some of them, for furious firing, exceeded anything he experienced in the [[American Civil War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mateer, Ada Haven.  ''Siege Days: Personal Experiences of American Women and Children during the Peking Siege.'' Chicago: Fleming H. Revell, 1903, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The hard-pressed Legation guards saw their numbers diminish daily with casualties.

The Chinese were divided on the prosecution of the siege.  The anti-Boxer faction, headed by Rong Lu, and the anti-foreign faction, headed by [[Zaiyi|Prince Duan]], squabbled at the Chinese court.  Cixi, the Dowager Empress, vacillated between the two.  She declared a truce for negotiations on June 25, but it endured only a few hours.  She declared a cease-fire on July 17 which lasted for most of the remainder of the siege.  As a sign of good will, she sent food and supplies to the foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=48g116X9IIwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=prince+tuan+replaced+prince+qing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HH7fTIzXAcOclgeYzJ24Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = The War of 1898, and U.S. Interventions, 1898–1934: An Encyclopedia |author=Benjamin R.

==Fight on the Wall==
The most critical threat to the survival of the foreigners came in early July. On June 30 the Chinese forced the Germans off the Tartar Wall, leaving the American marines alone in its defense. At the same time a Chinese barricade advanced to within a few feet of the American positions and it became clear that the Americans had to abandon the wall or force the Chinese to retreat. At 2:00&amp;nbsp;am on July 3 the foreigners launched an assault against the Chinese barricade on the wall with 26 British, 15 Russian and 15 Americans under the command of American Capt. John T. Myers. As hoped, the attack caught the Chinese sleeping; about 20 of them were killed and the survivors expelled from the barricades. Two American marines were killed and Capt. Myers was wounded and spent the rest of the siege in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, Nigel, A Diary of the Siege of the Legations in Peking. London: Longman, Greens, 1901, pp 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of Chinese positions on the Wall was hailed as the "pivot of our destiny" by one of the besieged. The Chinese did not attempt to regain or advance their positions on the Tartar Wall for the remainder of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W.A.P. ''The Siege in Peking''. New York:Fleming H. Revell, 1900, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darkest days and a truce==
[[File:Edwin H. Conger - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|upright|Edwin H. Conger, the American Minister to China]]

Sir Claude MacDonald said July 13 was the "most harassing day" of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, 157&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese and Italians in the Fu were driven back to their last defense line. While the Fu was under heavy attack the Chinese detonated a mine beneath the French Legation, destroying most of it, killing two soldiers and pushing the French and Austrians out of most of the French Legation. Frank Gamewell began digging bombproof shelters as a last refuge for the besieged. The end seemed near.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 204; "The Fortification of Peking during the Siege". ''The Gospel in all Lands''. Feb 1902, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, however, a conciliatory message was received from the Chinese, which raised hopes—dashed again on July 16 when the most capable British officer was killed and journalist [[George Ernest Morrison]] was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Peter and Macklin, Robert ''The Man who Died Twice: The Life and Adventures of Morrison of Peking''. Crow’s Nest, Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2005, pp 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; However, American Minister Conger carried on a communication with the Chinese government and on July 17 firing died down on both sides and an armistice began.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Sarah Pike, ''Letters from China''. Chicago: A.C McClurg, 1910, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was just in time; more than one-third of the legation guards were dead or wounded.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The motivation on the Chinese side was probably the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the Boxers and the siege was at hand.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Relief of the Legations==
{{Main|Battle of Peking (1900)}}
[[File:Battle of Beijing.jpg|thumb|left|Beijing in 1900 was surrounded by high walls broken by many gates (''men''). The location of the Legation Quarter and of the armies of Japan, Russia, the U.S. and Great Britain on the morning of August 14 is shown on the map.]]
On July 28 the foreigners in the Legation Quarter received their first message from the outside world in more than a month. A Chinese boy—a student of the missionary William Scott Ament—sneaked into the Legation Quarter with the news that a rescue army of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] was in [[Tianjin]] {{convert |100|mi|km|abbr= on}} away and would advance shortly to Beijing. The news was hardly reassuring, as the besieged had been expecting an earlier rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government also passed along inquiries about the welfare of the besieged from their governments. A British soldier suggested that an appropriate reply would be, "Not massacred yet."&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Luella, "A Prison in Peking: The Diary of an American Woman during the Siege". ''The Outlook'', Nov. 10, 17, 24, 1900, p. 735&lt;/ref&gt;

After many relatively quiet days, the night of August 13, with the rescue army just {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} outside the gates of Beijing, may have been the most difficult of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, George. "Vae Victis! The Allies in Peking after the Siege". ''The Independent''. Nov 8, 1900, pp. 130–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese broke the truce with an artillery barrage of the British Legation and heavy fire in the Fu. However, the Chinese confined themselves to firing from a distance rather than mounting an assault until, at 2:00 am on August 14, the defenders heard from the east the sound of a machine gun, a sign that the rescue army was on the way. At 5:00 am came the sound of artillery outside the walls of Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Five national contingents advanced on the walls of Beijing on August 14: British, American, Japanese, Russian and French. Each had a gate in the Wall for its objective. The Japanese and Russians were delayed at their gates by Chinese resistance. The small French contingent got lost. The Americans scaled the walls rather than attempting to force their way through a fortified gate.  However, it was the British who won the race to relieve the siege of the legations. They entered the city through an unguarded gate and proceeded with virtually no opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, 208&lt;/ref&gt;  At 3:00 pm the British passed through a drainage ditch—the "water gate"—under the Tartar Wall. Sikh and Rajput soldiers from India and their British officers had the honor of being the first to enter the Legation Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 174–182&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese armies ringing the legation quarter melted away. A short time later the British commander, Gen.

[[Adna Chaffee]], arrived at 5:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, 161&lt;/ref&gt;
The commanding Muslim general, [[Ma Fulu]], and four cousins of his were killed in action against the foreign forces. After the battle was over, the Chinese Muslim forces guarded the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] when she fled to [[Xi'an]] with the entire Imperial Court; general [[Ma Fuxiang]] assisted in guarding Cixi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?d=90CN0vtxdY0C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=ma+fulu&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MywhTNS9LoWBlAfA_JRa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fulu%20legations&amp;f=false |title=Familiar Strangers: A history of Muslims in Northwest China |author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman |year=2004 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=169 |ISBN = 0-295-97644-6 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Casualties==
The foreigners were united in declaring the miraculous nature of their survival. "I seek in vain some military reason for the failure of the Chinese to exterminate the foreigners," said an American military officer.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Reports of the War Department, 1901'', p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;  Missionary Arthur Smith summed up the Chinese military performance. "Upon unnumbered occasions, had they been ready to make a sacrifice of a few hundred lives, they could have extinguished the defense [of the Legation Quarter] in an hour." However, the equivocation on the part of the Chinese to use their military assets decisively against the Legation Quarter does not deny the fact that soldiers on both sides fought and died in large numbers.  The foreign soldiers defending the Legation Quarter suffered heavy casualties. Of the 409 soldiers, 55 were killed and 135 wounded, a casualty rate of 46.5%. In addition, 13 civilians were killed and 24 wounded, mostly men who participated in the defense.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 552, with minor corrections&lt;/ref&gt;

A small Japanese force of one officer and 24 sailors commanded by [[Shiba Gorō|Col. Shiba]] distinguished itself defending the Fu and the Chinese Christians there.  It suffered greater than 100% casualties. This was possible because many of the Japanese troops were wounded, entered into the casualty lists, then returned to the line of battle only to be wounded once more and again entered in the casualty lists. The French force of 57 men also suffered more than 100% casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese military casualties are not known, nor were deaths among the Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter recorded.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

==False propaganda==
During the siege Sheng Xuanhuai and other provincial officials suggested the Qing court give [[Li Hongzhang]] full diplomatic power to negotiate with foreign powers. Li Hongzhang telegraphed back to Sheng Xuanhuai on June 25, describing the war declaration a "false edict" (luanming).  Later, the "[[The Mutual Protection of Southeast China|Southeast Mutual Protection]]" was reached by provincial officials as a consensus not to follow Empress Cixi’s declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Li Hongzhang used the siege as a political weapon against his rivals in Beijing, since he controlled the Chinese [[telegraph]] service; he exaggerated and lied, claiming that Chinese forces committed atrocities and murder upon the foreigners and exterminated all of them. This information was sent to the Western world. He aimed to infuriate the Europeans against the Chinese forces in Beijing, and succeeded in spreading massive amounts of false information to the west. This false information spread by Li played a part in the massive atrocities which the foreigners later committed upon the Chinese in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=the+siege+of+the+peking+legations+was+not+intended+to+kill+all+the+foreigners.+If+it+had+been,+nothing+would+have+been+easier+for+the+chinese+than+to+use+their+many+heavy+german+artillery+pieces+to+batter+the+barricades+and+buildings+to+rubble,+then+send+in+thousands+of+infantry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8YkGTcPnG8OblgeewNXZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=li%20hung-chang%20ownership%20of%20the%20chinese%20telegraph&amp;f=false |title = Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Robert B.

==Aftermath==
The Empress Dowager and her court fled Beijing on August 15. She remained in exile in [[Shanxi]] province until 1902, when she was permitted by the foreign armies occupying Beijing to return to reoccupy the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Diana. ''The Boxer Rebellion''. New York: Berkley Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For China, the Boxer Rebellion was a disaster but – ironically – turned out about as well as could be expected. China remained together as a single country, while prior to the Boxer Rebellion it seemed likely to be divided by the colonial powers. The Chinese government supported the Boxers, who otherwise might have turned anti-Qing and hastened the extinction of the dynasty, but was unsuccessful in killing the foreigners in the Legations. Had the Chinese succeeded, the retribution the Western countries and Japan took might have been more severe. Ronglu later took credit for saving the besieged: "I was able to avert the crowning misfortune which would have resulted from the killing of the Foreign Ministers."  Ronglu was being disingenuous, as his forces came very close to breaking the ability of the besieged to resist.&lt;ref name ="Fleming, pp. 228-229"/&gt;

The Boxer movement disintegrated during the siege. Some Boxers were incorporated into the army but most probably returned to their homes in the countryside where they became targets for punitive expeditions by the foreign military forces occupying Beijing after the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

The military occupation of Beijing and much of northern China became an orgy of looting and violence in which foreign soldiers, diplomats, missionaries, and journalists participated.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 194–204&lt;/ref&gt;  Reports of the behavior of the foreigners in Beijing caused widespread criticism in Western countries, including from [[Mark Twain]]. While the rescue of the besieged foreigners in the Legation Quarter was seen as a proof of the superiority of Western civilization, the sordid aftermath of the siege may have contributed to many people in the United States and Europe reevaluating the morality of forcing Western culture and religion on the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 194–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slánský trial''' (officially ''Proces s protistátním spikleneckým centrem Rudolfa Slánského'' meaning "Trial of anti-state conspiracy centered around Rudolf Slánský") was a [[show trial]] against elements of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ) who were thought to have adopted the line of the [[Dissenter|maverick]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;Igor Lukes, "The Rudolf Slansky Affair", ''Slavic Review'', Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 1952, [[Rudolf Slánský]], [[General Secretary]] of the KSČ, and thirteen other leading party members, eleven of them Jews, were accused of participating in a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]]-[[Titoism|Titoite]]-[[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] and convicted: eleven including [[Rudolf Slánský|Slánský]] were [[death penalty|hanged]] in Prague on December 3,&lt;ref&gt;Brent, Jonathan and Naumov, Vladimir P., ''Stalin's Last Crime'', John Murray (Publishers), London, 2003, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; and three were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The state prosecutor at the trial in Prague was [[Josef Urválek]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kaplan, Karel | title=Report on the Murder of the General Secretary | location=London | publisher=I. B. Tauris &amp; Co | year=1990 | isbn=1-85043-211-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==
The trial was the result of a split within the Communist leadership on the degree to which the state should emulate the [[Soviet Union]], and was part of a [[Joseph Stalin]]-inspired purge of "disloyal" elements in the national Communist parties in [[Central Europe]], as well as a purge of [[Jew]]s from the leadership of Communist parties. [[Klement Gottwald]], president of Czechoslovakia and leader of the Communist Party, feared being purged, and decided to sacrifice Slánský, a longtime collaborator and personal friend who was the second-in-command of the party. The others were picked to convey a clear threat to different groups in the state bureaucracy. A couple of them (Šváb, Reicin) were brutal sadists conveniently added for a more realistic show.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

The trial was orchestrated (and the subsequent terror staged in [[Czechoslovakia]]) on the order of [[Moscow]] leadership by Soviet advisors, who were invited by [[Rudolf Slánský]] and [[Klement Gottwald]], with the help of the Czechoslovak State Security personnel following the [[László Rajk]] trial in [[Budapest]] in September 1949.&lt;ref name="Margolius"&gt;{{cite book | author=Margolius, Ivan | title=Reflections of Prague: Journeys Through the 20th Century |  location=London | publisher=Wiley | year=2006 | isbn=0-470-02219-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those put on trial confessed to all crimes (under duress or after torture) and were sentenced to punishment. Slánský attempted suicide while in prison. The people of Czechoslovakia signed petitions asking for death for the alleged traitors.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;   Apropos of the conspiracy theories of the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], prosecutors claimed that a "Zionist-Imperialist" summit had taken place in Washington DC in April 1947 with [[President Truman]], undersecretary of state [[Dean Acheson]], former treasury secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Moshe Sharret]] in attendance.  The conspiracy charged that defendants were acting in accordance with a so called "Morgenthau Plan" to commit espionage and sabotage against Czechoslovakia for the US in exchange for American support for Israel.  Ironically most of the defendants were known to be ardent anti-Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;Antisemitism and the American Far Left, Stephen H. Norwood, Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-107-65700-7}}, pp155-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of both Stalin and Gottwald in March 1953, the harshness of the persecutions slowly decreased, and the victims of the trial quietly received amnesty one by one, including those who had survived the Prague Trial. Later, the official historiography of the Communist Party was rather quiet on the trial, vaguely putting blame on errors that happened as a result of a "[[cult of personality]]". Many other political trials followed on, sending many innocent victims to jail and hard labour in [[Jáchymov]] uranium mines and labour camps.&lt;ref name="Margolius"/&gt;

The Slánský trial was dramatised in the 1970 film ''[[The Confession (1970 film)|L'Aveu]]'' ("The Confession"), directed by [[Costa-Gavras]] and starring [[Yves Montand]] and [[Simone Signoret]]. The film was based on the book of the same name by [[Artur London]], who was a survivor of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=London, Artur | title=Confession | location=New York | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=1971 | isbn=0-345-22170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slánský trial is a key element of the book  [[Under a Cruel Star (book)|''Under a Cruel Star'']]. A memoir by [[Heda Margolius Kovály]], the book follows the life of a Jewish woman, starting with her escape from a concentration camp during World War II, up until her departure from Czechoslovakia after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Warsaw Pact countries invasion of 1968]].  Kovály's husband, [[Rudolf Margolius]], a fellow Holocaust survivor, was one of the 11 men executed during the Slánský trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Margolius Kovály, Heda | title=Under A Cruel Star - A Life in Prague 1941-1968 | location=London | publisher=Granta | isbn=978-1-84708-476-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More encompassing information is available in the more recent book ''Hitler, Stalin and I'', an interview of [[Heda Margolius Kovály]] by Helena Třeštíková published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Margolius Kovály, Heda and  Třeštíková, Helena | title=Hitler, Stalin and I | location=Los Angeles | publisher=DoppelHouse Press | isbn=978-0-9987770-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slánský trial is the subject of the documentary ''[[A Trial in Prague]]'', directed by Zuzana Justman (2000, 83min).

In April 2018 ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that original film of the Slánský trial had been found near Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/rudolf-slansky-czechoslovakia-show-trial|title=Czechs discover hidden film record of Stalin’s antisemitic show trial|first=Robert|last=Tait|date=8 April 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[Kate Zernike]] reports that some within the Tea Party credit Seattle blogger and conservative activist [[Keli Carender]] with organizing the first Tea Party on February 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike |first=Kate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/us/politics/28keli.html/ |title=Unlikely Activist Who Got to the Tea Party Early |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=February 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by Chris Good of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' credits Carender as "one of the first" Tea Party organizers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Carendar organized what she called a "Porkulus Protest" on President's Day, a few days before Rick Santelli used the phrase "Tea Party" in what has been characterized as a "rant" broadcast from the floor of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike |first=Kate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/us/politics/28keli.html |title=Unlikely Activist Who Got to the Tea Party Early |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=February 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxdayteaparty.com/2009/03/meet-keli-carender-tea-party-organizer-in-seattle-washington/ |title=Meet Keli Carender, Tea Party organizer in Seattle, Washington « Tax Day Tea Party |publisher=Taxdayteaparty.com |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carender contacted conservative author and Fox News contributor [[Michelle Malkin]] in order to gain her support and publicize the event. Malkin promoted the protest in several posts on her blog, saying that "There should be one of these in every town in America", and that she would be supplying the crowd with a meal of pulled pork.

A protest at the Denver Capitol Building was already scheduled to coincide with the bill signing.

===Birth of the national Tea Party movement===
On February 19, 2009,&lt;ref name = McGrath/&gt; in a broadcast from the floor of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], [[CNBC]] Business News Network editor [[Rick Santelli]] loudly criticized the [[Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan|government plan to refinance mortgages]] as "promoting bad behavior" by "subsidizing losers' mortgages", and raised the possibility of putting together a "Chicago Tea Party in July".&lt;ref name="cnbc"&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/29471026 Rick Santelli: I Want to Set the Record Straight].[[CNBC]].

It was called "the rant heard round the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29306760 |title=Answer Desk: Housing relief backlash – Answer Desk |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santelli's remarks "set the fuse to the modern anti-Obama Tea Party movement", according to journalist [[Lee Fang]].&lt;ref name="themachine"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Machine: A Field Guide to the Resurgent Right |last=Fang |first=Lee |page=27 |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-59558-639-1 |publisher=[[The New Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day after Santelli's comments from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 50 national conservative leaders, including [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], [[Amy Kremer]] and [[Jenny Beth Martin]],  participated in a conference call that gave birth to the national Tea Party movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmoneytalk.com/finance/tea-party-palins-pet-or-is-there-more-to-it-underneath-910/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415112820/http://www.usmoneytalk.com/finance/tea-party-palins-pet-or-is-there-more-to-it-underneath-910/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 15, 2014|title=Tea Party: Palin's Pet, Or Is There More To It Underneath|date=April 15, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelpatrickleahy.com/teapartyfounders.html "The founding Mothers and Fathers of the Tea Party movement," by Michael Patrick Leahy], retrieved September 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Santelli, websites such as ChicagoTeaParty.com, registered in August 2008 by Chicago radio producer Zack Christenson, were live within twelve hours.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/04/opinion/main4843055.shtml A Growing "Tea Party" Movement?], Jonathan V.

Also on February 19, [[Young Americans for Liberty]] NY State Chairman Trevor Leach created a Facebook page called "The Capitalist Chicago Tea Party – Rick's Revolution", in response to Santelli's call for a national Tea Party.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Frazee, [http://www.yaliberty.org/posts/traders-revolt "Traders Revolt"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722194011/http://www.yaliberty.org/posts/traders-revolt |date=July 22, 2011 }}, ''Young Americans for Liberty, February 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=56760555635|title=Security Check Required|publisher=|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Huffington Post]], a Facebook page was developed on February 20 calling for Tea Party protests across the country.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-hamsher/a-teabagger-timeline-koch_b_187312.html |title=Jane Hamsher: A Teabagger Timeline: Koch, Coors, Newt, Dick Armey There From The Start |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= May 16, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eric Odom of the conservative activist group FreedomWorks was one of the group administrators, and it was created by [[Phil Kerpen]] from the conservative advocacy organization [[Americans for Prosperity]].

On September 12, 2009, Tea Party protests were held in various cities around the nation. In Washington, D.C., Tea Party protests gathered to march from [[Freedom Plaza]] to the [[United States Capitol]].

===First Tea Party convention===

On February 4, 2010, the first [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] national convention was held in [[Nashville]], attended by 600 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/75905/media-at-the-tea-party-convention |title=Media at the Tea Party Convention « The Washington Independent |publisher=Washingtonindependent.com |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention received broad media coverage as former GOP Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]] was the featured speaker.

==Tactics==
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on August 8, 2009, that organizations opposed to the President Obama's health care legislation were urging opponents to be disruptive. It noted that the Tea Party Patriots web site circulated a memo instructing them to "Pack the hall. Yell out and challenge the Rep's statements early. Get him off his prepared script and agenda. Stand up and shout and sit right back down." The memo continued, "The Rep [representative] should be made to feel that a majority, and if not, a significant portion of at least the audience, opposes the [[socialist]] agenda of Washington."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html?hpHealth Debates Turns Hostile], New York Times, August 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Tea Party organizers have stated that they look to [[leftist]] [[Saul Alinsky]]'s ''[[Rules for Radicals]]'' for inspiration. Protesters have also [[appropriation (art)|appropriated]] [[left-wing]] imagery; the logo for the March 9/12 on Washington featured a [[raised fist]] design that was intended to resemble those used by the [[Labour movement|pro-labor]], [[anti-war]], and [[black power]] movements of the 1960s. In addition, the slogan "Keep Your Laws Off My Body", usually associated with [[pro-choice]] activists, has been seen on signs at tea parties.&lt;ref name="alinsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27285.html|title=Conservatives use liberal playbook|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2010, it was announced that the [[National Tea Party Federation]] had been set up to publicize the movement, and organizers said it would issue news releases, respond to critics and help get the word out about tea party rallies and initiatives.&lt;ref name="LATimes2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/08/nation/la-na-tea-federation9-2010apr09 |title=Tea parties form a federation, but don't call them organized |author=Kathleen Hennessey |date=April 8, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea Party activist Mark Skoda noted the slow response to critics who have charged the protesters with racism, stating: "It took us 72 hours to respond to John Lewis... We're not needing to meet every week. But there will now be a way to have a call to arms to respond to attacks with a crisp and clear message."&lt;ref name="LATimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NTPF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationalteapartyfederation.com/uploads/NTPF_Letter_to_CBC.pdf|title=''Letter to the Congressional Black Caucus from Tea Party Federation: Please Provide Evidence of Cannon N-Word Incident'', National Tea Party Federation, April 24, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2010, at a Tea Party protest at the [[Ohio]] offices of Rep.

On March 20, 2010, it was reported that protesters against proposed health care legislation used racial and anti-gay slurs.

Conservative commentator [[Andrew Breitbart]], who wasn't at the protests,&lt;ref name="CBS48"/&gt; said the incidents reported by Cleaver, Lewis and Carson were fabricated as part of a plan to annihilate the Tea Party movement by all means necessary and that they never actually happened. He offered to donate $10,000 to the [[United Negro College Fund]] if Lewis could provide audio or video footage of the slurs, or pass a lie detector test. The amount was later raised to $100,000 for "hard evidence."&lt;ref name="CBS48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302143429/http://bigjournalism.com/abreitbart/2010/04/02/barack-obamas-helter-skelter-insane-clown-posse-alinsky-planes-to-deconstruct-america/ Andrew Breitbart, ''Big Journalism'', April 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJC1"&gt;[http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2010/03/26/breitbart-offers-10k-reward-for-proof-that-n-word-was-hurled-at-john-lewis/ "Political Insider" by Jim Galloway, ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', March 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the National Tea Party Federation sent a letter to the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (CBC) denouncing racism and requesting that the CBC supply any evidence of the alleged events at the protest.&lt;ref name="NTPF"/&gt;

In addition to mockery, protesters left a couple of notes behind. According to the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', one letter "asked what [[Rahm Emanuel]] did with Weiner in the shower", in a reference to the mess around ex-Rep [[Eric Massa]]. It was signed with a [[swastika]], the staffer said. The other note called the congressman "Schlomo Weiner".&lt;ref name="Make that the Nas-Tea Party"/&gt;
 
Kate Zernike, author of ''Boiling Mad: Inside Tea Party America'', has observed, "Rather than explain it as a fringe of the movement, which they plausibly might have, they argued that the ugliness had never happened. Wasn't it suspicious, they asked, that there was no video of spitting or slurs, in an age when everyone's cell phone has a camera? It was difficult, if not disingenuous, for the Tea Party groups to try to disown the behavior."&lt;ref&gt;''Boiling Mad: Inside Tea Party America''; Kate Zernike; Macmillan Publishers; November 2010; pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians from both political parties, black conservative activists and columnists have argued that allegations of racism do not reflect the movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38303950/ns/politics/t/tea-party-not-racist-movement-biden-says/ |title=Tea party not a racist movement, Biden says |date=July 19, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20067671-503544.html |title=Herman Cain: I prove Tea Party isn't racist |date=May 31, 2011 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Montopoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/04/black-political-activists-tea-party-racist/ |title=Black Political Activists: Tea Party 'Not Racist' |date=August 4, 2010 |publisher=Fox News|accessdate=November 11, 2011 |first=Jake |last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/7125472/article-Tea-Party--Not-racist--just-wary-of-government-s-reach |title=Tea Party: Not racist, just wary of government's reach |work=The Herald Sun |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |first=Robert |last=McCartney |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403032017/http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/7125472/article-Tea-Party--Not-racist--just-wary-of-government-s-reach |archive-date=April 3, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Left''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: השמאל הלאומי - ''Ha'Smol Ha'Leumi'') is an [[Israel]]i [[political movement]] striving to express the classic values of [[Zionism]] and the Israeli [[Left-wing politics|Left]] in face of the dwindling [[Election|electoral]] success of left-wing parties in recent decades: "...Our great and Zionist national Left, who wants, just like [[Binyamin Ze'ev Herzl]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]], a [[Jewish]] [[democratic state]] with recognizable and defendable borders, an exemplary, model society, and social justice" (translated from The National Left site).&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;[http://blogs.smoleumi.org.il/me2/?page_id=2 The National Left site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515135121/http://blogs.smoleumi.org.il/me2/?page_id=2 |date=2010-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was created on the foundation of "The National Left, a first draft", a 2009 manifesto by playwright [[Shmuel Hasfari]] and attorney [[Eldad Yaniv]] describing the state of the Israeli Left and the potential dangers of continued Israeli presence in the [[West Bank|West Bank territories]], and attempting to restore the Left's influence on Israel's [[Israeli politics|political agenda]] by promoting a pragmatic agenda based on the values of the Left, an Israeli pullout from the West Bank and an end to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and turning the Israeli society into a "model society".&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mackey"&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/israeli-stores-stop-selling-book-that-denounces-settlers/?scp=2&amp;sq=israel%20left&amp;st=cse "Israeli Stores Stop Selling Book That Denounces Settlers"] by Robert Mackey, ''New York Times'', 12 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="somfalvi"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3874378,00.html "Bookstore chain removes leftist book from shelves"] by Attile Somfalvi, YnetNews, 12 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book was criticized for its harsh denouncement of settlers and the settlement enterprise, and its distribution by bookstore chain Tzomet Sfarim was stopped, following pressure by right-wing sources.&lt;ref name="mackey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="somfalvi" /&gt;

On May 15, 2010, the movement held a rally in [[Jerusalem]] under the banner "Zionists do not settle".&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=175653 "Thousands join left-wing J'lem rally"] by Abe Selig, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 16 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was organized by The National Left, [[Peace Now]] and other left-wing organizations.

'''Tied aid''' is [[foreign aid]] that must be spent in the country providing the aid (the donor country) or in a group of selected countries. A [[developed country]] will provide a [[bilateralism|bilateral]] loan or grant to a [[developing country]], but mandate that the money be spent on goods or services produced in the selected country. From this it follows that '''untied aid''' has no geographical limitations.

In 2006 the [[oecd|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) estimated that 41.7 percent of [[Official Development Assistance]] is untied.&lt;ref name="OECD2006"&gt;OECD. (2006). ''2005 Development Co-operation Report''. Volume 7, No. 1. Paris: OECD. {{ISBN|92-64-03651-2}} Available for download: [http://www.oecd.org/document/35/0,2340,en_2649_201185_36052835_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Journal on Development, Development Co-operation Report 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The full definition of ''tied aid'' as defined by OECD&lt;ref&gt;"Tied Aid Credits", [http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3089 OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tied aid credits are official or officially supported Loans, credits or Associated Financing packages where procurement of the goods or services involved is limited to the donor country or to a group of countries which does not include substantially all developing countries (or Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs)/New Independent States (NIS) in transition).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motivations==
{{Further|Political corruption}}
In the OECD report ''The Tying of Aid''&lt;ref name="TyingAid"&gt;
[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,2546,en_2649_18108886_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD ''The tying of Aid'']&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that the motivations for tying aid were both economical and political. From the economic point of view, the donor country aims to raise its own exports. However, the study found that the exports related to tied aid were minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}} It referred to an earlier study that looked at the relation between exports from nine representative European donors and 32 representative developing countries. That study found that exports connected to tied aid constituted about 4 percent of the total. ''The Tying of Aid'' thus concluded that the more important reason for the practice was political. Historical relations, trade relationships, geopolitical interests and cultural ties are all examples of the political motivations behind the tying of aid, but according to Jepma, they all boiled down to the same thing: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although most donors give aid to quite a wide variety of recipients, the importance they attach to individual recipients clearly differs: donors support countries with which they have, or hope to have, strong ties. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Costs to the recipients of aid==
[[Image:Atrophy30.png|thumb|right|Value reduced by 30 %]]
[[Image:Atrophy20.png|thumb|right|Value reduced by 20 %]]
It is difficult to make a correct estimate on the related costs to the recipient for various reasons. One of these, is that even though a donor ties its aid, it might be that the donor has the most competitive prices in any case. Another factor is the ability a donor has to enforce the tying of aid in the recipient country. Even so, the OECD has made some general remarks on the costs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aid tying by OECD donor countries has important consequences for developing countries. Tying aid to specific commodities and services, or to procurement in a specific country or region, can increase development project costs by as much as 20 to 30 per cent.&lt;ref name="TyingAid"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If donors claim that 42 percent of bilateral aid is untied, one can assume that the remaining 58 is tied. In 2004, total bilateral aid amounted to US$79.5 billion.&lt;ref name="OECD2006"/&gt; In the worst-case scenario of OECD, the tying of aid can reduce its value by as much as 30 percent. If that was true in all cases, that translates into a US$13.9 billion reduced value of aid for the recipients. If the value on an average only is reduced by 20 percent, it would equal US$9.2 billion.

==The problems of untying aid==
The tying of aid is a form of [[protectionism]]; however, the literature on this particular subject is rather scanty. One of the major problems in the untying of aid is the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. Those donors that want to abolish the practice will see their own interests damaged if the other donors do not follow.&lt;ref&gt;Jepma, Catrinus J. (1991). ''The Tying of Aid''. Paris: OECD. Available for download: [http://www.oecd.org/findDocument/0,2350,en_2649_18108886_1_119699_1_1_1,00.html Untied Aid OECD Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the donor members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), a subcommittee of the OECD, agreed to virtually untie all aid to the [[Least Developed Countries]]. That Recommendation entered into effect on January 1, 2002. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have untied their aid beyond the requirements of the Recommendation.

Further progress on this particular issue is being implemented as part of the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]]. However, of the 12 indicators included, the untying of bilateral aid is the only item without a deadline for its competition.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Indicator nr. 8. Available for download: [http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_3236398_35401554_1_1_1_1,00.html The Paris Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for and against tied aid===

Tied aid increases the cost of assistance and has the tendency of making donors focus more on the commercial advancement of their countries than what developing countries need.  When recipient nations are required to spend aid on products from the donor nation, project costs can be raised by up to 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/doc/CDI/2009/Aid_2009.pdf CGD Background Paper: Aid Component by David Roodman]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tied aid can create distortions in the market and impede the recipient country's ability to spend the aid they receive.  There are growing concerns about the use of tied aid and efforts to analyze the quality of aid given, rather than simply the quantity. The [[Commitment to Development Index]], which measures the "development friendliness" of rich countries, actually penalizes donor governments for tied aid in the calculation of the index.

Others have argued that tying aid to donor-country products is common sense; it is a strategic use of aid to promote donor country’s business or exports.  It is further argued that tied aid if well designed and effectively managed, would not necessarily compromise the quality as well as the effectiveness of aid (Aryeetey, 1995; Sowa 1997).  However, this argument would hold particularly for programme aid, where aid is tied to a specific projects or policies and where there is little or no commercial interest.  It must be emphasized however, that commercial interest and aid effectiveness are two different things and it would be difficult to pursue commercial interest without compromising aid effectiveness. Thus, the idea of maximizing development should be separated from the notion of pursuing commercial interest.  Tied aid improves donors export performance, creates business for local companies and jobs.  It also helps to expose firms, which have not had any international experience on the global market to do so.&lt;ref name="tiedaid"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112138351/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0], Tied Aid and Multi-Donor Budgetary Support, Journal of International Development, Vol 17. Issue 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In the UK, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), was under the supervision of the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], which led, on at least one occasion, to allegations of a connection between the granting of aid and the achievement of either foreign policy goals or British companies winning export orders.  A scandal erupted concerning the UK funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border.  Building work began in 1991 with money from the UK foreign aid budget.  Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion worth of arms from the UK.  The suggested linkage of arms deals to aid became the subject of a UK government inquiry from March 1994.  In November 1994, after an application for [[Judicial Review]] brought by the [[World Development Movement]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] held that the then [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]] had acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (outside of his power and therefore illegally) by allocating £234 million towards the funding of the dam, on the grounds that it was not of economic or humanitarian benefit to the Malaysian people [https://web.archive.org/web/20091015114133/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0045540.html]. In 1997 the administration of the UK's aid budget was removed from the Foreign Secretary's remit with the establishment of the [[Department for International Development]] (DfID) which replaced the ODA.

Tied aid is now illegal in the UK by virtue of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20020001.htm International Development Act], which came into force on 17 June 2002, replacing the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act (1980)yA.

[[File:Ченці - криваві вороги трудящих.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Monks - the bloody enemies of working people" (Banner on the Dormition Cathedral of the Kiev Cave Monastery, 1930s)]]

The '''USSR anti-religious campaign of 1928–1941''' was a new phase of [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] persecution in the [[Soviet Union]] following the [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921–28)|anti-religious campaign of 1921–1928]]. The campaign began in 1929, with the drafting of new legislation that severely prohibited religious activities and called for a heightened attack on religion in order to further disseminate [[atheism]]. This had been preceded in 1928 at the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|fifteenth party congress]], where [[Joseph Stalin]] criticized the party for failure to produce more active and persuasive anti-religious [[propaganda]]. This new phase coincided with the beginning of the forced mass [[collectivization of agriculture]] and the nationalization of the few remaining [[private enterprise]]s.

Many of those who had been arrested in the 1920s would continue to remain in prison throughout the 1930s and beyond.

The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly all of its [[clergy]], and many of its believers, were shot or sent to [[Labor camp|labour camps]]. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited.&lt;ref name="Olga Tchepournaya 2003 p. 377"&gt;Olga Tchepournaya.

(4690 words)&lt;/ref&gt; More than 85,000 Orthodox priests were shot in 1937 alone.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail (Canada), 9 March 2001 - Why father of glasnost is despised in Russia By GEOFFREY YORK http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5141.html# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120105914/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5141.html |date=2012-01-20 }}#2 In his new book, Maelstrom of Memory, Mr. Yakovlev lists some of the nightmares uncovered by his commission. More than 41 million Soviets were imprisoned from 1923 to 1953. More than 884,000 children were in internal exile by 1954. More than 85,000 Orthodox priests were shot in 1937 alone.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a twelfth of the Russian Orthodox Church's priests were left functioning in their parishes by 1941.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pospielovsky, The Russian Orthodox Church under the Soviet Regime, vol. 1, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) &lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign slowed down in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and came to an abrupt end after the commencement of [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="Olga Tchepournaya 2003 p. 377"/&gt; The challenge produced by the German invasion would ultimately prevent the public withering away of religion in Soviet society.&lt;ref name="John Anderson 1991 pp. 689-710"&gt;John Anderson. The Council for Religious Affairs and the Shaping of Soviet Religious Policy. Soviet Studies, Vol. 43, No. 4 (1991), pp. 689-710&lt;/ref&gt;

This campaign, like the campaigns of other periods that formed the basis of the USSR's efforts to eliminate religion and replace it with atheism supported with a [[materialism|materialist]] [[world view]],&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion. Proletary, No. 45, May 13 (26), 1909. Found at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1909/may/13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was accompanied with official claims that there was no religious persecution in the USSR, and that believers who were being targeted were for other reasons. Believers were in fact being widely targeted and persecuted for their belief or promotion of religion, as part of the state's campaign to disseminate atheism, but officially the state claimed that no such persecution existed and that the people being targeted - when they admitted that people were being targeted - were only being attacked for resistance to the state or breaking the law.&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"&gt;Letters of Metropolitan Sergii of Vilnius http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letters_of_Metropolitan_Sergii_of_Vilnius&lt;/ref&gt; This guise served Soviet propaganda abroad, where it tried to promote a better image of itself especially in light of the great criticism against it from foreign religious influences.

== Education ==
In 1928 the Soviet [[People's Commissariat for Education | People's Commissar for Education]], [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], pressured by [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Marxism|Marxists]], agreed to an entirely anti-religious education system from the first grade up, however, he still warned against a general expulsion of teachers with religious beliefs due to the shortage of atheist teachers.{{cn|date=February 2017}} In 1929 an [[Agitprop]] conference resolved to intensify anti-religious work throughout the education system. This led to the setting-up of anti-religious sections at all research and higher-education teaching institutions. A special anti-religious faculty was instituted at the [[Institute of Red Professors]] in 1929.

A campaign was led{{by whom?|date=February 2017}} against schoolteachers of the old [[intelligentsia]] who were asserted to be working against the system and were even allowing priests to spiritually influence schoolchildren. Teachers accused of such could be fired, and in most cases the Soviet authorities imprisoned or exiled them.

The antireligious press identified by name [[religious belief | believer]]s among the ranks of top Soviet scholars. This labeling led to the 1929–1930 [[purge]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in which up to 100 scholars, their assistants and graduate students were arrested on forged charges and given sentences that ranged from three years of internal exile to the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} Most of them subsequently perished in camps or in prison. One of the aims of this purge was to take away the church's intellectuals and to assist the propaganda that only backward people believed in God.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance the famous Soviet historian [[Sergey Platonov|Sergei Platonov]] was asked why he appointed a [[Jew]] named Kaplan to the directorship of the [[Pushkin House]], and he replied saying that Kaplan was not a Jew but an [[Orthodox Christian]]; on this basis Kaplan was sent to a [[concentration camp]] for five years{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}.

The [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] called off "administrative measures" against religion from 1930 to 1931, which weakened the anti-religious educational work, but another resolution in September 1931 re-instituted active anti-religious education.

== Sergii and the Church ==
Most of the bishops arrested between 1928–1932 were arrested for reasons surrounding opposition to Metropolitan Sergius and his notorious declaration of loyalty. The state did officially maintain the line that church and state were separate in the Soviet Union during this time, despite the many arrests of people for not following their religious leaders. The GPU often cynically questioned arrested believers "what is your attitude to 'our' Metropolitan Sergii, heading the Soviet church?".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 60"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to Sergius was used as a pretext to close many churches and sending clergy to exile. The last officially functioning anti-Sergiite church in Moscow was closed in 1933 and in Leningrad in 1936.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 65"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; After these churches were closed, they were usually demolished or turned to secular use (rather than being given to Sergii's jurisdiction as though they were really being closed simply for the reason of their opposition to Sergii). This campaign greatly diminished the number of functioning churches in the country.

Although officially anti-Sergiite churches were destroyed, many unofficial underground church communities existed and formed what was called 'The [[Catacomb]] Church'.&lt;ref name="Daniel, Wallace L 2009"&gt;Daniel, Wallace L. "Father Aleksandr men and the struggle to recover Russia's heritage." Demokratizatsiya 17.1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This underground church movement claimed to be the true legitimate continuation of Orthodoxy in Russia.&lt;ref name="Daniel, Wallace L 2009"/&gt;

Twenty percent of inmates at the [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki camps]] in 1928–1929 were imprisoned in connection with these affairs. Between 1928 and 1931, at least thirty-six bishops were imprisoned and exiled, and the total number surpassed 150 by the end of 1930.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 60"/&gt; This did not mean, however, that clergy loyal to Sergii were safer for they were also widely attacked and arrested.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 76"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Metropolitan Sergii told foreign press in 1930 that there was no religious persecution and that Christianity shared many social goals with Marxism.&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt; A large number of clergy had made peace with Sergii by 1930.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 65"/&gt;

Due to the massive number of bishops being arrested, both the Orthodox and the [[Renovationism|Renovationists]] consecrated bishops secretly who could take the place of arrested bishops and continue the apostolic lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Also as a result of this massive arrest of bishops, the Orthodox [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church|Holy Synod]] ceased functioning in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anti-religious press, priests would wander from village to village surreptitiously performing religious services in the homes of believers, while being disguised as wandering repairmen, or some other profession. It also claimed the young people were being attracted to Christianity by clergy who hired themselves out free of charge to youth parties as games organizers, musicians, choir directors, readers of secular Russian literature, drama-circle directors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) page 71&lt;/ref&gt; It also claimed that many believers were keeping themselves away from churches and priests due to shame of observing religious ritual overtly, and that in response to this many priests performed religious rituals in absentia; this meant that marriage ceremonies were performed over rings that were then sent to absent bride and groom, or that funeral services were performed over empty coffins in which the corpse was later laid in a secular funeral.

== Legislative measures ==
The LMG called for sectarians to be expelled from farm management in 1929.

In 1929 Lunacharsky, made some statements in which he claimed that religious freedom could be suspended "when it is abused for the direct class struggle against the proletarian dictatorship".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 52"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) page 52&lt;/ref&gt; While Lunacharsky had urged moderation, this quotation would be taken out of context in order to justify the intense anti-religious persecution carried out in the next decade.

The church's successful competition with the ongoing and widespread atheistic propaganda, prompted new laws to be adopted in 1929 on "Religious Associations"&lt;ref name="Edward Derwinski 1986"&gt;Edward Derwinski. Religious persecution in the Soviet Union. (transcript). Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986): 77+.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as amendments to the constitution, which forbade all forms of public, social, communal, educational, publishing or missionary activities for religious believers.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 41"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The Church thereby lost any public voice and was limited strictly to religious services that took place in the walls of churches. Atheist propaganda continued to have an unlimited right of propagation, which meant that the Church could not respond to the arguments used against it any longer.&lt;ref name="Edward Derwinski 1986"/&gt; The Church was not permitted to run study groups for religious adults, organize picnics or cultural circles, or organize special services for groups of believers, such as schoolchildren, youth, women or mothers.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 61"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Any pursuit of the true pastoral duties by clergymen became punishable by law.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 52"/&gt; These laws also forbade Christian charity efforts, participation of children in religious activities, and religious functionaries were restricted to the area associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Young Pioneer]] organizations were urged to participate in the anti-religious struggle by the 16th party congress. The same congress also made it illegal for children to serve as [[acolyte]]s in churches or to be drawn into groups for home religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The official explanation for this campaign was that the state was vulnerable due to foreign religious efforts (e.g. the Vatican, US evangelical churches) and that therefore the churches in Russia needed to be deprived of all public rights with the exception of liturgical services conducted within church walls.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; All of these regulations together made it much easier for the state to arbitrarily persecute clergy and their families, especially with regard to the discriminatory financial, land use and housing regulations.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 61"/&gt;

In 1929 the [[Soviet calendar]] was changed to replace the seven-day work week with a six-day one, with five days of work and the sixth day off; this was done in order to force people to work on Sunday instead of going to church. The Soviet leadership instituted measures to stop the celebration of Christmas and other religious feasts. For example, the 25th and 26 December were proclaimed "Days of Industrialization" in which the whole country was obligated to celebrate national industrialization by being at work for the whole day. High work [[absenteeism]] on religious feast days was reported throughout the 1930s, however. Workers that did go to church services on working Sundays or on such religious feast days could be punished for [[truancy]]. The new work week remained in effect until 1940.

The celebration of the traditional Russian holiday of New Year (Feast of the Circumcision of Christ) was prohibited (later on New Year was reinstated as a secular holiday and is now the most significant family holiday in Russia). Gatherings and religious processions were initially prohibited and later on strictly limited and regulated.

In later years, a more subtle method of disrupting Christian holidays involved broadcasting very popular movies one after the other on the major holidays when believers are expected to participate in religious processions, especially during the Easter celebration. Apparently, this was intended to keep those whose faith was uncertain or wavering in their homes and glued to their TVs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 1929 a resolution of the CPSU central committee called on the [[Komsomol]] to eliminate religious prejudices from its membership through mandatory "voluntary political education" (note: this is not a typo, "voluntary" did not mean allowing refusal to participate in Soviet legislative jargon). Coercive pressure was applied to members of trade unions and local party cells to join the [[League of the Militant Godless]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the 16th party congress mentioned the duty of the party to help "the emancipation of the masses from the reactionary influence of religion" and called on trade unions to "correctly organize and strengthen anti-religious propaganda".

The party adopted a resolution at its 16th congress (1930) that priests should not be invited to private homes, donations to churches should discontinue, and that trade unions should be pressured not to perform any work for churches (including building repairs).&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; It also called upon the unions to boost anti-religious propaganda.

== Financial persecution ==

The church was treated as a private enterprise and clergy qualified as [[kulaks]] for taxation purposes, and they were subject to the same oppressive [[tax]]ation that was introduced for private peasants and shopkeepers (up to 81% of income). The lack of regulations that defined how such should be assessed allowed for arbitrary assessments and financial persecution. The rural clergy were required to pay the full tax on land use, along with tax on income received for special clerical functions as well as a special tax paid by those deprived of voting rights (all clergy were in this category). All church communities were required to pay a special tax on the leased church building at 0.5% of the "market" value of the building, which would be arbitrarily assessed by the State Insurance Office. Furthermore, clergy and conscientious objectors had to pay a special tax for not serving in the armed forces, but still had to serve in special auxiliary forces (felling trees, mining, and doing other labour) when called upon. This tax was equal to 50% of the income tax on incomes under 3000 [[ruble]]s and 75% of the [[income tax]] on incomes greater than 3000 rubles. Through all of these taxes combined, the taxes charged to clergy could exceed 100% of their income. Failure to pay taxes could be criminally prosecuted and lead to imprisonment or exile in Siberia.&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to pay taxes could also be treated as a subversive activity to undermine the Soviet economy during the Five Year Plan and could lead to execution.

Clergy were deprived of any social security rights as well. Up until 1929, the Church could insure their clergy for medical care and for pension by paying required sums, but after this date all such sums were to be kept by the state and no insurance or pension would be issued including to clergy who were already retired. This caused clergy to be only served by doctors who could charge as much as they wanted.

Since the church had been deprived of property in 1918, and the clergy had no fields to till as a result, along with the facts that the wealthier members of their congregation were being liquidated and the clergy were still forbidden to collect membership dues, they often no longer had a financial base to maintain their churches.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917–1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory land use policies had been introduced prior to 1929, which made it such that clergy who wanted land plots for private cultivation needed special permission and that this permission could only be given if no one else requested the land for use, and if such a request did arise the state could confiscate the land from the clergyman and give it to the person who requested it. The clergy also had no priority in claim to the land that belonged to the Church prior to 1917. In 1928 it was made illegal for clergy to join co-operative and [[collective farm]]s. In addition there were no laws that limited the rights of local governments to refuse land plots to clergy arbitrarily. All of this legislation contributed to a situation in which the clergy had no land to cultivate.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerical housing began to be rented at 10% of their commercial value in 1929 (in comparison to 1–2% for others living in the same type of building). Clergy that had annual income surpassing 3000 rubles could not remain in nationalized or municipalized buildings and they had to be evicted by April 8, 1929. No further leases of such buildings to clergy of any income were permitted, and it was also made illegal for them to reside in the homes of others. The only way they could live then was in private houses that they rented, of which after the collectivization nothing remained except semi-rural cottages. In the context of the persecution few laypeople would offer such housing to clergy out of fear of reprisal. This lack of housing forced many priests to leave their vocation and take civilian jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Priests' wives could nominally divorce their husbands in order to get jobs to support their families. Priests could be seen in rags in front of churches begging for [[alms]] and reportedly it could occur where priests had to mount the pulpit wearing their underclothes for lack of any other clothing that they owned.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 64"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antireligious propaganda ==
[[File:Bezbozhnik u stanka 22-1929.jpg|thumb|1929 cover of the magazine [[Bezbozhnik (magazine)|Bezbozhnik]], published by the [[League of Militant Atheists]]]]
The antireligious propaganda was critical in order to demonize active believers and foster a mindset of hostility against them as '[[vermin]]' or 'scum', and it was in some ways{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} similar to the contemporary [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] propaganda of [[Nazi Germany]].{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} Creating this mindset was critical in order to make the public accept the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

The published anti-religious propaganda was not as conspicuous as it was during the 1920s, but this did not bear reflection on the level of actual persecution. The verbal propaganda was increasingly relegated to public organizations, such as party branches, the [[Komsomol]], the Young Pioneers, the [[League of the Militant Godless]], Museums of Scientific Atheism, Workers' Evening Universities of Atheism under the auspices of Trade Unions, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of behaviour and policies of the Churches were treated in the official propaganda as insincere and aiming to overthrow Communism (including both believers that were pro-soviet and anti-soviet). Even acts of loyalty by religious leaders to the system were considered to be insincere attempts to curry favour in order to retain their influence over the believers and protect religion from its final liquidation as the sworn enemy of the workers.

Religious behaviour was presented in the official propaganda as being linked to psychological disorders and even criminal behaviour. Textbooks for schoolchildren tried to evoke contempt for believers; pilgrims were depicted as morons, repulsive-looking alcoholics, syphilitics, plain cheaters and money-grubbing clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Believers were treated as harmful parasites that spread ignorance, filth and disease, and which needed to be liquidated.

The press relayed slogans like "let us deal a crushing blow to religion!" or "we must achieve liquidation of the Church and complete liquidation of religious superstitions!".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 64"/&gt; Religious belief was presented as superstitious and backward.&lt;ref name="Daniel, Wallace L 2009"/&gt; It often printed pictures of former churches that had been demolished or turned into other uses.

The official press instructed people to sacrifice their family ties for the sake of atheism, and that they should not make compromises with family religious tradition for the sake of family unity or loving pity for their relatives.

The anti-religious propaganda attempted to show a relationship between religious belief and immoral or criminal behaviour. This included a revision of Russian history, in which religious figures were condemned. Fr [[Georgy Gapon|Gapon]], the leader of the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] March in January 1905 who was praised by Lenin, was turned into a Japanese spy, and [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] was alleged to have been affiliated with British capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holodomor|massive famine]] in the early 1930s (which was organized partly by the state) was blamed on religious believers who supposedly were infiltrating the collective farms and wrecking them from within. They were blamed in similar ways for the failures of the Soviet economy in the 1930s. Religious festivals were also blamed for hurting the economy by introducing high work absenteeism and drunkenness.&lt;ref name="Paul Froese 2004 pp. 35-50"&gt;Paul Froese. Forced Secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an Atheistic Monopoly Failed. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 35-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimes were invented in the press against religious believers that corresponded with their arrest. Accusations of [[lechery]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease]] were used against clergy wherever possible, since the propaganda maintained that the only reason why an intellectual would become a priest would be by moral decline and dishonesty in order to exploit people. [[Black market]]ing was one of the easiest accusations to put against believers, because after the abolition of the [[New Economic Policy]] the sale of a cross or icon could be categorized as illegal private enterprise, since the state did not produce these.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the USSR's policy of denying the existence of religious persecution, the press only admitted the existence of persecution in the past during the [[Russian Civil War]] and during the campaign to seize church valuables, and this was justified by claiming that the Church was conducting counter-revolutionary activities. Under the same policy, it was claimed that the mass closure of churches represented a voluntary decline in religion of the population (and closed supposedly as a result of demands of the workers).&lt;ref name="Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987"&gt;"Soviet repression of the Ukrainian Catholic Church." Department of State Bulletin 87 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were contradicted even before 1929, by cases of thousands of believers who petitioned the government to open churches that had been 'voluntarily' closed. Decades later, Soviet writers would admit the existence of persecution in the 1930s. The fact that less than 1% of the churches used in 1917 were available for believers by 1939 when they still numbered at least 50% of the population also is cited as proof against the supposed voluntary closures.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious press lost much creativity in the 1930s and often [[:wikt:boilerplate|regurgitated]] the same routine of hate propaganda from publication to publication along with drab articles that praised state policies or called on people to be good citizens. It also tended to exaggerate the success of eliminating religion and claimed that the state had dealt it a mortal blow.

In the hostile climate of the time, believers were named and exposed in the atheist press. Those who attended church at Easter could be reported by name. Such reporting could precede further attacks against them. Students at public schools could be asked to write on the blackboard the names of fellow students that had been attending religious services. Students were given homework assignments to try to convert a member of their family to atheism.&lt;ref name="Paul Froese 2004 pp. 35-50"/&gt;

== Agricultural communes ==
The religious agricultural communes were replaced with state communes. These communes were attacked, not because of poor productivity but because they prevented the penetration of anti-religious propaganda into them. People from religious communes who joined state communes were blamed in the press for sabotaging the harvest and work on the communes.

Churikov, a small merchant from the Volga area who had established highly successful Orthodox agricultural communes began to be targeted by the state in the late 1920s. He had a great reputation among the thousands of those who participated in his communes and reportedly had a gift for curing [[alcoholism]] through [[prayer]], sermon, and appeal for love of God and man and working for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He also preached "Christ's socialism". Originally he had been praised in official propaganda, but the failure of the state's collective farms to compete with his communes produced an ideological need to eliminate him. As a result, his character was maligned in a long press campaign and he was finally executed in 1930 along with his chief lieutenants. His communes were dissolved, along with all the other religious farming communes in the country.

== Muslims ==
[[Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev|Sultan Galiev]], the Central Asian Marxist leader who had advocated for an independent Marxist state in Central Asia, began to be attacked in 1927. From 1927-1940 he and his supporters were purged from the CPSU. Galiev was arrested and sent to penal servitude; he was later executed in 1940.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"&gt;Froese, Paul. "'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition." Journal of Church and State 47.3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims who had supported a united Muslim state in Central Asia were targeted and liquidated in the 1930s as traitors.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt;

Much of the communist party in Central Asia was composed of believing Muslims, and the state found that it was not pragmatic to eliminate all of them, because of the lack of experience that Russian communist replacements had with Central Asia and the shortage of sufficient numbers of atheist members of the CPSU in those territories.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt;

Muslims nevertheless were attacked along with the believers of other religions during this period. The 1929 law on religious associations for the whole country was implemented in Central Asia by the dissolution of all Islamic courts that oversaw rulings on both [[Sharia]] and customary law.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt;

There were 20,000 mosques in Soviet Central Asia in 1917, fewer than 4,000 in 1929 and by 1935 it is known that there were less than 60 still functioning in [[Uzbekistan]], which held half of the Muslim population of Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; Muslim clerics encountered the same financial persecution as Christian clergy, and were unable to support themselves. There was also a massive decrease in the number of registered Muslim clergy, which left significant amounts of areas without [[imam]]s or [[mullah]]s. Many unregistered Muslim clerics continued to practise illegally, however, as well as many Muslim mosques existed illegally without registration.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; The unregistered mosques along with the registered ones, still represented a tiny fraction of the number of mosques in the region of Central Asia in 1917.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt;

Many Muslim clerics were arrested and executed during Stalin's purges.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; The campaign against Islam in the 1930s was directly linked with the physical annihilation of the "Islamic" nationalistic communists of the Central Asian parts of the USSR.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; In 1936 there was an "unmasking" of the supreme Muslim [[Mufti]] of [[Ufa]] as a Japanese and German agent who had turned the entire Muslim Spiritual Administration of Ufa into a giant espionage network. In some parts of the [[Caucasus]], the anti-religious campaign and attacks against Islam provoked guerrilla warfare that Soviet troops were brought in to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter.

== Activities ==
Stalin called "to bring to completion the liquidation of the reactionary clergy in our country".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 88"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin called for an "atheist five year plan" from 1932–1937, led by the LMG, in order to completely eliminate all religious expression in the USSR.&lt;ref name="marxist.com"&gt;Paul Dixon, Religion in the Soviet Union, first published 1945 in Workers International News, and can be found at: http://www.marxist.com/religion-soviet-union170406.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared that the concept of God would disappear from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="marxist.com"/&gt;

Some of the tactics that had been used early on and discarded in the 1920s due to their crude nature or providing too much offense to the feelings of believers. Included in these tactics were the anti-Christmases and anti-Easters that were organized by groups such as the Komsomol.

[[Anti-clericalism]], and attempting to divide religions by pitting laity against their hierarchy was still encouraged. Most of the clergy arrested and imprisoned in the 1920s and onwards never had trials. The maximum sentence for administrative exile in the 1920s had been three years, but this was extended to four years in 1934 when the [[NKVD]] was created and given the power to issue such sentences. After serving such terms, most clergy would return their dioceses. Those whose terms ran out around 1930 were often transported later under surveillance to an isolated village in the far north or north-east, never to return.

There had initially been great resistance by religious associations against the beginning of the attack in 1929-1930 and large volumes of petitions to the government.&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"&gt;Gregory L. Freeze. Counter-Reformation in Russian Orthodoxy: Popular Response to Religious Innovation, 1922-1925. Slavic Review, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Summer, 1995), pp. 305-339&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1929 and through the 1930s, the closing of churches, mass arrests of the clergy and religiously active laity, and persecution of people for attending church reached unprecedented proportions.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marxist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regels.org"&gt;Letters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson, http://www.regels.org/humanright.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the central Russian region of Bezhetsk, 100 of the surviving 308 churches were shut in 1929 (only twelve were closed in this region between 1918–1929) and in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] diocese 200 out of the 700 churches were closed in 1929.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 64"/&gt; This campaign began to intensify first in the rural areas&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"/&gt; before it came to the cities after the liquidation of monasteries in 1932.

Much of this was carried out on secret unpublished instructions from the Central Committee, while confusingly the same Committee would publicly call for an end to the practice of shutting churches.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to this, the terror campaign of the 1930s was conducted in an atmosphere of absolute secrecy after very bad international publicity that initially followed the campaign run from 1929–1930.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Party members that were found to have religious affiliation were purged.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp 5&lt;/ref&gt; Party members that were found to have insufficiently detached themselves from religious affiliations (e.g. if they continued to be friends with the local priest) were expelled and purged.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Soviet press claimed that an espionage organization serving the Polish intelligence service was uncovered in the Baptist community. It was supposedly headed by the Baptist leader Shevchuk and employed a hundred secret agents that were collecting Soviet military secrets. These claims were doubtful, however, and the accusation followed a decision by the Baptist church to allow its membership to serve in the armed forces, which thereby deprived Soviet propaganda of its ability to make accusations, as it had earlier, that the Baptists were irresponsible pacifists who parasitically enjoyed the security provided by their fellow citizens who shed their blood in that nation's defense.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 86"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Other accusations of this sort were leveled against the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], students at the [[Leningrad Theological Institute]] and a number of top engineers and scientists, who were accused of doing espionage for foreign powers and the Vatican, or subversion; this led to trials, imprisonments and executions of numerous individuals. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was essentially shut down in 1930 through this means, and in the remainder of the decade most of its bishops were killed as well as many of its followers.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 86"/&gt; A number of Protestant and Roman Catholic dignitaries were "exposed" as foreign spies in 1929–1930. Charges of espionage were commonly used against religious believers in order to arrest them.

There were even accusations that clergy were cooperating with [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]] and Zonvievites against the state, although [[Leon Trotsky]] was an energetic and militantly atheistic communist leader. In the same theme, Nikolai Bukharin was accused of promoting extreme attacks against believers in order to strengthen the religious convictions of believers and demoralize the atheists.

Church icons and religious architecture were destroyed.&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt; The [[People's Commissariat for Education]] reduced the list of protected churches from 7000 to 1000, thus leaving 6000 churches to destruction. There were public burnings of thousands of religious icons. The built religious cultural heritage of the country was largely destroyed.&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt;

A lull in the active persecution was experienced in 1930–33 following Stalin's 1930 article "Diziness From Success"; however, it swept back in fervor again afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 the Politburo adopted a plan to eliminate [[monasticism]] in the country, and in the next several years all monasteries were officially closed. This was accompanied by press campaigns that depicted them as parasitic institutions that engaged in immorality (nuns were especially accused of sexual immorality). Many of the dispossessed monks and nuns formed semi-legal clandestine communities around the country after the closures. Prior to and up to this time, there had also been many believers who had taken monastic vows in secret and met with secret monastic communities that existed in Soviet cities.  Beginning on February 18, 1932 the state conducted a campaign that resulted in near-complete annihilation of all monasticism in the country.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Wynot 2002 p63"&gt;Jennifer Wynot. Monasteries without walls: secret monasticism in the Soviet Union, 1928–39. Church History 71.1 (March 2002): p63(17). (7266 words)&lt;/ref&gt; On that night all of the monks and nuns in Leningrad were arrested (a total of 316),&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Wynot. Monasteries without walls: secret monasticism in the Soviet Union, 1928–39. Church History 71.1 (March 2002): p. 63(17). (7266 words)&lt;/ref&gt; and the local prisons were filled to their limits in the subsequent period with the arrest of monks and nuns in Leningrad province.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 65"/&gt; In Ukraine, there may have been some survival of semi-overt monasticism into the later 1930s.

The NKVD Kul'tkommissiya, formed in 1931, was used as the chief instrument for legal supervision and forceful repression of religious communities over the next decade.&lt;ref name="John Anderson 1991 pp. 689-710"/&gt;

There was another lull after the 1932 campaign that ended when it re-intensified in 1934.

In 1934 the persecution of the Renovationist sect began to reach the proportions of the persecution of the old Orthodox church. This was triggered by a growing interest of Soviet youth in the Renovationist church.

German [[Lutheran]] communities began to experience the same level of persecution and anti-religious repression as other faith communities after 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In Moscow over 400 churches and monasteries were dynamited, including the famous [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Ekaterina V. "Russia's post-communist past: the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the re-imagining of national identity." History and Memory: Studies in Representation of the Past 21.1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oleschuk in 1938 accused the Church and clergy of misinterpreting the new Soviet Constitution's article 146, which allowed social and public organizations to put forward candidate for election to local soviets, by thinking that this meant the Church could put forward candidates. The supreme procurator [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] claimed that the only public organizations that were allowed to do this were those "whose aim is active participation in the socialist construction and in national defense".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 89"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The Church did not fall into either of these categories because it was considered anti-socialist and because Christianity taught to [[turn the other cheek]] and love one's enemies, which therefore meant Christians could not be good soldiers and defenders of the homeland.

A large body of Orthodox clergy were liquidated in [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] in 1938 for supposedly belonging to a network of subversive agents headed by Feofan Tuliakov, the Metropolitan of Gorky, Bishop Purlevsky of Sergach, Bishop Korobov of Vetluga and others. The network was allegedly trying to subvert collective farms and factories, destroy transportation, collect secret information for espionage and to create terrorist bands. They were alleged to have burned twelve houses of collective farmers, and to have cooperated with militantly atheistic Trotskyites and Bukharinites against the Soviet state. This guise served to cover mass executions of clergy.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 89"/&gt;

In the late 1930s being associated with the Church was dangerous. Even a brief visit to a church could mean loss of employment and irreparable career damage, expulsion from educational establishments and even to arrest. People who wore pectoral crosses underneath their clothing could be subject to persecution. People could be arrested for such things as having an icon in their home (the orthodox practice of kissing icons was blamed for an epidemic of [[syphilis]] &lt;ref name="Paul Froese 2004 pp. 35-50"/&gt;), inviting a priest to perform a religious rite or service at home since the local churches were closed. Priests caught performing such rites were often imprisoned and disappeared forever.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 90"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Massive numbers of believers were effectively imprisoned or executed for nothing except overtly witnessing their faith, especially if they were charismatic or of great stature and spiritual authority, because they were therefore undermining the antireligious propaganda.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 90"/&gt;

Exact figures of victims is difficult to calculate due to the nature of the campaign and may never be known with certainty. During the [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937 and 1938, church documents record that 168,300 Russian Orthodox clergy were arrested. Of these, over 100,000 were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|author=Alexander N.

A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; When including both religious (i.e., monks and nuns) and clergy, historian Nathaniel Davis estimates that 80,000 were killed by the end of the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Davis 2003"&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], the head of the Commission for Rehabilitating Victims of Political Repression (in the modern Russian government) has stated that the number of monks, nuns and priests killed in the purges is over 200,000.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Wynot 2002 p63"/&gt; About 600 bishops of both the Orthodox and the Renovationists were killed.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 68"/&gt; The number of laity killed likely greatly exceeds the number of clergy. Many thousands of victims of persecution became recognized in a special canon of saints known as the "new martyrs and confessors of Russia".

In the late 1930s when war was brewing Europe, the anti-religious propaganda carried the line that devout Christians could not make good soldiers because Christianity was anti-war, preached love of one's enemies, turning the other cheek, etc. This propaganda stood in sharp contradiction with the anti-religious propaganda that had been produced in the 1920s that blamed the church for preaching unqualified patriotism in World War I. To a lesser degree, it also differed from the criticism of Christians who had fought for Russia in World War I but who would not take up arms for the USSR.

Regarding the persecution of clergy, [[Michael Ellman]] has stated that "...the 1937–38 terror against the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church and of other religions (Binner &amp; Junge 2004) might also qualify as [[genocide]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/famine/ellman1933.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable atrocities and victims ==

As a result of the secrecy of the campaign, detailed and systematic information of all of the activities carried out by the state is not existent, as a result of this the information known about the victims and actions of this campaign is limited. However, there were a number of notable incidents that were largely recorded by the church.

Father Arkadii Ostal'sky was accused in 1922 of inciting the masses against the state. At his trial every witness refuted the charge, and the prosecution then argued that this number of witnesses was proof that the bishop was very popular and because he preached religion, which was harmful to the Soviet state, he ought to be condemned. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to ten years hard labour. After he returned early he was consecrated a bishop, but was then arrested and exiled to [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]] in 1931. He returned again in 1934 and then went into hiding, but he was caught and sent to another concentration camp. He was released shortly before the war broke out and was told by his camp administrator that he could have safety and job security if he agreed to remain in the area of the camps and give up the priesthood. He refused, and was then re-arrested and disappeared.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 74"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Alexander (Petrovsky) was consecrated in 1932 and appointed to [[Kharkiv]] by Sergii. In 1939 he was arrested without charge and he soon died in prison thereafter (it is unknown if this was a natural death or not). Afterwards the authorities decided to close the last functioning church in Kharkiv; this was carried out during Lent 1941 when the church was ordered to pay a tax of 125,000 roubles (the average annual wage at the time was 4,000 roubles). The money was collected and submitted, but the church was still shut down before Easter. At Easter a crowd of 8,000 people reportedly participated in a service carried out in the square in front of the church around priests dressed in civilian clothes and impromptu sang the hymn "Glory to Thy Passion, O Lord!" The same was repeated at the Easter Sunday service with an even larger crowd.

Metropolitan Konstantin (D'iakov) of [[Kiev]] was arrested in 1937 and shot in prison without trial twelve days later.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 74"/&gt;

Metropolitan Pimen (Pegov) of [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] was hated by the communists for his success in resisting the local [[Living Church|Renovationists]]; he was arrested on trumped-up charges of contacts with foreign diplomats and he died in prison in 1933.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 74"/&gt;

Bishop Maxim (Ruberovsky) returned from prison in 1935 to the city of [[Zhytomyr]], to where by 1937 almost all priests from Soviet [[Volhynia]] were sent (total of about 200). In August, all of them as well as the bishop were arrested; they were later shot in winter 1937 without trial. Afterwards the Soviet press accused them of subversive acts.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 74"/&gt;

Archbishop Antonii of [[Arkhangelsk]] was arrested in 1932. The authorities tried to force him to "confess" to his activities against the Soviet state, but he refused. He wrote in a written questionnaire given to him that he 'prayed daily that God forgive the Soviet Government for its sins and it stop shedding blood'. In prison he was tortured by being made to eat salty food without adequate drink and by restricting the oxygen in his dirty, crowded and unventilated cell; he contracted dysentery and died.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 75"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Metropolitan Serafim (Meshcheriakov) of [[Belorussia]] had been an active leader of the [[Living Church|Renovationists]] before he returned to the Orthodox church with much public penance, thus incurring the enmity of the Soviet state. Soon after his return, he was arrested in 1924 and exiled to Solovki. He was then re-arrested and shot without trial in [[Rostov-on-Don]] along with 122 other clergy and monks in 1932.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Wynot 2002 p63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 75"/&gt;

Metropolitan Nikolai of [[Rostov-on-Don]] was exiled without trial to [[Kazakhstan]], where he and other exiled clergy built huts out of clay and grass; they also ate grass to survive. In 1934 he was allowed to return to Rostov and to return to his post. He was re-arrested in 1938 and condemned to death by a firing squad. After being shot he was dumped in a mass open grave, but when believers came the next day they found that he was still alive, took him away and secretly took care of him. He served as Metropolitan of Rostov under the German occupation, and he evacuated to [[Romania]] as the Germans retreated. His subsequent fate is unknown.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 75"/&gt;

Bishop Onufrii (Gagliuk) of [[Elisavetgrad]] was arrested in 1924, without cause. He had returned to his post within a year. In 1927 he was re-arrested and exiled to [[Krasnoiarsk]] in [[Siberia]]. He returned and occupied two more Episcopal sees, but was re-arrested in the mid-1930s and deported beyond the Urals, where he was rumoured to have been shot in 1938.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 75"/&gt;

Bishop Illarion (Belsky) was exiled to Solovki from 1929–1935 in retaliation for his resistance to Sergii. He was re-arrested in 1938, for continuing to refuse to recognize Sergii and shot.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Varfolomei (Remov) was accused through information provided by own of his own pupils (future bishop Alexii (not the patriarch Alexii)) of having operated a secret theological academy and was shot in 1936.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 76"/&gt;

Bishop Maxim (Zhizhilenko) had worked as a transit prison medical doctor-surgeon for twenty-five years before he was consecrated as a bishop in 1928. His medical and humanitarian work had become famous, and he used to eat [[prison food]], sleep on bare boards and give away his salary to the prisoners he worked with. He was ordained a priest in secret after the revolution and he had reportedly converted many of the imprisoned to Christianity as well as performed pastoral functions and confessions for them. He broke with Sergii after 1927, and he was arrested in 1929. The regime was annoyed with him because he was a popular and outstanding medical doctor that had "deserted" them to the Church, he had been a charismatic bishop and he had chosen the most militantly anti-Sergiite faction (M. Joseph). He was described as a "confessor of apocalyptic mind".&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 77"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He had brought many parishes over from Sergii's faction to his and he had also introduced a prayer that would be introduced in many churches that called on Jesus to keep His word that the gates of hell would not overcome the church and He "grant those in power wisdom and fear of God, so that their hearts become merciful and peaceful towards the Church". He was executed in 1931.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 77"/&gt;

Fr. Roman Medved remained loyal to Sergii. He was arrested in 1931 because of his magnetic personality and acts of charity that were drawing people to religion. He had set up an unofficial church brotherhood in the 1920s that continued long after his death. He was released from his camp in 1936 because of ruined health and died within a year.

Fr Paul Florensky was one of the Orthodox church's greatest 20th century theologians. At the same time he was also a professor of electrical engineering at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, one of the top counsellors in the Soviet Central Office for the Electrification of the USSR, a musicologist and an art historian. In these fields he held official posts, gave lectures and published widely, while continuing to serve as a priest and he did not even remove his cassock or pectoral cross while lecturing at the university. This situation caused him to be arrested many times beginning in 1925. He was loyal to Sergii. His last arrest occurred in 1933 and he was sent to a concentration camp in the far north. He was given a laboratory at the camp and assigned to do research for the Soviet armed forces during the war. He died there in 1943.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 77"/&gt;

Valentin Sventsitsky was a journalist, a religious author and thinker of Christian-socialist leanings before 1917. Some of his writings had brought trouble from the tsarist police and he was forced to live abroad for a number of years. He returned after the revolution in 1917 and sought ordination in the Orthodox Church where he would become its champion apologist against the Renovationists. This caused him to be arrested and exiled in 1922. After his return he became a very influential priest in [[Moscow]] and formed parish brotherhoods for moral rebirth. In 1927 he broke with Sergii, and in 1928 he was exiled to Siberia, where he died in 1931. Before his death he repented of breaking with Sergii and asked to be reaccepted into the Orthodox Church, claiming that schism was the worst of all sins and that it separated one from the true Church; he also wrote a passionate appeal to his Moscow parishioners to return to Sergii and asked for them to forgive him for having led them in the wrong direction.

Alexander Zhurakovsky of Kiev, was a very influential priest with great love, respect and devotion of the faithful as well as charisma and good pastoral leadership. He joined the opposition to Sergii after the death of his diocesan bishop. Fr Zhurakovsky was arrested in 1930 and sent to ten years' hard labour. He suffered from TB and had been near the point of death in 1939 when he was sentenced to another ten years of hard labour without seeing freedom for a day. He died not long after in a distant northern camp.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergii Mechev of Moscow, another very influential priest with charisma and devotion recognized Sergii but refused to do public prayers for the Soviet government. He along with his father (also a priest) were prominent initiators of the semi-monastic church brotherhoods in Moscow. He was first arrested in 1922, and in 1929 he was administratively exiled for three years but released in 1933. In 1934 he was sentenced to fifteen years in a concentration camp in the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. When the Germans invaded in 1941, he as well as all prisoners of terms exceeding ten years were shot by the retreating Soviets.

Bishop Manuil (Lemeshevsky) of [[Leningrad]] had angered the government by his successful resistance to the Renovationists as early as the imprisoning of the Patriarch in 1922 when few were daring to declare public loyalty to him. Almost all of the parishes in Petrograd had been held by the Renovationists initially and he was responsible for bringing them back. He was arrested in 1923 and after spending almost a year in prison, he was sent on a three-year exile. He returned in 1927, but was not allowed to reside in Leningrad. He was appointed bishop of [[Serpukhov]]. He had been loyal to Sergii through the 1927 schism, but he found the new political line of the church to be too frustrating and he retired in 1929. He may have found it morally unbearable to be in the same city with bishop Maxim (mentioned above) in the opposing camp, especially after Maxim was arrested. He was sent on an administrative exile of three years to Siberia in 1933. After his return, he was rearrested in 1940 and charged with spreading religious propaganda among youth, and sentenced to ten years' hard labour. He was released in 1945 and made Archbishop of [[Orenburg]] where he achieved great success in reviving religious life, and as a result he was arrested again in 1948. He was released in 1955, and served as Archbishop of [[Cheboksary]] and Metropolitan of Kuibyshev. He died a natural death in 1968 at t age of 83. He had left a considerable volume of scholarly papers behind him, including a mult-volume "Who's Who" of Russian 20th century bishops. His case was significant because he survived the period and his many arrests, unlike many of his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky.

The young bishop Luka (Voino-Yasenetsky), a founder of the [[Tashkent university]] and its first professor of medicine, chief surgeon at the university and a brilliant sermonizer. He remained loyal to the Patriarch and he was first imprisoned in [[Tashkent]] in 1923, due to influence of the Renovationists who felt they could not compete with him. He was officially accused of treasonous ties to foreign agents in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]], and he was exiled to the distant northern-Siberian town of [[Eniseisk]] for three years. After he returned, he was arrested again in 1927 and exiled to Arkhangelsk without trial for another three years. He was loyal to Sergii. He was arrested again in 1937 and suffered his worst imprisonment in the subsequent years when he was tortured for two years (including beatings, interrogations that lasted for weeks, and food deprivation) in fruitless NKVD attempts to have him sign confessions. When this failed, he was deported to northern Siberia. In 1941 after the war broke out, his unique expertise in treating infected wounds caused the state to bring him to [[Krasnoyarsk]] and make him chief sturgeon at the main military hospital. He was honoured at a ceremony in December 1945 with a medal for service he had given to war medicine. During the service he criticized the regime for locking him for so many years and preventing him from exercising his talents to save more. He became archbishop of [[Tambov]] after the war. He was given the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1946 for his new and enlarged addition of his book on infected wounds; he donated the prize money to war orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; His case was also significant because of his survival.

Afanasii (Sakharov) a vicar-bishop of the [[Vladimir archdiocese]]. He was made a bishop in 1921 and from 1921–1954 he spent no more than 2 ½ years total performing Episcopal functions. He was arrested in 1922 in connection with the church valuables campaign and sentenced to one year in prison. He was arrested five more times in the next five years, involving short prison terms, exile and hard labour. He was told that he would be left alone if he simply retired or left his diocese, but refused to do so. He opposed the declaration of loyalty in 1927 and was sentenced to three years hard labour in [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]. He suffered seven more imprisonments and exiles between 1930–1946, mostly without formal indictments; his last arrest involved very hard manual labour. He was one of the most respected leaders in the underground church through the early 1940s, but he returned to the Patriarchal church with the election of Alexii in 1945, and he called on others in the underground church to follow his example and come back. He was not released, however, until 1954. After his release he claimed that his survival was thanks to the memory of faithful believers who had sent him parcels out of love. He died in 1962; his case was also notable because of his survival.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a highly revered convent near [[Kazan]] that had been closed in the late 1920s and the nuns were forced to resettle the nearby area privately. The community had broken with Sergii. The authorities permitted the main local cathedral to open once a year on February 14, when the former monks, nuns and laity came to it and had services. On February 14, 1933, during the service, a huge armed NKVD detachment surrounded the church and arrested everyone leaving it. Two months later ten of them were executed and most of the others were sent to concentration camps for five to ten years. They were charged with participating in an unregistered church service.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of geologists in the Siberian Taiga in the summer of 1933 had camped in the vicinity of a concentration camp. While they were there, they witnessed a group of prisoners being led forth by camp guards to a freshly dug ditch. When the guards saw the geologists they explained that the prisoners were priests and therefore opposed to the Soviet government, and the geologists were asked to go away. The geologists went to nearby tents and from there they witnessed that the victims were told that if they denied God's existence they would be allowed to live. Every priest, one after the other, then repeated the answer "God exists" and was individually shot. This was repeated sixty times.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky.

Fr Antonii Elsner-Foiransky-Gogol was a priest in [[Smolensk]] who was arrested in 1922 and exiled for three years. In 1935 his church was closed and he moved to a nearby village. In 1937 there were only two churches left in Smolensk, and one of them had no priest, and so they asked Fr Antonii to become their pastor. He agreed, but when several thousand people then petitioned to begin services again with Fr Antonii as their priest, the local NKVD refused and warned Fr Antonii that he would suffer consequences. The petitions reached the government in Moscow and received a positive reply. The church was therefore then set to commence services with their new priest on July 21, 1937, but in the night before that date Fr Antonii was arrested. He was shot on August 1.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 83"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1934, three priests and two laypeople were taken out of their special regime [[Kolyma camp]] to the local OGPU administration. They were asked to renounce their faith in Jesus, and were warned that if they did not do so they would be killed. They then declared their faith, and without any formal charges, they were then taken to a freshly dug grave and four of them were shot, while one was spared and instructed to bury the others.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 83"/&gt;

In the end of the 1930s there was only church open in Kharkiv. The authorities refused to grant registration for priests to serve in it. Fr Gavriil was a priest in Kharkiv, and on Easter in what may have been 1936, he felt compelled to go to the church and serve the Resurrection Vigil. He disappeared after this and no one saw him again.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Poltava]] all the remaining clergy were arrested during the night of 26–27 February 1938. Their relatives were told that all of them were sentences to ten years without the right to correspond, which was a euphemism for the death sentence.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 84"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky.

The Elder Sampson had converted from Anglicanism to Orthodoxy at the age of 14. He received a degree in medicine and a theological education, and in 1918 he joined a monastic community near [[Petrograd]]. In the same year, he was arrested and taken to a mass execution where he survived by being wounded and covered up with the other bodies. He was rescued by fellow monks from the heap. He later became a priest. In 1929 he was arrested again and was released in 1934. He was arrested again in 1936 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He served these years as a prison doctor in Central Asia, and for this reason the authorities did not wish to release him due to the need for his service when his term came to an end in 1946. He escaped and wandered through the desert, while successfully avoiding capture. He went on to do pastoral work without any legal papers. He died in 1979, and was remembered as a saint by those who knew him.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 84"/&gt;

Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was a medical doctor and this assisted his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners to be allowed to stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of [[Penza]] who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Riaza]]n bishop was arrested with a priest and deacon in 1935 for supposedly stealing {{convert|130|kg|0|abbr=on}} of silver.

Bishop Dometian (Gorokhov) was tried in 1932 for black marketing and for writing anti-Bolshevik leaflets in 1928. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to eight years' imprisonment. In 1937 he may have been executed after accusations of organizing young people for espionage and terrorism.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 88"/&gt;

A bishop of [[Ivanovo]] was alleged to run a military espionage network composed of young girls who formed his church choir. This was despite the fact that Ivanovo had no military value and was a textile producing town.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 88"/&gt; There had, however, been vigorous protests in Ivanovo against the church closures in 1929-1930.&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"/&gt; The purpose of the obviously false allegations may have been meant to relate the message not to associate with clergy or join church choirs if one wanted to avoid arrest and execution.

Renovationist M. Serafim (Ruzhentsov) was alleged to have led a subversive espionage network of monks and priests, who used altars for orgies and raped teenage girls that they infected with venereal disease. Metropolitan Evlogii in [[Paris]] was alleged to have run a band of terrorists in Leningrad run by an archpriest. The Kazan Archbishop Venedict (Plotnikov) was executed in 1938, for allegedly running a group of church terrorists and spies.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 page 88"/&gt;

== Foreign criticism ==

Many protests occurred in Western countries against the wild persecutions in the USSR, and there were mass public prayers in the United Kingdom, Rome and other places on behalf of the persecuted Church. These activities contributed greatly to the temporary halt in persecution in the early years of the 1930s and to the decision to run the anti-religious terror campaign covertly; Stalin could not afford total alienation of the West as he still needed its credits and machines for industrialization.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 65"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky.

== Resolution of debate ==

The ongoing debate between the "rightist" and "leftist" sides of how to best combat religion found some resolution by 1930. The journal ''Under the Banner of Marxism'', edited by [[Abram Deborin]], proclaimed victory of the leftist side of the debate in 1929, but it was a year later withdrawn from publication until February 1931, when an editorial appeared in it that condemned both the rightist thinking and the Deborin group. The journal was criticized for failing to become "the organ of militant atheism" as Lenin had ordered by being too philosophical and abstract in argumentation, as well as detached from the real anti-religious struggle.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 43"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the purges that characterized the 1930s as well as Stalin's efforts to submit all marxist institutions to himself. Marxist leaders who took either position on this issue would find themselves attacked by a paranoid Stalin who did not tolerate other authorities to speak as authorities on public policy.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 43"/&gt;

Trotsky, Bukharin and other "traitors" were condemned as well as their ideas on the antireligious struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drop in enthusiasm for the anti-religious campaign ==

The failure of the propaganda war was evident in the increasing reliance on terror tactics by the regime in the antireligious campaign in the 1930s. However, by the end of the decade it may have become apparent to the leadership of the antireligious campaign that the previous two decades of experience had shown that religion was a much deeper rooted phenomena than originally thought.

Anti-religious museums began to be closed in the late 1930s and chairs of "scientific atheism" were abolished in universities. The average figures for those who attended atheist lectures was dropping to less than 50 per lecture by 1940.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 65"/&gt; The circulation of anti-religious journals was dropping as was membership in the League of the Militant Godless. There are different reasons that may have caused this, including some moral alienation of people from the brutality of the campaign as well as the fact that the centralized terror did not have much tolerance for autonomous organizations, and even those who worked for anti-religious purposes could find themselves criticized in the campaign or subject to purge for deviating from the established line. Stalin's mind may have changed as well; he may have lost patience with the campaign, alternatively he may have thought that it had reached its goals once organized religion had ceased to exist in any public way throughout the country or he may have thought that the looming war clouds needed a more unified country.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 65"/&gt;
The leadership may also have concluded that a long-term, deep, insistent and patient persuasion would be needed in light of religion's perseverance.

In 1937, Grekulov, a Soviet historian published an article in an official journal that praised Russia's conversion to Christianity in the 10th century as a means that culture and learning entered the country. This was in contrast to years earlier when the League of the Militant Godless had attacked school teachers who claimed that the church benefitted Russia in this way. What Grekulov wrote would become the official Soviet position until the fall of communism.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 65"/&gt;

Even still, the persecution continued full swing and the clergy were attacked as foreign spies in the late 1930s and trials of bishops were conducted with their clergy as well as lay adherents who were reported as "subversive terroristic gangs" that had been unmasked.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 66"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone was changing at that point though, especially following the annexation of the new territories in eastern Poland in 1939, as party leaders, such as Oleschuk, began to claim that only a tiny minority of religious believers were class enemies of state.  Church institutions in Eastern Poland were abolished or taken over by the state.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987"/&gt; The anti-religious work in the new territories was even criticized for being too zealous and Oleschuk advised against setting up new LMG cells in the territories.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 page 66"/&gt; When the Nazis invaded in 1941, the secret police rounded up many Ukrainian catholic priests who were either murdered or sent into internal exile.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987"/&gt;

Official Soviet figures reported that up to one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 (a decrease from estimated 80% of the country being religious in the late 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study.  University of New York Press, 1978, pp47&lt;/ref&gt;); altogether this made up 50% of the state's population (and even these figures may have been low estimates). However, religion had been hit very powerfully; the number of churches had been reduced from 50,000 in 1917 to only a few hundred (and there was not a single church open in Belarus)&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 13&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps even less,&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years.  ME Sharpe inc., 2002 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; out of 300 bishops in 1917 (and 163 in 1929) only 4 remained (Metropolitan Sergii (the head of the church), Metropolitan Alexii of Leningrad, Bishop Nikolai (Yarushevich), and Metropolitan Sergi (Voskresenski)),&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Davis 2003"/&gt; out of 45,000 priests there were only to 2,000–3,000 remaining, not a single monastery remained open&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp4&lt;/ref&gt; and the only thing that enthusiasts of atheism could still do was to spy on individual believers and denounce them to the secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 600 religious communities in Moscow in 1917, and only 20–21 of these still existed by 1939. In Leningrad, where there had been 401 Orthodox churches in 1918, there were only five remaining. Belgorod and district, which had 47 churches and 3 monasteries in 1917 had only 4 churches left by 1936. Novgorod, which had 42 churches and 3 monasteries in 1917 had only 15 churches by 1934. Kuibyshev and its diocese, which had 2200 churches, mosques and other temples in 1917 had only 325 by 1937. The number of registered religious communities by 1941 had dropped to 8000 (of which the vast majority were present in the newly annexed western territories).&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Proportionally more churches had been closed in rural areas than in cities.&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"/&gt; All religions in the country by the end of the 1930s had had most of their buildings either confiscated or destroyed, and most of their clerical leadership arrested or dead.&lt;ref name="John Anderson 1991 pp. 689-710"/&gt;

The anti-religious campaign of the past decade and the terror tactics of the militantly atheist regime, had effectively eliminated all public expressions of religion and communal gatherings of believers outside of the walls of the few churches (or mosques, synagogues, etc.) that still held services.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished in a country that only a few decades earlier had had a deeply Christian public life and culture that had developed for almost a thousand years.

A '''Verbandsgemeinde''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐ̯ˈbantsɡəˌmaɪndə}}; plural '''Verbandsgemeinden''') is a low-level [[administrative division|administrative unit]] in the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|federal states]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. A Verbandsgemeinde is typically composed of a small group of villages or towns. 

==Rhineland-Palatinate==

The state of Rhineland-Palatinate is divided into 163 Verbandsgemeinden, which are municipal associations grouped within the 24 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] of the state and subdivided into 2,257 '''Ortsgemeinden''' (singular '''Ortsgemeinde''') which comprise single settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mwIamd0mfnMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=163+Verbandsgemeinde&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbw6an65zTAhXEIMAKHT0WCfgQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=163%20Verbandsgemeinde&amp;f=false|title=Sportförderung und Sportpolitik in der Kommune|last=Eckl|first=Stefan|date=2007-01-01|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=|isbn=9783825801205|location=|pages=115|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Verbandsgemeinden were established in 1969. Formerly the name of the administrative units was ''[[Amt (political division)|Amt]]''. Most of the functions of municipal government for several municipalities are consolidated and administered centrally from a larger or more central town or municipality among the group, while the individual municipalities (Ortsgemeinden) still maintain a limited degree of local autonomy.

==Saxony-Anhalt==
The 11 districts of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] are divided into ''[[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft]]en'' and, since 1 July 2009 also ''Verbandsgemeinden''. Since the January 2010 government reform, there are 18 ''Verbandsgemeinden'' in Saxony-Anhalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EvVkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=18+Verbandsgemeinde+Sachsen-Anhalt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOmPWA-pzTAhWEDsAKHYDkB-wQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=18%20Verbandsgemeinde%20Sachsen-Anhalt&amp;f=false|title=Die Struktur der Gemeinden im kreisangehörigen Raum: Vergleichend dargestellt am Beispiel des Kreises Euskirchen und des Landkreises Vulkaneifel|last=Ammermann|first=Joachim|date=2012-01-01|publisher=BWV Verlag|year=|isbn=9783830528210|location=|pages=185|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
