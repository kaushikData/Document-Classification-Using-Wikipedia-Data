The '''A338''' is a major primary route in southern [[England]], that runs from the junction with the [[A35 road (Great Britain)|A35]] at [[Poole]] in [[Dorset]] to the junction with the [[A420 road|A420]] at [[Besselsleigh]] in [[Oxfordshire]], a distance of {{convert|84|mi}}.

==Route==
The road begins on the edge of Poole by the border with [[Bournemouth]], before heading northward as a [[Grade separation|grade separated]] [[dual carriageway]], one of the main roads in the [[South East Dorset conurbation]]. From near [[Bournemouth Airport|Bournemouth International Airport]] it follows the western side of the [[River Avon, Hampshire|Avon]] valley, [[concurrency (road)|joining the route]] of the [[A31 road]] heading north-east for {{convert|1+1/2|mi}} to cross the valley, before turning left at [[Ringwood]] in [[Hampshire]] where it joins the original, [[single carriageway]] route to the east of the river. 

Heading northward up the east side of the Avon, it crosses to the west again near the town of [[Fordingbridge]]. After crossing into [[Wiltshire]] near [[Downton, Wiltshire|Downton]], it meets the [[A354 road]] at a roundabout near [[Britford]] on the southern outskirts of [[Salisbury]], before joining the route of the [[A36 road]] as it bypasses the city centre to dual carriageway standard. It then joins the [[A30 road]] at St. Mark's Roundabout, before separating in a north-easterly direction to follow the entire length of the [[River Bourne, Wiltshire|River Bourne]]. It has a grade-separated junction with the main [[A303 road]] and then passes through the town of [[Tidworth]]. From there the road travels north to [[Collingbourne Ducis]], where it twists through the village around the church to a mini-roundabout.  It turns right to continue northwards alongside the Bourne through another narrow stretch at [[Collingbourne Kingston]] to another mini-roundabout before again heading north. 

Near [[Burbage, Wiltshire|Burbage]] the continued route north to [[Swindon]] is designated [[A346 road|A346]], the A338 turning off to the right at a roundabout and heading east then north-east and crossing the border into [[Berkshire]]. It passes through the town of [[Hungerford]], where it meets the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4 road]] (to [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]). It meets the [[M4 motorway]] at junction 14, passes through the village of [[Great Shefford]] and crosses into [[Oxfordshire]]. It goes through [[Wantage]] where it meets the [[A417 road]], and past the villages of [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]], [[Hanney|East Hanney]] and [[Frilford]]. It terminates at its junction with the [[A420 road]] near [[Bessels Leigh]], {{convert|6|mi}} south-west of [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A338|title=A338|last1=Cobb|first1=Jim|last2= |first2= |date=31 May 2012|work= |publisher=The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The section of the A338 south of the A31 to the west of the Avon consists mostly of a relatively newly built road. Part is constructed along the trackbed of the former [[Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway]] which closed in 1935. Originally, the A338 went from Ringwood to [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] on the east side of the valley, along what is now the B3347.

===Central Bournemouth speed limit===
The Bournemouth Town Centre section of the A338 Wessex Way is carried on viaducts across the Bourne Valley. On 21 January 2010 Bournemouth Borough Council imposed a 40&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit on this section of A338 dual carriageway (between Bournemouth West Roundabout and St Paul's Roundabout) in an attempt to reduce the accident rate of 198 accidents in four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/News/features/Experimental40mph.asp|title=WESSEX WAY EXPERIMENTAL 40 MPH SPEED LIMIT|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=13 January 2010|work= |publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100124085236/http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/News/features/Experimental40mph.asp|archivedate  =24 January 2010|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental speed limit was run for six months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Library/PDF/Residents/Roads/2010/Highways_Consultation/WessexWay40mph.pdf|title= SPEED LIMIT ORDER|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=7 January 2010|work= |publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100215192208/http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Library/PDF/Residents/Roads/2010/Highways_Consultation/WessexWay40mph.pdf|archivedate=15 February 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provoked fierce opposition from the town's residents, with a protest group on Facebook gaining thousands of members who argued that other options such as improving the slip-road lengths should have been trialled before lowering the speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisdorset.net/news/tidnews/4886803.Thousands_join_campaign_to_ditch_new_40mph_limit_on_Wessex_Way |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211150057/http://www.thisisdorset.net/news/tidnews/4886803.Thousands_join_campaign_to_ditch_new_40mph_limit_on_Wessex_Way/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 February 2010 |title=Thousands join Facebook campaign to ditch new 40mph limit |last1=Reader |first1=Jane |last2= |first2= |date=3 February 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] |accessdate=16 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repair work and funding===
{{Update|reason=Major maintenance has been performed 2015-16 |date=July 2017}}
In February 2011 it was announced that £20m of funding for repair works on the {{convert|6.5|mi}} stretch south of the junction with the A31 was turned down by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Transport, http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/ltp/major/transportschemesupdate/pdf/transportschemesupdate.pdf{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorset County Council had planned to start work in September 2010, but had to await funding following a [[Spending Review]].  As a result of the funding request being unsuccessful, ad hoc work will now be carried out over a number of years instead of a period of about 6 months as originally planned.  Dorset and Bournemouth councils are expected to meet the cost of the ad hoc work at around £1m per year.&lt;ref&gt;DorsetForYou.com (Partnership of several Dorset councils), {{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/394920 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105205723/http://www.dorsetforyou.com/394920 |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ringwood to Salisbury upgrade campaign==
The section of A338 between the A31 dual carriageway at Ringwood and Salisbury's A36 Churchill Way is built on a substandard single carriageway alignment with multiple sharp bends as the road follows the line of the River Avon. This section of the road has a poor safety record; it is heavily trafficked and the resulting risky overtaking is responsible for a number of head-on collisions.

Following four fatal head-on collision accidents in 2008 alone, local residents have renewed their calls for the road to be upgraded to dual carriageway to provide a safe overtaking facility and deal with the capacity problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/3855594.HOW_MANY_MUST_DIE_ON_A338|title=How many must die on A338?|last1=Codd|first1=Joanna|last2= |first2= |date=18 November 2008|work= |publisher=[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]]|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The A338 figures in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s '[[Jude the Obscure]]', chapter 3. The point where the road crests the downs before beginning the steep drop into Wantage ('Alfredston') is the spot where young Jude stands one evening and looks out for the first time on Oxford ('Christminster').&lt;ref&gt;DI Rosie Blanchard, http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A338&lt;/ref&gt;

'''President Pedro Aguirre Cerda Station''' was a Chilean Antarctic base, located at [[Pendulum Cove]] in Deception Island in the [[South Shetland Islands]], inaugurated in 1955  The same year, the [[Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition]] was established at Deception Island to help the survey of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], operating aircraft from [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd]].

==History==
The Station was inaugurated on February 12, 1955 by the Defence Minister of Chile Tobías Barros Ortiz, when at that time the Commodore Jorge Gándara was in charge of the Chilean Air Force. The base was first designated with the name of the then President [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], but after the inauguration received the name of the former president [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], in gratitude to his disposal of the decree that defined the [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] in 1940.
The research  was carried out to volcanology, climatology and meteorology. Since 1965, a weather office was in operation in order to elaborate national and international meteorological forecasts.

The base operation ended violently and definitively on December 4, 1967 when a volcanic eruption destroyed it. It was abandoned evacuating the 16 men who made up its endowment. New volcanic eruptions in 1969 and 1970 affected again the structures of the base.
The ruins of the base, including its meteorological and volcanological center, were declared in 2001 as [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica]] N° 76 under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]], on the proposal and preservation of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Presidente_Pedro_Aguirre_Cerda | title = Base Presidente Pedro Aguirre Cerda | website = Wikipedia Espanol | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate = September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gutiérrez Vargas Refuge==
The Gutiérrez Vargas Refuge, so called in memory of the aviation Captain who died on December 30, 1955, was located at {{convert|1|km}} from Aguirre Cerda Station and was inaugurated on February 12, 1956. Its purpose was to serve as a refuge for the members of the Station in case of fire.
On December 4, 1967, the refuge was definitively abandoned, as was the Aguirre Cerda Station, due to a violent volcanic eruption. The poor remains of the refuge structure can still be seen on the beach where it was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugio_Cabo_Guti%C3%A9rrez_Vargas | title = Refugio Cabo Gutiérrez Vargas | website = Wikipedia Espanol | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate = September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">The '''Atlas of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|L'Atlas du Canada}}) is an online [[atlas]] published by [[Natural Resources Canada]] that has information on every [[city]], [[town]], [[village]], and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in [[Canada]]. It was originally a print atlas, with its first edition being published in 1906 by geographer [[James White (geographer)|James White]] and a team of 20 [[cartographer]]s. Much of the geospatial data used in the atlas is available for download and commercial re-use from the Atlas of Canada site or from [[GeoGratis]]. Information used to develop the atlas is used in conjunction with information from [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] to produce collaborative continental-scale tools such as the [[North American Environmental Atlas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">The '''Cenas tīrelis''' is a [[bog]] located in the municipalities of [[Mārupe Municipality|Marupe]], [[Babīte Municipality|Babite]] and [[Olaine Municipality|Olaine]], approximately 30 kilometers west of [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]. It is a [[Natura 2000]] protected site and one of Latvia's 261 [[Nature reserve|nature reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daba.gov.lv/public/lat/iadt/dabas_liegumi/cenas_tirelis/|title=Dabas aizsardzības pārvalde|website=www.daba.gov.lv|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed 5000 years ago. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atputasbazes.lv/lv/apskates_objekti/460_dabas_liegums_cenas_tirelis_purva_laipa_skatu_tornis/|title=Dabas liegums „Cenas tīrelis” (purva laipa, skatu tornis) :: Atputasbazes.lv|last=atputasbazes.lv|website=www.atputasbazes.lv|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bog has a total size of 6,000 ha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rigasmezi.lv/lv/mezi/par_meziem___fakti_/atputas_iespejas/?doc=1314|title=Cenas tīreļa purva taka, Rīgas meži|last=www.efumo.lv|website=www.rigasmezi.lv|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly occupied by the nature reserve and an active [[peat extraction]] site. The Cenas tirelis bog is the second largest peatland in Latvia, after the [[Teiči Nature Reserve]], which has a total size of 19,779 ha. The "[[Skaista ezers]]", which is Latvian for "Beautiful Lake" is also located within the nature reserve. 

In 2007 a [[trail]] of wooden planks was built in the southern area of the reserve. It leads from the end of the peat extraction area in a circle and has a total length of 5 kilometers. On the widest point away from the start, close to an old military road from [[World War I|WW1]], a [[Bird watching towers|bird watching tower]] and picnic tables can be found. Along the way, several information boards explain about the resident flora and fauna as well as about the peat industry in Latvia and the world in Latvian and English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celotajs.lv/en/e/service/list/cenastirelis/all|title=Cenas tirelis - Specializations|last=Celotajs|first=LLTA Lauku|website=www.celotajs.lv|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to those information boards, peat is still used as energy source in Latvia and accounts for around 1% of the total [[energy mix]]. 

The reserve is home to several special of animals, including 10 protected bird species in Latvia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latvia.travel/lv/apskates-vieta/cenas-tirela-purva-laipa|title=Cenas tīreļa purva laipa {{!}} Latvia Travel|website=www.latvia.travel|language=lv|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common resting place for several [[Goose|geese]] and [[Crane (bird)|cranes]].

{{Politics of the United States}}
In the [[United States]] the term “[[deep state]]” is used in political messaging to describe a controversial belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/leaks-trump-deep-state-fbi-cia-michael-flynn|title=The 'deep state' is real.

The term was originally coined in a somewhat pejorative sense to refer to similar relatively invisible state apparatus in [[Turkey]] and [[post-Soviet Russia]], where the Turkish military colluded with drug traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;The State: Past, Present, Future&lt;/ref&gt;
With respect to the United States, the concept has been discussed in numerous published works by [[Marc Ambinder]], [[David W. Brown]], [[Peter Dale Scott]], [[Mike Lofgren]], {{ill|Kevin Shipp|sv}}, [[Michael Tomasky]] and [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

While definitions vary, the term gained popularity among various groups, primarily supporters of [[Donald Trump]], during the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], in opposition to [[The Establishment|establishment]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates. Following Trump's inauguration, the term was widely adopted among Republicans alleging that there exists a deep-state conspiracy to delegitimize the presidency and thwart its policy goals.&lt;ref name="NY Times2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/americas/deep-state-leaks-trump.html|title=As Leaks Multiply, Fears of a 'Deep State' in America|last1=Taub|first1=Amanda|date=February 16, 2017|work=The New York Times|last2=Fisher|first2=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
{{Main|Deep state}}
According to the journalist Robert Worth, "The expression ''deep state'' had originated in Turkey in the 1990s, where the military colluded with [[drug trafficking|drug traffickers]] and hit men to wage a dirty war against Kurdish insurgents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS|date=2016|publisher=Pan Macmillan|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO4L2trp7OAhWo5IMKHRzTD0cQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Concealment of the State'', Professor Jason Royce Lindsey argues that even without a conspiratorial agenda, the term ''deep state'' is useful for understanding aspects of the [[Military-industrial complex|national security establishment]] in developed countries, with emphasis on the United States. Lindsey writes that the deep state draws power from the national security and intelligence communities, a realm where secrecy is a source of power.&lt;ref&gt;[The Concealment of the State] Jason Royce Lindsey, 2013 pages 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. McCoy]] states that the increase in the power of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence community]] since the [[September 11 attacks]] "has built a fourth branch of the U.S. government" that is "in many ways autonomous from the executive, and increasingly so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jeremy Scahill|last=Scahill|first=Jeremy|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/07/22/donald-trump-and-the-coming-fall-of-american-empire/|title=Donald Trump and the Coming Fall of the American Empire|website=[[The Intercept]]|date=July 22, 2017|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA Law]] professor Jon D. Michaels discusses Trump and the deep state, and argues that the concept's relevance is quite limited in the United States. He states that it is a more useful perspective in the study of developing governments such as Egypt, Pakistan and [[Deep state in Turkey|Turkey]], "where shadowy elites in the military and government ministries have been known to countermand or simply defy democratic directives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jon D.|last=Michaels|title=Trump and the "Deep State"|magazine=Foreign Affairs|date=September–October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Gergen]], quoted in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, the term has been appropriated by [[Steve Bannon]] and ''[[Breitbart News]]'' and other supporters of the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] in order to delegitimize the critics of the current presidency.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abramson|first1=Alana|title=President Trump's Allies Keep Talking About the 'Deep State.'

Former NSA leaker [[Edward Snowden]] has used the term generally to refer to the influence of [[United States federal civil service|civil servants]] over elected officials: "the deep state is not just the intelligence agencies, it is really a way of referring to the career bureaucracy of government. These are officials who sit in powerful positions, who don't leave when presidents do, who watch presidents come and go...they influence policy, they influence presidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2018/03/19/news/snowden_how_the_deep_state_shapes_presidents_-191619170|title=Edward Snowden: "Poisoning people who are long out of their service is contemptible"|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion piece by linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], he said the "deep state" is an "elastic label — depending on the occasion" and its "story conforms to the intricate grammar of those conspiracy narratives." He also contrasted the change in the "twin bogeys of conservative rhetoric", from bureaucratic "meddlesome bunglers" of "[[big government]]" to "conniving ideologues" who "orchestrates complex schemes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/09/633019635/opinion-why-the-term-deep-state-speaks-to-conspiracy-theorists|title=Opinion: Why The Term 'Deep State' Speaks To Conspiracy Theorists|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "deep state" has been associated with the "[[military–industrial complex]]" by several of the authors on the subject. Potential risks from the military-industrial complex were raised in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s 1961 [[Eisenhower's farewell address|farewell address]]: "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ike.htm|title=Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation|website=mcadams.posc.mu.edu|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lofgren has claimed the military-industrial complex is the private part of the deep state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mikelofgren.net/how-the-powers-that-be-maintain-the-deep-state/|title="Deep State" Truthout Interview -|date=February 22, 2016|access-date=August 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Marc Ambinder]] has suggested that a myth about the "deep state" is that it functions as one entity; in reality, he states, "the deep state contains multitudes, and they are often at odds with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-deep-state/2017/03/10/ddb09b54-04da-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html|title=Five myths about the deep state|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|date=March 10, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 9, 2017|last2=Ambinder|first2=Marc|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tufts University]] professor [[Michael J. Glennon]] claimed that President [[Barack Obama]] did not succeed in resisting and/or changing what he calls the "double government"; the defense and national security network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/18/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL/story.html|title=Vote all you want. The secret government won't change. - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|date=October 18, 2014|access-date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fdmedia.org/background_briefing/march-12-2017/|title=Background Briefing with Ian Masters|work=FD Media|access-date=August 22, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lofgren felt Obama was pushed into the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)#2009 Increase in U.S. troops|Afghanistan "surge" in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/|title=Essay: Anatomy of the Deep State|last=Lofgren|first=Mike|date=February 21, 2014|website=BillMoyers.com|access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major campaign promise Obama made was the closure of [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay Prison Camp]], which he was unable to accomplish. This has been attributed indirectly to the influence of a deep state.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

President Donald Trump supporters use the term to refer to allegations that intelligence officers and [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] officials guide policy through [[news leak|leaking]] or other internal means.&lt;ref name="WaPo Ishaan"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Is Trump fighting the deep state or creating his own? |author=Ishaan Tharoor |date=February 1, 2017 |journal=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/01/is-trump-fighting-the-deep-state-or-creating-his-own/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt; According to a July 2017 report by the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]], "the Trump administration was being hit by national security leaks 'on a nearly daily basis' and at a far higher rate than its predecessors encountered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Michael|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/deep-state-real-cia-fbi-intelligence-215537|title=The Deep State Is Real|website=[[Politico#Politico Magazine|Politico Magazine]]|date=September–October 2017|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in comments on the "deep state"-like influence allegedly wielded by career military officers such as [[H. R. McMaster]], [[John F. Kelly|John Kelly]] and [[James Mattis]] in the Trump administration.

== Polls ==
According to a poll of Americans in April 2017, about half (48%) thought there was a "deep state" (meaning "military, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly manipulate government"), while about a third (35%) of all participants thought it was a conspiracy theory and the remainder (17%) had no opinion. Of those who believe a "deep state" exists, more than half (58%) said it was a major problem, a net of 28% of those surveyed.&lt;ref name="ABC_47032061"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lies-damn-lies-deep-state-plenty-americans-poll/story?id=47032061|title=Nearly half of Americans think there's a 'deep state' in US: Poll|last=News|first=A.

A March 2018 poll found most respondents (63%) were unfamiliar with the term "deep state", but a majority believe that a deep state likely exists in the United States when described as "a group of unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or direct national policy".

[[File:Deer park, Powderham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1416619.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fallow deer]] in the park of [[Powderham Castle]], Devon]]

In [[Middle ages|medieval]] and [[Early Modern period|Early Modern]] [[Kingdom of England|England]], a '''deer park''' was an enclosed area containing deer. It was bounded by a ditch and bank with a wooden park [[Palisade|pale]] on top of the bank, or by a stone or brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;Dry stone wall at [[Dyrham Park]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ditch was on the inside&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland150&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J. M. Dent]] &amp; Sons Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-460-04183-5 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the effective height. Some parks had deer "leaps", where there was an external ramp and the inner ditch was constructed on a grander scale, thus allowing deer to enter the park but preventing them from leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NEW Reading the Landscape|first=Richard|last=Muir|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=200|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some deer parks were established in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon era]] and are mentioned in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]]; these were often called hays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Sykes| first1 = Naomi  | editor-last=Liddiard  | editor-first=Robert  | year = 2007  | chapter = Animal Bones and Animal Parks | title = The Medieval Park: New Perspectives  |  publisher = Windgather Press  | location= Macclesfield, UK  | ISBN = 9781905119165 | page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] seized existing game reserves. Deer parks flourished and proliferated under the Normans,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Deer Park |volume=7 |page=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a forerunner of the deer parks that became popular among England's landed gentry. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records thirty-six of them.

Initially the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] maintained an exclusive right to keep and hunt deer and established [[Royal forest|forest law]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm Forests and Chases of England and Wales: A Glossary.] St John's College, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In due course they also allowed members of the nobility and senior clergy to maintain deer parks. At their peak at the turn of the 14th century, deer parks may have covered 2% of the land area of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Rackham| first1 = Oliver  | editor-last=  | editor-first= | year = 2003  | chapter = Wood-Pasture | title = The Illustrated History of the Countryside  |  publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson  | location= London, UK  | ISBN = 9780297843351 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James I of England|James I]] was an enthusiast for hunting but it became less fashionable and popular after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. The number of deer parks then declined, contemporary books documenting other more profitable uses for such an estate.&lt;ref&gt;An example is the planting for woods for firewood and shipbuilding in John Evelyn's ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber]]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century many deer parks were landscaped, where deer then became optional within larger country parks, several of which were created or enlarged from wealth from trade and colonization in the [[British Empire]]. These later mostly gave way to profitable agriculture dependent on crop prices, with large parts of the workforce having been attracted elsewhere following increasing [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]]. This created pressure to sell off parts or divide such estates while rural population growth pushed up poor law rates (particularly [[outdoor relief]] and the [[Labour Rate]]) and urban poverty led to the introduction of lump sum [[capital (economics)|capital taxation]] such as [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|inheritance tax]] and a shift in power away from the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estate Landscapes: Design, Improvements and Power in the Post-Medieval Landscape| editor1-last=Finch|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last= Giles|editor2-first=Kate|year= 2007|publisher= Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge and New York |pages=19–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer parks are notable landscape features in their own right.  However, where they have survived into the 20th century, the lack of ploughing or development has often preserved other features within the park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beresford |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Beresford |title=History on the Ground |origyear=1957 |year=1998 |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7509-1884-5 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Tumulus|barrows (tumuli)]], [[Roman road]]s and [[abandoned village#United Kingdom|abandoned village]]s.

==Status==
To establish a deer park a royal licence was required, known as a "licence to empark"&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;—especially if the park was in or near a royal forest. Because of their cost and exclusivity, deer parks became status symbols. Deer were almost all kept within exclusive reserves with the larger ones often used as aristocratic playgrounds, for hunting, often with deer being driven into nets; and, there was no legitimate market for [[venison]] without an established provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=The History of the Countryside |origyear=1975 |year=1997|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Giant Paperback]] |location= |isbn= |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ability to eat venison or give it to others was also a status symbol. Consequently, many deer parks were maintained for the supply of venison, rather than hunting the deer. Small deer parks which functioned primarily as household larders were attached to many smaller manors, such as at [[Umberleigh]] in Devon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) ''The Lisle Letters'', 6 vols., University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Owners would grant to their friends or to others to whom they owed a favour, a signed warrant for a specified number of deer, usually one only, specified as buck or doe, which the recipient would present to the park keeper who would select and kill one and hand the carcass to the grantee. The [[Lisle Papers]] dating from the 1530s contains many such letters from prospective grantees requesting such gifts from the park of [[Honor Grenville]], the lady of the manor of [[Umberleigh]] in Devon, and also contains reports to her from her [[bailiff]] listing grants of venison made from her park during the past year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Such grants acted as common features of the mediaeval social machinery.

==Licence to empark==
[[File:DyrhamLicence1511.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal licence to empark Dyrham granted by King Henry VIII to Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533), [[Esquire of the Body]], 5 June 1511. Appended is a rare perfect example of the Great Seal of Henry VIII. Collection of Dyrham Park, National Trust]]

King Henry VIII appointed Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533) an [[Esquire of the Body]] at some date before 5 June 1511. It was perhaps at the very time of William's appointment to that position at court that the King promised him the honour of a licence to empark 500 acres of his [[manor]] of [[Manor of Dyrham|Dyrham]] in Gloucestershire, which is to say to enclose the land with a wall or hedgebank and to establish a captive herd of deer within, with exclusive hunting rights. This grant is witnessed by a charter on parchment, to which is affixed a rare example of a perfect great seal of Henry VIII, now hanging in a frame beneath the main staircase of [[Dyrham Park]]. It clearly was handed down with the deeds of the manor on the termination of the Denys era at Dyrham. The charter is of exceptional interest as it is signed as witnesses by men of the greatest importance in the state, who were at the King's side at that moment, at the Palace of Westminster. The text of the document, translated from Latin is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Translation provided by information sheet by National Trust, at Dyrham Park; A summary of the charter was retained in the royal records, Charter Roll 200, no. 20, printed in ''Letters &amp; Papers of Henry VIII, Foreign &amp; Domestic, 1509–1514'', vol. 1, 5 June 1511, summarized as follows: "William Denys, Esquire for the Body, license by charter to impark 500 acres at Le Worthy within his manor of ''Dereham'' Gloucestershire &amp; to have [[Warren (free)|free-warren]] in all the [[demesne]]s of that manor.

Let it be known that we, motivated by our especial grace and certain knowledge of him, have granted for us and our heirs to our faithful servant William Denys, esquire of the Royal Body, to him, his heirs and assigns, the right to empark 500 acres of land, meadow, pasture and wood together with appurtenance at ''Le Worthy'' within the manor of ''Dereham'' in the county of Gloucestershire and enclose them with fences and hedges in order to make a park there. Also that they may have [[free warren]] in all their [[demesne]] lands within the said manor. No other person may enter this park or warren to hunt or catch anything which might belong to that park or warren without permission from William, his heirs or assigns under penalty of £10, provided that the land is not within our [[Royal forest|forest]].

{{wide image|Dyrham Park deer under trees, panorama.jpg|800px|The herd of fallow deer in 2009 in the park at [[Dyrham Park|Dyrham]], Gloucestershire, established in 1511}}

From the size of the present park it appears that only about 250 acres were ultimately enclosed. The grant of emparkment was separate from and in addition to the grant of [[free warren]] in his [[demesne]] lands. This latter allowed him to hunt exclusively on his unemparked other untenanted lands which were managed by his own staff. High dry-stone walls, typical of Gloucestershire, still survive around parts of the present parkland, which is still stocked with a herd of fallow deer. The park was thus an area in which Denys's deer would be at his own disposal and would be safe from being hunted or otherwise taken by any other person, including his neighbours and the king himself. The king when on royal progress throughout his kingdom was accompanied by an enormous entourage which needed daily feeding and entertainment, both of which functions were achieved by holding driven game shoots, in which an area of ground several miles in area would be surrounded and any deer within would be  driven towards a specified exit where the king and his favoured courtiers would be awaiting with bows and arrows to kill them. Thus several dozen if not hundreds of deer could be killed in a single day, to the impoverishment of the local countryside for several months if not years into the future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus any landowner with a licensed park, even if within the circuit of such a drive, would be immune from the entry of such beaters into his park, and his deer would remain untouched.

Early historical records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, often as a result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of [[Sutton Court]], [[Chew Magna]], Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to [[Banwell|Banwell Abbey]], a residence belonging to [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] [[William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)|William Barlow]], and killed 4 bucks and other deer. In the following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which he stuck on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812201701/http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html |date=12 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
Deer parks could vary in size from a circumference of many miles down to what amounted to little more than a deer paddock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |format=PDF |author=Rotherham, I.D |date=2007 |title=The ecology and economics of medieval deer parks |journal=Landscape Archaeology and Ecology |volume=6 |pages=86–102 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730034358/http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape within a deer park was manipulated to produce a habitat that was both suitable for the deer and also provided space for hunting.

[[William George Hoskins|W. G.

Where the deer park reverted to agriculture, the newly established [[field system]] was often rectilinear, clearly contrasting with the system outside the park.

'''Doi Khun Tan National Park''' ({{lang-th|อุทยานแห่งชาติดอยขุนตาล}}) straddles the mountainous area of the [[Khun Tan Range]] in [[Lamphun Province|Lamphun]] and [[Lampang Province]]s, northern [[Thailand]].

Established in 1975 as Thailand's tenth national park, it is an IUCN Category V protected area measuring {{convert|255.29|km2}}.&lt;ref name="CentreCentre1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Conservation Monitoring Centre|author2=IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre|author3=IUCN Commission on National Parks and Protected Areas|title=1990 United Nations list of national parks and protected areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uhtNruyLzkC&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=3 October 2011|date=November 1990|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-8317-0032-8|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park ranges in elevation from 325-1,373 m.

Its best known feature is Thailand’s longest railroad tunnel, 1,352 m long.&lt;ref name=DNP&gt;{{cite web|title=Doi Khun Tan National Park|url=http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=46&amp;lg=2|publisher=[[Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation|Department of National Parks (Thailand)]]|accessdate=24 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125043656/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=46&amp;lg=2|archivedate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The three basic seasons are summer, from March–June; rainy season, from July–October; and winter, from November–February. The temperature varies from 38 degrees Celsius during the hot season to as cold as 5 degrees Celsius. Rainfall, which falls mostly during the rainy season, averages about 1,034&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref name=DNP /&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
Human encroachment has disturbed the forests of Doi Khun Tan and they have changed dramatically in the past century. The forests can be divided into three types, with distinct elevation ranges.

Lowland elevations (325–850 m). Originally a teak forest, lower elevations are composed of a degraded, mixed bamboo deciduous forest and deciduous Dipterocarp-oak forest.

Middle elevations (850-1,000 meter). This is a transitional area where the lowland deciduous forest and upland evergreen-pine forest mix to form a mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. Here are only two species of pine trees in Thailand, a two–needle pine ([[Pinus merkusii]]) and three-needle pine ([[Pinus kesiya]]), both of which can be found here.

Upland elevations (1,000-1,373 m). The forest here is composed mostly of evergreen hardwood trees and a minority of pine (Pinus merkusii) to form an evergreen-pine forest. Much of the forest and watershed on the west side of the national park has been ravaged. More pristine conditions are found on the east side.

Doi Khun Tan offers year-round viewing of wild-flowers such as orchids and gingers. Doi Khun Tan is botanically very diverse, home to over 1,300 different vascular species. Numerous edible fungi are found in the park.

Some wildlife still exists in Doi Khun Tan, including the Siamese hare, porcupine, wild chicken, wild boar and weasel, as a variety of birds, reptiles, spiders and insects. The effects of hunting, logging, frequent fires, and human encroachment have greatly reduced their numbers. In the past, gibbons, tiger, elephants, bears, wild cattle, serow, slow loris, barking deer and many other species were also residents of Doi Khun Tan. Now they are all gone.&lt;ref name=DNP /&gt;

The ''' School of Sagres''', also called '''Court of Sagres''' (in Portuguese ''Escola de Sagres'')&lt;ref name = "Beazley" /&gt; according to some historians was a group of scientific [[Portugal|Portuguese]] personalities and techniques related to ocean navigation of the fifteenth century, formed around the infant [[Henry the Navigator|Enrique, nicknamed '' the Navigator '']] in [[Sagres Point|Sagres]] near [[Cape St. Vincent]], the southwestern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in the [[Algarve]].

While it is proven that the nearby port of [[Lagos (Portugal)|Lagos]] was the starting point for numerous expeditions of exploration and colonization along the African coast and Atlantic islands, the existence of the School of Sagres has been questioned by some historians,&lt;ref name = "Randles"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Randles  | title = The Alleged nautical school founded in the fifteenth century by Prince Henry at Sagres of Portugal, called the 'Navigator' | publisher = Imago Mundi | year = 1993 | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Albuq"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luís de Albuquerque|title=Dúvidas e certezas na história dos descobrimentos portugueses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F4jAQAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Vega|isbn=978-972-699-273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramos"&gt;{{Cite book |  surname = Rocha| first = Daniel | title = Brazil: nega historian existência da Escola Sagres|url=http://www.publico.pt/cultura/noticia/brasil-historiador-nega-existencia-da-escola-de-sagres-1364441|publisher=Público|date=8 February 2009 | accessdate = 16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Marques160"&gt;{{cite book| publisher = University of Coimbra | last = Marques |  first =Alfredo Pinheiro | title = Os Descobrimentos e o 'Miller Atlas' | date = 2005 | url = https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2xiUdRpMxk6YW5fMzNTTFlJYUE |language = Portuguese|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; All historians agree that at least since the death of Prince Henry (1460), the driver of the Portuguese discoveries center was [[Lisbon]] .

The first written mention of the concept of '' School of Sagres '' dating from the seventeenth century by the English [[Samuel Purchas]], although in the sixteenth century [[Damião de Gois]] pointed out a similar idea. Portuguese and  English historians settled and popularized the term later on.

== Controversy ==

=== Romantic view ===
In the nineteenth century began to spread a version of the biography of Prince Henry whereby he would have installed his court in Sagres in 1418, shortly after the capture of [[Ceuta]] by the Portuguese. There would be formed around him the best of "science and navigation" and building a [[shipyard]] and a palace with the first [[observatory]] in Portugal.&lt;ref name = "Beazley"&gt;{{Cite book

| first = C. R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They even wrote that Sagres represented modern refounding "the systematic study of applied science" in Christendom".&lt;ref name =" Beazley "/&gt; Others nuanced that, more than a nautical school in the modern concept of the word, Sagres was a meeting place for sailors and scientists to exchange information and techniques, designing maps, shipbuilding and organize expeditions.

The diverse religious status (Jews, Muslims, Christians) of the members of the alleged Sagres school, and even the ability to remotely connect them with the [[Templar]]s given the fact that Prince Henry was the commander of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], have increased the romantic halo that sometimes appears.
&lt;!--
Since the sixteenth century ([[Damião de Gois]]), we have tried to relate in one way or another with this '' school '' a large [[explorers]], for example [[Vasco da Gama]] or [[ Cristobal Colon]]. The chronicler [[João de Barros]] reported that Prince Henry was attracted to Portugal, without specifying where, to a "Master Jacome of Majorca" as well as Arab and Jewish mathematicians. &lt;Ref name = "Beazley" /&gt; Some historians Jacome identified this with the Majorcan cartographer [[Jehuda Cresques]], co-author of '' [[Catalan Atlas]] '' of [[1375]], and stated that he would have installed in Sagres.--&gt;

=== Critical view ===
According to the critical view, the Portuguese learned navigation in a practical way, on the decks of the ships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = University of Coimbra | last = Marques |  first =Alfredo Pinheiro | title = Os Descobrimentos e o 'Miller Atlas' | date = 2005 | url = https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2xiUdRpMxk6YW5fMzNTTFlJYUE |language = Portuguese|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not being able to find archaeological and documentary support for the "Escola de Sagres", they consider it a myth of [[history of Portugal|Portuguese history]].&lt;ref name = "Randles"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Albuq"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramos"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Marques160"/&gt;  
&lt;!--Several historians, particularly Portuguese, have disputed the romantic vision of the School of Sagres and questioned its very existence. Not found any archaeological remains of  buildings supposedly related to the school, as the observatory or the shipyard. &lt;Ref name = "Ramos" /&gt; There is evidence that the infant Enrique, which is not nicknamed "the Navigator" until the nineteenth century, only received land in Sagres in 1443 and never lived there until 1457, only three years before his death. &lt;ref name = "Randles" /&gt; In his will expressed willingness to install there a mere shelter to supply merchant ships scale but did not mention shipyard or palace or observatory. &lt;ref name = "Randles" ==Myth creation==
The first mention of an alleged sailing school associated with the infant Enrique dating from Portuguese chroniclers of the sixteenth century as [[Damião de Gois]]. &lt;Ref name = "Marques160" /&gt; In 1625 the English [[Samuel Purchas]] coined by . first time the term "Sagres School of Navigation" &lt;ref name = "Randles"&gt; {{Cite book | name = Randles | WGL name = | title = The Alleged nautical school founded in the fifteenth century by Prince Henry at Sagres of Portugal, called the 'Navigator' | Imago Mundi publication = | year = 1993 | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 20-28}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1660 [[Francisco de Melo]] ventured in Sagres It would also have been a shipyard, on the basis of an alleged Venetian etymology of medieval name Sagres (Terçanabal). &lt;ref name = "Randles" /&gt; In the nineteenth century the Portuguese historian [[Oliveira Martins]] used the myth of .

== Majorcan school influence==
The ''[[majorcan school]]'' influence on the Portuguese "navigation know how" is asserted by [[Julio Rey Pastor]] who says in his book ''[[La Cartografía Mallorquina]]'' (citing [[João de Barros]] and [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Pacheco Pereira]]).. "..That [[Jehuda Cresques]] (c. 1415) acted as  founder and director of the Escola de Sagres, was known to historians for over a century,  with doubts on which ''mestre Jacome'' from Majorca corresponded to the ''mestre Jacome'' contracted by Prince Henry,  (although he was the only cartographer with that name). But it's unforgivable some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sens, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter the Ceremonious]] and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Pacheco Pereira]]...:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estudos de História, Volume III|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dVc0MZsZj48C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=pacheco+pereira+mandou+%C3%A1+ilha+de+Malhorca+por+um+mestre+Jacome,+mestre+de+cartas+de+marear,&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMIhvKT7vHdyAIVh4ssCh3WGwdL#v=onepage&amp;q=pacheco%20pereira%20mandou%20%C3%A1%20ilha%20de%20Malhorca%20por%20um%20mestre%20Jacome%2C%20mestre%20de%20cartas%20de%20marear%2C&amp;f=false|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|pages=10–|id=GGKEY:7186FCQBHS5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |''..Muijos beneficios tem feytos o virtuoso Infante Dom Anrique a estes Reynos de Portugal, por que descubrió a ilha da Madeyra no anno de nosso senhor de mil CCCCXX, e ha mandau pouoar e mandou a Cicilia pellas canas de açuquar, ...; isso mesmo mandou á ilha de Malhorca por um mestre Jacome, mestre de cartas de marear, na qual ilha primeiramente se fezeram as ditas cartas, e com muitas dadiuas e mercés ho ouue nestes Reynos, ho qual as ensinou a fazer áquelles de que os que em nosso tempo viuem, aprendéram...''}}

And he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading [[João de Barros]], which clearly states:  ''"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester.."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bibliografia Henriquina, Vol. I|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=AeqIevJ5kxMC&amp;pg=RA2-PA159&amp;dq=pacheco+pereira+mandou+%C3%A1+ilha+de+Malhorca+por+um+mestre+Jacome,+mestre+de+cartas+de+marear,&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIhvKT7vHdyAIVh4ssCh3WGwdL#v=onepage&amp;q=pacheco%20pereira%20mandou%20%C3%A1%20ilha%20de%20Malhorca%20por%20um%20mestre%20Jacome%2C%20mestre%20de%20cartas%20de%20marear%2C&amp;f=false|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|pages=2–|id=GGKEY:PGJ4UJDUYAZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First results==
[[João Gonçalves Zarco]] arrived at [[Porto Santo]] (1419) and [[Madeira]] (1420), and on the other part [[Diogo de Silves]] found the island of Santa Maria at [[Azores]] (1427). In 1434 [[Gil Eanes]] doubled [[Cape Bojador]], the westernmost point of [[Africa]]. This meant a period of twelve years to navigate across two hundred miles that separate the [[Cape Não]] from [[Cape Bojador]]. From this point, the '' Dark Sea '' was feared by Arab geographers for the difficulty of the return trip, sailing against the prevailing winds. This problem could be sorted out at the end, by means of [[high sea sailing]], returning by a route far away from the coast. This breakthrough was achieved in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. The suitable vessel was the [[Caravel]], used for fishing and characterized for its robustness and shallowness, with a tonnage from 50 to 160 tonnes, with 1, 2 or 3 masts with triangular [[Latin sail]]s.

A '''fellfield''' or '''fell field''' comprises the environment of a slope, usually [[alpine climate|alpine]] or [[tundra]], where the dynamics of [[frost]] (freeze and thaw cycles) and of [[wind]] give rise to characteristic plant forms in [[scree]] interstices.&lt;ref name="leroux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.sun.ac.za/consecol/students/leroux/leroux.html |title=Peter le Roux |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070822031931/http://academic.sun.ac.za/consecol/students/leroux/leroux.html |archivedate = 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil dynamics==
The freeze-thaw cycles tend to push plants out of the soil. In addition, the high [[porosity]] of the soil makes a fellfield a difficult place for plants to grow.&lt;ref name="leroux"/&gt; Fellfields often have typical patterns of rocks: lines of rocks that have been pushed out of the soil, and slid into a low region.&lt;ref name="schoenherr"/&gt;

==Botany==
In [[botany]] the term "fellfield" describes an [[ecoregion]], [[ecosystem]], [[habitat]], or [[plant community]]. The term frequently used is '''alpine fellfield'''.  Fellfield is usually applied to an [[alpine tundra]] region of high altitude mountains, or high latitude islands, and the [[alpine plant]]s there.&lt;ref name="schoenherr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenherr|first=Allan A.|title=[[A Natural History of California]]|publisher=University of California|year=1992|isbn=0-520-06922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
Fellfields are typically populated by [[cushion plant]]s: [[perennial]]s that grow close to the ground. Cushion plants are well-adapted to the dryness and short growing season of a fellfield. Cushion plants often have hairy foliage and long [[taproot]]s, to gather and retain moisture. Examples of cushion plants include the [[lupin]]es and [[buckwheat]]s.&lt;ref name="schoenherr"/&gt;

====Fellfield species====
*[[:Category:Alpine flora|Alpine flora list]]
** ''[[Azorella selago]]''
** ''[[Oenothera xylocarpa]]''
** ''[[Calyptridium umbellatum]]''

Some geologists find it is controversial to share the term for [[biology]] and [[geomorphology]] applications.&lt;ref name="schoenherr"/&gt;

The '''Fertile Crescent''' is a [[crescent]]-shaped region in the [[Middle East]] where [[History of agriculture|agriculture]] and early human [[civilization]]s such as [[Sumer]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Fertile Crescent |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Fertile-Crescent |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=28 January 2018 |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advances in the region include the development of [[History of writing#Bronze Age writing|writing]], [[glass]], the [[Wheel#History|wheel]], [[agriculture]], and the use of [[irrigation]].
It has been called the "[[cradle of civilization]]".

The Fertile Crescent lies in parts of [[Iraq]], [[Israel]]/[[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]] as well as the southeastern fringe of [[Turkey]] and the western fringes of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haviland |first=William A. |first2=Harald E.

==Terminology==
The term "Fertile Crescent" was popularized by [[archaeologist]] [[James Henry Breasted]] in ''Outlines of European History'' (1914) and ''Ancient Times, A History of the Early World'' (1916).&lt;ref name="Breasted 1914/1916"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abt|first=Jeffrey|year=2011|title=American Egyptologist: the life of James Henry Breasted and the creation of his Oriental Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEc0bc93LwYC|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-0011-04|pages=193–194, 436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodspeed|first=George Stephen|year=1904|title=A History of the ancient world: for high schools and academies|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|pages=&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vmubAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 5]–&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vmubAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 6]&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breasted|first=James Henry|year=1914|chapter=Earliest man, the Orient, Greece, and Rome|editor1-last=Robinson|editor1-first=James Harvey|editor2-last=Breasted|editor2-first=James Henry|editor3-last=Beard|editor3-first=Charles A.|title=Outlines of European history, Vol. 1|url= https://archive.org/download/outlinesofeurope01robi/outlinesofeurope01robi.pdf |location=Boston|publisher=Ginn|pages=56–57}} "The Ancient Orient" map is inserted between pages 56 and 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breasted|first=James Henry|year=1916|title=Ancient times, a history of the early world: an introduction to the study of ancient history and the career of early man|location=Boston|publisher=Ginn|pages=100–101|url=https://archive.org/download/cu31924027764996/cu31924027764996.pdf}} "The Ancient Oriental World" map is inserted between pages 100 and 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|first=Albert T.|year=1924|title=The so-called Fertile Crescent and desert bay|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=44|pages=186–201|jstor=593554|doi=10.2307/593554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuklick|first=Bruce|year=1996|chapter=Essay on methods and sources|title=Puritans in Babylon: the ancient Near East and American intellectual life, 1880–1930|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02582-7|page=241|quote=Textbooks...The true texts brought all of these strands together, the most important being James Henry Breasted, ''Ancient Times: A History of the Early World'' (Boston, 1916), but a predecessor, George Stephen Goodspeed, ''A History of the Ancient World'' (New York, 1904), is outstanding. Goodspeed, who taught at Chicago with Breasted, antedated him in the conception of a 'crescent' of civilization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breasted wrote:&lt;ref name="Breasted 1914/1916" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This fertile crescent is approximately a semicircle, with the open side toward the south, having the west end at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean, the center directly north of Arabia, and the east end at the north end of the Persian Gulf (see map, p. 100). It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down—a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some {{convert|500|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=out}} across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height—too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut cañons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands—a struggle which is still going on—for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], as well as the surrounding portions of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. Water sources include the [[Jordan River]]. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the south. Around the outer boundary are the [[Anatolia]]n highlands to the north, the [[Sahara Desert]] to the west and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the east.

== Biodiversity and climate ==
As crucial as rivers and [[marsh]]lands were to the [[Cradle of civilization|rise of civilization]] in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the "bridge" between [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]], which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of [[biodiversity]] than either [[Europe]] or [[North Africa]], where [[climate change]]s during the [[Ice Age]] led to repeated [[extinction]] events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Saharan pump theory]] posits that this Middle Eastern [[land-bridge]] was extremely important to the modern distribution of [[Old World]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including the [[Early human migrations|spread of humanity]].

The area has borne the brunt of the [[Divergent boundary|tectonic divergence]] between the African and Arabian [[tectonic plates|plates]] and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.

The Fertile Crescent had many diverse [[climate]]s, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many [[r/K strategy|"r" type]] [[annual plant]]s, which produce more edible seeds than [[r/K strategy|"K" type]] [[perennial plant]]s. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight [[Neolithic founder crops]] important in early [[agriculture]] (i.e., wild progenitors to [[emmer|emmer wheat]], [[einkorn]], [[barley]], [[flax]], [[chick pea]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]]), and four of the five most important species of [[domestication|domesticated]] animals—[[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s; the fifth species, the [[horse]], lived nearby.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] |last=Diamond |first=Jared |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=March 1997 |publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]] |isbn=0-393-03891-2 |pages=480 |edition=1st |oclc=35792200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fertile Crescent flora comprises a high percentage of plants that can [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]], but may also be [[Pollination|cross-pollinated]].&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"/&gt; These plants, called "[[Self-pollination|selfers]]", were one of the geographical advantages of the area because they did not depend on other plants for reproduction.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;

==History==
{{Further information|History of the Middle East}}
{{Ancient Near East topics}}
As well as possessing many sites with the skeletal and cultural remains of both pre-modern and early [[modern humans]] (e.g., at [[Tabun Cave|Tabun]] and [[Es Skhul]] caves in Israel), later [[Pleistocene]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipalaeolithic]] semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers (the [[Natufian]]s); the Fertile Crescent is most famous for its sites related to the [[origins of agriculture]]. The western zone around the Jordan and upper Euphrates rivers gave rise to the first known Neolithic [[farming]] settlements (referred to as [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), which date to around 9,000 BCE (and includes sites such as [[Göbekli Tepe]] and [[Jericho]]).

This region, alongside Mesopotamia (which lies to the east of the Fertile Crescent, between the rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]), also saw the emergence of early [[complex society|complex societies]] during the succeeding [[Bronze Age]]. There is also early evidence from the region for [[writing]] and the formation of [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Sovereign state|statelevel]] societies. This has earned the region the nickname "The [[cradle of civilization]]".

It is in this region where the first [[Library|libraries]] appeared, some 5,000 years ago. The oldest known library was found in northern Syria, in the ruins of Ebla, a major commercial center that was destroyed around 1650 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stuart |date=9 July 2009 |title=The Library: An Illustrated History |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.]] |pages=320 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=HMgtAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=9781628733228 |oclc=277203534 |doi=10.1080/10875300903535149 |editor-first=Nicholas A. |editor-last=Basbanes |editor2-first=Donald G. |editor2-last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Tigris and Euphrates start in the [[Taurus Mountains]] of what is modern-day Turkey. Farmers in southern Mesopotamia had to protect their fields from flooding each year, except northern [[Mesopotamia]] which had just enough rain to make some farming possible.  To protect against flooding, they made levees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Roger B. |last2=Black |first2=Linda |last3=Krieger |first3=Larry S. |last4=Naylor |first4= hillip C. |last5=Shabaka |first5=Dahia Ibo |title=World History: Patterns of Interaction |publisher=[[McDougal Littell]] |year=1999 |location=Evanston, IL |pages=1082 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pQRlSAAACAAJ |isbn=0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Bronze Age]], the region's natural [[Soil fertility|fertility]] has been greatly extended by [[irrigation]] works, upon which much of its agricultural production continues to depend. The last two millennia have seen repeated cycles of decline and recovery as past works have fallen into disrepair through the replacement of states, to be replaced under their successors. Another ongoing problem has been [[Soil salination|salination]] — gradual concentration of salt and other minerals in soils with a long history of irrigation.

Consequently contemporary [[in-situ]] peoples absorbed the agricultural way of life of those early migrants who ventured out of the Fertile Crescent.  This is contrary to the suggestion that the spread of agriculture disseminated out of the Fertile Crescent by way of sharing of knowledge. Instead the view now supported by a preponderance of the evidence is that it occurred by actual migration out of the region, coupled with subsequent interbreeding with indigenous local populations whom the migrants came in contact with.&lt;ref name="PNAS"/&gt;

The studies show also that not all present day [[Europe]]ans share strong genetic affinities to the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent;&lt;ref name="PNAS"/&gt; instead the closest ties to the Fertile Crescent rest with [[Southern Europe]]ans.&lt;ref name="PNAS"/&gt;  The same study further demonstrates all present day [[Europe]]ans to be closely related.&lt;ref name="PNAS"/&gt; --&gt;

== Languages ==
Linguistically, the Fertile Crescent was a region of great diversity.  Historically, [[Semitic languages]] generally prevailed in the lowlands, whilst in the mountainous areas to the east and north a number of generally unrelated languages were found including [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Kassite language|Kassite]], and [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]]. The precise affiliation of these, and their date of arrival, remain topics of scholarly discussion. However, given lack of textual evidence for the earliest era of prehistory, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.

The evidence which does exist suggests that by the third millennium BCE and into the second, several language groups already existed in the region.

'''Flanders''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaanderen}} {{IPA-nl|ˈvlaːndərə(n)||Nl-Vlaanderen.ogg}}, {{lang-fr|Flandre}} {{IPA-fr|flɑ̃dʁ}}, {{lang-de|Flandern}} {{IPA-de|ˈflandɐn}}) is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking northern portion of [[Belgium]] and one of the [[communities, regions and language areas of Belgium]]. However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The [[demonym]] associated with Flanders is [[Flemings|Fleming]], while the corresponding adjective is [[Flemish]]. The official capital of Flanders is [[City of Brussels|Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vlaanderen.be/en/discover-flanders |title=Discover Flanders |website=Flanders.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Brussels Capital Region]] has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees the community aspects of Flanders life in Brussels such as (Flemish) culture and education.

Flanders, despite not being the biggest part of [[Belgium]] by area, is the area with the largest population (68.5%). 7,876,873 out of 11,491,346 Belgian inhabitants live in Flanders or the bilingual city of [[Brussels]]. Not including Brussels, there are five modern Flemish provinces.

In medieval contexts, the original "[[County of Flanders]]" stretched around AD 900 from the [[Strait of Dover]] to the [[Scheldt]] [[estuary]] and expanded from there. This county also still corresponds roughly with the modern-day Belgian provinces of [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]], along with neighbouring parts of [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Although this original meaning is still relevant, during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term "Flanders" to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, stretching all the way to the [[River Meuse]], as well as cultural movements such as [[Flemish art]]. In accordance with late 20th century [[state reform in Belgium|Belgian state reforms]] the Belgian part of this area was made into two political entities: the "[[Flemish Community]]" ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschap}}) and the "[[Flemish Region]]" ({{lang-nl|Vlaams Gewest}}). These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.

Flanders, by every definition, has figured prominently in European history since the [[Middle Ages]]. In this period, cities such as [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], and later [[Antwerp]] made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, trading, and weaving the [[wool]] of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century [[industrial revolution]] but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking [[Wallonia]]. In the second half of the 20th century, however, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are significantly more wealthy than Wallonia and in general one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2874.htm|title=Belgium|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Flanders is mainly flat, and has a small section of coast on the North Sea. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated, with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer (1,200 per square mile). It touches France to the west near the coast, and borders the Netherlands to the north and east, and Wallonia to the south. The [[Brussels Capital Region]] is an officially bilingual [[enclave]] within the Flemish Region. Flanders has exclaves of its own: [[Voeren]] in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and [[Baarle-Hertog]] in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands.

== Terminology ==

=== In Belgium ===
The term "Flanders" has several main modern meanings:
* The "Flemish community" or "Flemish nation", i.e. the social, cultural and linguistic, scientific and educational, economical and political community of the [[Flemings]]. It comprises 6.5 million Belgians (60%) who consider Dutch to be their mother tongue.
* The political subdivisions of Belgium: the [[Flemish Region]] (competent in mainly economic matters) and the [[Flemish Community]] (competent in mainly cultural matters). The first does not comprise Brussels (which forms a [[Brussels-Capital Region|Region on itself]]), whereas the latter does comprise the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Brussels.
* The political institutions that govern both subdivisions: the operative body "[[Flemish Government]]" and the legislative organ "[[Flemish Parliament]]".
* The two westernmost provinces of the Flemish Region, [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]], forming the central portion of the historic [[County of Flanders]].

=== In Belgium and neighbouring countries ===
* An ''[[ancien regime]]'' territory that existed from the 8th century (''Flandria'') until its absorption by the [[French First Republic]]. Until the 1600s, this county also extended over parts of what are now France and the Netherlands. {{main|County of Flanders}}
* One of the historically Flemish regions which are now part of France, in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord department]]. This is referred to as [[French Flanders]], and can be divided into two smaller regions: [[Walloon Flanders]] and [[Westhoek (region)|Maritime Flanders (Westhoek)]]. The first region was predominantly French-speaking already in the 1600s, the latter became so in the 20th century. The [[Lille|city of Lille]] identifies itself as "Flemish", and this is reflected, for instance, in the name of its local railway station [[TGV]] ''[[Gare de Lille Flandres|Lille Flandres]]''. {{main|French Flanders}}
* The historically Flemish region which became part of the [[Dutch Republic]], now part of the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]]. {{main|Zeelandic Flanders}}

=== Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ===
The significance of the County of Flanders and its [[Count of Flanders|counts]] eroded through time, but the designation remained in a very broad sense. In the [[Early modern period]], the term Flanders was associated with the southern part of the [[Low Countries]]: the [[Southern Netherlands]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, it became increasingly commonplace to refer to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium as "Flanders". The linguistic limit between French and Dutch was recorded in the early '60's, from [[Kortrijk]] to [[Maastricht]]. Now, Flanders extends over the northern part of Belgium, including [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] (corresponding closely to the medieval [[County of Loon]]), and the Dutch-speaking Belgian parts of the medieval [[Duchy of Brabant]].

The ambiguity between this wider area and that of the County (or the Belgian parts thereof), still remains. In most present-day contexts however, in general the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the [[Flemish Community]]), or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the [[Flemish Region]].

In the [[history of art]] and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and [[Netherlandish]] are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term "Flemish Primitives", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for "[[Early Netherlandish painting]]", and it is not uncommon to see [[Mosan art]] categorized as Flemish art. In music the ''[[Franco-Flemish School]]'' is also known as the ''Dutch School''.

Within this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens and Jewish groups have been speaking [[Yiddish]] in Antwerp for centuries. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities{{efn |name="Note_Nationality-Minority-Education" |The relation between nationality, genetic ethnicity, native and mainly spoken language(s) (within a group of same ethnicity and age, in presence of elders, in ethnically mixed groups), and minority group identification, can be complex: Dutch nationals constituting one of the largest groups of foreigners, share the [[Dutch language|standard language]] with Flemish locals but their accent is enough to immediately distinguish them. The majority of immigrants from certain other countries, had belonged to a minority or disadvantaged group there. Children born in Belgium from residents of foreign nationality, very often acquired Belgian citizenship. Regardless of nationality, according to Belgian Law, obligatory education in schools located in the Flemish Region are in Dutch language. In Brussels, teaching is also done in French. The determination of statistical samples and interpretation of publicized figures can easily lead to false assumptions or conclusions.}} — the largest groups speaking [[French language|French]], English, [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic]], Spanish, Italian and Polish.

== History ==
{{main|History of Flanders}}

=== Early history ===
{{main|Belgae}}

When [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the area he described it as the less economically developed and more warlike part of ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''. His informants told him that especially in the east, the tribes claimed ancestral connections and kinship with the [[Germanic peoples|"Germanic" peoples]] then east of the [[Rhine]]. Under the [[Roman empire]] the whole of ''Gallia Belgica'' became an administrative province. The future counties of Flanders and Brabant remained part of this province connected to what is now France, but in the east modern Limburg became part of the Rhine frontier province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' connected to what is now the Netherlands and Germany. ''Gallia Belgica'' and ''Germania Inferior'' were the two most northerly continental provinces of the [[Roman empire]].

In the future county of Flanders, the main [[Belgic]] tribe in early Roman times was the [[Menapii]], but also on the coast were the [[Marsacii]] and [[Morini]]. In the central part of modern Belgium were the [[Nervii]] and in the east were the [[Tungri]]. The Tungri especially were understood to have links to Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Another notable Germanic group were the [[Toxandrians]] who appear to have lived in the [[Campine|Kempen]] region, in the northern parts of both the Nervian and Tungrian provinces, probably stretching into the modern Netherlands. The Roman provinces of the Menapii, Nervii and Tungri therefore corresponded roughly with the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and [[County of Loon|Loon]], and the modern Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders (Menapii), Brabant and Antwerp (Nervii), and Belgian Limburg (Tungri). Brabant appears to have been home to relatively unpopulated forest area, the [[Silva Carbonaria]], forming a natural boundary between northeast and southwest Belgium.

Linguistically, the tribes in this area were under [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] influence in the south, and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] influence in the east, but there is disagreement about what language was spoken locally, which may even have been an intermediate "[[Nordwestblock]]" language related to both. By the first century BC [[Germanic languages]] had become prevalent.

=== Historical Flanders ===
{{main|County of Flanders}}

The County of Flanders was a [[feudal]] [[fief]] in [[West Francia]]. The first certain Count in the comital family, [[Baldwin I of Flanders]], is first reported in a document of 862 when he eloped with a daughter of his king [[Charles the Bald]]. The region developed as a medieval economic power with a large degree of political autonomy. While its trading cities remained strong, it was weakened and divided when districts fell under direct French royal rule in the late 12th century. The remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring imperial [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] under [[Baldwin V of Hainaut]] in 1191.

During the late [[Middle Ages]] Flanders' trading towns (notably [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ypres]]) made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the [[wool]] of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the [[Franc of Bruges]] formed the [[Four Members]], a form of parliament that exercised considerable power in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;''Philip the Good: the apogee of Burgundy'' by Richard Vaughan, p201&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban [[Medieval commune|communes]] were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300–1302), finally defeating the French in the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] (11 July 1302), near [[Kortrijk]]. Two years later, the [[Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305)|uprising was defeated]] and Flanders remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the [[Black Death]] of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to [[Worstead]] and [[North Walsham]] in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.

The County of Flanders started to take control of the neighbouring [[County of Brabant]] during the life of [[Louis II, Count of Flanders]] (1330-1384), who fought his sister-in-law [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant]] for control of it.

The entire area, straddling the ancient boundary of France and the Holy Roman Empire, later passed to [[Philip the Bold]] in 1384, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]], with his capital in [[Brussels]]. The titles were eventually more clearly united under his grandson [[Philip the Good]] (1396 – 1467). This large Duchy passed in [[&lt;!--same year: Great Privilege + Habsburg by her marriage--&gt;Mary of Burgundy|1477]] to the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, and in [[&lt;!--Charles V abdicated--&gt;Philip II of Spain|1556]] to the kings of Spain. Western and southern districts of Flanders were confirmed under French rule under successive treaties of [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|1659]] (Artois), [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|1668]], and [[Treaties of Nijmegen|1678]].

The County of Loon, approximately the modern Flemish province of Limburg, remained independent under the lordship of the Archbishop of Liège until the French Revolution, but surrounded by the Burgundians, and under their influence.

=== Low Countries ===
{{main|Low Countries}}

==== Beeldenstorm ====
In 1500, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was born in [[Ghent]]. He inherited the [[Seventeen Provinces]] (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V (NY, 1874), p 116&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by Charles V, established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or [[Spanish Netherlands]] in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and from France. In 1556 Charles V abdicated due to ill health (he suffered from crippling [[gout]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V (NY, 1874), p 456&lt;/ref&gt; Spain and the Seventeen Provinces went to his son, king [[Philip II of Spain]].

Over the first half of the 16th century [[Antwerp]] grew to become the second-largest European city north of the [[Alps]] by 1560. Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Incendio Ayuntamiento Amberes.jpg|thumb|The [[Sack of Antwerp]] in 1576, in which about 7,000 people died]]
Meanwhile, Protestantism had reached the Low Countries. Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] beliefs of the German [[Hanseatic (class)|Hanseatic]] traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an [[Augustinian]] cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant [[Anabaptist]], then a [[Mennonite]], and finally a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] movement. These movements existed independently of each other.

[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] Calvinism in Flanders, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and Holland (what is now approximately [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] was part of the [[Bishopric of Liège]] and was Catholic ''de facto''). In 1566, the wave of [[iconoclasm]] known as the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' was a prelude to religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The ''Beeldenstorm'' started in what is now [[French Flanders]], with open-air sermons ({{lang-nl|hagepreken}}) that spread through the Low Countries, first to Antwerp and Ghent, and from there further east and north. In total it lasted not even a month.

==== The Eighty Years' War and its consequences ====
Subsequently, Philip II sent [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|the Duke]] of [[Duchy of Alba|Alba]] to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the [[Union of Arras|Union of Atrecht]], which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the [[Union of Utrecht]] and settled in 1581 the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, but before the revolt could be completely defeated, a war between England and Spain had broken out, forcing Philip's Spanish troops to halt their advance. Meanwhile, the Spanish armies had already conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) [[Southern Netherlands]]. The [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 – the [[Peace of Westphalia]].

While Spain was at war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s Spanish troops. They managed to conquer a considerable part of Brabant (the later [[Noord-Brabant]] of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary ([[Zeelandic Flanders]]), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front line at the end of this war stabilized and became the current border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river [[Scheldt]], effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.

First the [[fall of Antwerp]] to the Spanish and later also the closing of the [[Scheldt]] were causes of a considerable emigration of Antverpians.{{efn |An ''Antverpian'', derived from ''Antverpia'', the Latin name of [[Antwerp]], is an inhabitant of this city; the term is also the [[adjective]] expressing that its substantive is from or in that city or belongs to it.}} Many of the Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and also of other Flemish cities left Flanders and emigrated to the north. A large number of them settled in [[Amsterdam]], which was at the time a smaller port, of significance only in the [[Baltic trade]]. In the following years Amsterdam was rapidly transformed into one of the world's most important ports. Because of the contribution of the Flemish exiles to this transformation, the exodus is sometimes described as "''creating a new Antwerp''".

Flanders and Brabant, due to these events, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the [[Thirty Years War]].&lt;ref name="FiifAntwHist"&gt;

|accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northern Netherlands however, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the [[Dutch Golden Age]].

==== Southern Netherlands (1581–1795) ====
[[File:Quad Flandria.jpg|thumb|1609 map of the county of Flanders]]
Although arts remained at a relatively impressive level for another century with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640) and [[Anthony van Dyck]], Flanders experienced a loss of its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule, with heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounding the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], but under the reign of Empress Maria-Theresia these lands economically flourished again. Influenced by the Enlightenment, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II was the first sovereign who had been in the Southern Netherlands since King Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.

==== French Revolution and Napoleonic France (1795–1815) ====
In 1794 the [[History of France#Revolution|French Republican Army]] started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France,&lt;ref name="FiifAntwHist" /&gt; which country officially annexed Flanders the following year as the ''[[The 130 départements|départements]]'' of [[Lys (département)|Lys]], [[Escaut (département)|Escaut]], [[Deux-Nèthes]], [[Meuse-Inférieure]] and [[Dyle (département)|Dyle]]. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16–25 was one of the main reasons for the people's uprising against the French in 1798, known as the ''Boerenkrijg'' (''Peasants' War''), with the heaviest fighting in the [[Campine]] area.

==== United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830) ====
After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] at the 1815 [[Battle of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], sovereignty over the [[Austrian Netherlands]] – Belgium minus the [[East Cantons]] and Luxembourg – was given by the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) to the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|United Netherlands]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Nederlanden''), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], after the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] was driven out of the Dutch territories. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, slowly but surely failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern [[bourgeoisie]] mainly was Roman Catholic, in contrast to the mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch.

In 1815 the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: ''Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal''). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became more and more estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew both between the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north and among the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On 25 August 1830 (after the showing of the opera '[[La Muette de Portici]]' of [[Daniel Auber]] in Brussels) the [[Belgian Revolution]] sparked off and became a fact. On 4 October 1830, the [[Provisional Government of Belgium|Provisional Government]] (Dutch: ''Voorlopig Bewind'') proclaimed the independence, which was later confirmed by the [[National Congress of Belgium|National Congress]] that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a [[Constitutional Monarchy]], under the House of [[Saxe-Coburg]]. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on 20 January 1831. The de facto dissidence was finally recognized by the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] on 19 April 1839.

=== Kingdom of Belgium ===
{{further|History of Belgium}}
In 1830, the [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the [[Treaty of London, 1839|Treaty of London]] of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over [[Zeelandic Flanders]], south of the [[Westerscheldt]] river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.&lt;ref name="FiifAntwHist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetware.com/map/belgium-kingdom-of-belgium-map-b-belg.htm |title=Kingdom of Belgium map (politically outdated) |website=Planet Ware |accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rise of the Flemish Movement ====
{{main|Flemish Movement}}

The Belgian Revolution was not well supported in Flanders and even on 4 October 1830, when the Belgian independence was eventually declared, Flemish authorities refused to take orders from the new Belgian government in Brussels. Only after Flanders was subdued with the aid of a large French military force one month later, under the leadership of the [[Louis Gustave le Doulcet, comte de Pontécoulant|Count de Pontécoulant]], did Flanders become a true part of Belgium.

The French-speaking bourgeoisie showed very little respect for the Dutch-speaking part of the population.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} French became the only official language in Belgium and all secondary and higher education in the Dutch language was abolished. &lt;!--Flemish nationalist claim that the Kingdom of Belgium's co-founder, [[Charles Rogier]] wrote in 1832 to the minister of Justice [[Jean-Joseph Raikem]], that "the first principles of a good administration are based upon the exclusive use of one language, and it is evident that the only language of the Belgians should be French. In order to achieve this result, it is necessary that all civil and military functions are entrusted to Walloons and Luxemburgers; this way, the Flemish, temporarily deprived of the advantages of these offices, will be constrained to learn French, and we will hence destroy bit by bit the Germanic element in Belgium." However, this "letter" has been proven to be a myth&lt;ref&gt;L. WILLEMS, "Over twee Antivlaamsche brieven toegeschreven aan Minister Rogier", Verslagen en mededelingen van de Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Taal- en Letterkunde, 1902, pp. 53-90&lt;/ref&gt;

According to nationalists senator [[Alexandre Gendebien]], another cofounder, even declared that the Flemish were "one of the more inferior races on the Earth, just like the negroes". Again, we must emphasize that this way of seeing things belongs to the nationalist mythology. For in reality, Gendebien didn't make this statement. He asked, as a rhetorical question if the Flemish were inferior, immediately adding: "of course not". --&gt;

In 1834, all people even remotely suspected of being "Flemish minded" or calling for the reunification of the Netherlands were prosecuted and their houses looted and burnt. Flanders, until then a very prosperous European region,{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} was not considered worthwhile for investment and scholarship. A study in 1918 demonstrated that in the first 88 years of its existence, 80% of the Belgian GNP was invested in Wallonia. This led to a widespread poverty in Flanders, forcing roughly 300.000 [[Flemish immigration to Wallonia|Flemish to emigrate to Wallonia]] to start working there in the heavy industry.

All of these events led to a silent uprising in Flanders against the French-speaking domination. But it was not until 1878 that Dutch was allowed to be used for official purposes in Flanders (see [[language legislation in Belgium]]), although French remained the only official language in Belgium.

In 1873, Dutch became the official language in public secondary schools. In 1898 Dutch and French were declared equal languages in laws and Royal orders. In 1930 the first Flemish university was opened.

The first official translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.

==== World War I and its consequences ====
Flanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[First World War]], in particular from the three battles of [[Ypres]].

Flemish feeling of identity and consciousness grew through the events and experiences of war. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. More importantly, the experiences of many Dutch-speaking soldiers on the front led by French-speaking officers catalysed Flemish emancipation. The French-speaking officers often gave orders in French only, followed by "et pour les Flamands, la même chose!", meaning "and for the Flemish, the same thing!" (which did not help the Flemish conscripts, who were mostly uneducated farmers and workers unable to have understood what had been said in French).&lt;ref

The resulting suffering is still remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly [[Ijzerbedevaart|Yser pilgrimage]] in [[Diksmuide]] at the monument of the [[IJzertoren|Yser Tower]].

==== Right-Wing Nationalism in the interbellum and World War II ====
{{main|Flemish National Union|Verdinaso|Dietsland|Cyriel Verschaeve}}

During the interbellum and World War II, several right-wing fascist and/or national-socialistic parties emerged in Belgium. Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemings by the German government during World War II, many of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, collaborators (or people who were ''Zwart'', "Black" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish Nationalists whose main political goal had been the emancipation of Flanders. As a result, up until this day Flemish Nationalism is often associated with right-wing and sometimes fascist ideologies.

==== Flemish autonomy ====
{{main|State reform in Belgium|2007–2011 Belgian political crisis|Partition of Belgium}}

After World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the [[Royal Question]], the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but not the Walloons) and the use of Dutch in the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]. As a result, several [[State reform in Belgium|state reforms]] took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities, regions and language areas]]. This resulted also in the establishment of a [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government|Government]]. During the 1970s, all major political parties split into a Dutch and French-speaking party.

Several Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see [[Partition of Belgium]]), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as [[Verhofstadt I Government]]) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments.

On 13 December 2006, a [[Flemish Secession hoax|spoof news broadcast]] by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station [[RTBF]] declared that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium.

The [[Belgian federal election, 2007|2007 federal elections]] showed more support for Flemish autonomy, marking the start of the [[2007–2011 Belgian political crisis]]. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the [[Belgian federal parliament]]. This was especially the case for [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] and [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared [[electoral list]]). The trend continued during the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009 regional elections]], where CD&amp;V and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]], followed by the [[2010–2011 Belgian government formation|longest-ever government formation]] after which the [[Di Rupo I Government]] was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a [[Sixth Belgian state reform|sixth state reform]] which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. The [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2012|2012 provincial and municipal elections]] however continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.

However, sociological studies show no parallel between the rise of nationalist parties and popular support for their agenda. Instead, a recent study revealed a majority in favour of returning regional competences to the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160124_02088008 |title=Staatshervorming richting België wint aan politieke steun |language=Dutch |trans-title=State reform towards Belgium is gaining political support

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Kris Peeters 675.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kris Peeters]], former [[Minister-President of Flanders]], promoting [[Flanders in Action]]]]
{{main|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}

Both the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[Flemish Region]] are constitutional institutions of the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of [[state reform in Belgium|state reforms]]. In practice, the Flemish Community and Region together form a single body, with its own [[Flemish Parliament|parliament]] and [[Flemish Government|government]], as the Community legally absorbed the competences of the Region. The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up to a maximum of eleven members and is presided by a [[Minister-President of Flanders|Minister-President]], currently [[Geert Bourgeois]] ([[New Flemish Alliance]]) leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams]] (CD&amp;V) and [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten]] (Open VLD).

The area of the Flemish Community is represented on the maps above, including the area of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] (hatched on the relevant map). Roughly, the Flemish Community exercises competences originally oriented towards the individuals of the Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), [[Flemish education|education]], and the use of the language. Extensions to personal matters less directly associated with language comprise sports, health policy (curative and preventive medicine), and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)&lt;ref name="fedgov2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Communities|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2686|accessdate=23 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184122/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2686|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of the Flemish Region is represented on the maps above. It has a population of more than 6 million (excluding the Dutch-speaking community in the Brussels Region, grey on the map for it is not a part of the Flemish Region). Roughly, the Flemish Region is responsible for territorial issues in a broad sense, including economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.&lt;ref name="fedgov3"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Regions|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2690|accessdate=23 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184618/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=navigationBanner.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=indexPage&amp;navId=2690|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Dutch-speaking [[Flemish people]] in the Capital Region is estimated to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://regards.ires.ucl.ac.be/Archives/RE042.pdf Report of study by the Université Catholique de Louvain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823190132/http://regards.ires.ucl.ac.be/Archives/RE042.pdf |date=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://taalunieversum.org/nieuws/1349/ Article at Taaluniversum.org summarising report]&lt;/ref&gt; They are governed by the Brussels Region for economics affairs and by the Flemish Community for educational and cultural issues.

[[File:Brussels - Vlaams Parlement.jpg|thumb|The [[Flemish Parliament]]]]
As mentioned above, Flemish institutions such as the [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government|Government]], represent the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus ''de facto'' share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the Brussels Region cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.

The [[official language]] for all Flemish institutions is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. French enjoys a limited official recognition in [[municipalities with language facilities|a dozen municipalities]] along the borders with French-speaking [[Wallonia]], and a large recognition in the bilingual Brussels Region. French is widely known in Flanders, with 59% claiming to know French according to a survey conducted by the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] and published in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://regards.ires.ucl.ac.be/Archives/RE042.pdf Report of study by Université Catholique de Louvain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823190132/http://regards.ires.ucl.ac.be/Archives/RE042.pdf |date=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://taalunieversum.org/nieuws/1349/ Taaluniversum.org], summarising report&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
{{Main|Politics of Flanders|Political parties in Flanders}}

Historically, the political parties reflected the [[pillarisation]] (''verzuiling'') in Flemish society. The traditional political parties of the three pillars are [[Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&amp;V), the [[Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open Vld) and the [[Socialist Party – Differently]] (sp.a).

However, during the last half century, many new political parties were founded in Flanders. One of the first was the nationalist [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]], of which the right nationalist [[Vlaams Blok|Flemish Block]] (now [[Vlaams Belang|Flemish Interest]]) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or [[Social Liberal Party (Belgium)|Social Liberal Party]], moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological [[Groen!|Green]] party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark [[ROSSEM]] and more recently the conservative-right liberal [[Lijst Dedecker|List Dedecker]], founded by [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]], and the socialist [[Workers' Party of Belgium|Workers' Party]].

Particularly the [[Flemish Block]]/[[Flemish Interest]] has seen electoral success roughly around the turn of the century, and the [[New Flemish Alliance]] during the last few elections, becoming even the largest party in the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]].

=== Flemish independence ===
[[File:Menen - Border crossing 1 cropped.jpg|thumb|Border crossing sign near [[Menen]].]]
{{main|Flemish Movement}}

For some inhabitants, Flanders is more than just a geographical area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even ''very proud'', while some 25% are not proud and 8% is ''very not proud''. Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them staying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in [[Service (economics)|services]], the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers - both housewives and house husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/drie-op-vier-vlamingen-zijn-trotse-belgen/article-1195114178145.htm|title=Drie op vier Vlamingen zijn trotse Belgen|work=knack.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Flemish government drafted a "Charter for Flanders" (''Handvest voor Vlaanderen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/biblio/opendigibib/monografie/2012/280_handvest_voor_vlaanderen_20120524.pdf|format=pdf|title=Handvest voor Vlaanderen|website=vlaamsparlement.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the first article says ''"Vlaanderen is een deelstaat van de federale Staat België en maakt deel uit van de Europese Unie."'' ("Flanders is a [[federated state|component state]] of the federal State of Belgium and is part of the European Union"). Although interpreted by many Flemish nationalists as a statement, this phrase is merely a quotation from the Belgian constitution and has no further legal value whatsoever.

== Geography ==
{{Further|Geography of Belgium}}
[[File:Zonien.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sonian Forest]]]]
Flanders shares its borders with Wallonia in the south, Brussels being an enclave within the Flemish Region. The rest of the border is shared with the [[Netherlands]] ([[Zeelandic Flanders]] in [[Zeeland]], [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]) in the north and east, and with [[France]] ([[French Flanders]] in [[Hauts-de-France]]) and the [[North Sea]] in the west. [[Voeren]] is an [[exclave]] of Flanders between Wallonia and the Netherlands, while [[Baarle-Hertog]] in Flanders forms a complicated series of enclaves and exclaves with [[Baarle-Nassau]] in the Netherlands. [[Germany]], although bordering Wallonia and close to [[Voeren]] in Limburg, does not share a border with Flanders. The [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], also close to Voeren, does not border Flanders either. (The commune of [[Plombières]], majority French speaking, lies between them.)

Flanders is a highly urbanised area, lying completely within the [[Blue Banana]]. [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Leuven]] are the largest cities of the [[Flemish Region]]. [[Antwerp]] has a population of more than 500,000 citizens and is the largest city, [[Ghent]] has a population of 250,000 citizens, followed by [[Bruges]] with 120,000 citizens and [[Leuven]] counts almost 100,000 citizens.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Brussels]] is a part of Flanders as far as community matters are concerned, but does not belong to the Flemish Region.

Flanders has two main geographical regions: the coastal [[Yser]] basin plain in the north-west and a central plain. The first consists mainly of sand dunes and [[clay]]ey [[alluvial]] soils in the [[polder]]s. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] or, a little further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. With similar soils along the lowermost [[Scheldt]] basin starts the central plain, a smooth, slowly rising fertile area irrigated by many waterways that reaches an average height of about five metres (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level with wide valleys of its rivers upstream as well as the [[Campine]] region to the east having sandy soils at altitudes around thirty metres.{{efn |The altitude of Mechelen, approximately in the middle of the central plain forming the large part of Flanders, is {{cvt|7|m|ft}} above sea level. Already closer to the higher southern [[Wallonia]], the more eastern Leuven and Hasselt reach altitudes up to about {{cvt|40|m|ft}}}} Near its southern edges close to [[Wallonia]] one can find slightly rougher land richer of [[calcium]] with low hills reaching up to {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} and small valleys, and at the eastern border with the Netherlands, in the [[Meuse]] basin, there are [[marl]] caves (''mergelgrotten''). Its [[exclave]] around [[Voeren]] between the Dutch border and the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]] attains a maximum altitude of {{convert|288|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;

The province of Flemish Brabant is the most recent one, being formed in 1995 after the splitting of the [[province of Brabant]].

Most municipalities are made up of several former municipalities, now called ''[[deelgemeente]]n''. The largest municipality (both in terms of population and area) is [[Antwerp]], having more than half a million inhabitants. Its nine ''deelgemeenten'' have a special status and are called [[Districts of Antwerp|districts]], which have an elected council and a college. While any municipality with more than 100,000 inhabitants can establish districts, only Antwerp did this so far. The smallest municipality (also both in terms of population and area) is [[Herstappe]] (Limburg).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:BrusselLocatie.png|thumb|Brussels-Capital Region with the [[City of Brussels]] (one of 19 municipalities) in red]]
The '''[[Flemish Community]]''' covers both the [[Flemish Region]] and, together with the French Community, the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. Brussels, an enclave within the province of Flemish Brabant, is not divided into any province nor is it part of any. It coincides with the [[Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital]] and includes [[List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|19 municipalities]].

The [[Flemish Government]] has its own local institutions in the Brussels-Capital Region, being the ''[[Flemish Community Commission|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie]]'' (VGC), and its municipal antennae (''Gemeenschapscentra'', community centres for the Flemish community in Brussels). These institutions are independent from the educational, cultural and social institutions that depend directly on the Flemish Government. They exert, among others, all those cultural competences that outside Brussels fall under the provinces.

== Climate ==
The climate is maritime [[temperate]], with significant precipitation in all seasons ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb''; the average temperature is {{convert|3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in January, and {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in July; the average precipitation is 65&amp;nbsp;millimetres (2.6&amp;nbsp;in) in January, and 78&amp;nbsp;millimetres (3.1&amp;nbsp;in) in July).

[[File:Lijn11 a12.jpg|thumb|The [[A12 road (Belgium)|A12]] with a railway in the centre.]]
Total GDP of the Flemish Region in 2004 was €165,847 billion ([[Eurostat]] figures). Per capita GDP at [[purchasing power parity]] was 23% above the EU average. Flemish productivity per capita is about 13% higher than that in [[Wallonia]], and wages are about 7% higher than in Wallonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=DMA28052005_007 Onze Waalse collega’s kunnen niet volgen], 29 May 2005, Het Nieuwsblad&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanders was one of the first continental European areas to undergo the [[Industrial Revolution]], in the 19th century. Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846–50). After World War II, [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]] experienced a fast expansion of the [[chemical]] and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] sent the economy into a recession. The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous [[Flemish Diamond]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Het belang van de Vlaamse Ruit vanuit economisch perspectief ''The importance of the Flemish Diamond from an economical perspective''|language=Dutch|author=Vanhaverbeke, Wim|url=http://edata.ub.unimaas.nl/www-edocs/loader/file.asp?id=264|publisher=Netherlands Institute of Business Organization and Strategy Research, [[University of Maastricht]]|accessdate=19 May 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314033239/http://edata.ub.unimaas.nl/www-edocs/loader/file.asp?id=264| archivedate = 14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.

Belgium is a founding member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951, which evolved into the present-day [[European Union]]. In 1999, the [[euro]], the single European currency, was introduced in Flanders. It replaced the [[Belgian franc]] in 2002.

The Flemish economy is strongly export-oriented, in particular of high value-added goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flanderstrade.com/site/internetEN.nsf/vPAG/aboutflanders__Economic?opendocument |title=Flanders: export-driven economy |access-date=2017-01-26 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224091510/http://www.flanderstrade.com/site/internetEN.nsf/vPAG/aboutflanders__Economic?opendocument |archive-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and non-ferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market within a [[customs union|customs]] and [[currency union]]—the [[Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union]]. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922551185|title=Flemish.|last=Dean.|first=Amory,|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Com|isbn=1291768084|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=922551185}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Antwerp is the number one diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based [[BASF]] plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities in Antwerp include car manufacturing, telecommunications, photographic products.

Flanders is home to several science and technology institutes, such as [[IMEC]], [[Flemish Institute for Technological Research|VITO]], [[Flanders DC]] and [[Flanders DRIVE]].

=== Infrastructure ===
{{Main|Transport in Belgium}}
Flanders has developed an extensive transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways and highways. The [[Port of Antwerp]] is the second-largest in Europe, after [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portofantwerp.com/portal/page/portal/POA_EN/Focus%20op%20de%20haven/Een%20wereldhaven|title=Focus on the port|publisher=Port of Antwerp|accessdate=27 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828050144/http://www.portofantwerp.com/portal/page/portal/POA_EN/Focus%20op%20de%20haven/Een%20wereldhaven|archivedate=28 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ports are [[Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge|Bruges-Zeebrugge]], [[Port of Ghent|Ghent]] and [[Port of Ostend|Ostend]], of which Bruges and Ostend are located at the {{ill|Belgian coast|nl|Belgische Kust}}.

Whereas railways are managed by the federal [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], other public transport ([[De Lijn]]) and roads are managed by the Flemish region.

The main airport is [[Brussels Airport]], the only other civilian airport with scheduled services in Flanders is [[Antwerp International Airport]], but there are two other ones with cargo or charter flights: [[Ostend-Bruges International Airport]] and [[Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport]], both in West Flanders.

== Demographics ==
{{Further|Demographics of Belgium|Flemish people|List of cities in Flanders}}
The highest population density is found in the area circumscribed by the [[Brussels]]-[[Antwerp]]-[[Ghent]]-[[Leuven]] agglomerations that surround Mechelen and is known as the [[Flemish Diamond]], in other important urban centres as [[Bruges]], [[Roeselare]] and [[Kortrijk]] to the west, and notable centres [[Turnhout]] and [[Hasselt]] to the east. On 1 January 2015, the Flemish Region had a population of 6,444,127 and about 15% of the 1,175,173&lt;!--2015-01-01--&gt; people in the Brussels Region are also considered Flemish.{{efn |name="Note_Nationality-Minority-Education"}}&lt;ref name="statbel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statbel.fgov.be/ |title=Statistics Belgium |publisher=[[Federal Public Service Economy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Religion ===
{{Further|Religion in Belgium}}
The (Belgian) ''[[Laïcité|laicist]]'', or secularist, constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the various governments in general respect this right in practice. Since independence, Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong [[freethought]] movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics, since the 20th century in Flanders mainly via the Christian trade union [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions|ACV]] and the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party (CD&amp;V). According to the ''2001 Survey and Study of Religion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2004|year=2004|publisher=US Department of State, [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35444.htm|accessdate=28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 47 percent of the Belgian population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church, while Islam is the second-largest religion at 3.5 percent.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered more religious than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious, and 36% believed that God created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine 22 November 2006 p. 14 [The Dutch language term 'gelovig' is in the text translated as 'religious', more precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of God in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, and/or in some [[afterlife]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews [[History of the Jews in Belgium|have been present]] in Flanders for a long time, in particular [[History of the Jews in Antwerp|in Antwerp]]. More recently, Muslims have immigrated to Flanders, now forming the largest minority religion with about 3.9% in the Flemish Region and 25% in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Jan Hertogen, [http://www.indymedia.be/en/node/29363 In België wonen 628.751 moslims], Indymedia, 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Muslim group is Moroccan in origin, while the second largest is Turkish in origin.

=== Education ===
{{Further|Education in Flanders}}
Education is compulsory from the ages of six to 18, but most [[Flemish people|Flemings]] continue to study until around 23. Among the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries in 1999, Flanders had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in [[postsecondary education]]. Flanders also scores very high in international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science. However, the success is not evenly spread: ethnic minority youth score consistently lower, and the difference is larger than in most comparable countries.{{efn |name="Note_Nationality-Minority-Education"}}

Mirroring the historical political conflicts between the freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a [[subsidy|subsidised]] religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must be able to prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the [[Catholic school]]s—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation {{ill|VSKO|nl|Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen}}. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. [[Waldorf education|Steiner]], [[Montessori]], or [[Freinet]]) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.

During the school year 2003–2004, 68.30% of the total population of children between the ages of six and 18 went to subsidized private schools (both religious schools or 'methodical pedagogies' schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education in Flanders|work=A broad view of the Flemish educational landscape|year=2005|publisher=Ministry of the Flemish Community|url=http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/publicaties/2005/educationinflandersbroadview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The big freedom given to schools results in a constant competition to be the "best" school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools to be the best school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as one of the main reasons for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools more eager to expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or "easier" schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.

=== Healthcare ===
{{Further|Healthcare in Belgium}}
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
Healthcare is a federal matter, but the [[Flemish Government]] is responsible for care, health education and [[preventive care]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Dutch language|Flemish|Flemish people|Flemish Movement}}
At first sight, ''Flemish culture'' is defined by the [[Dutch language]] and its gourmandic mentality, as compared to the more Calvinistic Dutch culture. [[Dutch paintings|Dutch]] and [[Flemish painting]]s enjoyed more equal international admiration.

=== Language and literature ===
[[File:Guidogezelle.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Guido Gezelle|Gezelle]] in [[Bruges]], by sculptor [[Jules Lagae]]]]

The standard language in Flanders is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the [[Dutch Language Union]] (''Nederlandse Taalunie''), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariate.&lt;ref name="Taalunie1"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/wie_zijn_wij/ | title = De Taalunie – Wie zijn wij? | language = Dutch | publisher = Nederlandse Taalunie | accessdate =19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taalunie2"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/werkwijze_en_beleid/ | title = De Taalunie – Werkwijze en beleid | language = Dutch | publisher = Nederlandse Taalunie | accessdate =17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Flemish]] can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://odur.let.rug.nl/~hoeksema/divid-4.ppt |format = ppt |title = College 4 – 1830 Belgische onafhankelijkheid, Noord-Zuidverschillen, Dialecten en de rijksgrens, Frans-Vlaanderen |language = Dutch |author = Hoeksema, Jack |publisher = [[University of Groningen]] (host site) |accessdate =19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest difference between Belgian Dutch and Dutch used in the Netherlands is in the pronunciation of words. The Dutch spoken in the north of the Netherlands is typically described as being "sharper", while Belgian Dutch is "softer". In Belgian Dutch, there are also fewer vowels pronounced as [[diphthongs]]. When it comes to spelling, Belgian Dutch language purists historically avoided writing words using a French spelling, or searched for specific translations of words derived from French, while the Dutch prefer to stick with French spelling, as it differentiates Dutch more from the neighbouring German. For example, the Dutch word "punaise" (English: ''[[Drawing pin]]'') is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word "duimspijker" (literally: ''thumb spike'') as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch. Other proposals by purists were sometimes accepted, and sometimes reverted again in later spelling revisions. As language purists were quite often professionally involved in language (e.g. as a teacher), these unofficial purist translations are found more often in Belgian Dutch texts.

The earliest example of literature in non-[[standardized dialect]]s in the current area of Flanders is [[Hendrik van Veldeke]]'s ''Eneas Romance'', the first courtly romance in a [[Germanic language]] (12th century). With a writer of [[Hendrik Conscience]]'s stature, [[Flemish literature]] rose ahead of French literature in Belgium's early history.&lt;ref name="Letterkundig-Museum"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.letterkundigmuseum.nl/tabid/92/BiographyID/19/BiographyName/HendrikConscience/Mode/BiographyDetails/Default.aspx |title = Hendrik Conscience (biography) |language = Dutch |publisher = Letterkundig Museum, The Hague, The Netherlands |accessdate = 21 February 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094015/http://www.letterkundigmuseum.nl/tabid/92/BiographyID/19/BiographyName/HendrikConscience/Mode/BiographyDetails/Default.aspx |archivedate = 24 July 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Couttenier"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/cout003nati01_01/cout003nati01_01_0001.php

Influential Flemish writers include [[Ernest Claes]], [[Stijn Streuvels]] and [[Felix Timmermans]]. Their novels mostly describe rural life in Flanders in the 19th century and at beginning of the 20th. Widely read by the older generations, they are considered somewhat old-fashioned by present-day critics. Some famous Flemish writers of the early 20th century wrote in French, including Nobel Prize winners (1911) [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Emile Verhaeren]]. They were followed by a younger generation, including [[Paul van Ostaijen]] and [[Gaston Burssens]], who ''[[Activism|activated]]'' the [[Flemish Movement]].&lt;ref name=de-Ridder/&gt; Still widely read and translated into other languages (including English) are the novels of authors such as [[Willem Elsschot]], [[Louis Paul Boon]] and [[Hugo Claus]]. The recent crop of writers includes the novelists [[Tom Lanoye]] and [[Herman Brusselmans]], and poets such as the married couple [[Herman de Coninck]] and [[Kristien Hemmerechts]].

==== Languages ====

At the creation of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. Historically Flanders was a Dutch-speaking region. For a long period, French was used as a [[second language]] and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the [[municipalities with language facilities]], along the language border and the [[municipalities with language facilities#Rim municipalities|Brussels periphery]] (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades.

In [[French Flanders]], French is the only official language and now the native language of the majority of the population, but there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there. French is also the primary language in the officially bilingual [[Brussels Capital Region]], (see [[Francization of Brussels]]).

Many Flemings are also able to speak French, children in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it hard to maintain a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements makes it easier to learn and maintain the English language. This makes the Flemish people very proficient in English (in Europe, only Sweden and Malta have a better knowledge of English as a second language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsmonkey.be/article/22936%7CExamens |title=Examens Frans, Engels en Duits moeten moeilijker worden volgens minister Crevits.

=== Media ===
{{Further|Television in Belgium}}
The public radio and television broadcaster in Flanders is [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], which operates the TV channels [[één]], [[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]], [[Ketnet]], [[OP12]] and (together with the Netherlands) [[BVN]]. Flemish provinces each have up to two TV channels as well. Commercial television broadcasters include [[vtm]] and [[Vier]] (VT4). Popular TV series are for example ''[[Thuis]]'' and ''[[F.C. De Kampioenen]]''.

The five most successful Flemish films were ''[[Loft (2008 film)|Loft]]'' (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), ''[[Koko Flanel]]'' (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), ''[[Hector (1987 film)|Hector]]'' (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), ''[[Daens (film)|Daens]]'' (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and ''[[The Alzheimer Case|De Zaak Alzheimer]]'' (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The first and last ones were directed by [[Erik Van Looy]], and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively ''[[The Loft (2012 film)|The Loft]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Memory of a Killer]]''. The other three ones were directed by [[Stijn Coninx]].

Newspapers are grouped under three main publishers: [[De Persgroep]] with ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'', the most popular newspaper in Flanders, ''[[De Morgen]]'' and ''[[De Tijd]]''. Then [[Corelio]] with ''{{ill|De Gentenaar|nl}}'', the oldest extant Flemish newspaper, ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'' and ''[[De Standaard]]''. Lastly, [[Concentra]] publishes ''[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]'' and ''[[Het Belang van Limburg]]''.

Magazines include ''[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]'' and ''[[HUMO]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">As defined by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], '''geo-literacy''' is "the ability to use [[geographic]] understanding and geographic reasoning to make decisions".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416071705/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |archivedate=April 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "geo-literacy" arose from the National Geographic Society's "Fight against Geographic Illiteracy." The organization released various media to help explain the concept to the general public. In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, "The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect [[natural resource|natural]] and cultural resources, reduce violent [[Armed conflict|conflict]], and improve the [[quality of life]] worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining [[Competition (economics)|economic competitiveness]], quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geography.about.com/b/2012/05/13/geo-literacy.htm | title=Geo-Literacy | publisher=About.com | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | author=Rosenberg, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have released various media to help explain it to the general public.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Fund for Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130105/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1 |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
According to Edelson, the 3 components of geo-literacy are:&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;
* Interactions-Understanding of human and natural systems
* Interconnections-Geographic reasoning
* Implications-Systematic decision-making

==Educational activities==
"Kid World Citizen", a site which provides "multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world", and who, listed the following "age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2012/05/13/what-is-geo-literacy/ | title=What is Geo-Literacy? | publisher=Kid World Citizen | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Explore different homes around the world and guess why the types of home fit their environment
* Discover why certain cultures celebrate certain holidays, and what is important to them
* Investigate different [[habitats]] and [[biomes]], such as the [[rainforest]]; look at tangible ways kids can prevent their destruction
* Surround kids with geography: study maps, [[cartography|create maps]], follow maps, play with maps. The more you develop their spatial intelligence when they’re younger, the more kids will understand their place in this world.
* Learn about the [[water cycle]] and the conserving and managing our freshwater resources
* Research your child’s favorite animal, turning it into a global lesson about protecting their habitat and food sources; what decisions can we make that will affect the outcome of this animal?

==Research Studies and Education Projects==
In 2012, InTeGrate ("a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/info_team_members/meetings/geo_lit_agenda.html | title=Module Author Meeting Agenda | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier Uses of the Term "geo-literacy"==

In 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] published a research report/journal article entitled "Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live", which included  "a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ658647&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ658647 | title=Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Arizona Geographic Information Council|Arizona Geographic Alliance]] launched a project called "The GeoLiteracy Project" that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction.  In this case, their term "GeoLiteracy" referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy. 

In 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called "The Geo-Literacy Project".  LaMar describes geo-literacy as "the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, [[geology]], and local [[history]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Ashley|title=Geo-Literacy: Using Technology to Forge New Ground|url=http://www.edutopia.org/geo-literacy-forging-new-ground|work=Edutopia|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5515">The '''geology of [[Panama]]''' includes the complex tectonic interplay between the Pacific, Cocos and Nazca plates, the Caribbean Plate and the Panama Microplate.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0306a/report.pdf|year=1957|title=Geology and Paleontology Of Canal Zone and Adjoining Parts of Panama|author=W. P. Woodring|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
The Cocos and Nazca plates formed in the [[Miocene]]. The Panama Microplate is made of oceanic crust [[basalt]], similar to the basalt plateau at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. The isthmus formed due to convergent tectonics of the eastern Pacific subduction zone, which created a magmatic arc extending from southern North America.

The center of the isthmus, from Arenal volcano in Costa Rica to El Valle volcano in Panama was uplifted during the subduction of the unusually thick Cocos Ridge oceanic crust, which also produced the four kilometer high Talamanca Range. The western edge of the Caribbean Plate—the Central American volcanic arc—also collided in the [[Neogene]] and was compressed as the South American Plate moved northward. The El Valle volcano is the easternmost stratovolcano in Central America. [[Dacite]] and [[andesite]] flows from five to 10&amp;nbsp;million years ago are the oldest rocks, followed by a period of quiet 3.4&amp;nbsp;million years ago and newer dacite domes and [[pyroclastic flows]] between 900,000 and 200,000 years ago. The volcano was the result of crust subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andesite and dacite genesis via contrasting processes: the geology and geochemistry of El Valle Volcano, Panama|first1=Mare J.|last1=Defant|first2=Lee F.|last2=Clark|first3=Robert H.|last3=Stewart|first4=Mark S.|last4=Drummond|first5=Jelle Z.|last5=de Boer|first6=René C.|last6=Maury|first7=Hervé|last7=Bellon|first8=Thomas E.|last8=Jackson|first9=Juan F.|last9=Restrepo|date=1 January 1991|journal=Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology|volume=106|issue=3|pages=309–324|doi=10.1007/bf00324560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of these forces produced the Isthmus of Panama and resulted in different sea surface salinity between the Pacific and Atlantic since 4.2&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/29/3/207/191840|title=Role of Panama uplift on oceanic freshwater balance|first1=Gerald H.|last1=Haug|first2=Ralf|last2=Tiedemann|first3=Rainer|last3=Zahn|first4=A.

In the remote southeastern province of Darien, crystalline basement rock of the San Blas Complex forms massifs in the northeast and southwest, dating to the [[Cretaceous]], [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. These rocks and others in the north such as [[rhyolite]], [[dacite]], basaltic andesite, [[granodiorite]] and quartz [[diorite]] indicate that the region was a separate magmatic arc until 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago. In the south, pre-collision basement rocks include radiolarian [[chert]], pillow basalt and [[diabase]]. Complex faulting and folding formed the Chucunaque-Tuira Basin includes three kilometers of sediments from the Miocene deposited during the collision with South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/116/11-12/1327/125266|title=The Geology of the Darien, Panama, and the late Miocene-Pliocene collision of the Panama arc with northwestern South America|first1=A.

Offshore of Colombia and western Panama, the Panama Basin formed between 27 and eight million years ago due to asymmetric sea-floor spreading between the Nazca and Cocos plates. The Mapelo rift and the Yaquina graben in the eastern basin are remnants of old and now inactive spreading centers. Between 22 and 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago, hotspot volcanism generated the Caregie, Cocos and Malpelo ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/89/7/981/187594|title=Structure and tectonic history of the eastern Panama Basin|first1=PETER|last1=LONSDALE|first2=KIM D.|last2=KLITGORD|date=9 November 1978|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=89|issue=7|pages=981|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1978)89&lt;981:SATHOT&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guide Falls''' and '''Upper Guide Falls''', a [[Waterfall#Types|tiered{{endash}}cascade waterfall]] on the Guide River, is located in the [[North West Tasmania|North West]] region of [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name= thinktasmania/&gt;

==Location and features==
The waterfalls are situated about 19km south of {{TAScity|Burnie}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guide falls|url=http://www.discoverburnie.net/what-to-see/guide-falls.html|journal=discoverburnie.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an elevation of {{convert|187|m}} [[Australian Height Datum|above sea level]] and descend in the range of {{convert|22|-|38|m}}.&lt;ref name=bonzle/&gt;

To access the falls from Burnie, take the road towards [[Cradle Mountain]], and then turn right just outside the boundary of Ridgley and continue down into the gully and turn left at a posted gate sign. Once entered, the Guide River is to the right and continue to drive up the gravel road where the falls are located. The top is safe and there are great view from the fenced lookout. There is also a set of steps that lead down to the bottom of the falls. Around the vicinity there are also picnic tables and barbecue areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-guide-falls.html|title=Guide Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|publisher=Johnny T.

The '''Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis''' (1965 to 1991) pioneered early [[cartography|cartographic]] and architectural computer applications that led to integrated [[GIS|geographic information systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/81657/859797671-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 |format=PDF |title=Stratified, Destratified, and Hybrid GIS: Organizing a Cross-Disciplinary Territory for Design |publisher=Dspace.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the Laboratory's influential programs included SYMAP, SYMVU, GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT.  The Laboratory's Odyssey project created a [[geographic information system]] that served as a milestone in the development of integrated mapping systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisman, Nick, [http://downloads2.esri.com/ESRIpress/images/82/HarvardBLAD_screen.pdf "Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping At Harvard Became GIS"], ESRI (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory influenced numerous computer graphic, mapping and architectural systems such as [[Intergraph]], [[Computervision]], and [[Esri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu/publish_web/CGA_Conferences/2015_Lab_Legacy/2015_CGA_Conference_Program.pdf |format=PDF |title=CGA Conference 2015 |publisher=Cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
In 1963, during a training session held at [[Northwestern University]], [[Chicago]] architect [[Howard T. Fisher]] encountered computer maps on [[urban planning]] and [[civil engineering]] produced by Edgar Horwood's group at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/1/26/howard-fisher-gsd-proffessor-dies-at/|title=Howard Fisher, GSD Proffessor, Dies at 75|work=thecrimson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher conceived a computer mapping software program, SYMAP (Synergistic Mapping), to produce conformant, proximal, and contour maps on a line printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health Based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their Applications | pmc=4315644 | pmid=25684850 | doi=10.5455/aim.2014.22.402-405 | volume=22 | year=2014 | journal=Acta Inform Med | pages=402–5 | last1 = Fradelos | first1 = EC | last2 = Papathanasiou | first2 = IV | last3 = Mitsi | first3 = D | last4 = Tsaras | first4 = K | last5 = Kleisiaris | first5 = CF | last6 = Kourkouta | first6 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher applied for a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to explore thematic mapping based on early SYMAP outputs, which was awarded in 1965.  In association with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] providing facilities in Robinson Hall in [[Harvard Yard]] as part of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/when-the-gsd-designed-software-experiments-in-computer-vision.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ford Foundation provided $294,000 over three years to seed the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics.  Working with programmer Betty Benson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisandscience.com/2009/11/17/charting-the-unknown-how-computer-mapping-at-harvard-became-gis/|title=Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping at Harvard Became GIS|work=GIS and Science|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher completed SYMAP for distribution in 1966.  Also under Fisher's direction, SYMVU and GRID programs were developed.  A 1968 reorganisation followed Fisher reaching Harvard's mandatory retirement age and led to renaming as the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.  From 1972, the Laboratory was based in Graduate School's newly built Gund Hall.

The Laboratory's original and continuing goals were:
# To design and develop computer software for the analysis and graphic display of spatial data.
# To distribute the resulting software to governmental agencies, educational organizations and interested professionals.
# To conduct research concerning the definition and analysis of spatial structure and process."&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1978, Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major research outputs==
[[File:SYMAP - LAB-LOG 1980.png|thumb|SYMAP - comparison of conformant, contour, proximal, and trend surface outputs]]SYMAP's ability to print cheap, albeit low quality, maps using readily available technology led to rapid adoption in the late 1960s.  SYMVU software, developed in 1969 to illustrate surface displays, was another popular product.  GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT products further explored the raster versus vector approach to mapping.  The Laboratory gained a reputation for solid output leading to several commercially successful projects and significant budgetary independence for a [[research institute]].  Some struggles with restructuring Geographic Base Files - Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF-DIME files, an early vector and polygonal data structure) for the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau's]] Urban Atlas in 1975 inspired the Laboratory to develop an integrated suite of programs beneath by a common user interface and common data manipulation software.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Allan H, "Shareable Data Bases Key For Effective Mapmaking", Computerworld, 8 May 1978, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 this suite became the Odyssey project.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Anne M, "A New ODYSSEY Begun", Context #10", Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1979), pages 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Odyssey project's aim was to produce a vector GIS that provided [[spatial analysis]] of many different forms within a single system.

As of 1980, in addition to early Odyssey modules, the Laboratory sold the following programs for display and analysis of spatial data&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1980, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ASPEX - 3d data perspectives;
* CALFORM - shaded vector maps;
* DOT.MAP - contour, shaded, and dot-distribution maps from gridded data;
* KWIC - key-word-in-context programs for indexing bibliographic references;
* POLYVRT - data conversion and analysis of polygonal data;
* SYMAP - line printer mapping producing conformant (areas), contour, trend surface, and proximal (also known as [[Voronoi diagram]] or Thiessan polygonal)
* GIMMS (Geographic Information Management and Mapping System) - a general purpose mapping system written by Tom Waugh at the [[University of Edinburgh]];
* MDS(X) - a multidimensional pattern detection and scaling system under the direction of Tony Coxon at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff]].

The 1982 release of Odyssey included seven programs for geographical analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics:a Poster Exhibit|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic39008.files/History_LCG.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Isites.harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the Laboratory's software, it was written in [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] and operated on several platforms. The POLYPS and PRISM modules could draw maps on a variety of vector display devices.
* PROTEUS - editing, projections, generalization, aggregation, simple display;
* CYCLONE - topological checking of nodes, error correction;
* CYCLOPS - topological checking of polygons, produce graphics shape files;
* WHIRLPOOL - planar enforcement: overlay, error detection of input;
* CALYPSO - attribute manipulations (areal interpolation);
* POLYPS - planar choropleth maps;
* PRISM - raised 3d prism maps.

==Activities==
The Laboratory distributed software, and later data, at cost, thus encouraging experimentation.  The Laboratory conducted correspondence courses, hosted numerous conferences, and worked on environmental planning and architectural projects with the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  From 1978 to 1983, the Laboratory hosted a popular annual Harvard Computer Graphics Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/Harvard/general.pdf |format=PDF |title=Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis |publisher=Vasulka.org |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Geoffrey Dutton, a Research Associate at the Laboratory from 1969 through 1984, created the first holographic thematic map, "America Graph Fleeting" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?term=holographic&amp;module=objects&amp;type=keyword&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;page=5&amp;kv=71277&amp;record=208&amp;module=objects|title=MIT Museum|work=Mit.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rotating strip of 3,000 holograms depicted an animated sequence of 3d maps showing US population growth from 1790 to 1970, generated by the Laboratory's ASPEX program. Dutton also contributed the program DOT.MAP to the Laboratory's family of distributed software (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Extensible Approach to Imagery of Gridded Data|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/563858.563886|publisher = ACM|journal = SIGGRAPH '77 Proceedings|date = 1977|location = New York, NY, USA|pages = 159–169|doi = 10.1145/563858.563886|first = Geoffrey|last = Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977 James Dougenik, Duane Niemeyer, and Nicholas Chrisman developed contiguous area cartograms.&lt;ref&gt;"Context 1982-83", Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, Harvard College (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bruce Donald]], working at the Laboratory from 1978 to 1984, wrote BUILDER, a program for computer-aided architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Bruce, "BUILDER: A Database and Display Program for Computer-aided Architectural Design" (a system for representation and display of design problems in architecture and urban design), Harvard Computer Graphics Conference, Session 17, Architectural Practice (27 July 27, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.duke.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/ |title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics |publisher=Cs.duke.edu |date=1982-07-27 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BUILDER produced plan and shaded perspectives that popularised computer-aided-design in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/|title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics|work=cs.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/papers/index.html#Builder|title=Bruce R.

The early period of the Laboratory saw staff numbers grow to approximately 40 in 1970, but shrink to half a dozen by 1972 as grants expired.  The Odyssey project grew the Laboratory from about 12 people in 1977&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1977, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; to forty people by 1981.  The Laboratory shrank significantly back to approximately half a dozen people from 1982 until its closure in June 1991.

==Later period and influence==
From 1979 the Laboratory was encouraged to develop external software sales and entered into licensing agreements for this purpose, most notably with Synercom and ISSCO Corporation (sold to [[Computer associates|Computer Associates]] in 1987) for Odyssey.  However, the licensing agreements had weak to non-existent technology exploitation and non-compete clauses, so potential purchasers were frustrated in attempting to license from a competitor often preferentially positioning its proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~gisteac/ilw/generic_resources/books_and_papers/Thx1ARTICLE.pdf |format=PDF |title=The History of GIS |publisher=Geos.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential purchasers often redeveloped Odyssey functions rather than wait for licenses.  Meanwhile, having carved out the potential commercial interests, from 1981 the Harvard Graduate School of Design sought less commercial work and an increased focus on research, though with reduced budgets.  "But the timing of this burgeoning commercialism of the Lab's activities collided with the moment in history when Harvard's President [[Derek Bok]] set out to clarify the blurred lines between academic research and development on the one hand, and more clearly defined commercial activities on the other."&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Eric, "Notes On Leaving Harvard: An Insider's View", Computer Graphics News (November/December 1981), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Financial strain and the lack of commercial inspiration for projects led to the dispersal of many team members from 1981.  Despite some further research during the late 1980s, the Laboratory closed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html/ |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918043755/http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html |archivedate=September 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odyssey became the template for subsequent GIS software, cited as an inspiration by numerous commercial efforts in mapping and architecture, such as M&amp;S Computing (later [[Intergraph]]), [[Computervision]], and [[Geodat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gis.harvard.edu/events/conferences/2015-cga-conference-computer-graphics-and-spatial-analysis-lab-and-its-legacy|title=2015 CGA Conference: The Lab for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (1965-1991) and Its Legacy|work=harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mainelli, Michael, "[http://www.zyen.com/PDF/GEODAT.pdf Geodat: A Cartographic Data Base for Petroleum Mapping]", Communications of Harvard Computer Graphics Week, Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory was an enormous influence on the commercial Environmental Systems Research Institute, [[Esri]], founded in 1969 by [[Jack Dangermond]], a landscape architect graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Design who had worked as a research assistant at the Laboratory during 1968 and 1969.  Scott Morehouse, the development lead for the Odyssey project, worked at the lab from 1977 to 1981. When revenues from Odyssey did not meet expectations, his team's resources started to dwindle, and Morehouse left to join Jack at Esri to build a next-generation GIS platform that was to be ArcInfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucgis.org/ucgis-fellow/scott-morehouse|title=Scott Morehouse - UCGIS|work=Ucgis.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's intimate knowledge of the Odyssey geoprocessing model and code base, combined with Jack's insights into how to put the 'IS' in 'GIS' evolved the Laboratory's GIS prototype processors into a system that could effectively and interactively manage, process, edit, and display vector geodata and its scalar attributes that addressed evolving market needs for more robust GIS capabilities.

'''ISO 3166-2:AD''' is the entry for [[Andorra]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Andorra, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[parishes of Andorra|7 parishes]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|AD}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Andorra. The second part is two digits:
* 02&amp;ndash;06: parishes created before 1978 except [[Andorra la Vella]]
* 07&amp;ndash;08: Andorra la Vella and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] (Escaldes-Engordany split from Andorra la Vella in 1978)

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Jean-Baptiste Berthier''' (1721–1804) was an officer (Lieutenant-Colonel) in the French Corps of Topographical Engineers during the reigns of [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]]. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jean-Baptiste Berthier was born on January 6, 1721 in [[Tonnerre, Yonne|Tonnerre]], France.

===Career===
After attracting the attention of ''marchal de camp'' [[Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, duc de Belle-Isle]], he was deputed by him to supervise construction of several prominent [[Paris]] public buildings, notably those of the ministries of war, navy and foreign affairs in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. 

In 1758, he was made Director of Military Survey to King Louis XV, a position he retained with Louis XVI for whom he prepared the famous topographic maps of the Royal hunting grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Watson,p.13&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Marie Françoise L'Huillier de La Serre, by French school of the 18th century.jpg|thumb|right|Marie Françoise L'Huillier de La Serre]]

===Personal life===
He married his first wife, Marie Françoise L'Huillier de La Serre, in 1746. They had five children. The oldest of five children, [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]] (1753), would become [[Marshal of France]], with the other three sons also serving in the French Army: Charles (1760) in North America, while César (1765) and Victor-Léopold (1770) became generals during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson,p.13&lt;/ref&gt; His only daughter is only remembered as Madame d'Ogeranville.&lt;ref&gt;Junot Abrantès, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

Widowed, he remarried Françoise Chéron. They had a son Alexandre Joseph Berthier (1792–1849), who married his cousin Thérèse Léopoldine Berthier (1806–1882), and had issue, Viscounts Berthier de Wagram, extinct in 1949.

===Death===
He died on May 21, 1804 in Paris, France.

'''Jean Papire Masson''' {{lang-la|Papirius}}&lt;ref&gt;Also Jean Papyre Masson&lt;/ref&gt; (1544, in [[Saint-Germain-Laval, Loire]] &amp;ndash; 1611) was a French humanist historian, known also as a geographer, biographer, literary critic and jurist.

==Life==
Masson was initially a [[Jesuit]], but left the Society.&lt;ref name="JuvignyMaine1772"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Antoine Rigoley de Juvigny|author2=François Grudé de La Croix Du Maine |author3=Antoine Du Verdier |author4=Bernard de La Monnoye |title=Bibliothèque Françoise De La Croix Du Maine |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4FPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |year=1772 |location=Paris |publisher=Saillant &amp; Nyon / Lambert |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law at Angers under [[François Baudouin]] around 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randall C.

==Works==
He defended [[Antoine Matharel]] against [[François Hotman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Quentin Skinner]]|title=The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: The Age of Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyzDnCLWJugC&amp;pg=PA318|accessdate=28 July 2012|date=30 November 1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29435-5|page=318|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may in fact have written much of Matharel's ''Responsio'' (1575) to Hotman's [[monarchomach]] work ''[[Francogallia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=François Hotman|author2=Ralph E.

The Latin life of [[John Calvin]] attributed to Masson had a reputation in its time as fair-minded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irena Dorota Backus|title=Life Writing in Reformation Europe: Lives of Reformers by Friends, Disciples and Foes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_90Q5BAnTEwC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=28 July 2012|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6055-2|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Elder''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1542 – 1565) was a Scottish cartographer and writer. He was the tutor of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] in England.

==Life==
Elder was a native of [[Caithness]]. He passed twelve years of his life at the [[St Andrew's University|universities of St. Andrews]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], and appears to have entered the ministry. He went to England soon after the death of [[James V of Scotland]] in 1542. At Mary's accession Elder turned Roman Catholic, as is apparent from a letter addressed to [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of March|Robert Stewart]], bishop-elect of Caithness.&lt;ref&gt;Letter 'from the Citie of London... the first... of January, 1555,' which was published as 'The Copie of a Letter sent in to Scotlande of the ariuall and landynge and... marryage of... [[Philip II of Spain|Philippe, Prynce of Spaine]] to the [[Mary I of England|Princess Marye Quene of England]], solemnisated in the Citie of [[Winchester]]... whereunto is added a brefe overture or openyng of the legacion of [[Cardinal Pole|Cardinall Poole]] from the [[Sea Apostolyke of Rome]], with the substaunce of his oracyon to the kyng and Quenes Maiestie for the reconcilement of the [[realme of Englande]] to the unitie of the Catholyke Churche. With the very copie also of the Supplycaciō exhibited to their highnesses by the [[three Estates]] assembled in the parliamente wherein they... haue submitted thēselyes to the Popes Holy , London [1555]. The letter is reprinted in 'The Chronicle of Queen Jane,' Sec. (Camd. Soc.)&lt;/ref&gt; He sent with it verses and [[adage]]s written with the hand of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], the bishop's nephew, Elder then being with Darnley, who was not yet nine years of age, at [[Temple Newsam]], Yorkshire. He refers to Darnley's noble parents as his patrons.

This John Elder seems to be the Scot described by [[Nicholas Throckmorton]] at the coronation of [[Francis II of France]](or was it more surely ARTHUR LALLART). Throckmorton wrote on 19 September 1559 that Elder had described the policy of [[Edmund Bonner]] [[Bishop of London]] and [[Cardinal Pole]] in the time of [[Mary I of England]] to [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine]]. He added that Elder was "as great a praticer, and as dangerous for the matters of England, as any that I know." Throckmorton advised [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] to have Elder's English acquaintance watched.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Patrick, ed.,  ''Full View of the Public Transactions in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth,'' vol.1, London (1740), p. 233, Throckmorton to Elizabeth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=oxQFAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Stevenson, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of State Papers Elizabeth'', 1558-1559, vol.1, London (1863)] p.262 no.1335: Strickland, Agnes, ''Lives of the Queens of Scotland and English Princesses'', vol.2, Blackwood (1851), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1561, Elder told one of the servants of the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]] that he had shown Darnley's juvenile handwriting to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The servant, possibly Thomas Bishop, was distrustful of him and thought he had the wit to be a spy, "he haitht wytt to playe the aspye where he listitht." He joined Lord Darnley and his wife Mary, Queen of Scots in August 1565, travelling from Flanders, according to a letter of the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]]&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Joseph, ed., ''Selections from Unpublished Manuscripts'', Maitland Club (1837), pp.101-2, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He presented to [[Henry VIII]], or [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] a 'plot' or map of the [[realm of Scotland]], being a description of all the chief towns, castles, and abbeys in each county and shire, with the situation of the principal isles. In an accompanying letter to Henry, Elder is very severe on [[David Beaton]], denouncing him as the pestiferous cardinal, and his bishops as blind and ignorant; in the subscription he styles himself clerk and a 'redshank,' meaning by the latter designation, it is supposed, 'a roughfooted Scot or highlander.'&lt;ref&gt;This letter, which is now preserved in the [[British Museum]], Royal MS. 18, A. xxxviii., was printed in the ''[[Bannatyne Club]] Miscellany'', vol.1, (1827), pp.1-18, the map &amp; description of Scotland is lost.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably for this writing, "John Elder, Redshank Scott" was given a reward of £5 on 12 August 1547.&lt;ref&gt;Dasent, J. R., ed., ''Acts of the Privy Council'', 1547-1550, new series, vol.2, London (1890) p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another surviving letter by Elder is addressed to Mr. Secretary Paget, dated from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], 6 October 1545. This gives an account of the operations of the army under the command of the [[Earl of Hertford]] in the [[The Rough Wooing|invasion of Scotland]] between 8 and 23 September 1545, minutely detailing their daily proceedings, with a list of the towns, villages and steadings  burnt each day. He mentions that the Governor of Scotland, [[Regent Arran]], was sick with 'colic &amp; stone', physicians checked his water, and he could not ride.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.20 part 2 (1907), no.533.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a New Years gift to [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of March|Lord Robert Stewart]], [[Bishop of Caithness]], Elder wrote a description of the wedding of [[Mary I of England]] and [[Philip II of Spain]]. This was printed in 1555 as, ''The copie of a letter sent in to Scotlande of the arivall and landynge, and most noble marryage of ... Philippe, prynce of Spaine to the ... Princes Marye quene of England solemnisated in the citie of Winchester.''&lt;ref&gt;Elder, John, ''Letter sent into Scotlande'', (1555)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape photography''' shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of [[nature]] but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes.

==Objectives==
[[File:Mount Aragats near Aparan.jpg|thumb|Photograph showing weather and distant mountains, Armenia (2008) ]]
Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons.  Perhaps the most common is to recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling.  Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.&lt;ref name="caputo_2007_08_natl_geographic"&gt;Caputo, Robert, [http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-tips/landscape-photography-tips/ "Landscape Photography Tips"], ''National Geographic,'' August 2007, (from ''Photography Field Guide: Landscapes and Ultimate Photography Field Guide: Landscapes'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kevin_mcneal_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;McNeal, Kevin with interviewer Dimitri Vasileiou, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "In Conversation...

Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]], devoid of human influence—instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light.&lt;ref name="brad_ellement_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006).

Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Mark Gray (photographer)|Mark Gray]], [[Galen Rowell]], and [[Edward Weston]].

===Environmentalism===
Some of the most important and celebrated landscape photographers have been motivated by an appreciation of the beauty of the natural environment and a desire to see it preserved.  The work of [[William Henry Jackson]] in the mid-19th century was instrumental in convincing Congress in 1872 to create [[Yellowstone]], the first national park in the United States.&lt;ref name="whj"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of William Henry Jackson - 1843-1942 |url=http://www.whjcollection.com/life.htm |website=William Henry Jackson Collection at Scotts Bluff National Monument |publisher=The Scotts Bluff National Monument |accessdate=10 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195404/http://www.whjcollection.com/life.htm |archivedate= 3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography produced by [[Philip Hyde (photographer)|Philip Hyde]] for the [[Sierra Club]] found extensive use in promoting the preservation of natural places in the [[Western United States]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="phyde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Club History: Philip Hyde|url=http://vault.sierraclub.org/history/philip-hyde/|website=Sierra Club|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned landscape photographer Ansel Adams received both a Conservation Service Award and a Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of the influence of his work on the preservation of wilderness and fostering of environmental consciousness.&lt;ref name="ansel"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: Ansel Adams|url=http://vault.sierraclub.org/history/ansel-adams/|website=Sierra Club|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
[[File:Champ de colza Côte-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|'''Farm landscape''', in this case a rapeseed field in France.]]
Landscape photography commonly involves daylight photography of natural features of land, sky and waters, at a distance—though some landscapes may involve subjects in a scenic setting nearby, even close-up, and sometimes at night.&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph"&gt;Audley, Alice, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardeningadvice/11061612/A-beginners-guide-to-garden-photography.html "A beginner’s guide to garden photography"], ''The [London Daily] Telegraph,'' (Kent, England, U.K.), August 30, 2014, retrieved October 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography of artificial scenery, such as farm fields, orchards, gardens and architecture, may be considered "landscape" photography as well.  Even the presence of man-made structures (buildings, roads and bridges, etc.) or art (such as [[sculpture]]) may be considered "landscape" if presented in artistic settings or appearing (or photographed) in artistic style.&lt;ref name="charlie_waite_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph" /&gt;

Further, landscape photography is typically of relatively stationary subjects—arguably a form of "[[still life]]."  This tends to simplify the task, as opposed to photography of kinetic or live subjects.  However, landscape photography often overlaps the activity of [[wildlife photography]] and the two terms are used somewhat interchangeably; both wildlife and landscapes may be elements of the same picture or body of work.&lt;ref name="kevin_mcneal_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namibia_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Freeman, John, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Photographing Namibia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Landscape Photography Magazine'',  2014 Edition, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods (technical)==
Landscape photography typically requires relatively simple photographic equipment, though more sophisticated equipment can give a wider range of possibilities to the art.  An artist's eye for the subject can yield attractive and impressive results even with modest equipment.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer"&gt;Ruiz, Kathleen, Associate Professor of Integrated Arts [http://www.arts.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/AdvancedDigitalImagingSpring2015/Landscape%20Photography.htm "Landscape Photography"],  Department of the Arts - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY., retrieved October 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camera===
{{wide image|Tjuvholmen Aker brygge.jpg|1100px|[[Panoramic view]] of cityscape}}
Any ordinary (or sophisticated) camera -- [[film camera]] or [[digital camera]]—can be readily used for common landscape photography.  Higher-resolution and larger-format digital cameras (or larger-format [[photographic film|film]] cameras) permit a greater amount of detail and a wider range of artistic presentation.&lt;ref name="kevin_mcneal_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfolio_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="charlie_waite_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="art_of_adventure_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Hay, David (reviewer), [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Book Review: The Art Of Adventure"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }} (by Bruce Percy), ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a larger-format camera yields a more limited [[depth of field]] (range of the scene that is in focus) for a given aperture value, requiring greater care in focusing (see:  "Shutter Speed and Aperture", below).&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson_pentax_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Wilson, Keith, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Gear Test:  Pentax 645D"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }} (camera review), ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera with "panorama" function or frame can permit very wide images suitable for capturing a panoramic view.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;

===Lens===
[[File:LongExposurePinhole.jpg|thumb|20 minute exposure with no lens (pinhole camera)]]
[[File:Maldonado desde la Barra.jpg|thumb|Use of light at Sunset]]
For "wide open spaces," a [[wide-angle lens]] is generally the preferred lens, allowing a broad angle of view. However, medium-range to [[telephoto lens]]es can achieve satisfying imagery, as well, and can enable the capture of detailed scenery of smaller areas at greater distances.  Telephoto lenses can also facilitate limited ranges of focus, to enable the photographer to emphasize a specific area, at a fairly specific distance, in sharp focus, with the foreground and background blurred (see:  [[depth of field]]). A big difference between a wide-angles lens and a telephoto lens is the compression of the landscape; the wider the angle the more distance will appear between the foreground and background elements; however, a telephoto lens will make the same elements appear closer to each other. Other lenses that can help include the [[fisheye lens]] for extremely wide angles and dramatic effect, and the [[macro/micro lens]] for extreme close-up work.  While variable-range [[zoom lens]]es are widely used, some landscape photographers prefer fixed-range [[prime lens]]es to provide higher clarity and quality in the image.&lt;ref name="caputo_2007_08_natl_geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kevin_mcneal_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namibia_2014_landscape_photog_magz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;

===Medium: film or digital sensor===
The sensitivity to light, of the medium—the film or the digital camera sensor—is important in landscape photography, especially where great detail is required. In bright daylight, a "slow film" (low-[[ISO (film)|ISO]] film), or low-ISO digital camera sensor sensitivity setting (typically ISO 100, or perhaps 200), is generally preferred, allowing maximum precision and evenness of image.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"&gt;Ruiz, Kathleen, Assoc. Prof. of Integrated Arts [http://www.arts.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/AdvancedDigitalImagingSpring2015/Photography%20Basics.htm "Photography Basics"],  Department of the Arts - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY., retrieved October 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if there is movement in the scene, and the scene is in lower light—as with cloudy days, twilight, night, or in shaded areas—a higher ISO (up to the limits of the film or camera sensor, depending upon the shortage of light) may be desirable, to ensure that fast shutter speeds can be used to "freeze" the motion.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer" /&gt;

===Lighting and flash===
[[File:Port and lighthouse overnight storm with lightning in Port-la-Nouvelle.jpg|thumb|Ocean at night - 383 second exposure]]
Normally, landscape photography—being focused primarily on natural beauty—tends to be done with only naturally occurring ambient light.&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;

In some cases, however, artificial light is recommended or unavoidable.  Careful use of [[flash (photography)|flash]], continuous artificial lighting or reflective surfaces (e.g.: [[reflector (photography)|reflectors]]) for "fill" in shadowy areas is often used in close-up landscape photography (e.g.: garden spaces, small areas of dark forests, etc.).

However, given the broad expanses of open space that tend to dominate in landscape photography, artificial lighting is typically ineffective, or even destructive (causing the foreground to be wildly over-lit, and the background to become overly dark).&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer"/&gt;

Light at dawn or dusk, or just before or after those times (especially at sunrise, or during the "golden hour" just before sunset), is often considered the best for capturing detail, showing scenes in the best colors of light, or otherwise generating impressive and attractive images.&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namibia_2014_landscape_photog_magz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vasileiou_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Vasileiou, Dimitri, editor, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Dedication To Duty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Landscape Photography Magazine'',  2014 Edition, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pro_feedback_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Plant, Ian, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "PRO Feedback, "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shutter speed and aperture===
[[File:Wasserfall Rosenlaui-Schlucht.JPG|thumb|Moving water - shutter speed 1/4 second]]
With cameras that allow a variety of [[shutter speed]]s and lens [[apertures]], landscape photographers tend to prefer settings that allow all of the viewed area to be in sharp focus.  This typically requires a small aperture (a high [[f-stop]]), which creates only a small hole for the light to come into the camera from the lens, ensuring that as much of the field of view is in focus as possible (see:  [[depth of field]]).&lt;ref name="audley_2014_08_30_telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"/&gt;

With a small aperture, however, a slower shutter speed (longer exposure) may be required to compensate for the limited amount of light squeezing in through the small aperture.  This can be a problem if there are kinetic elements in the picture, such as moving animals (especially birds), people or vehicles.  It can also be a problem if the environment is kinetic (in motion), such as wind blowing and shaking all the trees and plants in the scene, or if water is flowing.   Slow shutter speeds can also be a problem if the photographer is in motion (such as shooting a scene from a moving vehicle).&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"/&gt;

Consequently, some compromise between shutter speed and aperture may be necessary, or advisable.  To some extent, a higher-ISO film or digital camera setting can compensate without the need to alter shutter speed or aperture.  However, higher ISO settings ("fast film") can result in grainy pictures and poor capture of details, especially at a distance.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"/&gt;

In some cases, a slow shutter speed is desired to show movement of the subjects, particularly moving water or the effects of wind.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"/&gt;

===Filters===
[[File:Neutral density filter demonstration.jpg|thumb|Neutral density filter demonstration. Photo taken with [[shutter speed]] 1/5 of a second and a [[focal length]] of 21mm]]
Filters can serve a wide range of purposes in landscape photography.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer"/&gt;

For instance, a [[polarizing filter]] can darken the sky, while allowing surface features to be shown in relatively sharper clarity.  Polarizing filters also help with cutting glare from water reducing reflections, snow and ice—even facilitating greater transparency of water and ice.&lt;ref name="caputo_2007_08_natl_geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washington_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Leggero, Michael, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Washington State"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neutral density filter]]s are darkened with a neutral (colorless) gray tint which reduces the amount of light entering the camera lens.  These filters are used to lengthen shutter speeds without the need to alter aperture or film/sensor sensitivity, or alternatively, to use large apertures without exceeding the maximum shutter speed of a camera.&lt;ref name="bpeterson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Bryan|title=Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide|date=2010|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=9780817400194|page=390|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MHe9wHGwv0C&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=%22neutral+density+filter%22+photography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih4ZX09_3LAhWDtBQKHaeVAcsQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22neutral%20density%20filter%22%20photography&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A variation of this filter, termed the graduated neutral density filter or simply 'ND grad', transitions from dark, neutral gray on one side to clear on the opposite side.  Photographers use these filters to lower natural contrasts by reducing light transmission from the brightest portion of the subject landscape, while letting light from the darker portion of the landscape enter the lens unobstructed.&lt;ref name="photogs-guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Nigel|title=The Photographer's Guide to Light|date=2005|publisher=David &amp; Charles|isbn=9780715319499|pages=38-39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU3Ye1ixk3EC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22grad+filter%22+photography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitvZSM_v3LAhVFXRoKHbDwC8IQ6AEIRDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22grad%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV-Zero haze filters reduce "purple fringing" caused by ultraviolet light, especially in digital situations.  They are also recommended by some professional photographers as protection for the vulnerable lens, especially when outdoors or in dynamic situations.

[[Color filter]]s can create other effects, or compensate for the appearance of unnatural lighting due to camera characteristics.

===Other accommodations===
[[File:Tripod.svg|thumb|130px|Camera tripod]]
In order to mitigate shaking associated with hand-holding a camera, landscape photography oftentimes requires a firm camera footing which affords the potential for sharper imagery.  [[Tripods]] are specifically designed for stabilizing cameras and are widely regarded as essential equipment for landscape photography.&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_landscape_photog_rensselaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kathleen_ruiz_photog_basics_rensselaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington_2014_landscape_photog_magz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tripods_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Paterson, Morag and Ted Leeming, [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Gear Test:  Tripods"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }} (equipment reviews), ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hay_fever_2014_landscape_photog_magz"&gt;Hay, David (columnist), [http://landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf "Hay Fever: The Meaning of Letters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062235/https://www.landscapephotographymagazine.com/sample/the-big-free-edition-2014.pdf |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Landscape Photography Magazine'', 2014 Edition, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;  However, any firm surface unaffected by vibration, wind or human contact may offer similar benefits.  The use of a timer, remote control or [[cable release]] allows the shutter to be tripped without the introduction of vibration that might result from manually depressing the shutter button.

Some modern, high-quality cameras also provide [[image stabilization]], which compensates for vibration by moving inner workings of the camera, or electronically correcting the photograph.&lt;ref name="hay_fever_2014_landscape_photog_magz"/&gt;

Because landscape photography is normally outdoors photography, protection from the elements can be helpful.  Shooting from inside a sheltering structure or stationary vehicle (engine off, occupants stationary) can be helpful.  Use of an umbrella or other shield to keep camera and photographer dry can also be helpful.  A waterproof container for the camera, with drying agent inside (e.g.: dry cloth) may be advised, and experts advise that the camera should be shielded from blowing dust, snow, and rain, and extremely harsh direct sunlight.&lt;ref name="caputo_2007_08_natl_geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namibia_2014_landscape_photog_magz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington_2014_landscape_photog_magz"/&gt;

{{Politics of Solomon Islands}}

The '''[[Leader of the Opposition]]''' (or '''Leader of the [[Official Opposition]]''') in '''[[Solomon Islands]]''' is a [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands|Member of Parliament]] who commands a large minority of his peers, united in [[loyal opposition]] to [[Cabinet of Solomon Islands|government]]. The title of "Leader of the Opposition" is common to the [[Commonwealth realms]] and several other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], though in Solomon Islands it is specifically defined by the [[Constitution of Solomon Islands|Constitution]]. The Leader of the Opposition appoints and leads a [[Shadow Cabinet of Solomon Islands|Shadow Cabinet]]. The current Leader of the Opposition, since December 2014, is [[Jeremiah Manele]].

==Constitutional provisions==
The position of "Leader of the Official Opposition" is established by article 66 of the Constitution of 1978, which has been the country's Constitution since independence. Article 66 states that the Leader of the Opposition is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]], who chooses the Member of Parliament who is considered leader by a significant opposition group within Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/c1978167/ Constitution of Solomon Islands]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means the Leader of the Opposition is elected by the members of the Opposition, and then formally recognised and appointed by the Governor-General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/7762-abana-is-new-opposition-leader "Abana is new Opposition leader"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103457/http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/7762-abana-is-new-opposition-leader |date=16 July 2011 }}, ''Solomon Star'', 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He or she is dismissed by the Governor-General if he or she no longer enjoys the support of the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/c1978167/ Constitution of Solomon Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 66 also provides for the Governor-General to appoint a [[Leader of the Independent Members]] - i.e., a parliamentary leader of Members of Parliament who remain unaligned with the government or with the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/c1978167/ Constitution of Solomon Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
The following have served as Leaders of the Official Opposition in Solomon Islands. (Given the fluctuating nature of majority coalitions, successful [[motions of no confidence]] and thus changes in government are frequent during a parliamentary term. Consequently, there are in most cases several successive Leaders of the Opposition during a single Parliament.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/199 "Members of Parliament"], National Parliament of Solomon Islands&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Abana]] of the [[Democratic Party (Solomon Islands)|Democratic Party]] became Leader of the Opposition on 30 August 2010, following the [[Solomon Islands general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/7762-abana-is-new-opposition-leader "Abana is new Opposition leader"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103457/http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/7762-abana-is-new-opposition-leader |date=16 July 2011 }}, ''Solomon Star'', 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from that position in late March 2011, and the Opposition chose [[Derek Sikua]] to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201103/3177860.htm "Revamped Solomons opposition on attack"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314104204/http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201103/3177860.htm |date=14 March 2012 }}, Radio Australia, 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sikua thus led the [[Shadow Cabinet of Solomon Islands|2011-2014 Shadow Cabinet]].

On 9 December 2014, following the [[Solomon Islands general election, 2014|2014 general election]], [[Jeremiah Manele]] was appointed as Leader of the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sibconline.com.sb/manele-appointed-opposition-leader-maelanga-independent/ "MANELE APPOINTED OPPOSITION LEADER, MAELANGA INDEPENDENT"], Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation, 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]''' ('''Independent Television''') is the original [[United Kingdom|British]] advertising television network. Some of the franchise holders, most notably [[ITV plc]] and its predecessor companies [[Granada plc]] and [[Carlton Communications]], set up other television channels, some with the ITV brand, some not.

==Current channels==

===ITV===
{{main|ITV (TV network)|ITV (TV channel)|STV (TV channel)|UTV (TV channel)|}}
[[File:STV logo 2014.png|thumb|right|STV, one of the three brands used on the ITV network.]]
The [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network was launched in 1955, a federal network of fifteen regional companies granted franchises either solely on a geographical basis or also on a weekday/weekend split basis. The franchises were reallocated several times and now, except for [[STV (TV channel)|two in Scotland]], all the franchises are owned by [[ITV plc]], and are branded as [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] or [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]. The network contains a variety of programming, such as entertainment, dramas, documentaries, news, films and sport. A timeshift channel, ITV +1, is available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]], [[Freesat]] and [[Virgin Media]].

===ITV2===
{{main|ITV2}}

After 1964, the fourth [[push-button]] channel selector on British televisions was traditionally labelled "ITV2", in the expectation that the second commercial channel would be awarded to ITV in the near future. In the event, [[Channel 4]] claimed the button when it launched in 1982. It was not until 1998 that ITV launched its first new digital channel, known as [[ITV2]]. This combines more repeated and new entertainment and films as well as behind the scenes and imported programmes for the modern world. It is available on all digital services and broadcasts 24 hours a day. A timeshift channel, ITV2 +1, is available on Freeview, Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media. Before 2 August 2011, ITV2 +1 was only available on Freeview between 19:00 and 06:00, as it was forced to timeshare with CITV, and, in Scotland, TeleG (until it closed).

ITV2 HD is the simulcast [[high-definition television]] channel of ITV2. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.

===ITV3===
{{main|ITV3}}
[[File:ITV3 logo 2013.jpg|100px|right]]
[[ITV plc]]'s third channel was launched on 1 November 2004 as [[ITV3]]. It was initially thought that ITV3 would continue alongside Plus, broadcasting only on Freeview and cable, but at a last minute deal made it available on Sky, replacing Plus on all platforms (except Freeview). It usually shows murder mysteries, classic dramas and movies. ITV3 is also available on all digital services and is available between 06:00 and 03:00, with teleshopping taking up the early hours of the day. A timeshift channel, ITV3 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.

ITV3 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV3. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.

===ITV4===
{{main|ITV4}}
[[File:ITV4-logo-2013.jpg|100px|right]]
[[ITV4]] is a digital channel based targeted at men. It began broadcasting on 1 November 2005. It broadcasts for the same amount of time as ITV3. It usually shows sport events, archival programming, and, similarly to ITV3, movies. A timeshift channel, ITV4 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.

ITV4 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV4. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.

===ITVBe===
{{Main|ITVBe}}
[[File:ITVBe logo 2014-.svg|100px|right]]
ITVBe is a lifestyle television channel from ITV plc, which launched on 8 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-launch-itvbe/ |title=ITV to launch ITVBe |publisher=ITV |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel broadcasts programmes previously broadcast on ITV2 such as ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' franchise and scripted reality show ''[[The Only Way Is Essex]]''. The channel is available free-to-air on Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITVBe HD and ITVBe +1, are also available.

===CITV===
{{main|CITV}}
The [[CITV]] channel is aimed at children under 12 years old, and broadcasts daily between 06:00 and 21:00. The channel launched on 11 March 2006 at 09:25 with ''[[Holly &amp; Stephen's Saturday Showdown]]'', on Freeview, Virgin Media and [[TalkTalk TV]]. It then launched on Sky on 8 May 2006 at 06:00, with other platforms to follow. The channel replaced the [[ITV News Channel]] on Freeview. In February 2008 it was moved to a space originally held by ABC1, allowing ITV4 to go 24/7 on Freeview; however, this means that it can no longer be received in Wales via Freeview because the channel would interfere with S4C if available in Wales. On 9 January 2012, a change in the FEC mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview.

===ITV Box Office===
{{Main|ITV Box Office}}
[[File:ITV Box Office logo.png|100px|right]]
ITV Box Office is a pay-per-view sports channel from ITV plc, which launched on 4 February 2017. The channel broadcasts live events such as boxing and is available on Sky, Virgin Media and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-show-eubank-jnr-world-title-fight |title=ITV to show Eubank Jnr World Title fight |publisher=ITV |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ITV HD===
{{main|ITV HD|STV (TV channel)#STV HD|UTV (TV channel)#UTV HD}}

[[ITV HD]] is the simulcast high-definition television channel created by ITV. It was first trialled primarily to show the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] games to which ITV had the rights. It also showed looping previews, it began scheduled broadcasting on 9 June 2006 and ended on 30 November 2006. The full version was released as a simulcast on 17 July 2008 on all platforms.

[[STV (TV channel)|STV]] launched their HD service in June 2010. STV HD broadcasts in Central and Northern Scotland on Virgin Media and Freeview. The channel was made available on the Sky and Freesat EPGs in April 2014.

[[UTV (TV channel)|UTV HD]] was launched in Northern Ireland in October 2010 exclusively to Virgin Media. It was later added to Freeview on 24 October 2012 after the completion of the [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|digital switchover]] in the region.

===The Store===
{{main|JML Direct TV#JML Store}}
JML Store is a UK television shopping channel, in partnership with [[JML Direct TV|JML Direct Limited]], and programming block on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. Dubbed the "chatmercial", The Store combines the format of a chatshow with home TV shopping in front of a studio audience.

The channel was first launched in November 2011 as "The Zone" exclusively on the Freeview platform, but was not available in Wales until 9 January 2012. On Tuesday 1 October, ITV rebranded the channel as "The Store", which also launched as a 24-hour channel on Freesat and Sky on the same day. The Freeview channel varies from the satellite feed, as it only broadcasts between 6&amp;nbsp;pm and 6&amp;nbsp;am, and airs the live casino programme ''[[Jackpot247]]'' daily, between 10&amp;nbsp;pm and 3&amp;nbsp;am. On 1 August 2014, it was rebranded as "JML Store" on all platforms, except Freeview.

==Defunct channels==
The ITV network as a whole has owned other spin-off channels. Some were as joint ventures with other broadcasters; others were not.

===With the ITV brand===

====ITV Encore====
{{main|ITV Encore}}
[[File:ITV Encore logo.png|100px|right]]
ITV Encore was a drama television channel from ITV plc launched on 9 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-encore-launch-sky#.UulSPPtdvjs |title=ITV Encore to launch on Sky |publisher=ITV |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ITV's other channels it was available exclusively on [[Sky UK|Sky]] and [[Now TV (UK and Ireland)|Now TV]], as part of their subscription packages. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITV Encore HD and ITV Encore +1, was also available on Sky. Following an over-reliance on repeated content and less than stellar ratings, the channel closed on 1 May 2018 as part of ITV's plans to turn the channel into a box-set brand. 


====ITV Play====
{{main|ITV Play}}

[[ITV Play]] was a 24/7 [[Quiz Channel|participation television channel]] in the United Kingdom. It launched on 19 April 2006 on Freeview, and was also available on Sky Digital. It was embroiled in a scandal involving overpriced premium-rate phone lines, by which ITV plc pulled the channel off air until further notice. The channel's closure was announced on 13 March 2007, and it closed on 15 March 2007. The channel was replaced by ITV2 +1 on Freeview. The brand "[[ITV Play]]" continued during late night quiz show slots on the ITV Network until December 2007.

While ITV plc had intended the make profits from the ITV Play brand, only the late night slots on ITV1 and ITV2 made money.

====ITV News Channel====
{{main|ITV News Channel}}

The ITV News Channel launched on 1 August 2000 under the name ITN News Channel. [[Carlton Communications|Carlton Television]] and [[Granada plc|Granada Television]] bought equal shares from [[ITN]] in the network and rebranded it ITV News Channel in September 2002. In April 2004 ITV bought NTL's 35 per cent share and took full control over the channel. The channel was closed on 23 December 2005 due to poor ratings and the launch of ITV4. It was replaced by ITV4 and CITV.

====ITV Sport Channel====
{{main|ITV Sport Channel}}

The ITV Sport Channel, originally broadcasting [[UEFA Champions League]] football and [[ATP Masters Series]] tennis under the brand ONsport, was ITV's sports channel. It closed with (and indeed was responsible for) the collapse of [[ITV Digital]]. Lasting for just one football season; the ITV Sport Channel launched on Saturday 11 August 2001 with [[Manchester City F.C.|Man City]] v [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], and closed on Sunday 12 May 2002 with the [[Football League Second Division|Division 2]] [[2002 Football League Second Division play-off Final|Play-off Final]] between [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]]. There were two spinoff channels, ITV Sport Plus and ITV Sport Select, the latter used to show the on-demand [[Premier League]] football matches from [[Sky Sports]]. Whilst football was the mainstay of the channel, it showed the [[ATP Masters Series]], [[British Basketball League|British basketball]] and European Cup [[rugby union]]. Previously to the ITV Digital rebrand, the ITV Sport bouquet included ONsport 1 and ONsport 2, which were subject to rebrands themselves after ITV bought up the rights to the tennis Masters Series. Before then, the channel had been branded as Champions on 28, and Champions on 99.

====ITV Select====
{{main|ITV Select}}
This pay-per-view service on [[ITV Digital]] was formerly called ONrequest, which launched with ONdigital. It gave access to [[film]]s, [[sport]] events and exclusive footage. It closed prior to the collapse of the platform due to ITV's financial difficulties and poor uptake.

== Granada plc ==

===Granada Breeze===

{{main|Granada Breeze}}
Originally ''Granada Good Life'', Granada Breeze was another GSB owned venture. This was a lifestyle channel aimed at female viewers and showed programmes on lifestyle, cookery, health and US daytime television such as ''Judge Joe Brown''. Cuts to the channel saw original programming drop in favour of US imports, which greatly impacted the channel’s ratings. It closed in January 2002 on Sky and ITV Digital due to poor viewing figures, but continued until April 2002 to honour contracts with NTL and Telewest.

===Granada Plus===

{{main|Plus (TV channel)}}

Owned by [[ITV Digital Channels Ltd|Granada Sky Broadcasting]], a 50-50 joint venture between [[Granada plc]] and [[Sky plc|BSkyB]], Granada Plus was a general entertainment channel aimed at older audiences and ran from archived material. The channel, initially launched as "Granada Plus", was later known as "G Plus" and finally simply "Plus". It continued to broadcast until 1 November 2004, when ITV sealed a deal to buy out Sky's stakes in GSB to close down the channel in order for ITV's new channel, ITV3, to take Plus' low EPG position on Sky Digital. The channel was replaced on digital satellite and cable platforms, but a closedown slide continued to be available as late as 2010 on analogue cable. The closedown slide has since become inaccessible to places where analogue cable is no longer supported, as the digital switchover occurred.

===Granada Men &amp; Motors===

{{main|Men &amp; Motors}}
Men &amp; Motors was a men's lifestyle television channel in the UK. It was the last remaining station operated by [[ITV Digital Channels Ltd|Granada Sky Broadcasting]] after Plus became the third GSB channel to be closed down, being replaced by ITV3. A joint venture set up by [[Granada plc]] (now part of ITV plc) and [[Sky plc|BSkyB]] in 1996. Although ITV plc is now the sole owner of GSB, Sky will receive 49.5 per cent of any proceeds (net of liabilities) if Men &amp; Motors is sold.

The channel was previously available on Freeview but was removed to make way for [[ITV Play]] which was then removed to make way for ITV2 +1, but was still available on Sky Digital and Virgin Media. While it was still broadcasting, it was available from 11:00 to 04:00 every day with [[ITV Nightscreen]] taking up the hours of 04:00 to 06:00 and a mixture of teleshopping and animated captions between 06:00 and 11:00.

Men &amp; Motors was removed from Virgin Media on 25 March 2010, and closed on 1 April 2010 on Sky Digital and Freesat, making way for ITV HD.

===Granada Talk TV===

{{main|Granada Talk TV}}

The last of the original GSB channels, Granada Talk TV focused primarily on chat shows. Due to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in the early hours of 31 August 1997, it ceased broadcasting on 31 August 1997.

== Carlton Communications ==

===Carlton Cinema===

{{main|Carlton Cinema (TV channel)}}

This channel was owned by [[Carlton Communications]] showing classic cinema. It closed in 2003 due to poor viewing figures.

===Taste CFN===

{{main|Carlton Food Network}}

Originally this was the Carlton Food Network, owned by Carlton Communications, showing cooking programmes. This was the first Carlton channel to be launched when it started on cable on 1 September 1996. The channel itself went bust in late 2001 due to financial difficulties. It was never replaced on the ITV Digital platform (but the closure stated that Carlton Cinema would replace this and fill in the gap)

===Carlton Kids===

{{main|Carlton Kids}}

This was owned by [[Carlton Communications]] showing children's television. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. This channel, like Carlton World, was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct [[Discovery Kids (UK)|Discovery Kids]] and [[Discovery Wings (UK)|Discovery Wings]] on the ONdigital platform.

===Carlton Select===

{{main|Carlton Select}}

This was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing general entertainment programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures; however, it relaunched again in 2002 (for cable television only), suddenly it plunged into extreme risk as Carlton heard rumours about itself merging with Granada to form a single ITV (save for the Granada name). It struggled to keep going, but it failed and shattered, which meant it closed in 2003, due to the rumours of merging. Its slot was used to provide extra hours for [[Carlton Food Network]]. The channel had originally been broadcast as SelecTV since June 1995 as a cable exclusive but changed to Carlton Select in early 1997 and started on OnDigital when that platform went on air in late 1998.

===Carlton World===

{{main|Carlton World}}

This was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing factual programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. It was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct [[Discovery Kids (UK)|Discovery Kids]] and [[Discovery Wings (UK)|Discovery Wings]] on the ONdigital platform.

===Joint ventures===

====Shop!====
Shop! was a [[home shopping channel]] which was a joint venture between Granada and [[Littlewoods]].  It ran from 1999–2002 and was replaced on Freeview by [[QVC]].

====Wellbeing====
Wellbeing was a health and beauty focused channel, a joint venture between Granada and [[Alliance Boots|Boots]] which lasted just nine months on air in 2001.

====Super Channel====
{{main|NBC Europe}}

This was a pan-European cable and satellite channel launched in 1987 by all of the ITV companies except [[Thames Television]] (who was a shareholder in the [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellite operator instead), with the assistance of [[BBC Worldwide]] (then Enterprises) and of a few other third parties, such as the independent music television producer [[Music Box (TV channel)|Music Box]]. This channel aimed to beam a selection of the best of British television from both past and present (from both the BBC and ITV) to those living in [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]. It was aimed both at foreign viewers and British expatriates, along with the syndicated [[ITN World News]] and a few other programmes coming from other European countries (such as [[Netherlands|Holland]]). However, the channel ran into severe financial difficulties almost from the start, with rights problems involving [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] demanding full payment of royalties for its archive programming, and poor viewing figures, advertising revenue and profits. The channel eventually had to scrap much of its BBC and ITV output, and after failing to achieve its expectations in 1988 the channel's British shareholders sold the entirety of its shares to the [[Italy|Italian]] consortium Beta Television, who changed its programming output completely, although it continued carrying the ITN World News and being based in [[London]]. In 1993, it was bought by the [[United States|American]] broadcaster [[NBC]], relaunching it as NBC Super Channel, later renaming it NBC Europe. It finally closed in 1998. (The BBC launched its own satellite service immediately after the failure of Super Channel, [[BBC TV Europe]] (later BBC World Service Television and BBC World).)

''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper speculated that the failure of Super Channel might have been a historical precedent to the bad luck that ITV has generally had with cable and satellite television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Sky Scottish====
{{main|Sky Scottish}}

A joint venture between [[Scottish Television]] and [[Sky plc|BSkyB]], this was a general entertainment channel for the Scottish market. It closed after 18 months on air due to poor viewing figures.

===Other===

====S2====
{{main|S2 (TV channel)}}

Owned by [[STV Group (Scotland)|SMG plc]] (now known as STV Group plc), this was the Scottish equivalent to ITV2. The channel simulcasted the vast majority of ITV2 programmes, albeit covering the ITV2 [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] with its own. It closed due to poor viewership.

====UTV2====
{{main|UTV2}}

Formerly TV You, owned by UTV plc, this was the Northern Irish equivalent to ITV2. It closed due to poor viewership, and the failure to attract ''any'' advertising during its existence.

====UTV Ireland====
{{main|UTV Ireland}}
UTV Ireland was a general entertainment channel available in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The channel was launched on 1 January 2015 and broadcast programmes from [[ITV Studios|ITV Studios Global Entertainment]] such as ''Emmerdale'' and ''Coronation Street'', often simulcast with the main ITV network. The channel was owned by ITV plc since February 2016, following the sale of [[Wireless Group|UTV Media]]'s television assets. In July 2016, ITV announced the sale of UTV Ireland to [[Virgin Media Ireland]], owners of [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. The channel was replaced by [[be3 (TV channel)|be3]] on 9 January 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">A '''losing stream''', '''disappearing stream''',  '''influent stream''' or '''sinking river''' is a [[stream]] or [[river]] that loses water  as it flows downstream. The water  [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrates]] into the ground recharging the local [[groundwater]], because the [[water table]] is below the bottom of the stream channel. This is the opposite of a more common ''gaining  stream'' (or ''effluent stream'') which increases in water volume farther down stream as it gains water from the local [[aquifer]].

Losing streams are common in arid areas due to the climate which results in huge amounts of water evaporating from the river generally towards the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/AskGeoMan/geoQuerry62.html Ask GeoMan...]&lt;/ref&gt; Losing streams are also common in regions of [[karst topography]] where the streamwater may be completely [[stream capture|captured]] by an underground [[cave|cavern]] system, becoming a [[subterranean river]].

==Examples==
[[File:Buna source.jpg|thumb|The cave of [[Vrelo Bune|source of the Buna]] can be entered by boat and dived through a cave system serving as an effluence of the [[Zalomka river|Zalomka]].]]
[[Image:Lostidahomap.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of the lost streams of Idaho]]

There are many natural examples of subterranean rivers including:
*In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: [[Unac (river)|Unac]]; Mušnica-[[Trebišnjica]]-[[Krupa (Neretva)|Krupa]]/[[Ombla]] '' (Trebišnjica is considered to be one of the largest sinking rivers in the world; one of its effluence, Ombla, springs out of huge cave near [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]] and after just cca 30 meters empties into [[Adriatic Sea]]'s [[ria]] called [[Rijeka Dubrovačka]])''; [[Zalomka river|Zalomka]]-[[Buna (Neretva)|Buna]]/[[Bunica]]/[[Bregava]]; [[Vrljika River|Vrljika]]-[[Trebižat (river)|Trebižat]]; [[Lištica (river)|Lištica]]-Jasenica; [[Šuica (river)|Šuica]]-Ričina&lt;ref name="Dinarides-devonkarst.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Devon Karst: Karst of the Dinaric Alps - the Dinarides in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=http://www.devonkarst.org.uk/Karstography%20of%20DINARIC%20KARST%20in%20BiH.html |website=devonkarst.org.uk |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponor-Dobrelji-devonkarst.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Devon Karst: Gatačko Polje - GP-Ponor Dobrelji |url=http://www.devonkarst.org.uk/Gatacko%20Polje/GP-Ponor%20-%20Dobrelji.html |website=devonkarst.org.uk |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are two rivers in Idaho, the [[Lost River (Idaho)|Big Lost River and the Little Lost River]], which both flow into the same depression and become subterranean, feeding the Snake River Plain Aquifer. Via the [[aquifer]] and numerous [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], they are tributaries of the [[Snake River]]. 
*The [[Lost River (Indiana)|Lost River in Indiana]] rises in [[Vernon Township, Washington County, Indiana]], and discharges into the East Fork of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. The Lost River is about {{convert|85|mi|km}} long and its name is derived from the fact that at least {{convert|23|mi|km}} of the primary course of the river flows completely underground.  The river disappears into a series of [[sink hole]]s of the type that are abundant in the [[karst]]land of [[southern Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xU5NF4EAbQMC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=harrison+spring+indiana&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=vtmZ2aQQILJjADDIVYbfEFFG4KI#PPA5,M1  Amazing Tales from Indiana By Fred D. Cavinder, 1990, Pg 4] &lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Lost River (New Hampshire)|Lost River of New Hampshire]] is a {{convert|6.5|mi|km|sing=on}} long [[stream]] located in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] in the [[United States]].  It is a [[tributary]] of the [[Pemigewasset River]], part of the [[Merrimack River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]]. The Lost River begins in [[Kinsman Notch]], one of the major [[mountain pass|passes]] through the White Mountains.  As it flows through the notch, it passes through [[Lost River Reservation|Lost River Gorge]], an area where enormous boulders falling off the flanking walls of the notch at the close of the last [[Ice age|Ice Age]] have covered the river, creating a network of boulder caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803072027/http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu/ |date=2013-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Lost River (Cacapon River tributary)|Lost River of West Virginia]] is located in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[Hardy County, West Virginia|Hardy County]] in the [[Eastern Panhandle]] region of the state. It flows into an underground channel northeast of [[Baker, West Virginia|Baker]] along [[West Virginia Route 259]] at "the Sinks" and reappears near [[Wardensville, West Virginia|Wardensville]] as the [[Cacapon River]].
*In southern Germany, the [[Danube River]] disappears in the [[Danube Sinkhole]] between [[Immendingen]] and [[Möhringen an der Donau|Möhringen]] in an area of [[karst]].
*The [[Selwyn River]] in [[New Zealand]] normally disappears below ground as it flows down the [[Canterbury Plains]] due to overlaying a deep and porous aquifer, re-emerging about 15 kilometres away from its output at [[Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora]].

A '''Malthusian catastrophe''' (also known as '''Malthusian check''', '''Malthusian spectre''' or '''Malthusian crunch''') is a prediction that [[population growth]] will outpace [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Production (economics)|production]] – that there will be too many people and not enough food.

In 1779, [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] wrote:

{{quote|Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resource of nature. The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter VII, p. 61&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"&gt;Oxford World's Classics reprint&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Notwithstanding the apocalyptic image conveyed by this particular paragraph, Malthus himself did not subscribe to the notion that mankind was fated for a "catastrophe" due to population overshooting resources. Rather, he believed that population growth was generally restricted by available resources:

{{quote|The passion between the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly the same that it may always be considered, in algebraic language, as a given quantity. The great law of necessity which prevents population from increasing in any country beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law so open to our view...that we cannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes which nature takes to prevent or repress a redundant population do not appear, indeed, to us so certain and regular, but though we cannot always predict the mode we may with certainty predict the fact.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter IV.}}

== Preventive vs. positive ==
Malthus proposed two kinds of population checks: preventive and positive.

A preventive check is a conscious decision to delay marriage or abstain from procreation based on a lack of resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf|title=An Essay on The Principle of Population|last=Malthus|first=Thomas Robert|date=1798|website=Electronic Scholarly Publishing Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of check is unique to humanity, because it requires foresight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Malthus argued that man is incapable of ignoring the consequences of uncontrolled population growth, and would intentionally avoid contributing to it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Malthus, a positive check is any event or circumstance that shortens the human life span. The primary examples of this are [[war]], [[epidemic|plague]] and [[famine]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, poor health and economic conditions are also considered instances of positive checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkins|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Can South Africa Avoid a Malthusian Positive Check?|jstor=20027682|journal=Daedalus|volume=130|issue=1|pages=123–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[mechanized agriculture]] produced a dramatic increase in productivity of agriculture and the [[Green Revolution]] greatly increased crop yields, expanding the world's food supply while lowering food prices.  In response, the growth rate of the world's population accelerated rapidly, resulting in predictions by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], Simon Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hopkins|first = Simon|title = A Systematic Foray into the Future|publisher = Barker Books|year = 1966|pages = 513–69}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and many others of an imminent Malthusian catastrophe.  However, populations of most developed countries grew slowly enough to be outpaced by gains in productivity.

By the early 21st century, many technologically developed countries had passed through the [[demographic transition]], a complex social development encompassing a drop in [[total fertility rate]]s in response to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]], including lower [[infant mortality]], increased [[urbanization]], and a wider availability of effective [[birth control]].

On the assumption that the [[demographic transition]] is now spreading from the developed countries to [[less developed countries]], the [[United Nations Population Fund]] estimates that human population may peak in the late 21st century rather than continue to grow until it has exhausted available resources.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|title=2004 UN Population Projections, 2004.|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:World-Population-1800-2100.svg|thumb|250px|World population from 1800 to 2100, based on [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf UN 2004 projections] (red, orange, green) and [https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html US Census Bureau historical estimates] (black)]]
[[Image:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|250px|Growth in food production has been greater than population growth. Food per person increased since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Data source: http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QI/E, see graph metadata for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historians have estimated the total human population back to 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html|title=Historical Estimates of World Population, U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2006.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013110506/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html|archivedate=2013-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure on the right shows the trend of total population from 1800 to 2005, and from there in three projections out to 2100 (low, medium, and high).&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; The United Nations population projections out to 2100 (the red, orange, and green lines) show a possible peak in the world's population occurring by 2040 in the first scenario, and by 2100 in the second scenario, and never ending growth in the third.

The graph of annual growth rates (at the top of the page) does not appear exactly as one would expect for long-term exponential growth.  For exponential growth it should be a straight line at constant height, whereas in fact the graph from 1800 to 2005 is dominated by an enormous hump that began about 1920, peaked in the mid-1960s, and has been steadily eroding away for the last 40 years. The sharp fluctuation between 1959 and 1960 was due to the combined effects of the [[Great Leap Forward]] and a natural disaster in China.&lt;ref name="USCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/|title=International Data Base}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also visible on this graph are the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the two world wars, and possibly also the [[1918 flu pandemic]].

Short-term trends, even on the scale of decades or centuries, cannot prove or disprove the existence of mechanisms promoting a Malthusian catastrophe over longer periods. However, due to the prosperity of a major fraction of the human population at the beginning of the 21st century, and the debatability{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} of the predictions for [[ecological collapse]] made by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] in the 1960s and 1970s, some people, such as economist [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian L. Simon]], question its inevitability.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian L, "[http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Articles/REVOLUTI.txt More People, Greater Wealth, More Resources, Healthier Environment]", ''Economic Affairs: J. Inst. Econ. Affairs'', April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study by a group of prominent economists and ecologists, including [[Kenneth Arrow]] and Paul Ehrlich&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, K., P. Dasgupta, L. Goulder, G. Daily, P. Ehrlich, G. Heal, S. Levin, K. Mäler, S. Schneider, D. Starrett and B. Walker, "Are We Consuming Too Much" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 18(3), 147–72, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the central concerns regarding sustainability have shifted from population growth to the consumption/savings ratio, due to shifts in population growth rates since the 1970s.  Empirical estimates show that public policy (taxes or the establishment of more complete property rights) can promote more efficient consumption and investment that are sustainable in an ecological sense; that is, given the current (relatively low) population growth rate, the Malthusian catastrophe can be avoided by either a shift in consumer preferences or public policy that induces a similar shift.

A 2002 study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2002/7828-en.html World agriculture 2030: Global food production will exceed population growth] August 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]] predicts that world food production will be in excess of the needs of the human population by the year 2030; however, that source also states that hundreds of millions will remain hungry (presumably due to economic realities and political issues).

==Criticism==

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that Malthus failed to recognize a crucial difference between humans and other species. In capitalist societies, as Engels put it, scientific and technological "progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich."Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy", ''Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher'', 1844, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued, even more broadly, that the growth of both a human population ''in toto'' and the "[[relative surplus population]]" within it, occurred in direct proportion to [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx (transl. Ben Fowkes), ''Capital Volume 1'', Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1976 (originally 1867),  pp. 782–802.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry George]] criticized Malthus's view that population growth was a cause of poverty, arguing that poverty was caused by the concentration of ownership of land and natural resources. George noted that humans are distinct from other species, because unlike most species humans can use their minds to leverage the reproductive forces of nature to their advantage. He wrote, "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." &lt;ref&gt;Progress and Poverty, Chapter 7, Malthus vs. Facts in http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

[[Ester Boserup]] suggested that population levels determined agricultural methods, rather than agricultural methods determining population.&lt;ref&gt;Ester Boserup, ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

[[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] was another economist who argued that there could be no global Malthusian catastrophe, because of two factors: (1) the existence of new knowledge, and educated people to take advantage of it, and (2) "economic freedom", that is, the ability of the world to increase production when there is a profitable opportunity to do so.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment in http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

D.E.C. Eversley observed that Malthus appeared unaware of the extent of industrialization, and either ignored or discredited the possibility that it could improve living conditions of the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1287575|title=Social theories of fertility and the Malthusian debate|last=Charles.|first=Eversley, David Edward|date=1959|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=9780837176284|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=|oclc=1287575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these criticisms, some individuals, such as [[Joseph Tainter]], argue that science has diminishing marginal returns&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph: ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} and that scientific progress is becoming more difficult, harder to achieve, and more costly.

'''Mount Wuteve''' is a [[mountain]] located in [[Liberia]], whose summit is the [[elevation|highest point]] in [[Liberia]]. It is located in the [[Guinea Highlands]] [[mountain range|range]], whose parent range is the [[West Africa Mountains]]. Data from the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] reveals that the correct elevation of its summit is 1,440 meters, and not the previously quoted 1,380 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ViewfinderPanorama.org|url=http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/elevmisquotes.html#africa|last=de Ferranti|first=Jonathan|date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Mount Wologizi among locals of the Loma tribe.

'''''La Niña''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''The Girl'') was one of the three [[Spain|Spanish]] ships used by [[Italy|Italian]] explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in his first voyage to the [[West Indies]] in 1492. As was tradition for Spanish ships of the day, she bore a female saint's name, '''''Santa Clara.''''' However, she was commonly referred to by her nickname, ''La Niña,'' which was probably a pun on the name of her owner, [[Niño brothers|Juan Niño]] of [[Moguer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=9780300170283 |date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300170283 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a standard [[caravel]]-type vessel.

The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the caravel-type {{ship||Pinta|ship|2}} and the [[carrack]]-type {{ship||Santa María|ship|2}}. ''Niña'' was by far Columbus' favorite. She was originally [[lateen sail]] rigged ''caravela latina'', but she was re-rigged as ''caravela redonda'' at [[Las Palmas]], in the [[Canary Islands]], with [[square sail]]s for better ocean performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBhLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Lateen+Sails+of+the+Ni%C3%B1a+changed+into+square+ones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs7YTM8M_JAhXIHh4KHdwfBEYQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lateen%20Sails%20of%20the%20Ni%C3%B1a%20changed%20into%20square%20ones&amp;f=false | title=The Life of Christopher Columbus: From Authentic Spanish and Italian Documents | publisher=The American News Company | author=Barry, J.

''Niña'', like ''Pinta'' and ''Santa María'', was a smaller trade ship built to sail the Mediterranean sea, not the open ocean. It was greatly surpassed in size by ships like {{ship||Peter von Danzig|ship|2}} of the [[Hanseatic League]], built in 1462, {{convert|51|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and the [[England|English]] carrack {{ship||Grace Dieu|ship|2}}, built during the period 1420–1439, weighing between 1,400 and 2,750 tons,  and {{convert|66.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, in both weight and length.

==History==
On Columbus' first expedition, ''Niña'' carried 26 men, captained by [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]]. They left [[Palos de la Frontera]] on 3 August 1492, stopping at the [[Canary Islands]] on 12 August 1492, and continued westward. Landfall was made in the [[Bahamas]] at dawn on 12 October 1492.

On 14 February 1493, in the east of the [[Azores]], a storm threatened to capsize ''Niña'', and at Columbus' instigation, he and the crew took [[Columbus' vow|a series of vows]] to perform certain acts including religious pilgrimages upon their return to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], Samuel Kettell (translator), ''Personal narrative of the first voyage of Columbus to America: From a manuscript recently discovered in Spain'', T. B. Wait and Son, 1827. p. 216. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8QRAAAAYAAJ Online] at [[Google Books]]. A version in modern Spanish—[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/9733.htm Text for 11-16 February] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113518/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/9733.htm |date=2009-04-14 }}—can be accessed online at artehistoria.jcyl.es.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Niña'' reached [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], on 4 March 1493, and arrived in Palos de la Frontera on 15 March 1493.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández Duro |first=Cesáreo |authorlink=Cesáreo Fernández Duro |title=Pinzón en el descubrimiento de las Indias |url=https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/n3/mode/2up |publisher=Sucesores de Rivadeneyra |location=Madrid |year=1892 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first voyage to America, the crew of ''Niña'' slept on the deck but adopted the use of [[hammock]]s after seeing Native Americans utilizing them.&lt;ref name=thenina/&gt;

In September 1493, ''Niña'' joined a grand fleet of 17 ships for the second voyage to [[Hispaniola]], becoming the flagship for an exploration of [[Cuba]]. She was the only ship to survive the 1495 hurricane, returning quickly to [[Spain]] in 1496.

''Niña'' was then chartered for an unauthorized voyage to [[Rome]]. She was captured by a pirate corsair when leaving the port of [[Cagliari]] and brought to [[Pula, Sardinia|Cape Pula]], Sardinia. The Captain, Alonso Medel, escaped with a few men. He stole a boat, rowed back to ''Niña'', and made sail, returning to [[Cádiz]].

In 1498, she returned to [[Hispaniola]] as advance guard of Columbus' Third Voyage. She was lying in wait at [[Santo Domingo]] in 1500. In 1501, she made a trading voyage to the Pearl Coast on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], and no further log of her is found in historic archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environment and History ('Ruined and Lost': Spanish Destruction of the Pearl Coast in the Early Sixteenth Century) |author=Michael Perri |url=http://www.erica.demon.co.uk/EH/EH1505.html |volume=15 |year=2009 |pages=129–161 |doi=10.3197/096734009X437963 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Niña'' logged at least {{convert|25000|nmi|km|-3}} under Columbus' command.

==Replicas==
[[File:The Nina And Pinta — Official Views Of The World's Columbian Exposition — 86.jpg|right|thumb|''Niña'' and ''Pinta'' replicas at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]]]]
[[File:Niña replica - Morro Bay CA.jpg|right|thumb|The replica of the Columbus Foundation]]
A replica of ''Niña'' was built by the Spanish government for the Columbian Naval Review of 1893. Along with replicas of ''Santa María'' and ''Pinta'' she participated in the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07EED61731E033A25755C2A9629C94629ED7CF|title=QUEER CRAFT THESE CARAVELS. -  Those Who Saw Them Hobble to Anchor Marveled at Columbus's Pluck.|date=26 April 1893|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica of ''Niña'' (based upon theory; there are no known contemporary likenesses of any of the three ships) now sails around the world.

The 4-masted replica ''Niña'' was built 1988-1991 by engineer and naval researcher John Patrick Sarsfield, British naval historian Jonathan Morton Nance, and a group of master shipbuilders in Bahia, Brazil who were still using design and construction techniques dating back to the 15th century. They built it from heavy, teredo-resistant Brazilian hardwoods using only [[adze]]s, axes, hand saws, and chisels. The sails were designed by Nance using square main sails and two aft lateen sails as were used by ships of this size at the end of the 15th century. The crew of ''Niña'' say that it can make about {{convert|5|–|7|kn|lk=in}}, which is quicker than older designs of the era. The replica weighs 75 tons.

In 1991, the replica sailed to Costa Rica to take part in the filming of ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Niña|publisher=''Niña Traveling Museum''|url=http://www.thenina.com|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Niña'' has visited hundreds of North America ports to give the public a chance to see and tour the ship. The vessel continues to visit ports across the Eastern to mid-United States along with its sister replica ship, ''Pinta''. The replicas of ''Niña'' and ''Pinta'' were built in [[Valença, Rio de Janeiro|Valença, Brazil]] using the same methods as the 15th century [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/05/12/2153691/history-visits-strand.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912112551/http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/05/12/2153691/history-visits-strand.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-12|title=History visits Bucksport in form of boats|last=Slate|first=Charles|work=[[The Sun News]]|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other replicas are located in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], United States and in Andalusia, Spain (at [[El Puerto de Santa María]] and at the [[Wharf of the Caravels]] in Palos de la Frontera).

The historic [[San Francisco]] restaurant [[Bernstein's Fish Grotto]] was designed to look like ''Niña''.&lt;ref name="timeshutter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshutter.com/image/bernsteins-fish-grotto-123-powell-st-san-francisco-calif|title=Bernstein's Fish Grotto, 123 Powell Street.

'''[[Uruguay]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located in southeastern [[South America]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html|title=Uruguay|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is home to 3.46 million people, of which 1.7 million live in the capital [[Montevideo]] and its [[metropolitan area]]. Montevideo was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold. Uruguay won its independence in 1825-1828 following a three-way struggle between [[Spain]], Argentina and Brazil. It is a [[constitutional democracy]], where the [[president]] fulfills the roles of both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The [[economy]] is largely based on [[agriculture]] (making up 10% of [[GDP]] and the most substantial export) and the state sector,  Uruguay's economy is on the whole more stable than in its surrounding states, and it maintains a solid reputation with investors.

The '''San Juan Hotel''' was built in 1885 at a cost of $150,000 by C.E Pierce.  The hotel was located in [[Orlando, Florida]] on the corner of Orange Avenue and Central Avenue.  Harry Beeman of Beeman Chewing Gum purchased the hotel in 1889 and added two additional stories.&lt;ref name=Cfmemory&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cfmemory.org/Learn/Stories/StoryView.php?s=16|title=Florida Stories: Hotels: Page:4 San Juan|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= cfmemory.org|publisher=Central Florida Memory |access-date=September 7, 2016 |quote=One of Orlando's oldest hotels, the San Juan, was a fixture in the city for over 80 years. Built in 1885 by C.E. Pierce at a cost of $150,000, the San Juan Hotel was located on the corner of Orange and Central Avenues. In 1893, Harry Beeman of Beeman Chewing Gum bought the San Juan Hotel and added two stories to the existing three story building. As its size increased, so did the hotel’s popularity as Orlando's premier destination for visitors and residents alike. During the 1920s, the San Juan Hotel was modernized as restaurants, a barbershop, a laundry mat, }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second floor was a favorite spot to view hangings at the Orange County Jail. In the spring of 1922 the Turner Construction Company constructed an eight-story addition to the north of the 1885 5-story wing right next to the [[Beacham Theatre]]. The San Juan hotel addition included restaurants, a barber shop, a laundromat, a pharmacy, as well as an office for [[Braxton Beacham]]. The hotel first suffered hard times in the 1960s, and on September 7 1975 The San Juan Hotel closed. But the 1976 It was opened again by a businessman but it didn't have enough clientele to stay open so it closed again in 1977. In October 1978 The San Juan reopened as the Grand Central Hotel, a hotel for gay clientele. But turns The San Juan was planning to be demolished holes were cut in the upper floors in preparation for demolition. But around 5 or 6 AM on the morning of January 2 1979 The top 3 stories of the 1885 5-story wing were on fire, There was a water leak which flooded down into the shops on the 1st floor as well, The 1922 8-story wing suffered only smoke and water damage. It is unknown to this day what started the fire. The San Juan Hotel was demolished in August 1980. The Orlando Historic Preservation Board were powerless to save it. On October 1980, the Orlando Historic Preservation board created the Downtown Orlando Historic District.

Tunnels connected the Beacham Theatre to the addition to the San Juan and [[Angebilt Hotel]]s.

The '''Second Launch Pad''' of the [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]] is a [[rocket launch site]] in [[Sriharikota]], [[India]]. It is the second of two launch pads at the centre. The Second Launch Pad or SLP was designed, supplied, erected &amp; commissioned by [[MECON Limited]], a Government of Indian Enterprise, located at Ranchi (Jharkhand, India) during the period March 1999 to December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meconlimited.co.in/FlashNews/Chandrayaan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220171630/http://www.meconlimited.co.in/FlashNews/Chandrayaan.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It cost about {{INRconvert|400|c|year=2005|lk=on}} at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/jharkhand/story_10006297.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The second launch pad with associated facilities was built in 2005. However it became operational only on 5 May 2005 with the launching of [[PSLV-C6]].

It is used by [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]]s and [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]]s, and is intended for use with future Indian rockets including the [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III|Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk.III]]&lt;ref name="ISRO-LF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/GroundFacilities/launchfacility.aspx|title=Launch Facility|publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation|accessdate=12 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417071046/http://www.isro.org/GroundFacilities/launchfacility.aspx|archivedate=17 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launches ==
The first launch from the pad occurred on 5 May 2005, and was of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carrying the [[CARTOSAT-1]] and [[HAMSAT]] satellites.&lt;ref name=ea20100412&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/sritaslp.htm|title=Sriharikota SLP|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, 9 PSLVs (all successful) and 6 GSLVs (2 success, 1 partial success &amp; 3 failures) have been launched from the complex. India's 1st Moon Mission, Chandrayan-I was launched from this launch pad on 22 October 2008. The most recent launch was of a PSLV-XL C32 on 10 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article2230383.ece ISRO-developed computer helped PSLV-C17 put satellite in orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

== Facilities ==
"As per the "Integrate, Transfer and Launch (ITL)" concept, based on which the launch pad and the associated facilities are designed, the entire vehicle is assembled and checked-out on a mobile pedestal in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and then moved in vertical position to the launch pad on a roll track."&lt;ref name="PDT"&gt;Public domain text sourced from the link - [http://www.isro.org/GroundFacilities/launchfacility.aspx ISRO Launch Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417071046/http://www.isro.org/GroundFacilities/launchfacility.aspx |date=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Other facilities include, Solid Stage Assembly Building (SSAB) connected to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) by a rail track, Technical Complex-2 (TC2), Spacecraft Preparation Facility, Range Instrumentation facilities comprising tracking, telemetry and tele-command systems."&lt;ref name="PDT"/&gt;

A new assembly building (SVAB - Second Vehicle Assembly Building) being constructed with a budgetary grant of {{INRconvert|630|c}} is nearing completion and is expected to be ready by mid 2018.This upgrade is expected to increase the launch capacity of second launch pad complex to 11 launches per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prajasakti.com/Article/Nellor/2004423 |title=PIF Project |publisher=Prajasakti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''talik''' is a layer of year-round unfrozen [[Soil|ground]] that lies in [[permafrost]] areas. In regions of continuous permafrost, taliks often occur underneath shallow [[thermokarst]] lakes and rivers, where the deep water does not [[freezing|freeze]] in winter, and thus the soil underneath will not freeze either. Sometimes closed, open and through talik are distinguished. These terms refer to whether the talik is completely surrounded by permafrost, is open to the top (e.g. a thermokarst lake), or open to both top and unfrozen layers beneath the permafrost, respectively.

==Supra-permafrost taliks==
Due to climate fluctuation or change, some permafrost regions may develop an unfrozen layer between the seasonally thawing/freezing active layer and the permafrost. The layer is called supra-permafrost (above the permafrost) talik; it is different from traditional taliks, which are usually associated with water bodies, in that supra-permafrost talik occurs because the ground that thawed in the summer does not completely refreeze in the winter. Calculations show that climate warming would induce supra-permafrost taliks in intermediately cold regions (in very cold regions, warming simply induces a deeper summer thaw without forming the talik layer; while in warm, shallow permafrost regions, permafrost quickly disappears). This type of taliks has recently been observed in [[Russia]]. With time and continued increase in air temperature or snow depth, this talik layer will become thicker and thicker and the deep permafrost layer would eventually disappear. Findings from a scientific study suggest occurrence of open taliks within areas of fault zones and those influenced by large rivers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Theobald Fischer''' (October 31, 1846 [[Döschwitz|Kirchsteitz]] – September 17, 1910) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]].

==Biography==
He was educated at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Halle|Halle]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] and at first devoted himself to history. A traveling tutorship directed his attention to geography, and he visited many parts of [[Europe]] in the pursuit of this study, but especially the [[Mediterranean]] lands, including North Africa (Atlas lands), e.g. the [[Tunisia]]n [[Sahara]] (1886), [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] (1888). The “Mediterranean region,” an example in the study of regional geography, is a conception the world owes to Fischer: his thesis for the rank of ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in the [[University of Bonn]] (1876) was entitled ''Beiträge zur physischen Geographie der Mittelmeerländer'' (Contributions to the physical geography of the lands of the Mediterranean), and his most important publications are a collection of ''Mittelmeerbilder'' (Mediterranean pictures) and his work on the Mediterranean peninsulas of [[Europe]] in [[Alfred Kirchhoff]]'s ''Allgemeine Länderkunde''.&lt;ref&gt;A complete citation for the last mentioned work is: Fischer, Theobald, “Die südosteuropäischen Halbinsel”, in Alfred Kirchoff, ed., ''Unser Wissen von der Erde. Allgemeine Erdkunde und Länderkunde''. '''3: Länderkunde von Europa''' (Second part, second half). Leipzig: G. Freytag, 1893, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

He held professorships of geography at the [[University of Kiel]] (1879-1883) and at [[University of Marburg]] from 1883 until his death. In addition to numerous contributions to scientific periodicals, and the works mentioned above, he also published ''Raccolta dei mappemondi e carte nautiche del XIII. al XVI. secolo'' (10 atlases, containing 79 leaves, 1881).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Topocide''' is the deliberate culling of a [[Location (geography)|place]] through industrial expansion and change, so that its earlier [[landscape]] and character are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Kelly|title=AP Human Geography 2009|year=2009|publisher=Kaplan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative term is [[domicide]], the destruction of home; the two may be viewed as synonyms or they may be opposed, with topocide referring to destruction from the point of view of the destroyers (generally outsiders) and domicide from the point of view of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porteous|first=Douglas|title=Domicide: The Global Destruction Of Home|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOwb3IXYfoEC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false|author2=Sandra E. Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Topocide can be the result of deliberate industrial expansion. When industries form, then the people's center of life revolve around that industry. New jobs are formed and the environmental and cultural landscape is forever changed.

Arguable examples include the destruction of [[Dresden]] at the end of World War II and the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s destruction in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Andrew E|title=Disaster and Development|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDfqfikFDmsC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''virtual globe''' is a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) [[computer software|software]] model or representation of the [[Earth]] or another world. A virtual globe provides the user with the ability to freely move around in the virtual environment by changing the viewing angle and position. Compared to a conventional [[globe]], virtual globes have the additional capability of representing many different views on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cag.2015.08.005 | last1 = Mahdavi-Amiri | first1 = A. | last2 = Alderson| first2 = T. | last3 = Samavati | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = A Survey of Digital Earth | url = | journal = Computers &amp; Graphics | volume = 53 | pages = 95–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These views may be of geographical features, man-made features such as [[roads]] and [[buildings]], or abstract representations of demographic quantities such as population.

On November 20, 1997, Microsoft released an ''offline'' virtual globe in the form of ''[[Encarta]] Virtual Globe 98'', followed by [[Cosmi Corporation|Cosmi]]'s [[3D World Atlas]] in 1999. The first widely publicized ''online'' virtual globes were [[NASA World Wind]] (released in mid-2004) and [[Google Earth]] (mid-2005). NOAA released its virtual globe, [http://sos.noaa.gov/SOS_Explorer/ Science On A Sphere (SOS) Explorer], in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sos.noaa.gov/SOS_Explorer/ Science On A Sphere (SOS) Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Virtual globes may be used for study or navigation (by connecting to a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the World as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. The other issue raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases.

Another type of virtual globe exists whose aim is not the accurate representation of the planet but instead a simplified graphical depiction. Most early computerized atlases were of this type and, while displaying less detail, these simplified interfaces are still widespread since they are faster to use because of the reduced graphics content and the speed with which the user can understand the display.

===List of virtual globe software===
{{see also|Comparison of web map services|Category:Street view services}}

As well as the availability of satellite imagery, online public domain factual databases such as the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] have been incorporated into virtual globes.

=== Technical info, data, and image sources ===

Although by default the World Wind download only comes with public domain imagery from the [[USGS]] and [[Landsat 7]], Community members have made available high resolution imagery for New Zealand and New York, here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/Add-on:ZoomIt! |title=Add-on:ZoomIt! - World Wind Wiki |publisher=Worldwindcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional countries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/Add-on:OneEarth&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Microsoft's Virtual Earth data (for non-commercial purposes)

Google Earth, NASA World Wind and Norkart Virtual Globe save a cache of downloaded imagery to the user's hard disk, enabling them to be used offline to view previously viewed areas. However, Google Earth cannot be activated without logging into its server the first time it is used.

The Google Earth's cache size is limited to 2000&amp;nbsp;MB whereas World Wind has no limit on cache size. In Norkart Virtual Globe the disk cache can be set by the user.

In addition to downloaded images, NASA World Wind also comes with the complete 500&amp;nbsp;m Blue Marble imagery&lt;ref name="bluemarble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/ |title=Blue Marble Next Generation : Feature Articles |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and global placenames including countries, capitals, counties, cities, towns and historical references that are available from install.

World Wind is also capable of displaying [[MODIS]] imagery from the JPL [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] and [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellites. An add-on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/Add-on:OnEarth |title=Add-on:OnEarth - World Wind Wiki |publisher=Worldwindcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for near-real-time MODIS imagery.

Google Earth and Virtual Earth 3D are both capable of displaying many more urban areas in high-resolution thanks to their private image sources. Both companies also hire chartered flights over major cities of the U.S. to take aerial images.

[http://sos.noaa.gov/SOS_Explorer/ Science On A Sphere (SOS) Explorer] is the desktop version of NOAA's Science On A Sphere  which is installed in 130+ museums around the world. It includes environmental datasets, NASA blue marble imagery, and was developed using the Unity 3D game engine. Focusing on Earth science education, it supports videos, tours, web content, satellite imagery, and KML.

[[Marble (KDE)]] is designed for use in lightweight environments without 3D [[hardware acceleration]] and is capable of not only being used as a standalone application, but also as a component in other applications, such as in a "World Clock" [[Plasma applet|Plasma (KDE)]] and for geolocation in the photo management software [[digiKam]].&lt;ref name=marblewidget&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edu.kde.org/marble/presentations/marble-sotm2008.pdf |format=PDF|title=OpenStreetmap "State Of The Map" presentation slides|publisher=Edu.kde.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D Weather Globe &amp; Atlas comes with complete 1&amp;nbsp;km Blue Marble imagery,&lt;ref name="bluemarble" /&gt; 40,000 locations database, countries and time zones overlays. Application requires Internet connection only for online features: satellite cloud cover and real-time weather and forecast data.

[[Worldwide Telescope]] data support includes raster and vector types, the latter including up to 700,000 points in a single layer..

osgEarth uses a [http://docs.osgearth.org/en/latest/user/earthfiles.html .earth XML map description] to configure both web map services and local data sources. osgEarth developers are able to use [http://readymap.org ReadyMap.org] free data services that hosts a 15m global basemap derived from the [http://www.landcover.org/data/ GLCF] Landsat imagery, 90M SRTM elevation dataset derived from [http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ CGIAR SRTM], and world-wide street vector overlay from [[OpenStreetMap]].

=== History ===
The use of virtual globe software was widely popularized by (and may have been first described in) [[Neal Stephenson]]'s famous [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Snow Crash]]''. In the [[metaverse]] in Snow Crash there is a piece of software called Earth made by the Central Intelligence Corporation. The CIC uses their virtual globe as a [[user interface]] for keeping track of all their geospatial data, including maps, architectural plans, weather data, and data from real-time satellite surveillance.

Virtual globes (along with all [[hypermedia]] and [[virtual reality]] software) are distant descendants of the [[Aspen Movie Map]] project, which pioneered the concept of using computers to simulate distant physical environments (though the Movie Map's scope was limited to the city of [[Aspen, Colorado]]).

Many of the functions of virtual globes were envisioned by [[Buckminster Fuller]] who in 1962 envisioned the creation of a [[Geoscope]] that would be a giant globe connected by computers to various databases. This would be used as an educational tool to display large scale global patterns related to topics such as economics, geology, natural resource use, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org/node/564 |title=R.

[[Image:Yomotsu Hirasaka.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Yomotsu Hirasaka in [[Higashiizumo]], [[Shimane Prefecture]]]]

{{Nihongo|'''Yomi''' or '''Yomi-no-kuni'''|黄泉 or 黄泉の国|}} is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for the land of the dead (World of Darkness).&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Terms of Shinto'', Kokugakuin University, Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics, Tokyo 1985&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Shinto]] mythology as related in [[Kojiki]], this is where the dead go [[afterlife|after life]]. Once one has eaten at the hearth of Yomi it is impossible to return to the land of the living. Yomi in [[Japanese mythology]] is comparable to [[Hell]] or [[Sheol]] and is most commonly known for [[Izanami]]'s retreat to that place after her death. [[Izanagi]] followed her there and upon his return he washed himself, creating [[Amaterasu]], [[Susanoo]], and [[Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto]] in the process.

This realm of the dead seems to have geographical continuity with this world and certainly cannot be thought of as a [[paradise]] to which one would aspire, nor can it appropriately be described as a [[hell]] in which one suffers retribution for past deeds; rather, all deceased carry on a gloomy and shadowy existence in perpetuity, regardless of their behavior in life. Many scholars believe that the image of Yomi was derived from ancient Japanese tombs in which corpses were left for some time to decompose.

The [[kanji]] that are sometimes used to transcribe ''Yomi'' actually refer to the mythological Chinese realm of the dead called [[Diyu]] or Huángquán (黄泉, lit. "Yellow Springs"), which appears in Chinese texts as early as the eighth century BCE.  This dark and vaguely defined realm was believed to be located beneath the earth, but it was not until the [[Han Dynasty]] that the Chinese had a clearly articulated conception of an underworld below in contrast with a heavenly realm above. The characters are ''[[jukujikun]]'', i.e. were used without regard to the actual meaning of the word Yomi, which is unknown. With regard to [[Japanese mythology]], Yomi is generally taken by commentators to lie beneath the earth and is part of a triad of locations discussed in [[Kojiki]]: {{Nihongo|''Takamahara''|高天原|also: [[Takama-ga-hara]]|lit., "high heavenly plain", located in the sky}}, {{Nihongo|''[[Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni]]''|葦原の中つ国|lit. "central land of reed plains", located on earth}}, and {{Nihongo|''Yomo-tsu-kuni''|黄泉国}} or {{Nihongo|''Yomi-no-Kuni''|黄泉の国| lit. "Land of Yomi"|located underground}}.  Yomi has also often been associated with the mythological realm of {{Nihongo|''[[Ne-no-Kuni]]''|根の国|lit. "Root Land / Land of Origin"}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''Ne-no-Katasukuni''|根の堅洲国|lit. "firm/hard-packed shoal land of origin"}}.

Yomi is ruled over by [[Izanami]] no Mikoto, the Grand Deity of Yomi (''Yomo-tsu-Ōkami'' 黄泉大神).  According to [[Kojiki]], the entrance to Yomi lies in [[Izumo province]] and was sealed off by [[Izanagi]] upon his flight from Yomi, at which time he permanently blocked the entrance by placing a massive boulder (''Chigaeshi no ōkami'' 道反の大神) at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi (''Yomotsu Hirasaka'' 黄泉平坂 or 黄泉比良坂).  Upon his return to Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, [[Izanagi]] noted that Yomi is a "polluted land" (''kegareki kuni'').  This opinion reflects the traditional [[Shinto]] association between death and pollution. Later Susanoo takes this position over.

==Christian uses==

Some [[Japanese Christian]] texts use 黄泉 to refer to what is called [[Hell]] in the English versions. For example, [http://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/%E3%83%A8%E3%83%8F%E3%83%8D%E3%81%AE%E9%BB%99%E7%A4%BA%E9%8C%B2(%E5%8F%A3%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%B3)#6:8 Revelation 6:8],

{{Verse translation|そこで見ていると、見よ、青白い馬が出てきた。そして、それに乗っている者の名は「死」と言い、それに'''黄泉'''が従っていた|And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him|lang=ja|italicsoff=yes}}

It is generally conceived as being similar to a typical Chinese capital city, such as [[Chang'an]], but surrounded with and pervaded with darkness.

==Name==
"You" (幽) in Chinese means "dark". "Du" (都) means "capital". Thus, Youdu is the Dark Capital (Yang 2005: 236). Among other meanings, ''You'' can mean "hidden", "secluded", and is in particular used to indicate the underworld.

==Location==
Youdu is located under the earth, in the Region of Darkness, also known as Diyu, or the Yellow Springs. The general ruler of this realm is [[Houtu]], but there are many other functionaries which have been believed to inhabit this region, and with the more important individuals being located in Youdu, as the capital city and seat of government.

==Description==
Youdu has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes differences exist according to the religious affiliation of the text, for example whether more Buddhist, folk-oriented, or secular. Being located in the darkness underground is the most common feature. Generally, lighting is provided by torches and candles. Youdu may be the best-lit area of Diyu.

===Inhabitants===
Youdu is the home or official residence of various deities, and also the location of their official offices or palaces. The souls of the dead are their fellow inhabitants and subjects. There are also many subordinate demons which serve to carry out the commands of the judges. Many of these are concerned with punishing or processing the souls of the dead for reincarnation. The sovereign deity is generally considered to be [[King Yama]]. Beneath him in rank ten other kings serve as judges of the souls of the dead.

===Creatures===
Various creatures also inhabit Youdu, including a creature that can determine truth from falsehood.

===Places===
Youdu is generally conceived of as similar to a typical historical Chinese capital city, such as [[Chang'an]]. Thus, it has a city wall, palaces, a hall of justice, and various residences for the ghosts of the dead. Especially, important is the housing for the official records, which allow the various judges to determine proper punishments or occasionally to allow someone who dies before their officially allotted time has expired to be returned to life. Especially important in this regard are the place of King Yama and the Ten Courts of Justice.

==Events==
Youdu is a major scene of action in various myths, as well as literary works derived from the myths, legends, or religious descriptions or depictions. In the novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', [[Sun Wukong]] visits it repeatedly.
