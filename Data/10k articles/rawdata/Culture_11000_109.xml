'''''.hack//Link''''' is a [[single-player]] [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[CyberConnect2]] for the {{nowrap|[[PlayStation Portable]]}}. The game was released exclusively in [[Japan]] on March 4, 2010.

Set in a fictional version of the year 2020, ''.hack//Link's'' story takes place in a new version of “The World,” a popular series of MMORPGs known as The World: RX. The game focuses on a young man named Tokio Kuryuu, a second year junior-high student who gets transported into The World: RX by a new student named  Saika Amagi. After arriving into the game, Tokio is tasked by an artificial intelligence version of the character Kite to be a hero and use a tower of the Akashic Records to save the Twilight Knights, a group of artificial intelligence versions of characters based on casts of previous entries in the ''.hack'' series. Using the Akashic Records, Tokio is able to travel backwards in time to previous ''.hack'' entries and encounter past characters in order to unfreeze the data of the Twilight Knights.

Since its release, ''.hack//LINK'' has been met with negative to mixed reception among both critics and fans alike. With many praising the expansion of the series' overall lore, but with strong criticism towards the gameplay of the title.

Although never stated to be the final chapter to the [[.hack|.hack series]], the game is currently the last game in the chronology of the series to bear the name of ''.hack''. The game was eventually followed with future installments known as ''Guilty Dragon: The Sin Dragon and the Eight Curses'' and ''New World Vol. 1: Maiden of Silver Tears'' for both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms. Both games have since had their services discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://gematsu.com/2016/01/guilty-dragon-end-service-march-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siliconera.com/2016/10/21/hacknew-world-shut-less-year-service-december/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story takes place in the year 2020. Tokio Kuryuu is a normal middle-school student who loves to play games. One day, a transfer student named Saika Amagi approaches Tokio and takes him to the school rooftop where she sends Tokio directly into The World R:X. There, he finds Kite, the legendary hero and leader of Twilight Knight dedicated to protect The World fighting against Flügel, the leader of a mysterious group called Schicksal. During their battle, Kite protected Tokio from Flügel's attack, resulting Kite's PC to be frozen but not before he asked Tokio to save them. Tokio is then transported to Saika's hideout, Grand Whale, and forcefully makes him her slave to find four items called Chrono Cores that are necessary to fully control the Akashic Record, a god-like power that holds over the system of The World and enables them to travel to the past data of The World. Using the Akashic Record, Tokio and Saika travels throughout the past timelines of .hack series to find the Chrono Cores and restored the frozen data of all members of Twilight Knights, gaining new allies in the process.

During their journey, Tokio befriends AIKA, a benevolent AIDA-PC that greatly resembles Saika whom the latter introduces as some sort of her alter ego. Saika also reveals that the reason she's gather Chrono Cores is because her cousin, Jyotaro Amagi, has sent her an email that tells her to save him by gathering all the Chrono Cores. One of Schicksal members, Geist, for some reason has been indirectly helping Tokio to get the Chrono Cores and at the same time getting rid of his own Schicksal comrades who were getting on Tokyo's way. The mystery behind Tokio's ability to directly entering the game is revealed because he is a Doubleware, a special kind of human who has the ability to real digitise himself into network.

Near reaching the top of Akashic Record, Tokio are confronted by the five remaining members of Schicksal. However, two of the members, Metronome and Geist betrays Flügel, allowing Tokio and Saika to reach the core of Akashic Records where they finds Aura trapped inside by Schicksal who reveals that they have been tricked. At this time, a virus suddenly came out from Tokio's body and slowly corrupting Aura. Geist reveals that he was the one who sent the email and the R:X disk to Saika by posing as Jyotaro so that he could corrupt Aura by using Tokio's power as a Doubleware combined with the virus that he implanted inside Tokio from the disk. Now working together with Flügel and the remaining members of Schicksal, Tokio confronts and defeats Geist who reveals that he was planning to bring forth Immortal Dusk, a plan to real digitize all humanity that started by his creator, Jyotaro, but Flügel reveals that the plan was a failure, and Jyotaro had been the very first victim of the plan, resulting him to be in coma for years.

Aura, who was completely corrupted, begins her onslaught throughout the network and begins to real digitise all humanity as a form of her twisted love for The World. Hoping to return Aura to normal, Tokio and all the revived Twilight Knights confronts Aura and uses the vaccines program that Saika has created to restore her. Unfortunately, the vaccine isn't enough to destroy the virus inside Aura, and one by one Tokio's friend was defeated. To save everyone, AIKA sacrifices herself to restore Aura's data and disappears. After the incident, Saika suddenly disappears, prompting Tokio to ask Flügel for help to locate her and finds her at a hospital where she is tending Jyotaro. Saika reveals her guilt for involving Tokio and blames herself for AIKA's death so she tries her best to just forget everything that happens and hopes for Tokio to do the same. Tokio refuses and convinces Saika that everything that happened are too meaningful and precious to be forgotten, telling her there's no need for her to bear the sadness alone. Tokio and Saika reaffirms their friendship, both determines to overcome their sadness over AIKA's death.

==Reception==
Reaction to .hack//Link has been moderate to negative among both critics and fans alike. Famitsu magazine has commented that while Link's story is deep and engaging the gameplay itself is shallow and boring. The [[juggle combo]] feature in battles has been said to be fun on the first try but that over the course of the game many simply ignored it. The large cast has been praised by fans for the return of many classic characters, but many complain that some of the new X-forms are not required and that they ruin the flair.  Heath Hindman, in RPGLand.com's review, shared many of these complaints in addition to ones regarding a "dreadful camera" and repetition "on a whole new level," among others. Hindman did have high praise for the story, however, saying, "It ties up many loose ends while adding a bit more info and detail to the world of The World. Moreover, it does so while managing to give a shout out to practically every major .hack side project and providing a great mix of fan service and real quality work". Ultimately, despite the story's strength, the .hack//Link's high number of game-breaking faults got it an overall rating of "Horrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=January 31, 2011 | title=Dot hack Link review | url=http://rpgland.com/games/reviews/hack-link/ | work=rpgland.com | accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off material==
In 2009 [[Namco Bandai Games]] announced at [[Tokyo Game Show]] that an all CG anime-series "tie-in" is going to be produced.  Not many details were known other than it was not going to be a television series.  They also announced that [[CyberConnect2]]'s team "sai" is the production force for the CG film.

Later a 2D anime [[Original Video Animation]] series known as ''[[.hack//Quantum]],'' produced by [[Kinma Citrus]] was announced with a subsequent 3DCGI movie known as ''[[.hack//The Movie]]'' being produced by CyberConnect 2 Sai.

'''Afrofuturism''' is a cultural [[aesthetic]], philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African/African Diaspora culture with technology.

==History==
===Mid-late 20th century development===
Despite Afrofuturism being coined in 1993, scholars tend to agree that Afrofuturistic music, art and text became more common and widespread in the late 1950s. The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]]. For many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]]. 

Afrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] ("pure cloned funk"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of "certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies".

Other musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],&lt;ref name=reddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/376/392 |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–90 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcleus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976–1986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotti Golden]] &amp; Richard Scher, electro hip hop producer/writers of [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]", a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, described as a "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1994 essay "Black to the Future", began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art. Dery dubbed this phenomenon "Afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dery|first=Mark|date=1994|title=Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose|url=https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf|journal=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture|location=Durham, NC|publisher=Duke University Press|page=180|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural critic [[Kodwo Eshun]], British journalist [[Mark Sinker]] was theorizing a form of Afrofuturism in the pages of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', a British music magazine, as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1992|title=Black Science Fiction|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-wire/february-1992-(issue-96)-35378/30/2/|journal=The Wire|publisher=Exact Editions Ltd.|page=30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrofuturist ideas have further been expanded by scholars like [[Alondra Nelson]], [[Greg Tate]], [[Tricia Rose]], [[Kodwo Eshun]], and others.&lt;ref name=history-future /&gt; In an interview, Alondra Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people which covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a utopic future. The idea of "alien" or "other" is a theme often explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Alondra Nelson (Interviewee) | title = Afrofuturism |medium = Youtube | year = 2010 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFhEjaal5js}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about a so-called "[[digital divide]]".&lt;ref name="Nelson-Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1527-1951 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–15 | last = Nelson | first = Alondra | title = Introduction: Future Texts | journal = Social Text: Special Issue on Afrofuturism | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | year = 2002 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/v020/20.2nelson01.html | doi=10.1215/01642472-20-2_71-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide overemphasizes the association of racial and economic inequality with limited access to technology.  This association then begins to construct blackness "as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress".&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt; As a critique of the neo-critical argument that the future's history-less identities will end burdensome stigma, Afrofuturism holds that history should remain a part of identity, particularly in terms of race.&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt;

===21st century===

A new generation of recording artists have embraced Afrofuturism into their music and fashion, including [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Beyoncé]]. This tradition continues from artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Janelle Monáe]], who incorporated cyborg themes and metallics into their style.&lt;ref name="La Ferla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Afrofuturism: The Next Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other 21st century musicians who have been characterized as Afrofuturist include singer [[FKA Twigs]],&lt;ref name="La Ferla"/&gt; musical duo [[Ibeyi]],&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; and DJ/producer [[Ras G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism takes flight: from Sun Ra to Janelle Monáe|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=2014-07-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, artists such as Rihanna and Beyoncé have often been interpreted by the public as having some non-human elements about them, exhibited in both their performances, and in their day to day interactions. Because the tabloids have so much control over the way that information is digested, the public receives images of these women that are distant and controlled solely by the media, and thus, these women are often painted as angry or unfeeling. Scholars such as Robin James have interrogated and expanded upon the work of Kodwo Eshun, and coined the idea of the "robo-diva". These scholars both argue that the Black experience has always been more alien than it has been human, and James connects the mechanics of the middle passage to alien abduction through concepts of kidnapping, isolation, and bowing down to an unknown power. Kodwo Eshun also posits that perhaps the categorization of "human" has no use in the Black community, and that instead, the category of "robot" is not only more powerful, but more accurately representative of the positioning in the social hierarchy in which Black people exist in the present day. Because musical artists (Rihanna, Beyoncé) exhibit such non-human qualities, they are often ostracized for being "cold" or "mechanical". The white patriarchy both fears and admires such artists due to their unapologetic displays of female sexuality and its interactions with technology. These fears then propel the virgin/whore dichotomy that stems from the trope of the Jezebel, and serves to further the racialized projections of stereotypes onto Black females in the music industry.

[[Janelle Monáe]] has made a conscious effort to restore Afrofuturist cosmology to the forefront of urban contemporary music. Her notable works include the music videos "Prime Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=janellemonae|title=Janelle Monáe – PrimeTime ft.

This ArchAndroid role reflects earlier Afrofuturistic figures Sun Ra and George Clinton, who created their own visuals as extraterrestrial beings rescuing African-Americans from the oppressive natures of Earth.

Chicago is home to a vibrant community of artists exploring Afrofuturism. [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], known for his Soundsuits project, has helped develop younger talent as the director of the graduate fashion program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other artists include visual artists Hebru Brantley as well as contemporary artist [[Rashid Johnson]], a Chicago native currently based in New York. In 2013, Chicago resident Ytasha L. Womack wrote the study ''Afrofuturism: The World of Black Science Fiction and Fantasy'', and William Hayashi has published all three volumes of his ''Darkside Trilogy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|title=(( The Dark Side Trilogy )) Book One : Discovery – by William Hayashi|website=www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of what happens in America when the country discovers African Americans secretly living on the backside of the moon since before the arrival of Neil Armstrong, an extreme vision of segregation imposed by technologically advanced Blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Xlibris | isbn = 1441586946 | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Discovery: Volume 1 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = XLIBRIS | isbn = 149310005X | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Conception: Volume 2 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} [[Krista Franklin]], a member of University of Chicago's Arts Incubator, is currently exploring the relation between Afrofuturism and the grotesque through her visual and written work with weaves and collected hair.

== Literature ==

The creation of the term Afrofuturism in the 1990s was often primarily used to categorize "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture,"&lt;ref name="Bould"&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon expanded to include artistic, scientific, and spiritual practices throughout the [[African diaspora]]. Contemporary practice retroactively identifies and documents historical instances of Afrofuturist practice and integrates them into the canon. For example, the [[Dark Matter (series)|Dark Matter]] anthologies edited by [[Sheree Thomas]] feature contemporary [[Black science fiction]], discuss Ralph Ellison's [[Invisible Man]] in her introduction, "Looking for the Invisible," and also include older works by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], and [[George S. Schuyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Sheree|authorlink=Sheree Thomas |editor-first=Sheree |editor-last=Thomas |title=Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora |year=2000|publisher=Warner Aspect |isbn=0446525839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Yazsek argues that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel, ''[[Invisible Man]]'', should be thought of as a predecessor to Afrofuturist literature. Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better – or even any –  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for "this kind of future-historical art" to those who succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=297–313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes. [[Nnedi Okorafor]] has been labeled this way, both for her [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Hugo Award]]-winning [[Binti (novel)|Binti]] novella series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384030/nnedi-okorafor-binti-home-afrofuturist-science-fiction-review|title=The Binti novellas are fun, bite-sized stories of interstellar Afrofuturism|date=2017-01-25|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for her novel ''[[Who Fears Death]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-far-out-guide-to-afrofuturism-and-black-magic_us_5711403fe4b0060ccda34a37|title=Your Brief And Far-Out Guide To Afrofuturism|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|date=2016-04-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Barnes]] has been called an Afrofuturist author for his alternate-history novels ''[[Lion's Blood]]'' and ''[[Zulu Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; [[N.

"Loving the Alien." ''The Wire'' 96 (February 1992): 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; this association has been somewhat controversial, since Butler incorporates multi-ethnic and multi-species communities that insist on "hybridity beyond the point of discomfort".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"&gt;Kilgore, De Witt Douglas and Ranu Samantrai. "A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fourth book of the science fiction [[Patternist series]], ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', particularly fits ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth century America.&lt;ref name="Canavan"&gt;Canavan, Gerry.

=== Museum and gallery exhibitions ===

In recent years, there have been many museum exhibitions displaying art with Afrofuturist themes.

The [[Studio Museum in Harlem|Studio Museum]] in Harlem held a major exhibit exploring Afrofuturistic aesthetics from November 14, 2013 to March 9, 2014. The exhibit, called ''The Shadows Took Shape'', displayed more than sixty works of art that looked at recurring themes such as identity in relation to technology, time, and space within African-American communities. Artists featured in the exhibit included Derrick Adams, [[Laylah Ali]] and Khaled Hafez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/the-shadows-took-shape|title=The Shadows Took Shape|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation and treatment of black female bodies is deconstructed by Afrofuturist contemporaries and amplified to alien and gruesome dimensions by artists such as [[Wangechi Mutu]] and Shoshanna Weinberger.

===The grotesque===

In the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a "mutant" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D. Scott|title=AfroSurreal Generation: AFROSURREAL MANIFESTO|url=https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214100010/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alienation===
Afrofuturism takes representations of the lived realities of black people in the past and present, and reexamines the narratives to attempt to build new truths outside of the dominant cultural narrative. By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|year=|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using "extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287–302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, "black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.

This is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their "history" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schrödinger's cat of African American past.

Another example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.

=== Reclamation ===
Ostensibly, Afrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery first coined the term, he says Afrofuturism as "giving rise to a troubling antinomy". This means that the seeming contradiction of a past being snuffed out and the writing of a future sees its possibilities in Afrofuturism. Furthermore, this Afrofuturism kind of story telling is not regulated to one aspect of communication. It is in novels and essays, academic writings and in music, but by its creation, it is ultimately reclaiming some type of autonomy over one's story that has historically been restricted.

Therefore, when Afrofuturism manifests itself in the music of the 80's and beyond, it is under the Afrofuturist's sensibility. It is in this way that, as Mark Dery says, "African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart". Because the ancestors of African Americans were forcibly removed from their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.

== Afrofuturism 2.0 ==
Afrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as "The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement".&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"/&gt; Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broaden to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.

In conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like "magical Negroes" or "references to Sun Ra". Through this identification of "overused tropes" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled "The Mundane Afrofuturist promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.

"'''Arcadia'''" is the fifteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on March 7, 1999. The episode was written by [[Daniel Arkin]] and directed by [[Michael Watkins]]. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Arcadia" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.5, being watched by 17.91 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive critical reception, with many reviewers praising the episode's humor.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, several disappearances at an idyllic [[planned community]] lead Mulder and Scully to go undercover as a married couple. They find that the members of the community strictly abide by every single subdivision rule, no matter how inconsequential a rule may seem. What Mulder and Scully soon discover is that the ruler of this small community has enforced his rule with a [[Tulpa]] creature from [[Tibet]].

Arkin, a first-year staff writer for the show, was inspired to write the episode based on an incident in his life that involved a planned community. The episode heavily utilized special effects, with various make-up and digital effects inserted into the final film to give the episode an appropriate feel.

==Plot==

At the Falls of Arcadia, a fictional [[planned community]] in [[San Diego County, California]], disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives at home to find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky [[whirligig]], which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in bed that night, Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.

[[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) investigate the Klines' disappearance, going undercover as new homeowners under the aliases [[The Dick Van Dyke Show#Characters|Rob and Laura Petrie]]. As Mulder and Scully are moving into the Klines' former home, neighbor Win Shroeder nervously tucks away Mulder's basketball hoop into the garage, telling him that it is against the community's [[Covenant (law)#Planned communities|CC&amp;Rs]]. Settling in, the agents begin searching the house and find what appears to be blood on a blade of the ceiling fan. When Big Mike, another neighbor, wants to let the "Petries" in on the "consequences" of breaking the CC&amp;Rs, [[homeowner association]] president Gene Gogolak describes him as "a weak link" to be dealt with. That night, Big Mike disappears after being attacked by the creature. While taking a walk, Scully later finds the Schroeder's dog Scruffy and Big Mike's necklace in a storm drain. Scruffy's face is covered in a substance that looks like blood.

Mulder and Scully discuss possible motives for the Klines' presumed murders, and Scully decides to have the substances analyzed in San Diego. Mulder decides to test his theories that noncompliance with the CC&amp;Rs is the motive by sticking a [[plastic flamingo]] in the yard, damaging the mailbox, among other antics. Mulder later finds a note in his mailbox that says, "Be like the others... before it gets dark". After dark, Mulder brings out his basketball hoop, and Shroeder runs over to frantically argue with Mulder to put it away. Meanwhile, something comes out of the grass at Mrs. Shroeder, who screams. Mulder chases it away, but they all notice their light has burned out.

Shroeder confronts Gogolak, accusing him of trying to kill his family. Instead Schroeder is told "Rob Petrie" is the real problem. Meanwhile, Mulder believes the creature that kills the homeowners moves through the yard, under the grass. Scully shares her lab results: the "blood" on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built on top of an old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig up the front yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a [[reflecting pool]], which is not against the CC&amp;Rs. They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.

As Scully calls for a forensic team to come out there immediately, she hears something in the house. She goes for her gun in the dresser drawer, but finds it missing. As the creature comes up the stairs, a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out, that "it's coming" for her. He shoves Scully in the closet, and fights with the creature. Meanwhile, Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill. Mulder says the creature is a [[tulpa]], a [[Tibet]]an thoughtform, that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the CC&amp;Rs. Mulder arrests him, handcuffs him to a mailbox, and goes to find Scully. Cuffed to the mailbox, Gogolak begs for help, knowing the creature is coming. The creature attacks Gogolak and, as he dies, it disintegrates into dirt. Scully comes outside too late to see the creature, the remnants of which are at Mulder's feet.&lt;ref name="plot"/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Arcadia" was inspired by life in planned communities.]]

===Inspiration and writing===
[[Daniel Arkin]], a first-year staff writer for the show, was inspired to write "Arcadia" based on an incident that had occurred several years prior: In 1991, he had moved into an "uptight planned communit[y]" in [[Greenwich Village]]. Unfortunately, his movers showed up late, forcing him to begin unloading his belongings in the later part of the evening. Because Arkin had neglected to read the community's "three hundred page"-long [[Covenant (law)#In planned communities|covenants, conditions, and restrictions]], he was later shocked to discover that the complex had fined him one thousand dollars for moving in after the approved hours. The incident stuck in Arkin's mind, and when he was tasked with writing a story for ''The X-Files'', he immediately jumped to the "frightening" reality of planned communities.&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt;

The story went through many variations, and when Arkin wrote his first draft, the main antagonist was simply a man who served as a metaphorical "[[bogeyman]]."&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt; After series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] suggested that Arkin replace the human with an actual monster, he quickly re-wrote his story to include elements of the Tulpa myth. The idea to "marry" Mulder and Scully came from a writers meeting, as everyone felt it would be a convincing way for Mulder and Scully to go undercover.&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt;

===Casting and design===
[[Abraham Benrubi]], noted at the time for his work as [[List of desk clerks and other non-medical staff in ER#Jerry Markovic|Jerry Markovic]] on the [[NBC]] hospital drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', was cast by Rick Millikan to play Big Mike.&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt; The NBC production staff was hesitant to allow him to appear on the show, given his tight production schedule, but, as Millikan later explained, "there was a small window—he had a few days off—and we were able to squeeze him in there."&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m169"/&gt;

Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf, the make-up department head for ''The X-Files'', was responsible for making Benrubi appear mauled and bloody. Applying the necessary makeup and prosthetics took four hours, and Benrubi wore his makeup for almost twelve hours straight. Costume designer Christine Peters was tasked with designing the outfits for Mulder and Scully. Mulder's outfit was composed largely of "[[Izod Lacoste|Lacoste Izod]] [[Lacoste|alligator shirts]], [[Dockers (brand)|Dockers]], Bass Weeguns," and Scully's outfit was "jeans and a sweatshirt [or] khakis and sneakers."&lt;ref name="m169"/&gt; Peters noted that Scully's outfit was harder to design because Scully's character has "a 'look' that she doesn't want to give up."&lt;ref name="m169"&gt;Meisler, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
{{quote box|width=28em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|The problem was that although the basic concept was good, no one could really envision what this strange beast—a psychological manifested compilation of garbage—should look like.|source=—Bruce Carter, discussing making the monster&lt;ref name="m168"/&gt;}}
The show's production crew had a difficult time designing the monster, which later earned a variety of colorful nicknames courtesy of the show's production staff, including "[[Gumby]] on Steroids," "[[Mrs. Butterworth|Mr. Butterworth]]," "Fecal Fred," and "The Shit Monster."&lt;ref name="m168"&gt;Meisler, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;. Assistant director Bruce Carter explained that the two choices were either to make a creature that "has grown muscle and sinew through the force of Gene Gogolak's personality", or make a more conventional garbage creature covered in "banana peels and coffee grounds."&lt;ref name="m168" /&gt; Makeup supervisor John Vulich eventually designed a monster outfit that was, effectively, a "foam rubber suit" made out of [[Polyurethane|urethane]].&lt;ref name="m168" /&gt; Shredded rubber was then attached to the suit, which was then submerged in "gunk" to create the garbage effect.&lt;ref name="m168" /&gt; Despite all this work, the final episode does not contain many shots of the monster, as most of its scenes were cut during the editing phrase.&lt;ref name="m168"&gt;Meisler, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital effects supervisor Bill Millar was tasked to edit Scully's "evidence video". He explained that "they wanted Scully's point of view rather than the Handicam's point of view."&lt;ref name="m169"/&gt; Unfortunately, he was given the film the Friday before the episode aired. The complete special effects for just this short video required roughly six hours to complete.&lt;ref name="m169"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Ratings===
"Arcadia" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on March&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;1999. This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.5, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.5 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.&lt;ref name="comp"/&gt; It was viewed by 17.91 million viewers.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;Meisler, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The episode aired in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] on [[Sky1]] on June 20, 1999 and received 1.02 million viewers, making it the most watched episode that week.&lt;ref name="barb2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10/? |title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes |publisher=barb.co.uk |accessdate=1 January 2012}} Note: Information is in the section titled "w/e June 14–20, 1999", listed under Sky 1&lt;/ref&gt; Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "Mulder and Scully married!

===Reviews===
"Arcadia" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rob Bricken from [[Topless Robot]] named "Arcadia" the tenth funniest ''X-Files'' episode and noted the two levels of humor in the episode—the "blatantly hilarious" pairing of Mulder and Scully as husband and wife, and the "perfect parody" of the planned community way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=13 October 2009|last=Bricken|first=Rob|title=The 10 Funniest X-Files Episodes|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/10/the_10_funniest_x-files_episodes.php?page=2|work=Topless Robot|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Sexton from [[Yahoo!

Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B+" and called it "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; However, he noted that the episode is not one of the series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that "the episode’s monster is a little hard to figure out".&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title='Arcadia'/'Forcing the End' {{!}} The X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club {{!}} TV|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/arcadiaforcing-the-end,84578/|work=[[The A.V.

Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files'' gave the episode a more mixed review, writing "after watching 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect."&lt;ref name="mess"&gt;Kessenich, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.&lt;ref name="cinepaula"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Sixth Season Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=26–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites."&lt;ref name=cinepaula/&gt;

In the 1999 [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] [[Thanksgiving]] Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, "Arcadia" was presented as the "Best Mulder/Scully Chemistry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The X-Files Thanksgiving Marathon (November 25, 1999)|medium=TV|publisher=[[TV channel|FX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bengali mythology''' in a literal sense has been a derivative of [[Vedic mythology]]. It can refer to the historical legends and folk tales of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. Given the historical Hindu and Buddhist presence in the region, characters from Vedic and Hindu mythology are present within Bengali literature. Later Islamic settlement has introduced legendary traits that ultimately draw from Middle Eastern inspirations. Such an example of the Vedic and Islamic legend transaction would be the progenitor of Bengalis known as Bonga, Hindu literature credits him as an ancient Hindu Prince Vanga, adopted son of King Vali. Muslim accounts however refer him as Bong, son of Hind who was the grandson of Prince.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D07601010%26ct%3D11 SECTION II.— DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Caipira''''' ({{IPA-pt|kajˈpiɾɐ|-|Br-Caipira.ogg}}; ([[Old Tupi]] ''ka'apir'' or ''kaa - pira'', which means "bush cutter") is a inhabitant of rural or remote areas in the interior of [[Centro-Sul|the south-central part]] of [[Brazil]]. Their racial origins and traditional culture is similar to those of the ''[[caiçaras]]'', who inhabit the coastal regions of the south, and the ''[[ribeirinhos]]'', who are riverbank dwellers in the [[Brazilian Amazon|Amazon region]].

By extension, the term ''caipira'' can also be applied to the different cultural manifestations of the ''caipiras'', such as [[Música caipira|their folk music]]. It is also the name of a [[Caipira dialect|group of dialects]] of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] spoken in the interior part of the [[São Paulo (state)|State of São Paulo]] and adjacent areas of neighbouring states.

The term can be considered pejorative when used to describe others (akin to "[[yokel]]"), however, it can also be used as a self-identifier without negative connotations (akin to "[[melungeon]]"). In the traditional [[Festa Junina|festas juninas]] people who are not otherwise considered as such dress up as stereotypical caipiras.

The [[diminutive]] form of the word, ''[[caipirinha]]'', is the name of a [[cocktail]] considered Brazil's national drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistacasaejardim.globo.com/Revista/Common/0%2c%2cEMI278045-16940%2c00-A+HISTORIA+DA+CAIPIRINHA.html|title=Casa e Jardim - NOTÍCIAS - A história da caipirinha|language=pt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117035757/http://revistacasaejardim.globo.com/Revista/Common/0%2C%2CEMI278045-16940%2C00-A%2BHISTORIA%2BDA%2BCAIPIRINHA.html|archivedate=2011-11-17|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-12-02|quote=Até que um dia alguém resolveu tirar o alho e o mel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14284">'''Campaign furniture''' is a type of furniture made for travel. Historically, much of it was made for military campaigns.
[[File:CampaignLineMarch.jpg|right|thumb|Line of March of a Bengal Regiment of Infantry in Scinde, showing furniture packed onto camels c.&amp;nbsp;1843]]

==Description==
[[File:CampaignRossChairs.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of campaign chairs by Ross &amp; Co. of Dublin]]
Any furniture specifically made to break down or fold for ease of travel can be described as campaign furniture. It was designed to be packed up and carried on the march. It has been used by traveling armies since at least the time of [[Julius Caesar]] but it is commonly associated with British Army officers, many of whom had purchased their commissions. With the rise and expansion of the [[British Empire]] in the 19th and 20th centuries the demand by the military, administrators and colonists increased. British officers of high social position in the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] periods (1714–1901) often carried high-quality portable furniture.

The most common item of campaign furniture is the chest of drawers, often referred to as a military chest or campaign chest. Campaign chests' primary wood was often mahogany, teak, or camphor, although cedar, pine and other woods were also used. The dominant type breaks down into two sections, and has removable feet. The brass corners and [[strapwork]] offer some protection and typify the distinctive "campaign look".

A similar type of furniture was made for naval service, and even for merchant ships, which allowed furnishings to be used in port or peacetime, but stowed out of harm's way in action, or during rough weather.  Naval furniture is often extremely small, reflecting the cramped quarters available on ship. (Some sea-going pieces were also made for frequent travelers, or intended for permanent use after the journey.) Seagoing furniture sometimes has fiddle rails to prevent items from sliding off top surfaces; the fiddles were often themselves removable, with brass mounting sockets for the fiddle pins.

Some items of campaign furniture are instantly recognizable as made to dismantle or fold. Brass caps to the tops of legs, hinges in unusual places, protruding bolts or X-frame legs all give clues to the functionality of the piece. However, some pieces were designed to be up to date and fashionable. In such cases, as much of it looked like domestic furniture, it is harder to see how it dismantles. [[Ross &amp; Co. Dublin Cabinet Makers|Ross and Co. of Dublin]] were innovators of campaign furniture design and much of their work is obviously Victorian in period. It only becomes apparent that their balloon back chairs dismantle when they are turned upside down and two locking bolts can be seen.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign Furniture|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91110/campaign-furniture|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CampaignChest.jpg|thumb|right|Anglo Indian Campaign or military chest]]

==Examples==
An old copy of [[Army &amp; Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|The Army &amp; Navy Co-Operative Society Limited's]] catalogue will show that there was a large variety of items, from portable beds to collapsible candlesticks (also known as Brighton Buns), that were available to ease life for the soldier or traveller by the end of the 19th century.

There seemed no limit to the number of items an officer would take with him if he could afford to and how well one's tent was kitted out was perhaps an indication of your social standing. [[William Howard Russell]] of ''[[The Times]]'' noted on 2 February 1858 in his diary, "Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell's]] baggage &amp;c. extended for eighteen miles, when he came down from Lucknow".

The numerous items specifically made for travel include a variety of types of bed from four poster or tent beds to chairs that would extend for sleeping; large dining tables, dining chairs, easy chairs, sofas and couches, chests of drawers, book cabinets, washstands, wardrobes, shelves, desks, mirrors, lanterns and candlesticks, canteens of silver, cooking equipment, toiletry equipment and thunderboxes were all made to be portable.

By the mid-19th century the demand for campaign furniture encouraged many makers to be inventive in their design thus creating many unusual and interesting pieces that offer a surprise in the ease in which they dismantle or the compactness of their storage. Tables were cleverly hinged to fold down into a box the size of a briefcase, chess board boxes would contain tripod legs and a telescopic column to convert into a table; chairs that would break down to a minimal size and could also be altered to become a sedan were all designed. The need to quickly be able to pack a piece of furniture to make it portable with minimal use of bolts etc. became the mother of invention.

A number of pieces of domestic furniture are commonly mis-described as campaign simply because they have handles to the sides, are metamorphic or dual purpose. Some campaign furniture certainly had these attributes but there was also much furniture produced with these qualities that was never intended for travel. Sometimes handles were added to pieces of furniture simply to make them easier to move from one part of the room to another. Metamorphic or dual purpose furniture was also popular for bachelors who typically had smaller lodgings and had to make use of their limited space. A library table that turned into a set of steps would also be useful in a larger house that did not want the steps constantly on view. It is often thought that the Wellington Chest must be a piece of campaign furniture because it was named for the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|1st Duke of Wellington]]. The vast majority were not made with travel in mind as they have over hanging mouldings or bases etc. It is forgotten that Wellington also had a distinguished life away from the battlefield. The seven drawers (one for each day of the week) enabled him to organise his business as a politician.

== Manufacturers ==
The [[Army &amp; Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army &amp; Navy Stores]] followed on from a strong British tradition of innovative and practical design in portable furniture that had its roots in the 18th century and grew as the British Empire expanded. Much of the early portable furniture would have been bespoke (made to order). It would not have been uncommon for a soldier to ask his local cabinet maker to take a domestic design and adapt it for travel. As demand grew, a number of well known designers, including [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]], [[Sheraton style|Sheraton]] and [[Robert Gillow|Gillows]], considered portable furniture and the end of the 18th century saw the rise of specialist makers with the names of Thomas Butler and Morgan &amp; Sanders perhaps being the most recognised. The number of such specialists increased in the 19th century and this was fuelled not only by military needs but also the increase of people moving to the colonies. The Victorians and Edwardian were particularly concerned with improving design to its utmost practicality and the patents relating to furniture greatly increased in the second half of the 19th century. Aside from cabinet makers, it was a natural addition for a number of companies such as J.W. Allen [https://web.archive.org/web/20111112125842/http://www.campaignfurniture.com/catdetails.asp?pubID=11], Day &amp; Son, John Pound and Hill &amp; Millard [https://web.archive.org/web/20111112132743/http://www.campaignfurniture.com/catdetails.asp?pubID=10], who all started out as luggage makers, to expand their trunk making businesses and develop a strong line in demountable furniture.
[[File:CampaignGamesTable2.jpg|thumb|left|A portable games table, packed down into its top which becomes a box case]]  One of the other main campaign furniture makers in the 19th century were Ross &amp; Co Dublin who were considered "  The Victorian Army’s Cabinet Maker of Choice."

By the mid-19th century it was possible to buy a complete Barrack Room Outfit from several London firms. More often than not this would consist of a Douro chair with packing case that would convert to a table, a washstand that would pack down into a hip bath, a camp bed and a chest of drawers with packing cases that would form a wardrobe.

==Demise==
The beginning of the 20th century saw changes in the way war was conducted. The British had been taught a lesson by the [[Boer Wars|Boers]] in South Africa who could move quickly and they discovered that their mobile units were not quite as mobile as they had thought. In 1903, the Secretary of State for War, [[H.&amp;nbsp;O. Arnold-Forster]], stated, "The British Army is a social institution prepared for every emergency except that of war." The new century also saw developments in transport and the rise of the motor car meant that travel was quicker making it less of a necessity to equip yourself for a long journey. There was a decrease in the demand for campaign furniture.

Portable furniture was still used for sporting events and shooting parties but it was less acceptable as an officer to have a large baggage train. Appreciation of the furniture for its practicality in domestic life had grown as the 19th century marched on. Although it still had a market it wasn't as strong as it had once. Many of the independent makers of campaign furniture started to disappear in the early 1900s, superseded by the one stop shops such as [[Army &amp; Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army &amp; Navy Stores]] and [[Harrods]].

While personal furniture faded from military use, field desks, field filing systems, medical and maintenance storage systems, and similar portable equipment continue in use until the present day; some show continuity in design.

==Legacy==
[[File:CampaignParagonChair.jpg|thumb|A Paragon Chair c.&amp;nbsp;1900]]

With campaign furniture by its nature needing to be both sturdy and efficient in its breakdown, it gave rise to good design that was often ahead of it time. A number of chairs that we today consider to be design icons of the 20th century were actually inspired by campaign furniture from the end of the 19th century.
The [[Roorkhee chair]] was designed by British Army Engineers stationed at the town of the same name in India. It became instantly popular for its simple but practical construction. [[Kaare Klint]] recognised its qualities and he made a version of the Roorkhee called the Safari Chair in 1933. The Paragon Chair folds down to a very compact size once the canvas seat is removed and the [[Harrods]] catalogue of 1895 described it as "the most Portable Chair in the Market". This chair was first designed by Fenby and patented on 22 March 1877 but it has been re-designed since under different names. Italian officers used a version in Ethiopia in the 1930s which was known as the [[Tripolina]]. In 1940, Jorge Ferrari-Hardoy, Juan Kurchan and Antonia Bonet designed the well known [[Butterfly chair]], made of dismantling metal sections and clearly inspired by the Paragon. [[Knoll (company)|Knoll International]] made a version called the Hardoy and today the [[Terence Conran|Conran Shop]] sell a version called the Bush chair.

Campaign furniture is evocative of luxurious travel and a time gone by. There is more likely to be an owner's or maker's name on a piece of portable furniture than a domestic version and it is easier to put it into a social context. The appeal of its nature has been picked up on and modern furniture made in a campaign style is produced by a number of makers today. Often, the consideration of portability has not been a factor with the overriding concern being to achieve the look by adding brass corners and [[strapwork]]. Another group of manufactures have produced direct copies of period campaign furniture seeing that there is still a call for it today be it for safaris or the high-class camper.

Good design will always be popular and this, along with many of the original reasons for the popularity of campaign furniture hold true today. It is practical, often versatile and naturally, very easy to move about.

'''''Cemetery Dance''''' is a thriller novel by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]] released on May 12, 2009 by Grand Central Publishing. This is the ninth installment in the Special Agent Pendergast series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2197227.Cemetery_Dance Cemetery Dance Pendergast #9)]&lt;/ref&gt; During production, it was known by the pre-release title ''Revenant''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omnilexica.com/?q=revenant Revenant]&lt;/ref&gt;  The preceding novel is ''[[The Wheel of Darkness]]''.

==Plot==
After celebrating their first anniversary, William Smithback, a [[NY Times]] reporter, and his wife Nora Kelly, a Museum of Natural History archeologist, return home from a romantic dinner.  Kelly slips out to pick up a pastry from the local shop, but upon her return to their apartment in the [[Upper West Side|Upper West]] side of [[Manhattan]], she finds the door ajar, Smithback dead, and is attacked as she approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bevvincent.com/onyx/preston-cemetery.html Onyx reviews: Cemetery Dance by Douglas Preston &amp; Lincoln Child]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewitnesses claim, and the security camera confirms, the attacker seen leaving the building was an individual who lived in the apartment building along with Smithback and Kelly. The twist: the man that witnesses believe is Smithback's murderer was pulled from the river dead, after committing [[suicide]], two weeks before the attack. [[Vincent D'Agosta|D'Agosta]], a homicide detective, leads the official investigation, while FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast's and Kelly's involvement leads to a less traditional quest for the truth. Their serpentine journey takes them into a part of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive and deadly hotbed of [[Obeah]], the [[West Indian]] [[Zombi (African god)|Zombi]] cult of sorcery and magic. Unfortunately many others learn of the cult, thus endangering themselves and countless innocent lives.

Citizen journalism should not be confused with [[Community journalism]] or [[Civic journalism]], both of which are practiced by professional journalists; [[Collaborative journalism]] which is the practice of professional and non-professional journalists working together;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin, A.|first=Secko, D.|date=November 25, 2012|title=Debate Cited: A First Exploration of a Web Application to Enhance the Production of Science Journalism Students|url=http://cca.kingsjournalism.com/?p=171|journal=Journalism Interest Group, CCA/Groupe d'intérêt en journalisme, ACC Conference Proceedings|volume=2012|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 8, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social journalism]] that denotes a digital publication with a hybrid of professional and non-professional journalism.

Citizen journalism is a specific form of both [[citizen media]] and [[user-generated content]]. By juxtaposing the term "citizen", with its attendant qualities of civic-mindedness and social responsibility, with that of "journalism", which refers to a particular profession, [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argues that this term best describes this particular form of ''online'' and ''digital'' journalism conducted by amateurs, because it underscores the link between the practice of journalism and its relation to the political and public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch Karlekar|first1= Karin|last2=Radsch|first2= Courtney C.|title=Adapting Concepts of Media Freedom to a Changing Media Environment: Incorporating New Media and Citizen Journalism into the Freedom of the Press Index |date=July 1, 2012|journal= ESSACHESS Journal for Communication Studies|volume= 5| issue =  1, 2012|via=SSRN|url= http://ssrn.com/abstract=2161601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New media]] technology, such as [[Social media|social networking and media-sharing websites]], in addition to the increasing prevalence of cellular telephones, have made citizen journalism more accessible to people worldwide. Recent advances in new media have started to have a profound political impact.&lt;ref&gt;Gilardi, F. (2016). Digital Democracy. ''How Digital Democracy is Changing Democracy And Its Study.'', 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the availability of technology, citizens often can report breaking news more quickly than traditional media reporters. Notable examples of citizen journalism reporting from major world events are, the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[Arab Spring]], the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement, the [[2013 protests in Turkey]], the [[Euromaidan]] events in [[Ukraine]], and [[Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently|Syrian Civil War]] and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]].

Critics of the [[phenomenon]], including professional journalists and news organizations, claim that citizen journalism is unregulated, too [[Subjectivity|subjective]], amateur, and [[wikt:haphazard|haphazard]] in quality and coverage.

==Theory==
Citizen journalism, as a form of [[alternative media]], presents a "radical challenge to the professionalized and institutionalized practices of the mainstream media".&lt;ref&gt;Atton, Chris. 2003. What is "alternative journalism"? Journalism: Theory, Practice and Criticism 4, no. 3: 267-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Terry Flew, there have been three elements critical to the rise of citizen journalism: open publishing, collaborative editing, and distributed content.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry. 2005. ''New media: An introduction''. South Melbourne, Vic. ; New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Glaser, a [[freelance journalist]] who frequently writes on new media issues, said in 2006:&lt;ref name="glaser2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/09/your-guide-to-citizen-journalism270.html|title=Your Guide to Citizen Journalism|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]| author=Mark Glaser| date=September 27, 2006|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea behind citizen journalism is that people without professional journalism training can use the tools of modern technology and the global distribution of the Internet to create, augment or fact-check media on their own or in collaboration with others. For example, you might write about a city council meeting on your blog or in an online forum. Or you could fact-check a newspaper article from the mainstream media and point out factual errors or bias on your blog. Or you might snap a digital photo of a newsworthy event happening in your town and post it online. Or you might videotape a similar event and post it on a site such as YouTube. &lt;/blockquote&gt; The accessibility of online media has also enhanced the interest for journalism among youth and many websites, like 'Far and Wide' a publication focusing on travel and international culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farandwide.org/about/ |title=About — Far and Wide |publisher=Farandwide.org |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as WorldWeekly a news blog covering a range of topics from world politics to science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldweekly.net/about.html |title=About |publisher=WorldWeekly |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; are founded and run by students.

In ''What is Participatory Journalism?'',&lt;ref name="lasica"&gt;Lasica, J. D. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1060217106.php What is Participatory Journalism?]" 2003-08-07, ''Online Journalism Review'', August 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; J. D. Lasica classifies media for citizen journalism into the following types:

# Audience participation (such as user comments attached to news stories, personal blogs, photographs or video footage captured from personal [[Digital camera#Integration|mobile cameras]], or local news written by residents of a community)
# Independent news and information Websites ([[Consumer Reports]], the [[Drudge Report]])
# Full-fledged participatory news sites ([[one:convo]], [[NowPublic]], [[OhmyNews]], DigitalJournal.com, [[GroundReport]], 'Fair Observer')
# Collaborative and contributory media sites ([[Slashdot]], [[Kuro5hin]], [[Newsvine]])
# Other kinds of "thin media" (mailing lists, email newsletters)
# Personal broadcasting sites (video broadcast sites such as [[KenRadio]])

The literature of citizen, alternative, and participatory journalism is most often situated in a democratic context and theorized as a response to corporate news media dominated by an economic logic. Some scholars have sought to extend the study of citizen journalism beyond the Western, developed world, including Sylvia Moretzsohn,&lt;ref&gt;Moretzsohn, S. 2006. " Citizen journalism" and the myth of redemptive technology. Brazilian Journalism Research 2, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Courtney C. Radsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Radsch, C. (2011).

===Versus "grassroots media"===

One criticism of the term "citizen journalism" to describe this concept is that the word "citizen" has a conterminous relation to the nation-state. The fact that many millions of people are considered stateless and often, are without citizenship (such as refugees or immigrants without papers) limits the concept to those recognised only by governments. Additionally, the global nature of many participatory media initiatives, such as the [[Independent Media Center]], makes talking of journalism in relation to a particular nation-state largely redundant as its production and dissemination do not recognise national boundaries.
Some additional names given to the concept based on this analysis are, "grassroots media," "people's media," or "participatory media."

=== Theories of Citizenship ===
According to Vincent Campbell, theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups: those that consider journalism ''for'' citizenship and those that consider journalism ''as'' citizenship. The classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship. The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens. The classical model has 4 main characteristics: journalists' role of informing citizens; citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with; more informed citizens are more likely to participate; and the more informed citizens participate, the more democratic a state is more likely to be.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Vincent|date=2015|title=Theorizing Citizenship in Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|pages=704–719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first characteristic suggesting that the role of journalism is to inform citizens upholds the theory that journalism is ''for'' citizens. One of the main issues with this first theory is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be. One branch of journalism ''for'' citizens is the "monitorial citizen" coined by [[Michael Schudson]]. The "monitorial citizen" suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume. The "monitorial citizen" along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship. However, this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship, but instead an act of journalism. Therefore, citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens ''for'' citizenship and conversely, journalists serve citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second theory considers journalism ''as'' citizenship. This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship. The term "liquid citizenship" coined by [[Zizi Papacharissi]] depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations, which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic, political, and social. This "liquid citizenship" allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism. An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between "dutiful" citizens and "actualizing" citizens. "Dutiful" citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices, while "actualizing" citizens engage in non-traditional citizenship practices. This alternative approach suggests that "actualizing" citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and [[social media]] as sources of information, discussion, and participation. Thus, journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Relationship to local journalism==

Criticisms have been made against citizen journalism, especially from among professionals in the field. Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable, biased and untrained – as opposed to professionals who have "recognition, paid work, unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated, at least in the claim if not in the actuality".&lt;ref name="The Iranian Story: What Citizens? What Journalism? By Gholam Khiabany and Annabelle Sreberny"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=edited by Stuart|last2=Thorsen|first2=Einar|title=Citizen journalism : global perspectives|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433102950|pages=121|edition=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Citizen journalists gather material by being on the streets. Their tools can be narrowed down to a camera, social media and an instinct to start recording whenever something seems newsworthy or out of order. Much of their knowledge regarding the issues that are raised are obtained through their experience as a part of the community.

However, some major news reporting agencies, threatened by the speed with which news is reported and delivered by citizen journalism, have launched campaigns to bring in readers and financial support. For example, Bill Johnson, president of Embarcadero Media, which publishes several northern California newspapers, issued an online statement asking readers to subscribe to local newspapers in order to keep them financially solvent. Johnson put special emphasis on the critical role played by local newspapers, which, he argues, "reflect the values of the residents and businesses, challenge assumptions, and shine a light on our imperfections and aspirations."&lt;ref name="supportlocaljournalism"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.supportlocaljournalism.org/PaloAlto | title=Support Local Journalism | publisher=Embarcadero Media | accessdate=January 8, 2012 | author=Bill Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea that every citizen can engage in acts of journalism has a long history in the United States. The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]]. Those journalists became part of the public, or civic, journalism movement, which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs.&lt;ref name="merritt"&gt;Merritt, D. "[http://pjnet.org/post/318/ News Media must regain vigor, courage.]" September 29, 2004, ''PJNet Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvorkin"&gt;Dvorkin, J. A. "[https://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/010705.html Media Matters. Can Public Radio Journalism be Re-Invented?]" January 27, 2005, ''[[National Public Radio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;Meyer, E. P. "[http://www.unc.edu/%7Epmeyer/ire95pj.htm Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity.]" 1995, [http://www.unc.edu/%7Epmeyer/ Published on personal website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, discussions of public journalism focused on promoting journalism that was "for the people" by changing the way professional reporters did their work. According to Leonard Witt, however, early public journalism efforts were "often part of 'special projects' that were expensive, time-consuming, and episodic. Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on. [[Professional journalism|Professional journalists]] were driving the discussion. They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare-to-work (or the environment, or traffic problems, or the economy), and then they would recruit a cross-section of citizens and chronicle their points of view. Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism, and some outright opposed it, reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task." By 2003, in fact, the movement seemed to be petering out, with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors.

Traditionally, the term "citizen journalism" has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition. Even today, the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization. Although the term lacks conceptualization, alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon. For example, one of  the interchangeable names with "citizen journalism" is "[[user-generated content]]" (UGC). However, the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=Melissa|date=2015|title=Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|pages=797–813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With today's technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally. As [[Yochai Benkler]] has noted, "the capacity to make meaning – to encode and decode humanly meaningful statements – and the capacity to communicate one's meaning around the world, are held by, or readily available to, at least many hundreds of millions of users around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Part One: The Networked Information Economy|url=http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php?title=Text_Part_One |accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at [[Boston College]], notes in her article, ''Citizen Journalism and the Reporter's Privilege,'' that:&lt;ref&gt;Papandrea, Mary-Rose. "[http://lsr.nellco.org/bc/bclsfp/papers/167/ Citizen Journalism and the Reporter's Privilege]." ''[[Boston College|Boston College Law School]] (Minnesota Law Review, Vol. 91).'' 2007. Retrieved January 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

::[i]n many ways, the definition of "journalist" has now come full circle. When the First Amendment of the [[U.S. Constitution]] was adopted, "freedom of the press" referred quite literally to the freedom to publish using a printing press, rather than the freedom of organized entities engaged in the publishing business. The printers of 1775 did not exclusively publish newspapers; instead, in order to survive financially they dedicated most of their efforts printing materials for paying clients. The newspapers and pamphlets of the American Revolutionary era were predominantly partisan and became even more so through the turn of the century. They engaged in little news gathering and instead were predominantly vehicles for opinion.

::The passage of the term "journalism" into common usage in the 1830s occurred at roughly the same time that newspapers, using high speed rotary steam presses, began mass circulation throughout the eastern United States. Using the printing press, newspapers could distribute exact copies to large numbers of readers at a low incremental cost. In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for advertising for brand-name products fueled the creation of publications subsidized, in large part, by advertising revenue. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the concept of the "press" metamorphized into a description of individuals and companies engaged in an often-competitive commercial media enterprise.

==World Trade Organization (WTO)==

In 1999, activists in Seattle created a response to the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] meeting being held there. These activists understood the only way they could get into the [[corporate media]] was by blocking the streets. Then they realized that a scant 60 seconds of coverage would show them being carted off by the police, but without any context to explain why they were protesting. They knew they had to create an alternative media model.

Since then, the [[Indymedia]] movement has experienced exponential growth, and [[Independent Media Center|IMCs]] have been created in more than 200 cities all over the world.

Simultaneously, journalism "by the people" began to flourish, enabled by emerging internet and networking technologies, such as [[Blog|weblogs]], [[chat rooms]], [[message boards]], [[wiki]]s, and [[mobile computing]]. A relatively new development is the use of convergent polls, allowing editorials and opinions to be submitted and voted on. Over time, the poll converges on the most broadly accepted editorials and opinions. In South Korea, [[OhmyNews]] became popular and commercially successful with the motto, "Every Citizen is a Reporter." Founded by [[Oh Yeon Ho|Oh Yeon-ho]] on February 22, 2000, it has a staff of 40 or more traditional reporters and editors who write about 20% of its content, with the rest coming from other freelance contributors who mostly are ordinary citizens. OhmyNews now has an estimated 50,000 contributors, and has been credited with transforming South Korea's conservative political environment.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], both the Democratic and Republican parties issued press credentials to citizen bloggers covering the convention, marking a new level of influence and credibility for nontraditional journalists. Some bloggers{{Who|date=September 2010}} also began "watchdogging" the work of conventional journalists, monitoring their work for biases and inaccuracy.

A recent trend in citizen journalism has been the emergence of what blogger [[Jeff Jarvis]] terms [[hyperlocal journalism]], as online news sites invite contributions from local residents of their subscription areas, who often report on topics that conventional newspapers tend to ignore.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, L. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46519-2004Dec8.html On Local Sites, Everyone's A Journalist], December 9, 2004, ''The Washington Post'', E1.&lt;/ref&gt; "We are the traditional journalism model turned upside down," explains Mary Lou Fulton, the publisher of the Northwest Voice in [[Bakersfield, California]]. "Instead of being the gatekeeper, telling people that what's important to them 'isn't news', we're just opening up the gates and letting people come on in. We are a better community newspaper for having thousands of readers who serve as the eyes and ears for the Voice, rather than having everything filtered through the views of a small group of reporters and editors."&lt;ref name="glaser"&gt;Glaser, M.

==Citizen journalists==
According to [[Jay Rosen]], citizen journalists are "the people formerly known as the audience," who "''were'' on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern, with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another— and who ''today'' are not in a situation like that ''at all''. ... The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer, less fictional, more able, less predictable."&lt;ref name="rosen2006"&gt;Rosen, Jay "[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html#more The People Formerly Known as the Audience]," PressThink, June 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, when [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|the 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake caused a huge]] [[tsunami]] in Banda Aceh Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean, a weblog-based virtual network of previously unrelated bloggers [[emergence|emerged]] that covered the news in real-time, and became a vital source for the traditional media for the first week after the tsunami.&lt;ref name=dameron2007&gt;

A large amount of news footage from many people who experienced the tsunami was widely broadcast,&lt;ref name=ft20060307&gt;
{{cite news |last=Glocer|first=Tim |title=Old media must embrace the amateur |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/e2bba176-ae0a-11da-8ffb-0000779e2340.html |accessdate=2013-03-08 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=2006-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{subscription required}}
as well as a good deal of "on the scene" citizen reporting and blogger analysis that was subsequently picked up by the major media outlets worldwide.&lt;ref name=dameron2007/&gt;
Subsequent to the citizen journalism coverage of the disaster and aftermath, researchers have suggested that citizen journalists may, in fact, play a critical role in the disaster warning system itself, potentially with higher reliability than the networks of tsunami warning equipment based on technology alone which then require interpretation by disinterested third parties.&lt;ref name=grabowski2011&gt;

Adaptive structuration theory suggests that, in complex systems, technology and organizational structures co-evolve, and users adapt technology to their needs, creating shared meaning about the role and utility of technology in various settings.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microblog]] Twitter played an important role during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]], after foreign journalists had effectively been "barred from reporting". Twitter delayed scheduled maintenance during the protests that would have shut down coverage in Iran due to the role it played in public communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/middleeast/17media.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology Washington Taps Into a Potent New Force in Diplomacy] ''[[The New York Times]]'' June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes citizen journalists are, at the same time, [[blog]]gers and after some time they often become [[journalist|professional journalists]], just as{{when|date=March 2013}} [[Paweł Rogaliński]], a prized{{by whom|date=March 2013}} [[Poland|Polish]] blogger and journalist did.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Today, individually produced citizen journalism exists in the form of [[social media]] platforms such as [[blogs]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]]. These social media platforms encourage and facilitate engagement with other citizens who participate in creating content through commenting, liking, linking, and sharing. This practice is considered to be the 21st century version of individualized citizen journalism. The first wave of this type of citizen journalism came about in the form of amateur news bloggers. These bloggers often created content and narrative that challenged and critiqued the mainstream news outlets. The majority of the content produced by these amateur news bloggers was not actually original content, but curated information that was primarily monitored and edited by these various bloggers. However, recently there has been a decline in the amateur news blogger due to social media platforms that are much easier to run and maintain. These social media platforms allow individuals to easily share and create and content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wikimedia Foundation hosts a participatory journalism web site, [[Wikinews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects|title=Our projects|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website allows contributors to write news which undergo a peer review prior to publications in some language editions (English, German, Russian) but not in others (Norwegian).

==Criticisms==

===Objectivity===

Citizen journalists also may be activists within the communities they write about. This has drawn some criticism from traditional media institutions such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', which have accused proponents of public journalism of abandoning the traditional goal of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]. Many traditional journalists view citizen journalism with some skepticism, believing that only trained journalists can understand the exactitude and ethics involved in reporting news. See, e.g., [[Nicholas Lemann]], Vincent Maher, and Tom Grubisich.

An academic paper by Vincent Maher, the head of the New Media Lab at Rhodes University, outlined several weaknesses in the claims made by citizen journalists, in terms of the "three deadly E's", referring to ethics, economics, and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name="maher"&gt;Maher, V. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060924125946/http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=6 Citizen Journalism is Dead.]" 2005, New Media Lab, School of Journalism &amp; Media Studies, Rhodes University, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by language and linguistics professor, Patricia Bou-Franch, found that some citizen journalists resorted to abuse-sustaining discourses naturalizing violence against women. She found that these discourses were then challenged by others who questioned the gendered ideologies of male violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bou-Franch | first1 = Patricia | title = Domestic violence and public participation in the media: The case of citizen journalism | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–302 | publisher = [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox]] | doi = 10.1558/genl.v7i3.275 | year = 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1558/genl.v7i3.275 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality===

An article in 2005 by Tom Grubisich reviewed ten new citizen journalism sites and found many of them lacking in quality and content.&lt;ref name="grubisich"&gt;Grubisich, T. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/051006/ Grassroots journalism: Actual content vs. shining ideal.]" October 6, 2005, ''USC Annenberg, Online Journalism Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Grubisich followed up a year later with, "Potemkin Village Redux."&lt;ref name="grubisich2006"&gt;Grubisich, T. "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/Grubisich061911/ Potemkin Village Redux.]" November 19, 2006, ''USC Annenberg, Online Journalism Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the best sites had improved editorially and were even nearing profitability, but only by not expensing editorial costs. Also according to the article, the sites with the weakest editorial content were able to expand aggressively because they had stronger financial resources.

Another article published on Pressthink examined Backfence, a citizen journalism site with three initial locations in the D.C. area, which reveals that the site has only attracted limited citizen contributions.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;George, E. "[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/11/30/lz_bcfc.html Guest Writer Liz George of Baristanet Reviews Backfence.com Seven Months After Launch.]" November 30, 2005, ''Pressthink''.&lt;/ref&gt; The author concludes that, "in fact, clicking through Backfence's pages feels like frontier land -– remote, often lonely, zoned for people but not home to any. The site recently launched for [[Arlington, Virginia]]. However, without more settlers, Backfence may wind up creating more ghost towns."

[[David Simon]], a former [[Baltimore Sun]] reporter and writer-producer of the popular television series, "[[The Wire]]," criticized the concept of citizen journalism—claiming that unpaid bloggers who write as a hobby cannot replace trained, professional, seasoned journalists.
{{quote|"I am offended to think that anyone, anywhere believes American institutions as insulated, self-preserving and self-justifying as police departments, school systems, legislatures and chief executives can be held to gathered facts by amateurs pursuing the task without compensation, training or for that matter, sufficient standing to make public officials even care to whom it is they are lying to."}}

An editorial published by ''The Digital Journalist'' web magazine expressed a similar position, advocating to abolish the term "citizen journalist", and replacing it with "citizen news gatherer".
{{quote|"Professional journalists cover fires, floods, crime, the legislature, and the White House every day. There is either a fire line or police line, or security, or the Secret Service who allow them to pass upon displaying credentials vetted by the departments or agencies concerned. A citizen journalist, an amateur, will always be on the outside of those lines. Imagine the White House throwing open its gates to admit everybody with a camera phone to a presidential event."&lt;ref name="letsabolishcitizenjournalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0912/lets-abolish-citizen-journalists.html|title=Let's abolish the term 'Citizen Journalists'|date=December 2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the fact that citizen journalists can report in real time and are not subject to oversight opens them to criticism about the accuracy of their reporting, news stories presented by mainstream media also misreport facts occasionally that are reported correctly by citizen journalists. As low as 32% of the American population have a fair amount of trust in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx|title=Americans' Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low|last=Inc|first=Gallup|website=Gallup.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on traditional journalism ===
Journalism has been affected significantly due to citizen journalism. This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want, whenever they want. In order to stay competitive, traditional news sources are forcing their journalist to compete. This means that journalist now have to write, edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace, as it is perceived by news companies that it's essential for journalist to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet. This is hard though, as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do.  Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a 35% increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to [[Astra Taylor]] in her book [[The People's Platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador Paperback|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal repercussions===

Edward Greenberg, a New York City litigator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecopyrightzone.com/?page_id=9|title=About Ed|author=Edward Greenberg |accessdate= 17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones:
{{quote|"So-called shield laws, which protect reporters from revealing sources, vary from state to state. On occasion, the protection is dependent on whether the person [who] asserted the claim is in fact a journalist. There are many cases at both the state and federal levels where judges determine just who is/is not a journalist. Cases involving libel often hinge on whether the actor was or was not a member of the "press"."&lt;ref name="letsabolishcitizenjournalism"/&gt;}}

The view stated above does not mean that professional journalists are fully protected by shield laws. In the 1972 [[Branzburg v. Hayes]] case the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] invalidated the use of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a [[grand jury]]. In 2005, the [[Reporters' Privilege#Judith Miller brings reporters' privilege to the forefront of media attention|reporter's privilege]] of [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] was rejected by the appellate court.

== Possible future ==
Citizen journalism has largely increased during the last decade of the twentieth century and throughout the twenty-first century. This rise of participation can be associated with the creation of the [[internet]] which introduced new ways in communicating and engaging news. Due to this shift in technology, individuals were able to access more news than previously and at a much faster rate. This larger quantity also made it so there was a larger variety of sources which people were able to consume media and news.

Natalie Fenton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/sfu/reader.action?docID=10349689|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|author=|date=|website=site.ebrary.com|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the role of citizen journalism within the [[Digital Age|digital age]] and has three characteristics associated with the topic: speed and space, multiplicity and poly-centrality and interactivity and participation. These characteristics were due to the invention of the internet, which, made way for amateur and citizen journalist to make a name for themselves within the industry. This was happening throughout the 1990s, however, once the [[2000s (decade)|mid 2000s]] began, the introduction of technologies such as the [[smartphone]] increased the ability to access the internet and made it so that individuals were able to use it globally and on the go. With these technological advancements, individuals were able to participate in journalism, like never before. Pictures or videos could be uploaded online in a matter of minutes and this paved the way for [[social media]] to grow as a strong producer in the industry.

In 2017, there are a number of different social media platforms through which people can access for their news. Many large corporations have even started to shift their focus onto internet sites, such as Facebook or YouTube and this has also made it easier for the existence of Alternative Media groups to exist. This transition into a digital realm of media has created many new possibilities for people to participate in journalism and it is due to the technological advancements such as the internet and [[smartphone]]s.

As society continues to move forward in a [[Digital Age|digital age]] new possibilities in the realm of technology emerge and can be associated with the journalism industry. New devices such as [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]], open new avenues, which media companies and people will be able to participate with journalism. As society continues to move towards embracing technology as part of their lives, citizen journalism should increase in accessibility and participation.

==Proponents and facilitators==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Dan Gillmor]], the former technology columnist for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', is one of the foremost proponents{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} of citizen journalism and founded a nonprofit, the Center for Citizen Media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citmedia.org/ |title=Center for Citizen Media |publisher=Center for Citizen Media Blog |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help promote it.

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s French-language television network also has organized a weekly public affairs program called, "5 sur 5", which has been organizing and promoting citizen-based journalism since 2001.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On the program, viewers submit questions on a wide variety of topics, and they, accompanied by staff journalists, get to interview experts to obtain answers to their questions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Jay Rosen]], a journalism professor at New York University, was one of public journalism's earliest proponents.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} From 1993 to 1997, he directed the ''Project on Public Life and the Press'', funded by the [[Knight Foundation]] and housed at NYU.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He also currently runs the PressThink weblog.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Professor [[Charles Nesson]], William F. Weld Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the founder of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, chairs the Advisory Board for Jamaican citizen journalism startup [[On the Ground News Reports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Ground News Reports (OGNR) the Citizen Powered News Network officially launched at Kingston BETA|url=http://kingstonbeta.com/2013/07/11/on-the-ground-news-report-ognr-the-citizen-powered-news-network-officially-launched-at-kingston-beta/|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading proponents{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} for citizen journalism in Australia is [[Margo Kingston]], author and former political journalist for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Kingston launched one of the world's first mainstream citizen journalism platforms, Webdiary, in 2000, well before ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Kingston resigned from Webdiary in 2005 but the site continues and has been preserved in Pandora, Australia's National Web Archive.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After a period of retirement, Kingston returned to citizen journalism in 2013 by co-publishing a new site [[No Fibs]]. It was on this site that Kingston published an exclusive story that the Australian Prime Minister, [[Tony Abbott]], had inappropriately claimed expenses for promoting his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margo |last=Kingston |title=NoFibs|url=http://nofibs.com.au/2013/07/06/exclusive-abbott-forced-to-repay-taxpayers-9400-he-charged-taxpayers-to-promote-his-book/|publisher=nofibs.com.au|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, blogger and novelist [[James Wesley Rawles]] launched a web site that provides free press credentials for citizen journalists called the Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA).&lt;ref name="blogs.spjnetwork.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/tech/2014/05/23/survivalist-starts-issuing-his-own-press-passes/|title=Survivalist starts issuing his own press passes - A Society of Professional Journalists Blog|work=Net Worked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CFAPA.org|title=Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA) Free Press Credentials (Free Press Pass)  - An Independent Press Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Sheets of the [[Society for Professional Journalists]], Rawles keeps no records on who gets these credentials.&lt;ref name="blogs.spjnetwork.org"/&gt;

Maurice Ali, a citizen journalist from Canada, founded one of the first international citizen journalist associations called the [[International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.]]  (IAIJ) in 2003. The association through its President (Maurice Ali) have published studies and articles on citizen journalism, attended and spoken at UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Citizen Journalism' |pages=|publisher=UNESCO |date=February 27, 2013|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/news/30_citizen_journalism.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United Nations events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='WSIS+10 United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting' |pages=|publisher=United Nations |date=July 2, 2015|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/wsis10/2julystakeholderconsultation|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Maurice Ali Speech: International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.

A '''coffin''' is a [[Funeral|funerary]] [[box]] used for viewing or keeping a [[corpse]], either for [[burial]] or [[cremation]].

The word took two different paths, '''''cofin''''' in [[Old French]] originally meaning basket, became '''''coffin''''' in English and became '''''couffin''''' in [[modern French]] which nowadays means a [[Bassinet|cradle]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also [[wikt:berceau|berceau]], [[wikt:couffin|couffin]] and [[wikt:cophinus|cophinus]] at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is often made between ''coffin'' and ''casket'': the latter is generally understood to denote a four-sided (almost always [[Rectangle|rectangular]]) funerary box, while a coffin is usually six-sided.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Casket Makers Dig In as Sales Take Hit

==Etymology==
[[File:Ancient Egyptian Coffin.JPG|thumb|left|140px|The side of an [[Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] sarcophagus]]
First attested in English in 1380, the word ''coffin'' derives from the [[Old French]] ''cofin'', from [[Latin]] ''cophinus'', which means a [[basket]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcophinus |title=cophinus |dictionary=''A Latin Dictionary'' |publisher=Perseus Digital Library |first1=Charlton T. |last1=Lewis |first2=Charles |last2=Short}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόφινος (''kophinos''), "basket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Ffinos |title=κόφινος |publisher=Perseus Digital Library |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ko-pi-na'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ |title=Palaeolexicon |publisher=www.palaeolexicon.com |work=Word study tool of ancient languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any box in which the dead are buried is a coffin, and while a casket was originally regarded as a box for jewelry, use of the word "casket" in this sense began as a [[euphemism]] introduced by the [[undertaker]]'s trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/43/1143.html |title=casket, coffin (nn.) |publisher=[[Bartleby.com]] |work=[[Columbia Guide to Standard American English]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is commonly drawn between "coffins" and "caskets", using coffin to refer to a tapered [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al (also considered to be anthropoidal in shape) box and casket to refer to a [[rectangle|rectangular]] box, often with a split lid used for viewing the deceased as seen in the picture. Receptacles for cremated and cremulated human ashes (sometimes called cremains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utc.edu/Administration/DepartmentalHonors/BrooksTim.pdf|format=PDF |title=Departmental Honors |publisher=Utc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funerals.org/faq/pdf-pamphlets/doc_view/29-what-shall-we-do-with-the-ashes funerals.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227030320/http://www.funerals.org/faq/pdf-pamphlets/doc_view/29-what-shall-we-do-with-the-ashes |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are called [[urns]].

==History==
The earliest evidence of wooden coffin remains, dated at 5000 BC, was found in the Tomb 4 at Beishouling, [[Shaanxi]]. Clear evidence of a wooden coffin in the form of a rectangular shape was found in Tomb 152 in an early [[Banpo]] site. The Banpo coffin belongs to a four-year-old girl, measuring 1.4&amp;nbsp;m (4.5&amp;nbsp;ft) by 0.55&amp;nbsp;m (1.8&amp;nbsp;ft) and 3–9&amp;nbsp;cm thick. As many as 10 wooden coffins have been found from the [[Dawenkou culture]] (4100–2600 BC) site at Chengzi, [[Shandong]].&lt;ref name="wang 1997 93 96"&gt;Wang (1997), 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill (2002), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of the coffin, as determined by the number of timber frames in its composition, also emphasized the level of [[Chinese nobility|nobility]], as mentioned in the ''[[Classic of Rites]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Legge (2004), 525.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Watson (2003), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mair (1997), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this have been found in several Neolithic sites; the double coffin, the earliest of which was found in the [[Liangzhu culture]] (3400–2250 BC) site at Puanqiao, Zhejiang, consists of an outer and an inner coffin, while the triple coffin, with its earliest finds from the [[Longshan culture]] (3000–2000 BC) sites at Xizhufeng and Yinjiacheng in Shandong, consists of two outer and one inner coffins.&lt;ref name="luan 2006 49 55"&gt;Luan (2006), 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
[[File:Plain bespoke stone coffin.JPG|thumb|Plain bespoke stone coffin, circa 7th century]]
A coffin may be buried in the ground directly, placed in a [[Burial vault (enclosure)|burial vault]] or cremated. Alternatively it may be entombed above ground in a [[mausoleum]], a [[chapel]], a [[church architecture|church]], or in a [[Loculus (architecture)|loculus]] within [[catacombs]]. Some countries practice one form almost exclusively, whereas in others it may depend on the individual [[cemetery]].

In part of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], ancestors are revered and bodies were often kept in coffins kept alongside the [[longhouse]]s until a ritual burial could be performed. The dead are also disinterred for rituals. Mass burials are also practiced. In northern [[Sulawesi]], some dead were kept in above ground sarcophagi called [[waruga]] until the practice was banned by the Dutch in the 19th century.

The handles and other ornaments (such as doves, stipple crosses, [[crucifix]], symbols etc.) that go on the outside of a coffin are called fittings (sometimes called 'coffin furniture' - not to be confused with furniture that is coffin shaped) while organising the inside of the coffin with fabric of some kind is known as "trimming the coffin".

Cultures that practice burial have widely different styles of coffins. In [[Judaism]], the coffin must be plain, made of wood and contain no metal parts or adornments. These coffins use wooden pegs instead of nails. All Jews are buried in the same plain cloth shroud from shoulder to knees, regardless of status in life, gender or age. In [[China]] and [[Japan]], coffins made from the scented, decay-resistant wood of [[Cupressaceae|cypress]], [[sugi]], [[thuja]] and [[incense-cedar]] are in high demand. Certain Aboriginal Australian groups use intricately decorated tree-bark cylinders sewn with fibre and sealed with adhesive as coffins. The cylinder is packed with dried grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=20473 |title=Bark coffin, National Museum of Australia |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes coffins are constructed to permanently display the corpse, as in the case of the glass-covered coffin of the [[Haraldskær Woman]] on display in the Church of Saint Nicolai in [[Vejle]], [[Denmark]] or the glass-coffin of [[Vladimir Lenin]], which is in [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]].

When a coffin is used to transport a [[death|deceased]] person, it can also be called a [[pall (casket)|pall]], a term that also refers to the cloth used to cover the coffin.

==Design==
[[File:Dronning_Gunhild_(moselig).JPG|right|thumb|240px|The glass-covered coffin of the [[Haraldskær Woman]]]]

Coffins are traditionally made with six sides plus the top (lid) and bottom, tapered around the shoulders, or rectangular with four sides. Another form of four-sided coffin is [[trapezoid]]al (also known as the "wedge" form) and is considered a variant of the six-sided hexagonal kind of coffin. Continental Europe at one time favoured the rectangular coffin or casket, although variations exist in size and shape. The rectangular form, and also the trapezoidal form, is still regularly used in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other parts of Eastern and Central Europe, with the lid sometimes made to slope gently from the head down towards the foot. Coffins in the UK are mainly similar to the hexagonal design, but with one-piece sides, curved at the shoulder instead of having a join. In Medieval Japan, round coffins were used, which resembled barrels in shape and were usually made by [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]]. In the case of a death at sea, there have been instances where trunks have been pressed into use as a coffin. Coffins usually have handles on the side so they will be easier to carry.

They may incorporate features that claim to protect the body or for public health reasons. For example, some may offer a ''protective casket'' that uses a [[gasket]] to seal the casket shut after it is closed for the final time. In England, it has long been law that a coffin for interment above ground should be sealed; this was traditionally implemented as a wooden outer coffin around a lead lining, around a third inner shell. After some decades have passed, the lead may ripple and tear. In the United States, numerous cemeteries require a vault of some kind in order to bury the deceased. A burial vault serves as an outer enclosure for buried remains and the coffin serves as an inner enclosure. The primary purpose of the vault is to prevent collapse of the coffin due to the weight of the [[soil]] above.

Some manufacturers offer a warranty on the structural integrity of the coffin. However, no coffin, regardless of its construction material (''e.g.'', metal rather than wood), whether or not it is sealed, and whether or not the deceased was [[Embalming|embalmed]] beforehand, will perfectly preserve the body. In some cases, a sealed coffin may actually speed up rather than slow down the process of decomposition. An airtight coffin, for example, fosters decomposition by [[anaerobic bacteria]], which results in a [[putrefaction|putrefied]] [[liquefaction]] of the body, and all putrefied tissue remains inside the container, only to be exposed in the event of an exhumation. A container that allows air to pass in and out, such as a simple wooden box, allows for clean [[skeleton]]ization. However the situation will vary according to soil or air conditions, and climate.

Coffins are made of many materials, including steel, various types of wood, and other materials such as fiberglass or recycled kraft paper. There is emerging interest in eco-friendly coffins made of purely natural materials such as [[bamboo]], [[X-Board]], [[willow]] or [[banana]] leaf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1730190.stm Bamboo Coffins "Coffin-maker resurrects tradition"], from BBC Business News, published 2001-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Custom coffins are occasionally created and some companies also make set ranges with non-traditional designs. These include [[printing]] or painting of peaceful tropical scenes, sea-shells, sunsets, cherubs and patriotic flags. Some manufacturers have designed them to look like gym carry bags, guitar cases, cigar humidors, and even yellow dumpster bins. Other coffins are left deliberately blank so that friends and family can inscribe final wishes and thoughts upon them to the deceased. In [[Taiwan]], coffins made of crushed [[oyster]] shells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/travel/taiwan-south/tainan/2006/11/30/96454/p2/Digging-up.htm |title=Digging up history in Tainan’s Science Park |publisher=The China Post |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; were used in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
In the 1990s, the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] released a customized [[Kiss Kasket]], which featured their trademark makeup designs and KISS logo and could also be used as a cooler.

===Design coffins in Ghana===

Design coffins in [[Ghana]], also called [[Fantasy coffin|fantasy]] coffins or figurative coffins, are only made by specialized carpenters in the [[Greater Accra Region]]. These colourful objects, which are not only coffins, but considered real works of art, were shown for the first time to a wider Western public in the exhibition ''Les Magiciens de la terre'' at the ''Musée National d’Art Moderne'' in Paris in 1989. The seven coffins which were exposed in Paris were done by [[Seth Kane Kwei]] (1922–1992) and by his former assistant [[Paa Joe]] (b.1947).&lt;ref&gt;A Deathbed of a Living Man. A Coffin for the Centre Pompidou. Regula Tschumi in Sâadane Afif (ed.), „Anthologie de l’humour noir“, Paris: Editions Centre Pompidou. 2010. P.56.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then coffins of Kane Kweis successors [[Paa Joe]], [[Daniel Mensah]], [[Kudjoe Affutu]] or [[Eric Adjetey Anang]] and others have been displayed in many international art museums and galleries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern: Benteli 2008, p. 230-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
The design coffins of the Ga have long been celebrated in the Western art world as the invention of a single, autonomous artist, the coffin maker [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|Kane Kwei]] (1924-1992) of [[Teshie]]. But as [[Regula Tschumi]] shows with her recent research this assumption was false. Design coffins have existed already before Kane Kwei and other [[Ga District|Ga]] carpenters like [[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) from [[La, Ghana|La]]  have built their first figurative coffins around 1950.&lt;ref name="Regula Tschumi 2013"&gt;Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance'', in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached in 2010 the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] some years before. She actually considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: „[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its „invented“ inventor, Kane Kwei“.&lt;/ref&gt; Kane Kwei and Ataa Oko had only continued a tradition that already existed in Accra where the kings were using figurative palanquins in the forms of their family symbol. And as those chiefs who were using [[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|figurative palanquins]] had to be buried in a coffin looking like their palanquin, their families used figurative coffins which were formerly nothing else than the copies of the design palanquins. Today figurative coffins are of course no more reserved for the traditional Ga and their kings, many families who use figurative coffins are indeed Christians. For them design coffins have no longer a spiritual function, their appeal is more aesthetic, aimed at surprising mourners with strikingly innovative forms like automobiles or aeroplanes, fish or pigs, onions or tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern: Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt; So the figurative coffins, rather than constituting a new art form as it was long believed, were developed from the figurative palanquins which had existed already a long time.&lt;ref name="Regula Tschumi 2013"/&gt;

==Cremation==
With the resurgence of [[cremation]] in the [[Western world]], manufacturers have begun providing options for those who choose cremation.  For a direct cremation a cardboard box is sometimes used. Those who wish to have a [[Funeral#Visitation|funeral visitation]] (sometimes called a [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]]) or traditional funeral service will use a coffin of some sort.

Some choose to use a coffin made of wood or other materials like particle board or low-density fibreboard.  Others will rent a regular casket for the duration of the services.  These caskets have a removable bed and liner which is replaced after each use.  There are also rental caskets with an outer shell that looks like a traditional coffin and a cardboard box that fits inside the shell.  At the end of the services the inner box is removed and the deceased is cremated inside this box.

==Industry==
[[File:Macau-coffin-shop-0805.jpg|thumb|left|A coffin shop in [[Macau]]]]
[[File:UniversalCasket.JPG|thumb|right|A Universal Casket sales kiosk within a U.S. [[Costco]] warehouse retail store in California. Steel caskets are available from $799. Delivery direct to a funeral home is available in 48 hours to 33 states and Washington, D.C. The cost with shipping (about $1500) is about a third of comparable costs of a similar casket bought through a funeral home. This is an example of an increasingly competition-driven and direct-to-consumer marketing funeral system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://costco.universalcasket.com/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Costco.universalcasket.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditionally, in the Western world, a coffin was made, when required, by the village [[carpenter]], who would frequently manage the whole funeral. The design and workmanship would reflect the skills of that individual carpenter, with the materials and brasses being the materials that were available at the time. In past centuries, if a [[pauper's funeral]] was paid for by the [[Poor law Union|parish]], the coffin might have been made of the cheapest, thinnest possible [[Softwood|pine]]. At the other extreme, a coffin bought privately by a wealthy individual might have used [[Taxus baccata|yew]] or [[mahogany]] with a fine lining, plated fittings and brass decorations, topped with a decorated velvet drape.

In modern times coffins are almost always mass-produced. Some manufacturers do not sell directly to the public, and only work with funeral homes. In that case, the funeral director usually sells the casket to a family for a deceased person as part of the funeral services offered, and in that case the price of the casket is included in the total bill for services rendered.
Some funeral homes will have a small showroom to present families with the available caskets that could be used for a deceased family member.  In many modern funeral homes the showroom will consist of sample pieces that show the end pieces of each type of coffin that can be used.  They also include samples of the lining and other materials.  This allows funeral homes to showcase a larger number of coffin styles without the need for a larger showroom. Other types may be available from a catalogue, including decorative paint effects or printed photographs or patterns.

Under a United States federal regulation, 16 CFR Part 453 (known as the ''Funeral Rule''), if a family provides a casket they purchased elsewhere (for example from a United States retail warehouse store, as illustrated here), the establishment is required to accept the casket and use it in the services. If the casket is delivered direct to the funeral home from the manufacturer or store, they are required to accept delivery of the casket. The funeral home may not add any extra charges or fees to the overall bill if a family decides to purchase a casket elsewhere. If the casket was bought from the funeral home, these regulations require bills to be completely itemized.

Creating documentation of collections and providing safe storage conditions are important aspects of collections management.]]

'''Collections management''' involves the development, storage, and preservation of [[collection (artwork)|collections]] and [[cultural heritage]]. The primary goal of collections management is to meet the needs of the individual collector or collecting institution's [[mission statement]], while also ensuring the long-term safety and sustainability of the cultural objects within the collector's care. Collections management, which consists primarily of the administrative responsibilities associated with collection development, is closely related to [[collections care]], which is the physical preservation of cultural heritage. The professions most influenced by collections management include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.

==Definition==
Cultural heritage collections require a great deal of care and protection in order to ensure their safety from external loss or damage, but they also require in-depth documentation to assist in tracking the life of the object within the holding institution. To accommodate these needs, collectors adhere to collections management and collections care standards and practices, which serve to create a safe environment for collection objects with clear and precise accompanying documentation. Where collections care addresses the physical actions necessary to prevent or delay damages of cultural heritage, collection management can be defined as "a process of information gathering, communication, coordination, policy formulation, evaluation, and planning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Johnson|first =Peggy|title =Fundamentals of Collection Development and Management|place =Chicago, IL|publisher =The American Library Association|year =2009|edition =2|chapter =1: Introduction to Collection Management and Development|page =2| isbn =978-0-8389-0972-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes influence decisions about records management and the collections management policy, which outlines protocols for the collection scope, collections care, and emergency planning and response.

==Records management==
According to the Smithsonian Institution, a record is "any official, recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristics which are created, received, and maintained" by an individual collector or institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Smithsonian Institution Archives|author-link=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Records Management|year =n.d.|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/services/records-management|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As every object within a collection must have accompanying documentation, records management functions as the primary focus of collections management, and covers a wide range of documentation and policy standards. Topics covered under the umbrella of records management include collection information management systems, collections accession and deaccession policies, collection management policies, cataloging, and curation. The lack of appropriate record keeping systems in museums compromises the security of museum collections and threatens the role of museums as information centers. Planned and systematized management of records improves programs and activities in museums, thereby leading to effective governance and operation of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Chaterera|author-link=Journal of the South African Society of Archivists|title=Beyond regress: museum records management in Zimbabwe|year =2014|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/services/records-management|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections management systems===
{{Main|Collections Management System}}
Collection management systems (CMS) are software programs designed to aid in the archiving and cataloging of objects in a collection. Within libraries, archives, and museums there are several CMS systems available for use to include: are [http://alm.axiell.com/collections-management-software/ Axiell's Collections Management Software], Proficio by Re:discovery Software, [http://www.zetcom.com/en/museumplus_en/ MuseumPlus] by zetcom, The Museum System (TMS), S-MUSEUM by SKINsoft, EmbARK, Archivists Toolkit, and PastPerfect, just to name a few. Some institutions even create their own "homegrown" CMS, using common development tools such as [[Filemaker|Filemaker Pro]], and [[Microsoft Access|Microsoft Office Access]], to address the specific needs of their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Re:discovery Software|title=Collection Management Systems for all collections big and small|year =n.d. |url=http://www.rediscoverysoftware.com/productsoverview.aspx|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Gallery Systems|title=Collection Management: Software for Museums, Visual Resources and Cultural Collections|year =n.d. |url=http://www.gallerysystems.com/collection-management-software-museums-visual-resources-and-cultural-collections|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Oral History in the Digital Age|title=Collection Management Systems: Tools for Managing Oral History Collections|year =2014 |url=http://ohda.matrix.msu.edu/2012/06/collection-management-systems/|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors to consider in selecting a CMS including the size of the collection, its anticipated growth over time, and the availability of IT resources and staffing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Z. (Jan-Feb 2013), "[http://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?]", History Associates, retrieved 17 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although every CMS program is unique, there are several features that are considered standard:

* ''Cataloging'': This feature includes fields for object identification purposes such as permanent identification numbers, object name, artist or creator name, object description, dimensions, object components and materials, condition, provenance, exhibition and preservation history, current location, and an image of the object.
* ''Acquisitions'': This feature includes fields relevant to the donor and purchase history for the object such as date of acquisition, donor or seller name and contact information, the assigned [[accession number (library science)|accession number]], purchase price, condition assessment at time of arrival, and seller or donor restrictions, if applicable.
* ''Deaccessions'': This feature addresses the removal of an object from a collection and includes information such as the date of deacessioning, method of disposal used, and reason for removal.
* ''Loans'': This feature is used for tracking information about incoming and outgoing loans to include lender name and contact information, special requirements, shipping instructions, associated insurance policies, and loan history.
* ''Condition and conservation reports'': This feature includes condition assessments performed on objects, and the name of the inspector and date of inspection. This section also includes conservation reports detailing [[conservation-restoration]] treatments performed on the object.
* ''Security'': This feature allows the database administrator to restrict access to the database by giving only specific individuals access to view and/or edit object records.
* ''Copyright'': The copyright feature allows the institution to input relevant intellectual property restrictions for the objects in order to prevent illegal distribution or reproduction of the object.
* ''Multimedia'': The multimedia feature is a function that allows digital materials such as image, video, and audio content associated with an object to be attached to the object record. This feature typically allows the input of associated [[metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Carpinone|first =Elana C.|title =Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All|date =May 2010|pages =25–27| url=http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf| accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cataloging===
{{Main|Cataloging}}
Cataloging is the process of entering informational data about an object into a [[collection catalog]] or database. This process involves assigning unique identification numbers to individual objects within a collection, and attaching relevant accompanying documentation to the item such as curatorial worksheets, photographs, condition assessments, and accession and/or deaccession information.&lt;ref name= "AMNH"&gt;{{Citation|last =American Museum of Natural History|author-link=American History Museum|title= Cataloging|year =n.d. |url=http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/11/cataloging|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A catalog is meant to serve as a systematic written or digital record of every object within a collection, and should at the very least, include an object description that will allow for easy identification of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =1A: History of Registration|page =2| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cataloging is an important aspect of collections management as it provides the individual records associated with each object within a collection. Should an object be lost or destroyed, the catalog entry can be utilized as a permanent record of the object and its data. For some collections, such as natural history collections, the catalog entry for an object or specimen also contains the scientific values and research information about the physical object, making maintenance of a catalog entry imperative for future research and education.&lt;ref name="AMNH" /&gt; Most modern collectors and institutions utilize CMS to streamline the catalog process. For this to be effective, data entry standards must be utilized for data structure, data values, and data content, which then "form the basis for a set of tools that can lead to good descriptive cataloguing, consistent documentation, shared records, and increased end-user access."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Visual Resources Association|title= Cataloging Cultural Objects: Executive Summary|year =2006 |url =http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/execsumm.html|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curation===
[[Content curation|Curation]] can be defined as the collecting, organizing, preserving, and displaying of information about a specific object or collection topic. The role of curating is performed by individuals known as [[curators]], who are trained as subject specialists. Where collection managers and registrars can be seen as record keepers, or in some cases, jacks-of-all-trades, curators pursue specialized training in a given subject matter which allows them to conduct research on objects, offer guidance in the organization of a collection, and select objects to be utilized in [[exhibition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Glaser|first =Jane R.|last2 =Zenetou|first2 =Artemis A.|title =Museums: A Place to Work, Planning Museum Careers|place =New York, NY|publisher =Routledge|year =1996|chapter =6: Museum professional positions: qualifications, duties, and responsibilities| pages =80–81|isbn =0-415-12256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curation therefore entails the aesthetic details of a collection and involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, as well as the in-depth research and writing of papers associated with the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =1B: Collection Roles|page =13| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital curation====
{{Main|Digital curation}}
Digital curation is an extension of content curation, and involves the collecting, preserving, and archiving of [[digital data|digital]] assets associated with digitized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Digital Curation? |publisher=[[Digital Curation Centre]] |url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about/what |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Yakel|first =Elizabeth|title=Digital curation |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=2007|url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/164/2007/00000023/00000004/art00003 |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital assets include both those items that originated in a digital form and are considered [[born-digital]] (i.e. websites, wikis, and digitally created sound and photographs), as well as [[analog recording|analog]] items that have been [[digitized]] (i.e. cataloged in digital form, while still maintaining the original physical/analog form).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Library of Congress|author-link= Library of Congress|title= Preserving Digital Culture|url= http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/swf/activity.swf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Erway|first =Ricky|title =Defining "Born Digital"|pages =4|date=November 2010|url =https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/activities/hiddencollections/borndigital.pdf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital curation, like content curation, also involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, which in this case, often involves website maintenance for online exhibits.

Whether born-digital or digitized, many modern collections contain some form of digital collection content which must be maintained in much the same way as physical objects. Preservation of digital assets involves the creation of metadata to improve accessibility and object tracking, preventing technical obsolescence and data loss due to mismanagement, performing routine audits of technical software and digital catalogs to ensure data remains uncorrupted, applying authorization standards to protect data from unauthorized alterations, and managing content for the purposes of research and exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Higgins|first =Sarah|title =Digital Curation: The Emergence of a New Discipline|journal =The International Journal of Digital Curation|volume =6|issue =2|pages =78–88|publisher =University of Edinburgh|date =2011|url =http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/184/251|doi =10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.191|accessdate =April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections management policy==
The primary focus of collections management is to document the standards and practices necessary to develop, care for, and make available for use, the collection objects within a collector or institution's care. To accomplish this, a collections management policy is created in which detailed information is provided to explain the specific needs of the collection based on type, age, location, etc. Collection management policies are specific to the collection-holding institution and these policies lay out terms such as which personnel are responsible for individual tasks involving the collection, if and when an object should be acquired for or removed from the collection, who within the institution has access to the collection, and the preventive care needs of each object within the collection.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =2A: Collection Management Policies|pages =24–29| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and ethical considerations===
In addition to general care standards, a collection management policy is also governed by the local and international legal restrictions placed on certain cultural heritage objects and the management needs associated with them. There are countless laws on the books that specify how [[antiquities]], [[archaeological]] findings, and [[ethnic]] pieces must be handled and maintained to ensure their physical safety as well as the ethical considerations that these unique collection objects must address.

Examples of local laws within the United States of America include:

* ''[[Antiquities Act|Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities]]'', June 8, 1906 (“The Antiquities Act”) (16 USC 431-433): authorizes the [[President of the United States]] to declare [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]], and enforces regulations protecting archaeological sites and excavated objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Appendix A: Mandates and Standards for NPS Museum Collections|year =2000|page =A:1|url= http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/AppendA.pdf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Museum Properties Management Act of 1955'', (16 USC, Sect. 18 [f]): explains the responsibilities and actions that may be performed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] through the [[National Park Service]] to include accepting donations and bequests of money, purchasing museum objects and collections, making exchanges of museum objects or collections, and accepting and making loans of museum objects or collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Legal Information Institute|author-link=Legal Information Institute|title= 16 U.S. Code § 18f - Management of museum properties|year =2012|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/18f?qt-us_code_tabs=0#qt-us_code_tabs|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990(NAGPRA)]]'', (25 USC 3001-13): identifies ownership and control rights for Native American cultural items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Legal Information Institute|author-link=Legal Information Institute|title= 25 U.S. Code Chapter 32 - Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation|year =n.d.|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-32|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of international legislation include:

* ''The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]]'', (adopted 14 May 1954): an international treaty focused on protecting cultural heritage such as architectural monuments, archaeological locations, works of art, and any objects deemed to have artistic, historic, or scientific significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|year =n.d.|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/the-hague-convention/|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]]'', (Paris, 14 November 1970): an international agreement to oppose the practices of illicit importing, exporting, and transferring of ownership of cultural property in order to better preserve the cultural property of the countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|year =n.d.|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]'', (Paris, 17 October 2003): an international agreement designed to safeguard [[intangible cultural heritage]] while also raising awareness and appreciation thereof. Intangible cultural heritage includes "the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 2003|year =2003|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection scope===
Written as a subsection of the overarching collection management policy, most collectors and cultural institutions utilize a [[collections policy]], or selection criteria policy, in which it is outlined what purpose the collection serves, and the types of objects that are considered most relevant. The collection policy lays out the scope of the collection and its relevance to the institution's mission statement by serving as "a broad description of the [institution's] collections and an explanation of how and what the museum collects and how those collections are used." &lt;ref name= "AAM"&gt;{{Citation |last =American Alliance of Museums|author-link=American Alliance of Museums|title=Developing a Collections Management Policy|year =2012|page =4|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the collection as laid on it in this policy serves to define if, when, and how a cultural institution chooses to accession or deaccession objects from its collection. Additionally, as different types of collections require unique care protocols, the collection policy also details the categories associated with the collection such as library or archive, education or research, permanent, and exhibit.  The collection policy might also address conflicts of interest for employees who hold personal collections that are similar to those of the institution within which they are employed.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "AAM" /&gt;

====Accessioning====
Accessioning can be defined as "the process of creating a permanent record of an object, assemblage, or lot received from one source at one time for which the [institution] has custody, right, or title, and assigning a unique control number to said object, assembly, or lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =University of Alaska Museum of the North|author-link=University of Alaska Museum of the North|title=Acquistitions and Accessioning|date= May 14, 2009|url=http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/ethno/policies/acquisitions/|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the collection scope policy, collectors and institutions must lay out acquisition terms to ensure only relevant objects are successfully accessioned into the collection. This portion of the policy discusses: who within the institution is authorized to make decisions on whether an object is acquired or not, under what legal terms the object is to be acquired (i.e. documentation proving legal purchase, import and export restrictions, and intellectual property rights), and [[wikt:repository|repository]] agreement information if the object is to be stored within an offsite facility.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt; The accessioning section of the collection policy might also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the collection by examining the history of the collection as a whole. This in turn allows the collector or institution to set guidelines for improving, growing, and developing the collection in a way that is of most benefit.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt;

====Deaccessioning====
Deaccessioning is the opposite of accessioning and involves the permanent removal of an object and all associated records from a collector's or institution's collection. Like the accession portion of the collection policy, the deaccession section lays out the terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions associated with removal of the object, and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt; There are many reasons that an object may be removed from a collection including:

* The object has been deemed no longer relevant to the collection-holder's mission or permanent collection scope.
* The condition of the object has deteriorated or been damaged to such an extent that the collection-holder cannot implement restoration repairs, or the object now poses a health risk for institution personnel.
* The institution no longer possess the means to maintain the object in an adequate environment due to financial or budgeting concerns, loss of personnel, lack of equipment, etc.
* The institution already possesses similar objects within the collection, which causes an unnecessary redundancy.
* The object has been deemed a fake or forgery, or not authentic and no longer relevant to the overall collection.
* The collection-holder is in a position in which deaccessioning an object will improve the quality of care and function of the remaining collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Loyola University Museum of Art|author-link = Loyola University Museum of Art|title = LUMA Acquisition and Deacquisition Policies|year = n.d.|url = http://www.luc.edu/luma/collections/collections_acquisition.html|accessdate = April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loans and temporary custody of objects====
Collectors and collecting institutions sometimes transfer objects to or from their collections for temporary periods of time as part of loan or temporary custody agreements. These loans help share and disseminate information to different communities and can prove mutually beneficial to both collection-holding individuals or institutions.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt; Loans can occur for a variety of reasons and for policy purposes loans may be defined as: stationary or traveling exhibition loans, exchange loans, study loans, promised gifts, fractional-interest gifts (a "donor's remaining interest in a partial gift"), and long-term loans. The policies for loans may also be applied to acquisitions during the processing period, unsolicited objects until a return can be arranged, and collection objects or those objects found, abandoned, or unclaimed, in which ownership is unclear.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRM5,3L"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =3L: Loans|page =120| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the collections scope section of a collections management policy, there is typically an area dedicated to discussing the procedures for loan approval and acceptance, associated acquisition fees, required documentation, specific insurance requirements, and monitoring instructions for the temporary holdings. This section may also include information about old loans and works with restrictions governing if and when they are allowed to leave the holding-institution.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt; The loan policy should address both incoming and outgoing loans with thoroughly explained written procedures.&lt;ref name="MRM5,3L" /&gt;

===Collections care===
[[Image:Visual storage - Victoria &amp; Albert Museum - 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|The visual storage facilities at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, England.]]
{{Main|Collections care}}

Collections care can be defined as the physical preventive care measures taken to prevent damage or delay the natural deterioration of cultural heritage collection objects. These practices strive to provide enhanced safety for collections by minimizing damages from external sources such as improper handling, vandalism, climate changes, overexposure to light, and pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Canadian Conservation Institute|author-link =Canadian Conservation Institute|title=Ten Agents of Deterioration|year =2013|url =http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/10agents/index-eng.aspx|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collections management policy carefully examines the collections care and [[collections maintenance (museum)]] needs of the individual objects within the collection, in order to provide practices and standards for how to mitigate threats, as well as the proper procedures for addressing issues as they arise. Sub-topics within this section may include display and storage housing, packing and transport, and integrated pest management.

====Display and storage housing====
When objects are held within a collection, either in storage or on display in an exhibit, the primary concern should be on the continued safety of the collection. To accomplish this, the collector or holding-institution must take into consideration proper housing containers, as well as environmental conditions necessary to prevent damages. The collections management policy for the collection should contain sections in which display and storage housing needs for the objects are addressed in full. Consultation with a [[conservator-restorer]] may be necessary to fully address these topics.

In terms of housing, solid [[structural design]] is vital in ensuring objects remain undamaged while stationary. This includes accounting for padding and support of the objects to prevent damage from bumps and snags, and stable display cases or mounts, which often requires collaboration with a [[mount maker]] to ensure proper creation and installation. Stands, shelves, drawers, and cases, in addition to fasteners, adhesives, papers, and foams, must all be chosen based on their compatibility with the structural design and materials of each individual object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5H: Storage|pages =295–296| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections management policy should outline housing specifications such as the use of acid-free (pH neutral) and dye-free materials; types of enclosed [[cabinetry]] where available; appropriate coverings such as fabrics (e.g. unbleached [[muslin]]), [[polyethylene]] sheeting, and [[foam|closed-cell foam]] (e.g. Ethafoam); containers made of paper, plastic, wood, or metal; enclosures such as folders or mats; and standards for frames, supports, and mounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5J: Preparation| pages =307–310| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main environmental conditions that require outlined protocols in the collections management policy include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]] (RH), light, and [[contaminants]].&lt;ref name="MRM5,5G"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5G: Preventive Care|pages =287–292| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to completely prevent natural deterioration of objects, but by carefully monitoring and implementing policies regarding environmental conditions, the effects of these conditions can be greatly reduced.

* ''Temperature'': There is some flexibility allowed when addressing temperature, as it is impossible to control external weather. However, policy standards should aim to set temperature ranges that are optimized for the type of objects being preserved, the collector's or institution's energy and financial restrictions, as well as human comfort levels within both exhibit galleries and storage facilities.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David |author2=Charles S. Tumosa |author3=Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying Science to the Question of Museum Climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Relative humidity'': Like temperature, RH standards, also allow for some fluctuations, although policies should take into account that excessive [[moisture]] or sudden dramatic shifts in relative humidity, can be harmful to almost all cultural heritage materials and may cause issues such as [[corrosion]], [[mold]] growth, cracking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Crack|title=Crack|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; warping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Warp_(damage)|title=Warp (damage)|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name =Erhardt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mecklenburg|first=Marion F.|author2=Charles S. Tumosa|title=Temperature and Relative Humidity Effects on the Mechanical and Chemical Stability of Collections|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=April 1999|pages=69–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Light'': There are two types of light- [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and visual [[light]] as perceived by the human eye- that need to be addressed within collections management and care. The effects of visual light exposure is cumulative, but visual light is necessary to view and safely handle objects within a collection, which means that standards should be established to limit time and intensity levels of visual light exposure, without risking visitor or staff safety.&lt;ref name ="Michalski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michalski|first=Stefan|title=The Lighting Decision|journal=CCI Preprints|year=1997|series=Canadian Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; UV light, on the other hand, is not necessary for viewing or handling of collections, and as such should be eliminated as much as possible through the use of [[filter (optics)|filters]] in order to prevent damage such as yellowing or disintegration.&lt;ref name ="Michalski" /&gt;
* ''Contaminants'': Contaminants can take a variety of forms such as gases, liquids, or solids, and they can pose threats not only to a collection, but also to those individuals that come in close contact with the pollutants. To ensure the safety of personnel and objects, it is necessary for a collection management policy to specify the proper methods for documenting and researching objects that are a risk for bringing contaminants into the collection, as well as explaining what precautions must be taken to prevent accidental contamination as the result of human error or the chemical breakdown of collection objects. Contaminated objects may show signs of disintegration, discoloration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Discoloration|title=Discoloration|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or corrosion.&lt;ref name ="MRM5,5G" /&gt;

====Packing and transport====
Objects within a collection should ideally, be handled as little as possible since every time they are handled, they are at an increased risk of damage. Proper display and storage housing will help to mitigate some of the risks of accidental damage, but it is important to create and implement high standards for the routine care and handling, as well as the packing and transporting, of collection objects.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp6"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1999|chapter =Chapter 6: Handling, Packing, and Shipping|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP6.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely important to ensure that staff are aware of and educated on standard practices for handling objects such as hand washing protocols, the appropriate use of cotton or latex gloves, established practices for identifying structural weaknesses that may require special care, and the accepted modes of transportation of objects within the holding-institution (i.e. flatbeds, carts, tote pans, pads, and tissue papers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ontario Ministry of Culture, Heritage and Libraries Branch|title=Museum Notes #6: Handling Museum Objects|year =2005|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/pdf/handling_museum_objects.pdf|accessdate =April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a collector or institution will have a need to move objects outside of exhibit and storage locations. The collection management policy, which discusses the proper procedures for loans and acquisitions, must therefore also address proper packing and transport protocols to ensure that the objects arrive at their destination safely. To ensure safe transport, safe handling techniques must be combined with individual packing requirements for the specific object being shipped. Ideally, the object will be packaged in a [[shipping container]] that provides protection from shock, vibration, sudden climate changes, and mishandling. Collection management policies will advise staff on how best to address issues such as "the object's fragility, the shipping method, the climate through which the objects will travel, and the climate at the object's destination."&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp6" /&gt; During the packing and transport process, it is likely that several departments within the shipping institution may contribute, and collaboration with the receiving institution must be arranged to provide policies for acclimatization and unpacking of the object once received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Emily|author2=Leslie Williamson |author3=Rachel Perkins Arenstein |author4=Angela Yvarra McGrew |author5=Mark Feitl |title=Integrating Preventive Conservation into a Collections Move and Rehousing Project at the National Museum of the American Indian|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|year=2005|volume=44|issue=3|pages=217–232|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic44-03-006_indx.html|accessdate =April 28, 2014 |doi=10.1179/019713605806082293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Mervin, Marion F. Mecklenburg, and Ross M. Merrill|title=Art in Transit Handbook|year=1997|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated pest management====
{{Main|Museum integrated pest management}}

Within the collections care section of a collections management policy, there is typically a section dedicated to integrated pest management (IPM). This section covers the policies related to the prevention and suppression methods of various types of pests typically found within collections. IPM focuses on utilizing non-pesticide prevention and treatment techniques in order to minimize health risks for personnel as well as damages to the collection itself. Examples of types of pests that should be addressed include "insects, mold, mice, rats, birds, and bats."&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp5"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 5: Biological Infestations|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection management aspect of IPM involves creating and implementing policies for the routine inspection of objects and housing facilities, authorized trapping procedures, and documentation of all inspections or trapping programs utilized within the facility. These policies are called cultural controls, and the physical techniques utilized as part of the collections care are known as mechanical controls.&lt;ref name ="NPS,Chp5" /&gt; Specific cultural controls that may be documented within the collections management policy include:

* Standards for the inspection of all new materials to be brought into collection areas including new acquisitions and loans, and storage or packing materials.
* Defined practices for daily collections maintenance and general housekeeping of collection-holding facilities.
* Restrictions on areas within the building where food, drinks, and smoking are allowed and prohibited.
* Documentation showing the careful monitoring of plants placed around the outside of the building, with special attention paid to the proximity of live plants and mulch to the building, in addition to banning live and dried plants within the building.
* Policies for standard collections care including relative humidity, and storage and housing guidelines.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp5" /&gt;

===Emergency planning and response===
{{Main|Emergency response (museum)}}

Collections management focuses heavily on planning and response standards, and lays out these practices in documents detailing how staff responsible for the care of a collection should address the various needs of the collection. Created in conjunction with the collection management policy, most collecting institutions will also possess a disaster preparedness and emergency response policy that outlines what procedures should be taken to prevent injury or loss of life for all personnel and building visitors, as well as how to minimize damages or loss to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 10: Emergency Planning|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP10A-B.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan often contains a section identifying potential risks for the collection based on the region in which the collection is located, including fires, earthquakes, criminal activity, or flooding, in addition to damages from repairs, building failure, improper collections care, and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =American Museum of Natural History|author-link=American Museum of Natural History|title=Risk Management and Disaster Planning|year =n.d.|url =http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/9/risk-management-and-disaster-planning|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan should also outline protocols for how to handle a disaster, starting with the chain of command within the emergency response team, as well as the individual responsibilities of each member of the staff. The emergency response team will include a managing official responsible for notifying other members of the team of a disaster and overseeing the implementation of the emergency response tasks.

'''Critical Mixed Race Studies''' (CMRS) is the transracial, transdisciplinary, and transnational critical analysis of the institutionalization of social, cultural, and political orders based on dominant conceptions of race. CMRS emphasizes the mutability of race and the porosity of racial boundaries in order to critique processes of racialization and social stratification based on race. CMRS addresses local and global systemic injustices rooted in systems of racialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticalmixedracestudies.org/ |title=Critical Mixed Race Studies |publisher=Critical Mixed Race Studies |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multiculturalfamilia.com/2011/12/01/critical-mixed-race-studies/ |title=Critical Mixed Race Studies |publisher=Multicultural Familia |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Curiosolites''' or '''Curiosolitae''' were a people in the region now called [[Brittany]], in [[Gaul|Celtica]], who are mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] several times.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] ii. 34, iii. 7, 11, vii. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name only occurs in the accusative form; as there are variations in the manuscripts, the nominative is uncertain. They are mentioned by Caesar&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B. G.'' ii. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]], [[Unelli]], [[Osismi]], and others that Caesar calls ''maritimae civitates'', "maritime cities", and border on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In another place&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B. G.'' vii. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; he describes the position of the Curiosolitae on the ocean in the same terms, and includes them among the [[Armorica|Armoric]] states, a name equivalent to ''maritimae''. The name occurs in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (iv. 18) in the form "Cariosvelites"; and he mentions them with the Unelli, [[Diablindi]], and [[Rhedones]]. The Curiosolitae are not mentioned by [[Ptolemy]]. No city of these people is mentioned, and the [[Itinerarium|Itineraries]] give no roads in this part of [[Brittany]]. Accordingly, we can only conjecture their position, which is determined with some probability to be the diocese of [[St. Malo]], the only place that remains for them after fixing the position of the other Armoric nations. The name seems to be preserved in [[Corseul]], a village between [[Dinan]] and [[Lamballe]], where there are the remains of an old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town. We may conclude that, after the fashion of Gallic names, Corseul represents the capital of the Curiosolitae. [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] supposes that on the coast they extended west to the neighborhood of [[St. Brieuc]], where a place called [[Finiac]] denotes the boundary of an ancient territory, as the name ''Fines'' or ''Fins'' denotes in other parts of Gallia. The neighbors of the Curiosolitae on the east were the Rhedones, and on the south the Veneti. On the west were the Osismi or Osismii, who occupied the extremity of the peninsula of Brittany. But [[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] places, between the Osismi and the Curiosolitae, the [[Biducasii]] of Ptolemy, in the diocese of [[St. Bidué]] or St. Brieuc; whom he distinguishes from the [[Viducasses]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Anville, ''Notice, &amp;c.''; [[Walckenaer]], ''Géographie ancienne, historique et comparée des Gaules'', vol. i. p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria Ramirez''' (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Dates from [[SSDI]]; Gloria C. Ramirez.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American woman dubbed "the Toxic Lady" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She had been admitted to the [[emergency department]] while suffering from late-stage [[cervical cancer]]. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms. Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in an [[intensive care unit]] for two weeks. She was from [[Riverside, California]].

Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. The incident was initially considered to be a case of [[mass hysteria]]. An investigation by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] proposed that Ramirez had been self-administering [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] as a treatment for pain, which converted into [[dimethyl sulfate]], an extremely poisonous and highly carcinogenic alkylating agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although this theory has been endorsed by the Riverside Coroner's Office and published in the journal ''[[Forensic Science International]]'', it is still a matter of debate in the scientific community.

==Emergency department visit==
About 8:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the evening of February 19, 1994, Ramirez, suffering from the effects of advanced [[cervical cancer]], was brought into the emergency department of [[Riverside County Regional Medical Center|Riverside General Hospital]] by [[paramedic]]s. She was extremely confused and was suffering from [[tachycardia]] and [[Cheyne–Stokes respiration]].&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Richard|title=Analysis of a Toxic Death|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/apr/analysisofatoxic493|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=Discover Magazine|date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical staff injected her with [[diazepam]], [[midazolam]], and [[lorazepam]] to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to [[defibrillate]] her heart; at that point several people saw an oily sheen covering Ramirez's body, and some noticed a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth. A [[registered nurse]] named Susan Kane attempted to draw blood from Ramirez's arm and noticed an [[ammonia]]-like smell coming from the [[Vacutainer|tube]].&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;

She passed the syringe to Julie Gorchynski, a medical resident, who noticed manila-colored particles floating in the blood. At this point, Kane [[fainted]] and was removed from the room. Shortly thereafter, Gorchynski began to feel [[nausea]]ted. Complaining that she was lightheaded, she left the trauma room and sat at a nurse's desk. A staff member asked her if she was okay, but before she could respond she also fainted. Maureen Welch, a respiratory therapist who was assisting in the trauma room was the third to pass out. The staff was then ordered to evacuate all emergency department patients to the parking lot outside the hospital. Overall, 23 people became ill and five were hospitalized.&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeptoid"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4291|number=291|date=3 January 2012|title=The Toxic Lady|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[skeleton crew]] stayed behind to stabilize Ramirez. At 8:50&amp;nbsp;p.m., after 45 minutes of [[CPR]] and [[defibrillation]], Ramirez was pronounced dead from [[kidney failure]] related to her cancer.&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;

==Investigation==
The county health department called in California's [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which put two scientists, Drs.&amp;nbsp;Ana Maria Osorio and Kirsten Waller, on the case. They interviewed 34 hospital staff who had been working in the emergency department on February 19. Using a standardized questionnaire, Osorio and Waller found that the people who had developed severe symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and muscle spasms, tended to have certain things in common. People who had worked within two feet of Ramirez and had handled her intravenous lines had been at high risk. But other factors that correlated with severe symptoms did not appear to match a scenario in which fumes had been released: the survey found that those afflicted tended to be women rather than men, and they all had normal blood tests after the exposure. They believed the hospital workers suffered from [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;

Gorchynski denied that she had been affected by [[mass hysteria]] and pointed to her own medical history as evidence. After the exposure, she spent two weeks in the [[intensive care unit]] with breathing problems. She developed [[hepatitis]] and [[avascular necrosis]] in her knees. Riverside Coroner’s Office contacted [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] to investigate the incident. Livermore Labs postulated that Ramirez had been using [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO), a solvent used as a powerful degreaser, as a home remedy for pain. Users of this substance report that it has a garlic-like taste.&lt;ref name="discover" /&gt; Sold in gel form at hardware stores, it could also explain the greasy appearance of Ramirez's body.&lt;ref name="discover" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeptoid" /&gt; The Livermore scientists theorized that the DMSO in Ramirez's system might have built up owing to urinary blockage caused by her kidney failure.&lt;ref name="Skeptoid" /&gt; Oxygen administered by the paramedics would have combined with the DMSO to form [[dimethyl sulfone]] (DMSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). DMSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to crystallize at room temperature, and crystals were observed in some of Ramirez's drawn blood.&lt;ref name="discover" /&gt; Electric shocks administered during emergency defibrillation could have then converted the DMSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into [[dimethyl sulfate]] (DMSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the highly toxic dimethyl ester of sulfuric acid, exposure to which could have caused some of the reported symptoms of the emergency department staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/999/whats-the-story-on-the-toxic-lady/|title=What’s the story on the "toxic lady"?|last1=Adams|first1=Cecil|author-link=Cecil Adams|date=22 March 1996|website=[[The Straight Dope]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Livermore scientists postulated on ''[[The New Detectives]]'' that the change in temperature of the blood drawn, from the 98.6&amp;nbsp;°F (37&amp;nbsp;°C) of Ramirez' body to the 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18&amp;nbsp;°C) of the emergency department, may have contributed to its conversion from DMSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into DMSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This, however, has not been confirmed.

== Burial ==
Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. The Riverside Coroner's Office hailed Livermore's DMSO conclusion as the probable cause of the hospital workers' symptoms, while her family disagreed. The Ramirez family's [[pathologist]] was unable to determine a cause of death because her heart was missing, her other organs were cross-contaminated with fecal matter, and her body was too badly decomposed. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at [[Riverside, California#Cemeteries|Olivewood Memorial Park]] in Riverside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-21/news/mn-48511_1_gloria-ramirez|title=Woman at Core of Mystery Buried|last1=Gorman|first1=Tom|date=21 April 1994|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Status of technical forensic analysis===
The possible chemical explanation for this incident by Patrick M. Grant of the Livermore Forensic Science Center is beginning to appear in basic forensic science textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Forensic Science'', M.M. Houck and J.A. Siegel, Academic Press, 2006, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In Houck and Siegel's textbook, the authors opine that, although some weaknesses exist, the postulated scenario is "the most scientific explanation to date" and that "beyond this theory, no credible explanation has ever been offered for the strange case of Gloria Ramirez."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934933234 |title=Fundamentals of forensic science |last=Houck |first=Max M. |last2=Siegel |first2=Jay A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780128002315 |edition= Third|location=Amsterdam |pages=177 |oclc=934933234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's conclusions and speculations about the incident were evaluated by professional forensic scientists, chemists, and toxicologists, passed peer review in an accredited, refereed journal, and was published by ''[[Forensic Science International]]''.&lt;ref name="Grant Article"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=et al, |title=Response to Letters to the Editor Concerning the Riverside 'Mystery Fumes' Incident Analysis |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073897000765 |website=Science Direct |publisher=Forensic Science International, Volume 87, Issue 3, 23 June 1997, Pages 219-237 |accessdate=24 October 2018 |ref=Volume 87, Issue 3, 23 June 1997, Pages 219-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, "Response to Letters to the Editor Concerning the Riverside 'Mystery Fumes' Incident Analysis", ''Forensic Science International'' 94: 223–230 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The first paper was very technically detailed and did, in fact, give two potential chemical reaction mechanisms that may possibly have formed dimethyl sulfate from dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl sulfone precursors. The second communication gave supplemental support for the postulated chemical scenario as well as insight into some of the sociology and vested interests inherent in the case.

However, the dimethyl sulfoxide theory has come under scrutiny in the scientific community for several reasons, the primary reason being that the proposed dimethyl sulfate generation could not be replicated in laboratory trials. Also, the symptoms displayed by the nursing staff members who fell ill while caring for Ramirez are not consistent with dimethyl sulfate exposure. Another reason the dimethyl sulfate theory is unlikely is that the odor observed by the staff was described as "ammoniacal", but dimethyl sulfate is described as having a faint odor reminiscent of that of onions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

One of the letters proposed the production of toxic [[chloramine]] gas due to urine mixing with bleach in a nearby sink. This hypothesis, previously proposed to the investigators and to the medical personnel involved in the incident, was apparently never considered by all involved. The noxious effects of this gas are documented in the ''New England Journal of Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;''New England Journal of Medicine'', Vol. 341: 848–849, 9 September 1999, [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/341/11/848-a "Severe Lung Injury after Exposure to Chloramine Gas from Household Cleaners"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grant later addressed this chloramine scenario in his 1998 ''Response'', and found it did not come close to fitting the ER incident.&lt;ref name="Grant Article"/&gt;

'''Decision downloading'''&lt;ref name="Clampitt,P. 2007"&gt;Clampitt,P. &amp; Williams, M.(2007)Decision Downloading, MIT Sloan Management Review, Jan 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; refers to communicating a decision to those who have not been involved in the decision-making process. 

The term “decision downloading” is used to set apart those special situations in which
decision-makers communicate a decision that has already been made. The communicators cannot,
for whatever reason, keep everyone informed in real-time about the decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Clampitt,P. 2007" /&gt;

==Types of "downloaders"==
Decision downloaders can be classified into three groups: robust, restricted, and remedial.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Clampitt,P. &amp; Williams, M.(2007)Decision Downloading, MIT Sloan Management Review, Jan 1, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  

Robust downloaders discuss: 

# how the decision was made 
# why it was made
# what alternatives were considered
# how it fits in with the organizational mission
# how it impacts the organization 
# how it impacts employees.  

Restricted downloaders discuss some of the above issues, while remedial downloaders discuss few of them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Robust decision downloaders have a different frame of reference than their less effective
counterparts. They view themselves more as educators than cheerleaders. They recognize that
education cannot be “once and done”. They know employees learn at different rates, in different
ways and from different of sources&lt;ref&gt;Smeltzer, L.R., &amp; Zener, M.F. (1995). Organization-wide change: Planning for an effective
announcement. Journal of General Management, 20(3), 31-43. &amp; Smeltzer, L.R. (1990). An analysis of strategies for announcing organization-wide change. Group
and Organization Studies, 16, 5-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical decision downloading situations==
* An executive team has been engaged in merger talks with another company. By mutual agreement, they cannot talk about the possible merger, even to employees. Presenting the offer to shareholders and other interested parties becomes a decision downloading situation.
* Union and management are locked into contentious negotiations that involve changes in compensation, work rules, and benefits packages. By agreed-upon rules, the offers and counteroffers are not openly discussed with union employees. After months of give-and-take, they agree on contract language and want to put it to a vote. Announcing the agreement becomes a decision downloading situation.
* An executive-level task force has been established with the principal objective of finding a creative way to reduce health care costs.  After months of discussions with various vendors, they decide on an approach that minimizes the company health care expenses, preserves quality levels but involves modest increases in employee contribution levels. Announcing the plan becomes a decision downloading situation.

In each situation, the decision-makers—either by choice or by prior agreement—do not involve
others in the decision-making process. Discussions leading to the decision are often deep, nuanced
and sometimes contentious. The decisions are frequently complex, often difficult to understand, and
sometimes controversial. Simply put, the nature of the decision-making process and the features of
the decision itself often make any subsequent communications about the decision extraordinarily
difficult. All too often, the subsequent communications are an afterthought borne out of
psychological exhaustion from the decision-making process itself.&lt;ref name="Clampitt,P. 2007" /&gt; Consequently, decision-makers
frequently stumble through what we call the “decision downloading process”. No wonder researchers have found that only 50% of all decisions ever get implemented and sustained.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, P. (1999). Surprising but true: Half the decisions in organizations fail. Academy of
Management Executive, 13(4), 75-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The term was coined by [[Phillip G. Clampitt]] and [[M. Lee Williams]] in an article published in the ''[[MIT Sloan Management Review]]'', Winter 2007.[http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/articles/2007/winter/48215/decision-downloading/]

== Causes of poor decision downloading ==
The causes of poor decision downloading include:&lt;ref&gt;Clampitt,P. &amp; Williams, M.(2007)Decision Downloading, MIT Sloan Management Review, Jan 1, 10&lt;/ref&gt;
#Failure to Clarify Responsibilities.  Decision-makers sometimes fail to clarify who has responsibility for communicating the decision.
#Desire to Quickly Inform.  Decision-makers may restrict communication to the informational highlights because they are motivated by a desire to promptly inform everyone. They tend to focus on the results of the decision-making process, not on the relevant facts, the options weighed, the manner by which decisions were made, and the [[uncertainty]] surrounding conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass
Destruction: Report to the President of the United States. (2005). Government Printing
Office, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Interest in Protecting Employees.  Decision-makers may want to protect employees from all the nitty-gritty details of the [[decision-making]] process.

== Consequences of decision downloading styles ==
Researchers&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; have reported that:
* Employees who experience robustly downloaded decisions are more than twice as likely to be supportive of the decision compared to those who are forced to cope with a remedially downloaded one.
* Robustly downloaded decisions engender greater employee job satisfaction, commitment to the organization, and identity with the organization than either of the other modes.
* Robustly downloaded decisions cultivate employee perceptions that the organization is well managed and headed in the right direction.

== Criticism ==
Since this is a relatively new concept there have not been replications of the original research.

'''''Divertimento''''' {{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˌ|v|ɜːr|t|ᵻ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|t|oʊ}} ({{IPA-it|divertiˈmento|lang}}; from the Italian ''[[Wikt:divertire|divertire]]'' "to amuse") is a musical genre, with most of its examples from the 18th century. The mood of the ''[[Wikt:divertimento|divertimento]]'' is most often lighthearted (as a result of being played at social functions) and it is generally composed for a small [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]. The term is used to describe a wide variety of secular (non-religious) instrumental works for soloist or chamber ensemble. It is usually a kind of music entertainment, although it could also be applied to a more serious genre. After 1780, the term generally designated works that were informal or light.

==Genre==
As a separate genre, it appears to have no specific form, although most of the ''divertimenti'' of the second half of the 18th century go either back to a dance [[Suite (music)|suite]] approach (derived from the 'ballet' type of theatrical ''divertimento''), or take the form of other [[chamber music]] genres of their century (as a continuation of the merely instrumental theatrical ''divertimento''). There are many other terms which describe music similar to the ''divertimento'', including ''[[serenade]]'', ''[[cassation (music)|cassation]]'', ''notturno'', ''Nachtmusik''; after about 1780, the ''divertimento'' was the term most commonly applied to this light, "after-dinner" and often outdoor music. ''Divertimenti'' have from one to nine [[Movement (music)|movements]], and there is at least one example with thirteen. The earliest publication to use the name "''divertimento''" is by [[Carlo Grossi]] in 1681 in Venice (''Il divertimento de' grandi: musiche da camera, ò per servizio di tavola'') and the hint that the ''divertimento'' is to accompany "table service" applies to later ages as well, since this light music was often used to accompany banquets and other social events.

==Examples==
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is known for having composed different types of ''divertimenti'', sometimes even taking the form of a small [[symphony]] (or, more exactly: [[sinfonia]]), for example, the ''Salzburg Symphonies'' K. 136, K. 137 and K. 138. Even more unusual is his six movement [[string trio]], the [[Divertimento in E-flat (Mozart)|Divertimento in E-flat, K. 563]], which is a serious work belonging with his [[string quartet]]s and [[String quintet|quintets]]. Other composers of ''divertimenti'' include [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Carl Stamitz]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]].

Several examples exist from the 20th century, including works by [[Alfred Reed]], [[Nikolai Medtner]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Paul Graener]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Lennox Berkeley]], [[Gareth Walters]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Lars-Erik Larsson]], [[Saint-Preux]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]] and [[Joe Hisaishi]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]] also arranged a divertimento from his ballet to music of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], ''[[Le baiser de la fée]]'', while [[Joaquín Rodrigo]] called his 1982 [[cello concerto]] a "[[Concierto como un divertimento]]" ("Concerto like a divertimento").

[[File:Dziady_(silver_coin)r.png|282px|thumb|Belarusian 20-[[Belarusian ruble|ruble]] "Dziady" coin, reverse]]

'''Dziady''' is an ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[feast day|feast]] commemorating the dead ancestors. The Polish and Belarusian word means "grandfathers" and is sometimes translated into English as '''Forefathers' Eve'''. 

The commemoration took place twice every year (in spring and in autumn), but nowadays it is usually held around end of October. During the feast the Slavs perform [[libation]]s and eat ritual meals, to celebrate the living and the souls of the forefathers who joined the ''dziady'' after dark.

In [[Poland]] the tradition was supplanted by the Christian [[Zaduszki]] feast&lt;ref name="Jan Witold Suligą"&gt;[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/tokfm/1,70505,3714426.html About ''Zaduszki''] {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but original Dziady celebration continues among [[Rodnovery]].

In [[Belarus]], Dziady (Дзяды) usually took place on the last Saturday before [[Saint Demetrius|St. Dmitry]]'s day, at the end of October/beginning of November (''Dźmitreuskija dziady'', St. Dmitry's ''Dziady''). There were also [[Trinity]] Day ''Dziady''', [[Shrovetide]] ''Dziady''', and some other dates. Today, it is celebrated on November 2.&lt;ref&gt;https://anydayguide.com/calendar/845&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lithuanians]] have a similar feast day, called [[Ilgės]]. It has roots in [[pagan]] times, and differs slightly from the Slavic Dziady.

In 1988 the newly founded [[Belarusian Popular Front]] (BPF) initiated the revival of the tradition in [[Belarus]]. In addition, on this day a rally to [[Kurapaty]] on the outskirts of Minsk is arranged, in the memory of the victims  of [[Soviet political repressions]]. The [[communist]] administration of the country at that time strongly opposed the initiative. The BPF and other movements in Belarus have continued the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tut.by/society/19141.html "On Dziady Day: To Kurapaty"] Belarusian edition of ''[[Radio Liberty]]'' October 22, 2002 {{be icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iniciative.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=3 "Dziady. Kurapaty 1937-2007"] {{be icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==

Much of the second part of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s verse drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (published in 1823) depicts the Dziady feast organized in what is now [[Belarus]], and popular among [[Ruthenians]] and Lithuanians during the times of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

A '''festival''' is an event ordinarily celebrated by a [[community]] and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its [[religion]] or [[culture]]s. It is often marked as a local or national [[holiday]], [[mela]], or [[Muslim holidays|eid]]. Next to religion and [[folklore]], a significant origin is [[agriculture|agricultural]]. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with [[harvest]] time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in [[autumn]], such as [[Halloween]] in the northern hemisphere and [[Easter]] in the southern.

Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. The celebrations offer a sense of belonging for religious, social, or geographical groups, contributing to [[group cohesiveness]]. They may also provide [[entertainment]], which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of [[old age|elders]] sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among [[family|families]].

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], festivals such as the [[Saturnalia]] were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Noel|title=Festivals and legends: the formation of Greek cities in the light of public ritual|year=1992|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802059880|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandt|first=edited by J.

The [[Philippines]] is one example of a modern society with a large number of festivals, as each day of the year has at least one specific celebration. There are more than 42,000 known major and minor festivals in the country, the majority of which are specific to the [[barangay]] (village) level.&lt;ref name="Picard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Picard|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Mike|editor=David Picard and Mike Robinson|title=Festivals, Tourism and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=[[Channel View Publications]]|isbn=978-1-84541-267-8|pages=1–3|chapter=Remaking Worlds: Festivals, Tourism and Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Alexander van Bredael - A Festival in Antwerp.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|A Festival at [[Antwerp]], 17th century]]
[[File:Ländliches Fest in Schwaben.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|Country Festival in [[Swabia]]]]
The word "festival" was originally used as an adjective from the late fourteenth century, deriving from [[Latin]] via [[Old French]].&lt;ref name=oed1&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69567 festival, adj. and n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]], a "festival dai" was a religious holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED15806&amp;egs=all festival (adj.)] at the [[Middle English Dictionary]]. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first recorded used as a noun was in 1589 (as "Festifall").&lt;ref name=oed1/&gt; Feast first came into usage as a noun circa 1200,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68799 feast, n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68800 feast, v.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "feast" is also used in common [[secular]] [[idiom|parlance]] as a synonym for any large or elaborate [[meal]]. When used as in the meaning of a festival, most often refers to a [[religious festival]] rather than a film or art festival. In the [[Philippines]] and many other former Spanish colonies, the Spanish word '''fiesta''' is used to denote a communal religious feast to honor a [[patron saint]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Traditions==
Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. The most important religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Diwali]], and [[Eid al-Adha]] serve to mark out the year. Others, such as [[harvest festival]]s, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. An early example is the festival established by [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] celebrating his victory over the Libyans.&lt;ref name=Berrett&gt;{{cite book|last=Berrett|first=LaMar C.|title=Discovering the world of the Bible|year=1996|publisher=Grandin Book Co.|location=Provo, Utah|isbn=0-910523-52-5|page=289|edition=3rd ed., rev.|author2=Ogden D. Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, royal holidays commemorate dynastic events just as agricultural holidays are about harvests. Festivals are often commemorated annually.

There are numerous [[Outline of festivals#Types of festivals|types of festivals]] in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to "feasting") and they bring people together. Festivals are also strongly associated with national holidays. Lists of national festivals are published to make participation easier.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[List of festivals in Australia]]; [[List of festivals in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]; [[List of festivals in Canada|Canada]]; [[Traditional Chinese holidays|China]]; [[List of festivals in Colombia|Colombia]]; [[List of festivals in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]]; [[List of festivals in Fiji|Fiji]]; [[Public holidays in India|India]]; [[List of festivals in Indonesia|Indonesia]]; [[List of festivals in Iran|Iran]]; [[List of festivals in Japan|Japan]]; [[List of festivals in Laos|Laos]]; [[List of festivals in Morocco|Morocco]]; [[List of festivals in Nepal|Nepal]]; [[List of festivals in Pakistan|Pakistan]]; [[List of festivals in the Philippines|Philippines]]; [[List of festivals in Romania|Romania]]; [[List of festivals in Tunisia|Tunisia]]; [[List of festivals in Turkey|Turkey]]; [[List of festivals in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]; [[List of festivals in the United States|United States]]; [[List of festivals in Vietnam|Vietnam]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of festivals==
===Religious festivals===
{{main|Religious festival}}
Among many [[religion]]s, a feast is a set of celebrations in honour of [[Gods]] or [[God]].&lt;ref name=Bleeker&gt;Ancient Egyptian festivals could be either religious or political.{{cite book|last=Bleeker|first=C. J.|title=Egyptian festivals. Enactments of religious renewal|date=1967 [1968]|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as [[Passover]], Easter and Eid al-Adha are [[moveable feast]]s – that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The [[Sed festival]], for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian [[pharaoh]]'s rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heb-Sed (Egyptian feast)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258986/Heb-Sed|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]], there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection, (Easter). In the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one specific religious festival, either from Catholic, Islamic, or indigenous origins.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious festivals, such as [[Esala Perahera]] are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerson|first=Ruth|title=Traditional festivals in Thailand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur; New York|isbn=9676531111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Sindhi festivals|Hindu festivals]], such as [[Holi]] are very ancient. The [[Sikh]] community celebrates the [[Vaisakhi]] festival marking the new year and birth of the [[Khalsa]].&lt;ref name="Roy2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 &amp;#91;M – Z&amp;#93;: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|page=480|chapter=Sikh Vaisakhi: Anniversary of the Pure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts festivals===
{{main|Arts festival}}

Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as [[science festival]]s, [[literary festival]]s and [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of music festivals]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sub-categories include [[comedy festival]]s, [[rock festival]]s, [[List of jazz festivals|jazz festivals]] and [[buskers festival]]s; [[poetry]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;Some such as such as [[Cúirt International Festival of Literature]] started as a poetry festival and then broadened in scope.&lt;/ref&gt; [[theatre festival]]s, and [[storytelling festival]]s; and re-enactment festivals such as [[Renaissance fair]]s. In the [[Philippines]], aside from numerous art festivals scattered throughout the year, February is known as national arts month, the culmination of all art festivals in the entire archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasilag|first=Giselle P.|date=February 1999|title=Performances, exhibits around the country mark National Arts Month|url=|journal=BusinessWorld (SanJuan, Philippines)|volume=|pages=1|issn=0116-3930|via=Nexis Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Film festival]]s involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the most significant film festivals include the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

===Food and drink festivals===
{{main|Food festival}}
A food festival is an event celebrating food or drink. These often highlight the output of producers from a certain region. Some food festivals are focused on a particular item of food, such as the [[National Peanut Festival]] in the United States, or the [[Galway International Oyster Festival]] in Ireland. There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany for [[Beer festival|beer]]. Many countries hold festivals to celebrate [[wine festival|wine]]. One example is the global celebration of the arrival of [[Beaujolais nouveau]], which involves shipping the new wine around the world for its release date on the third Thursday of November each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Beaujolais Nouveau day: 10 facts about the wine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/10465236/Beaujolais-Nouveau-day-10-facts-about-the-wine.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haine2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

In the Philippines, there are at least two hundred festivals dedicated to food and drinks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Seasonal and harvest festivals===
Seasonal festivals, such as [[Beltane]], are determined by the [[solar calendar|solar]] and the [[lunar calendar]]s and by the cycle of the [[season]]s, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a [[list of harvest festivals|wide range]] of ancient and modern [[harvest festival]]s. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal [[inundation]] caused by the [[Nile River]], a form of [[irrigation]], which provided fertile land for crops.&lt;ref name="Bunson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0997-8|page=278|chapter=Nile festivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alps]], in autumn the return of the cattle from the mountain [[pasture]]s to the stables in the valley is celebrated as ''[[Almabtrieb]]''. A recognized winter festival, the [[Chinese New Year]], is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day of the second new moon after the [[Dongzhi (solar term)|winter solstice]]. [[Dree Festival]] of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.&lt;ref name="GoAP PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|title=Press release – Dree festival|date=5 July 2004|publisher=Directorate of Information, Govt of Arunachal Pradesh|accessdate=2009-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718153132/http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|archive-date=July 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midsummer]] or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the [[feast day]] of a Christian saint as well as a celebration of the time of the [[summer solstice]] in the northern hemisphere, where it is particularly important in Sweden. [[Winter carnival]]s also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one festival dedicated to harvesting of crops, fishes, crustaceans, milk, and other local goods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

* [[Heortology]] – the study of [[religious festival]]s.  It was originally only used in respect of [[Christianity|Christian]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Heortology}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it now covers all [[religion]]s, in particular those of Ancient [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parker: Athenian Religion&lt;/ref&gt; See [[list of foods with religious symbolism]] for some topical overlap.

The '''flag of Kenya''' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''Bendera ya Kenya'') is a tricolour of  black, red, and green with two white edges imposed with a red, white and black [[Maasai people|Maasai]] [[shield]] and two crossed [[spear]]s. The flag is based on that of [[Kenya African National Union]] and was officially adopted on 12 December 1963 after [[Kenya]]'s independence.

==History&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Kenya|title=Flag of Kenya|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
The Kenyan flag is based on the black over red over green flag of [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU), the political party that led the fight for freedom and independence of Kenya. Upon independence, the white fimbriation, symbolising peace and unity, and the shield were added. The meaning of the colours of the flag of Kenya match closely to those of the Pan-African flag adopted by the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unia-acl.com/history-black,red,%20green.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913034450/http://www.unia-acl.com/history-black,red,%20green.html |archive-date=2010-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The colour black represents the people of the Republic of Kenya, red for the blood shed during the fight for independence, and green for the country's landscape and natural wealth. The white [[fimbriation]] was added later to symbolize peace and honesty. The black, red, and white traditional [[Maasai people|Maasai]] [[shield]] and two [[spear]]s symbolise the defense of all the things mentioned above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25906">The '''Hupda''' (also known as Hup, Hupd'äh, or Húpd’əh) are an [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] indigenous people who live in [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]].

==Residence and neighbors==
The Hupd'äh people live in the region bordered by the rivers [[Tiquié]] and [[Papuri River|Papuri]], tributaries that join the left hand bank of the river [[Uaupes]] in the Upper [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] region of the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] in [[Brazil]] and the departament of [[Vaupés Department|Vaupes]] in [[Colombia]]. They are known as part of the [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup language family]], and have been in contact with the frontiers of colonization since the 18th century. There are records of countless epidemics of measles, smallpox, and influenza, which decimated the population. Currently they are distributed in approximately 35 villages (local groups) estimated at a total of 1500 individuals. The Hupda villages are, in general, close to areas of [[Tucano people|Tukano]], [[Tariana people|Tariana]], [[Tuyuka]] and [[Piratapuia]] population, populations which speak languages of the [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]] [[language family]], living near the banks of the streams and rivers that make up the hydrographic basin of the [[Uaupes]] river.

There are other tribes who are part of the [[Nadahup languages|Hupd'äh language family]] in the (Rio) Negro (black) river region. Each tribe has its own language and practically lives in the jungle, on the small streams. The [[Yohup]] people, for example, live on the streams on the right hand margin of the Tiquié river (Castanho, Samaúma, Cunuri and Ira streams), are fewer in number than the Hupda and barely have contact with them. The [[Kakwa people]] live on the streams on the left hand side of the Papuri River, in [[Colombia]], and maintain sporadic contact with the Hupda who live on the streams flowing into the Papuri River. Still in Colombia, are the [[Nukak]] people on the Guaviri and Enírida rivers. The [[Dâw people]], commonly known as the ''Kama'', are the smallest tribe and are currently about 100 in number; they live around [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]] although their traditional home is on the streams flowing into the Curicuriari River. Finally the [[Nadëb]], in permanent contact with the merchants (regatões), live by extracting natural jungle products on the Jurubaxi and Uneuixi rivers that flow into the right hand side of the Rio Negro river.

The word ''Maku'' is not Hup. It probably comes from the [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] ([[Baniwa language|Baniwa]]) and means "he who does not have language" or "he who does not have our language". (''ma-aku''; ''ma''=personal pronoun, ''aku''=language). J. Hill (1986) uses the name "Wakuénai" to designate the five northern dialects of Arawak and translates "Wakuénai" as "people who speak our language" (''wa-aku-nai''; ''wa''=ours, ''aku''=language, ''nai''=associative suffix). J. Hill differentiates the [[Kuripaco people|Kuripace]] and [[Baniwa people|Baniwa]] of Içana from the Maakunai {ma-ku-nai ma=personal pronoun aku=language nai=associative suffix =those who have no language} to designate other groups whose language the Hupda don’t understand. In this case, for Baniwa, the [[Tukanos]] would also be Maakunai. Judging based on this linguistic aspect, it is possible to confirm the hypothesis of [[Nimuendajú]] that the various groups known as the ''Maku'' were in the region, living on the banks of the river, before the arrival of the Arawak, from the North by way of the Cassiquiari channel, and the Tukanos, from the West. In reality, the term ''Maku'' is used inaccurately in the whole Rio Negro region, not only among the indigenous peoples but also among the caboclos ( those of mixed European and native origin) and it is being incorporated into the dialects of the inhabitants of São Gabriel. The semantic context of the term has always been associated with forest as opposed to the horticultural Indians like the Tukano and the Arawak. By reason of the geographical location of their villages, the Tukano have always been described as Indians-of-the-river while the Maku were described as Indians-of-the-forest.

==Relationships with other indigenous groups==
The Hupd'äh maintain complex and permanent historical relationships with the Tukano, [[Desana]], [[Tuyuka]], and [[Tariano people|Tariano]] Indians of the Uaupés, Tiquié, and Papuri rivers. This peculiar inter-ethnic relationship is part of the traditions of the peoples of this region, and its preservation would likely guarantee the cultural equilibrium of the peoples of the region. The relationship has already been described as [[symbiotic]], asymmetric and [[hierarchical]], or as an employer/employee relationship. The Tukanos justify their behavior through myths that tell of the origins of the tribes of the region. The Hupda, according to Tukano versions of the myths, were the last to come into world. Consequently, they are considered inferior, lowest on the hierarchy of intertribal relations in the Uaupés river basin and, because of this, must perform work deemed inferior, which only the lowest ranking clans in the hierarchy perform.

==Language==
{{main|Hupdë language}}
The Hupd'äh call the [[Tukano]] "sokw’ät-d’äh," which translates as [[toucan]]. They also refer to the Tukano as "wóh", "wóh-d’äh". These terms are used generically, with no distinction as to which linguistic group the other person belongs to. The words used by the Hupda to distinguish the other social groups with which they interact are "tëghõih-d’äh" for non-Indians and agents of the national society. Literally it means 'the sound of the burning fire wood' and is those who come from outside, the white men, coming from the East and owning many things. It has been suggested that the name is derived from the sound of a firearm. For [[missionary|missionaries]] they use the term "páíd’äh", distinguishing them as a separate social category to the tëghõih-d’äh.

The term "mer'ah" means "from the east" or "from below" contrasting "pör'ah," which means "from the west" or "from above" always using the river as a reference.  These terms are also used in relation to directions of travel. An individual will always explain the location of individual groups in this way, without ever defining a boundary, be it linguistic or territorial, as all Hupda consider themselves brothers and part of the same Hup world. They may even say that others talk differently. It may simply be a case of different accent or a few words of the vocabulary.

==Culture and nuclear family==
The Hupd'äh, as hunters, know the forest intimately and do not work in [[agriculture]], which their neighbors do extensively. They are scattered amongst more than 20 clans. Each of the clans shares a common ancestry and a set of rituals specific to each clan. [[Marriage]]s are made between clans, as a marriage inside a clan is considered to be incestuous. The married man can live, most commonly, in his father's local group or in his father-in-law's local group. And as all the clans native to the [[Alto Rio Negro]] area practice [[Dabucuri]] and celebrate [[Jurupari]], the Hupda maintain their own [[kapi-vaiyá]].

The hearth group, "kakah", is the smallest [[unit of production]] and consumption, and can be made up of a [[nuclear family]]; it may also include additional persons (mothers-in-law, orphaned nephews, widowed uncles) making it into an extended family. There is no ideal [[Group size measures|group size]], and numbers vary enormously between one local group and another. A hearth group is significantly autonomous, is generally the [[social unit]], which visits other local groups, and is the most mobile part of the local group. The general rule is that the hearth group be self-sufficient and, to that end, each hearth group generally contains two adults, a man and a woman, almost always married to each other. Two couples are never part of the same hearth group while the minimum number of people in a hearth group is two.

==Hayám - the local group==
The Hupda live in small villages. The local group is normally known as a "hayam" although there are in fact three other ways it may be named. These terms are related to the local geography:
# "-deh," which means "stream"
# "-nuh" (head), the source of the stream
# "-buk" indicates the group stays in a clearing

A local group is completely autonomous and, may join another group or split itself between two others. This may cause its transit around relations to be seriously modified from one year to the next. There is no fixed village or camp. The local group is described by reference to the sources of the streams on which it where they live for a particular period. Some groups may reside in one location for years and still give the impression that they are only there temporarily. The names given to these locations are the names of the small streams where they draw water.

These local groups ["hayám"] can contain from 15 to more than 50 people and generally each group comprises members of one or two clans.  Some villages with more than this number of inhabitants because of the work of missionaries. Each local group is made up of several hearth groups. These hearth groups are smallest unit of production and consumption, and are usually made up of a nuclear family and, in some cases, those who have joined it. The local groups were based at the sources of the small streams, tributaries to [[Papuri River|Papuri]], [[Japu]] and [[Tiquié]] rivers. The members of a local group wandered within a certain perimeter, always using as reference one of the streams; they did not however migrate beyond this specific  territory. When they leave the territories, for a predetermined length of time, it is to hunt or visit the villages of their in-laws. These visits are periodic and are important to the regeneration of the renewable resources of the area where the local groups have established their villages. Frequently a hearth group may, during the year, move from one local group to another and stay for long or short periods of time. In fact, these long visits to other villages are common, and someone is always visiting a group. The mobility of the Hupda is impressive for their knowledge of all the existing trails {tíw hup} and where each local group is based.

In each local group there is an elderly male member who is considered the leader. He generally knows the history of the ancestors of the clan. These men are not always the [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (''yo’òm ih''), also called captain (''capitão'') in the local Portuguese dialect, and who are, in many cases, chosen to deal with missionaries and other agents. The captains of the local groups are the intermediaries between the non-Indians and the Hupda world. Frequently they need to be able to interpret clearly, for the local group, the ideas and concepts of the missionaries and other agents of the national society who pass through the villages. The job is not easy.

==Lineage and clans==
The Hupda social groups are based on [[unilinear]] descent, with [[patrilinear]] clans, and dispersed in exogamic units. The term clan is being used to describe the basic unit of Hupda society. The Hupda clan does not have a very specific geographical area/location as is found with the Tukano clans. The clan is a grouping that gathers members with a common ancestor.

Within the concept of Hupda life and the dynamics of social interaction, the clan is of less importance than the local group as it is difficult to identify a local group with a specific clan. It is in the local group that the idea of brotherhood and a concept of territoriality is developed. The concept of territoriality is important to social interactions between the different local groups. The  geographic area inhabited by a local group indicates the sense of belonging to a local group but not to a clan. The dabucuri celebrations ("pä’") take place between local groups and not different clans. The clans interact as "yawám", those with a common ancestor, or "kót", those directly related to each other. Within the clans sharing a common ancestor a hierarchy exists form the most senior, "ó", to the most junior, "púy". In some larger clans, like for example the "Sokw’ätnohk’ödtëh" from the middle of the Tiquié river, there are several lines of patrilinear descent while all the members consider themselves descended from a common ancestor. These relationships cannot be illustrated in their genealogies by the members of the clans.

Each clan knows a specific set of ceremonies and stories and this knowledge is shared amongst all its members. The most important ceremony a clan has is the one that gives (transmits) its name. It is generally performed by the oldest male in the clan who has a direct familial relationship with the person receiving the name or by the father's father if he is still alive.. The ritual is generally called "bi’ìd - hàt" or name of ceremony. This is a naming ritual where the name of an ancestor is changed and is given to a newborn child. The name is used in everyday life and there is no secrecy about the "bi’ìd - hàt". Each clan has a set of five to seven proper names for each sex. These names are repeated and are given in the birth order of the ancestors. This is seen in fact as the newborn child being swapped for an ancestor. When the swap is made, the child becomes a member of the clan. The first-born son will be given his grandfather's name who in turn received it from his grandfather. The subsequent boys can be given the names of any younger brothers the grandfather had, in no particular order. The name, apart from legitimizing an individual as a member of a clan, defines the person's place in the hierarchy. Thus to have the "bi’ìd - hàt" is to belong to a clan. To have the name shows a right to, and a possibility of access to, all the knowledge specific to the clan as well as a set of privileges, be they social, economic or ritual. The bearer of a clan name must observe and honor all the responsibilities assigned to their clan.

There must be, in the region between the Papuri and Tiquié rivers, about 20 named clans. The clans are connected by a hierarchy and scattered across the area; there is no direct link between a clan and a territory. The hierarchy between the clans is not rigid, as can be seen amongst the Tukano. The process of splitting a clan takes place in response to reduced (natural) [[natural resource|resources]] in particular areas. The clan has no property but is associated with a specific area. For example, all the members of the "Dehpuhtèh" clan came from the East, they have even said they came from [[Belém do Pará]].

Marriages allowed within the classes of relatives include [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] [[cross cousins]]. The exogamic unit in the Hupda social structure is the clan, patrilinear and patrilocal for preference. The terminology of the kinship of the Hupda has five distinct generations, two above and two below a generation. All the terms of kinship refer to members of the family, real or fictive. The second generation (-2) does not distinguish between affinal and consanguine relatives. All the terms, except mother and father, refer to the real and fictive relative. The terms of kinship identify individuals according to each generation, gender, affinals and cosanguines. The most important kinship term used by the Hupda is the regulation of marriage. In other words, according to them, the preferred marriage is between fictive relatives, or in other words, bilateral cross cousins of the same generation.

==The role of the Uaupés river==
The [[Uaupés]] river, where it is principally the Tukano who are present, is where most of the outside resources are found, in exchange for work. These are commercial relationships. For the Hupda, this is where the illnesses and curses (of society) come from. The behavior of a Hupda in this environment is, almost always, one of total submission to any and all order. In this environment, where the two apparently contrary tribes interact, age is irrelevant, the setting is defined and dialogue is short and decorous on all parts. It is rare for Hupda to go to Tukano villages without being invited or contracted for a job. The reverse is not true. The Tukano go to Hupda villages whenever they feel like it, sometimes simply for a walk or to collect things such as cured meat or fish.  The relationships between the Hupda and a specific Tukano village are enduring if not permanent. It is an employment relationship and can be seen as a boss/employee relationship. These relationships can be individual or may include the whole hearth group. For this reason, the Hupda do not feel comfortable in the Tukano village and will not remain there any longer than they have to; they are also afraid of catching diseases. The Hupda perceive the land on the banks of the rivers as belonging to the Tukano and their existence is based around this assumption. The Hupda feel most at home and comfortable in the forests. It is where they feel safest from outside threats and find the resources to allow them to survive for long periods of time, without having to move to the banks of the river. In the clearings, where their houses are found, behavior is governed by a different set of rules. The clearing is the  special place for ceremonies and socializing with other Hupda.

The Hupda share the Uaupés river basin with its other inhabitants, as a common environment, living a lifestyle differentiated from others, in its adaptive form, by ideological factors. These ideological factors are dictated by an interpretation of the world, based on a [[mythological]] corpus, that assures them a specific role in social and inter-ethnic relations in a hierarchical system. Thus to characterize them simply as hunters, gatherers, nomads, or semi-nomads to differentiate them from other tribes in the region is only relevant at the first level of analysis, where differences between tribes are established, possibly, based on their individual technical-economic systems. In this model are contained the inter-ethnic relations and the use of the land amongst the human resources necessary for the organization of the land and forest resources, the impact of human activities upon these resources and, most importantly, the maintenance of a balance between the various peoples sharing the region.

==Cosmology==
The concept of illness amongst the Hupda is based on their perception of their presence on this world as defined by their view of the world and humanity. Their [[cosmology]] has as a principal feature several worlds superimposed on each other. The terrestrial world [s’áh] is the one we live in our bodies [sáp] and that is found between two ends of a continuous plane. On the East side [mer’ah] is the "wedó ip mòy" (house of the father of the sun and moon) and at the (other) West [pör’ah] end is the "s’áh-tút" from where all the river waters flow and where the cold is found. The other worlds are stacked vertically beneath the earth and the waters (s’àk e o pèj mòy - world of the umari and the spirits) and above them, towards the infinite sky (K’èg-teh mòy, wero-meh mòy wã-mòy / world of K’èg-teh - principal hero and creator of earthly beings, of the stars, of the birds and the vultures). These worlds are all inhabited by [[Mythology|mythological]] beings in the forms of animals, fruits and energies. The terrestrial world is stuck, or as they say tied, by cipó [yúb-tut], an energy whose main source is the coca plant[pu’uk].

The body [sáp] of the Hupda and of all humans is in contrast to all the "live" beings, which can be classified as "spirits" and which manifest in non-corporeal forms. The Hupda tell that in their bodies there is a point where an energy called "hawäg" is found. They are unanimous in their assertion that it is found in their chests at the same height as their hearts. In fact, the Hupda word for [[heart]] is the same, "hawäg". As people are born, and when they receive their clan names, they become stronger and thus begins the process of the growth of "hawäg," which is initially small and grows at the same time as the physical body.

When [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] [pu’úk], [[tobacco]] [hunt], [[paricá]] [seâheak] or [[Kapi (plant)|kapi]] are used the "hawäg" can be perceived. The [[shaman]] [bi’id-ih] uses these plants to dream and thus diagnose the patient's illness. The shaman is the only one, who in a trance or dream, perceives the patient's "hawäg". A Hupda, as well as having a body [sáp] with a "hawäg" (point of vital energy), also has a "b’atub’," which could be referred to as their shadow or personal [[ghost]]. This entity is generally associated with negative and malevolent influences. This term is also confused with "[[devil]]" due to the [[Catholic]] influence. The bodies of animal merely have the "hawäg", they don’t have "b’atub’ ". Some say that dogs may have "b’atub’ " as they can see others in the dark.

If life and consciousness arise as a result of the development of the "hawäg", [[death]] occurs when a person loses their (own) "hawäg". After death the body (sáp) is buried and the "hawäg" goes to the spirit world, which is close to the world of "K’èg-teâh" and other heroes, up in the sky. The ghost (b’atöb’) remains on earth for a while, afterwards going to a world found beneath the waters form which it can, every so often, reappear on the earth. The material parts of the "b’atöb’" are in all the body's secretions such as urine, sweat, catarrh, blood and faeces. It is by way of the orifices from which these secretions emanate that illnesses may enter (the body).

Illness and health are therefore the result of the balance between the two forces in the body, the "hawäg" and the "b’atub’". Each initiate knows the ceremonies for the protection and strengthening of the "hawäg". All the curing ceremonies [bi’in dóhoité] invoke the forces of the forest to strengthen the "hawäg" and reduce the influence of the ghosts upon the "hawäg". If a Hupda is ill or feels unwell, it is common to see them pointing initially at their heart, even if the illness is found somewhere else in their body. The illness shows then, in final analysis, a weakness of the "hawäg" and a dominion of the "b’atub’" over the physical body.

==Medical system==
The medical system of the Hupda is a shamanic system, both in the way it refers to health and illness and in the way illness is treated. It is mediated by people, usually men, initiates and possessors of 'keys' that allow them access to various worlds in search of understanding for the events occurring on earth (s’ah). Each clan has specific knowledge on a way of treating illness. According to the Hupda, everything that happens on this world (or plane) has already happened in some form in the other worlds in the past (myths). As a result, everything has a meaning and these meanings can be found in the stories of "K’èg-teh".

Illnesses can be classified as follows:
* Those that lead to death, the most serious and deadly ones - these are caused by [[Incantation|enchantments]], whose origins are hard to find, caused by other people
* Those caused by prepared [[poisons]] that have been mixed into the food and drink&amp;mdash;these can be cured as long as the source (where it came from and who sent it) is known
* Illnesses arising from the forest, river or caused by the [[spirit]]s&amp;mdash;for this type of illness cures can be found which are given by means of ceremony (bi’id)

The term "bi’id" covers a set of [[ritual]]s that range from the most basic blessing to the most complex magic. All the healing practices are done by means of the word. The term "Bi’in" ("sopro") is translated as '[[breath]]' or 'blow' alluding to the way in which the shaman recites the formulas, in a susurration of words with a "cuia" (gourd made from the fruit of [[Lagenaria vulgaris]]) near his mouth. In the local Portuguese dialect the term "sopro" is associated with this practice. Generally the point is to reinforce the "hawäg," which is sited where the heart is, and to diminish the power of the "b’atub’" over the "sáp". This work can take hours. The patient must observe a special diet to get the desired effect. The diets generally involve abstaining from cooked meats, salt and peppers. Another common abstention, almost always required, is that of not touching menstruating women and of sexual abstinence for a prescribed period. The patient must generally remain lying down for the majority of this period.[Renato Athias]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32318">'''Indonesian philosophy''' is a generic designation for the tradition of abstract speculation held by the people who inhabit the region now known as [[Indonesia]]. Indonesian philosophy is expressed in the living languages found in Indonesia (approximately 587 languages) and its national language [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], comprising many diverse schools of thought with influences from Eastern and Western origins, and indigenous philosophical themes.

The term ''Indonesian philosophy'' originates from the title of a book written by [[M. Nasroen]],&lt;ref&gt;Professor emeritus, of Philosophy at [[University of Indonesia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he traced philosophical elements found in Indonesian culture.  Since then, the term has been popular and inspired many later writers like Sunoto, Parmono, and Jakob Sumardjo. Sunoto began the nation's first philosophy department at [[Gajah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta]].

Sunoto, Parmona, and Sumardjo each defined the word ''Indonesian philosophy'' differently. Without clearly defining the word, M. Nasroen argued that Indonesian philosophy was neither Western nor Eastern.  He pointed to core Indonesian concepts and practices such as ''mupakat, pantun-pantun, [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]], hukum [[adat]], [[gotong-royong]]'', and ''kekeluargaan'' (Nasroen 1967:14, 24, 25, 33, and 38). Sunoto (1987:ii) also embraced a culturalist notion of Indonesian philosophy, calling it "the cultural richness of our own nation…contained in our own culture." Similarly, Parmono defined it as "thought or reflections…which are bound in" adat "as well as ethnic culture" (Parmono 1985:iii). Sumardjo wrote that the "philosophy of Indonesian people has never been conceived of. Their philosophical conceptions must be sought after and found out of what they have done. "  He added, "Indonesian philosophy lies in their daily-life behavior and factual result of their activities. The philosophy of Indonesian people lies within their ''pepatah-petitih, adat ''houses'', adat ''ceremonies and rites, old myths, in their dress ornaments, their dances, the music they play, in their weapons, their social system, and so on" (Sumardjo 2003:113).

The writers above understand Indonesian philosophy as a part of [[culture]] and do not make a contrast between philosophy and [[cultural studies]] or [[anthropology]].  The Indonesian language initially had no word for philosophy as an entity separated from [[theology]], art, and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not any of the other [[Languages of Indonesia|several hundred local languages]] possess an abstract idea of philosophy has not yet been established.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Indonesians have a generic word ''budaya'' or ''kebudayaan'', which describes the totality of the manifestations of the life of a society. Philosophy, science, theology, [[religion]], [[art]] and [[technology]] are at once manifestations of a society’s life, which are included in the meaning of the word ''budaya''. Indonesians usually use the word ''budayawan'' for their [[philosophers]] (Alisjahbana 1977:6-7). Accordingly, to them, the scope of Indonesian philosophy only comprised those original notions of Indonesian cultural richness. This is understood by  Ferry Hidayat,&lt;ref&gt;Lecturer at Universitas Pembangunan Nasional 'Veteran' Jakarta&lt;/ref&gt; as "the poverty of the scope." If Indonesian philosophy only comprised those original ethnic philosophies, it would be very limited. Like other scholars, Ferry widens the scope of Indonesian philosophy so as to include the adapted and "indigenized" philosophy as influenced by foreign philosophical traditions. This article employs the latter definition.

==Schools of thought==
There are seven schools of thought developing in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Ferry Hidayat, ''Pengantar Menuju Filsafat Indonesia'', 2005, unpublished paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  The categorization of schools is first based on the originality that a certain school contains (like "ethnic school"), secondly based on the influence of great world philosophies that a particular school absorbs and adapts to Indonesian philosophy (such as "Chinese school," "Indian school," "Islamic school," "Christian school," and "Western school"), and lastly based on a historical chronology (such as "the post-Soeharto school'). The following is a sketch of the Indonesian schools of thought and their main philosophers.

===Ethnic school===

This school takes Indonesian ethnic philosophies as its source of inspiration. Its assumption is mythologies, legends, folklores, the way an ethnic group builds its house and holds its ceremonies, literature it keeps, the epics the ethnic group writes, all bases foundation of its philosophy. This 'philosophy' cannot change; it remains the same, from the beginning to the end of the world, and it is also 'the Good'. It guides every member of the group to the origin of group creation on earth (in Javanese, ''sangkan'') and the ''telos'' of the life the group reaches to (in Javanese, ''paran''), so the member cannot go astray.

This school preserves Indonesian ethnic philosophies which are original, since the philosophies had been hold tight by ethnic members before they were encountered with later foreign philosophical traditions.

Most of the school’s proponents assume that today’s Indonesian people are in the position of being blind to their original values. Jakob Sumardjo, for instance, argued that most of today’s Indonesians ''…forget to preserve their original values'' and ''…forgetting the past, forgetting the origin, they are like amnesiac people...'' who ''…ignore their own national history…'' (Sumardjo 2003:23, 25). Consequently, they are ‘alienated’; estranged from ‘their mother cultures’ (Sumardjo 2003:53). The failure of Indonesian educational policy, to Jakob, is brought by this ‘blindness’ to Indonesian original culture (Sumardjo 2003:58). Therefore, the necessary task of this school of philosophy is to seek after, recall and revitalize the ethnic original values, since the values are ‘mothers’ (''lokalitas ialah ibu manusia'') and people are ‘fathers’ of existence (''balita ialah bapak manusia'') (Sumardjo 2003:22).

The following are some philosophical notions which this school advocates:

====Adat====

For this school of thought, ''[[adat]]'' plays very important role. ''Adat'' is the main inspiration for ethnic philosophers, as it is the intellectual legacy which belongs to a particular ethnic group. ''Adat'' is inherited from an ethnic's forefathers to later generations of the ethnic group. Indonesians believe that ''adat'' is not a human creation, but the spirits and supernatural powers ruling the community. This ''adat'' is very different from what Englishmen call ''tradition'', ''custom'' or ''convention'' today. Its meaning is not simply wider, but more particularly goes far deeper. It includes everything Englishmen call ''law'' nowadays; and it goes much further than law in determining the needs and the actions of individuals and the community. It ordains the ceremonies of marriage, birth and death, the times and the methods for sowing rice, building a house, praying for rain, and many other things. Economics, politics, philosophy and art all come within its sphere. Indeed, from one point of view, ''adat'' is simply a social expression of the community religion, in as much as it is not a human creation, and in its exercise men are still constantly watched over by the spirits and supernatural powers ruling community. Because the ''adat'' which regulates the entire life of the community is dominated by spirits and supernatural powers, that communal life is inevitably static and deeply conservative. Its roots lay in the obscurity of the past, when the ancestors laid down the adat once and for all, or as [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people say: ''It doesn't crack with the heat or rot in the rain.'' In such an environment the word 'old' has a special significance, denoting something venerable, sacred, powerful and full of wisdom (Alisjahbana 1961:13-14).

====Myths of Origin====

Among intellectual legacy which the ''adat'' inherited to Indonesians is a set of myths of origin of creation. The myths are sung (and only recently written) in important ceremonies held on special occasions of birth, death, marriage, [[harvest festival]], and so on. The Dayak-Benuaq tribe of East [[Kalimantan]], for example, has a set of myths known as ''Temputn''. This ''Temputn'' tells myths of origin of universe, world and sky, human and animal creation, plants, water, fire, rain, death, ancestor origin, and some social taboos (Michael Hopes &amp; Karaakng 1997:1-19). According to ''Temputn'', far before humankind had been created, they were two families who inhabited the sky. Of the raw materials used by the ‘sky families’ to create the earth and the sky, finally the first human came into being. He was married to a woman, who was his own daughter, and had many children, some of whom later became ''seniangs''—group of spirits who live in the heavens, responsible for the policing of the most important moral affairs and they are in charge of ''adat'' guardians. The ''seniangs'' can inflict punishments (curses) on the ‘incestuous’. Their children were not only the human race and spirits, but also animals like wildcats of the forest, bears, ancestor of deer, the pigs of the forest, forefathers of monkey, ancestor of bees, snakes, and many others (Michael Hopes &amp; Karaakng 1997:29-41).

====''Pantun''====

''[[Pantun]]'' is original kind of poem created by Indonesians. It is a four-line poem that consists of two parts; the first two lines are called as ''sampiran'' and the second two lines as ''isi''. The ''sampiran'' always provides an analogy for the ''isi'', and it symbolizes a [[macrocosm]] for a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]. As the [[mythology]] went, humankind was made of materials from which 'the sky families' created the sky and the world, and ''pantun'' reflects this belief very clearly. The ''sampiran'' represents 'the sky and the world', while the ''isi'' signifies 'the humankind'. Both between ''sampiran'' and ''isi'' there must be [[logical correspondence]], as they both are symbols of harmony of the nature and humankind (Sumardjo 2002:296-324). Below is an example of ''pantun'':

:''Tujuh hari dalam hutan'' || ''Air tak minum, nasi tak makan'' || ''Sehari tiada pandang Tuan'' || ''Rasanya susut tubuh di badan''

The ''sampiran'' which says (in English) ''seven days in deep forest || no drinking water, no eating rice'' must have logical correspondence with the ''isi'', which says ''no meeting you Sir in a day || feels like the body becomes thinner and thinner''. The ''sampiran'' says about the suffering one can feel when he is in a deep forest in seven days without drink and food, while the ''isi'' says about the suffering one can feel when he does not meet in a day the lover he really longs or yearns for. The ''sampiran'', therefore, analogizes the ''isi'' in the suffering of the longing.

====Pepatah====

A ''[[Pepatah]]'' is like a ''[[proverb]]'' or ''[[saying]]''.  These sayings are part of the ''adat'' in the sense that they give guidance and instruction to every member of a particular ethnic group to treat others well in the community. It is believed that ''pepatah'' were created by ancestors inspired by supernatural powers and spirits (Nasroen 1967:27). The wording of a ''pepatah'' is taken from nature, which means that all guidance for people's life must be derived from [[the laws of nature]]. Nature has its own laws and it is people's obligation to submit to it. As the [[myth of origin]] told, humans were parts of nature; they were made of it, so they had to live in total submission to its laws (Nasroen 1967:30).

Here are some examples of ''pepatah'': ''dalam laut dapat diduga, dalam hati siapa tahu'' (we can assume the depth of the sea, but we cannot assume what is in people's hearts) teaches very clearly about the danger of assuming what is in people's hearts, for this knowledge can only be obtained by asking the people concerned, not by assuming; ''ada gula, ada semut'' (where there is sugar, there is ant) teaches [[the law of causality]], in which an effect can be inferred if there is a cause; ''malu bertanya, sesat di jalan'' (if you are shy of asking questions, you will get lost in your way) teaches the importance of asking questions in the process of seeking after [[knowledge]], and the like.

====''Adat'' Social Structure====

It has been stated above that not only did ''adat'' include tradition, custom, convention and law, but it also included a kind of social structure. The [[social structure]] bound by a common ''adat'' was typified by small-scale communities of people in villages or of nomads wandering over a specific area. These communities were rather like miniature [[democratic republic]]s. Their headmen were elected from the descendants of the oldest branch of the tribe, and they saw to the needs and interests of the community, assisted by a council of elders. Really important decisions were taken by collective deliberations, called as ''mupakat''. Naturally in a democracy of this type, in which a premium is put on unanimity of opinions, the position of the ''balai'' was extremely important. This was the building in which meetings and discussions were held. We can think them as the centers of social life within these small communities (Alisjahbana 1961:14-15).

The principal duty of the village government was to administer the ''adat'' handed down from generation to generation, and to settle any disputes that might arise. However, the actual scope of administration within this indigenous Indonesian society was very broad if one compared it to the scope of governmental activity today. it included the regulation of marriage ceremonies, crop cultivation, distribution of the harvest, division of legacies, etc., quite apart from attending to the daily needs of the community (Alisjahbana 1961:15).

===Chinese school===
The native Indonesian [[philosophers]] held their original philosophies until the coming of Chinese migrants between 1122-222 BC who introduced [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] to them (Larope 1986:4). These two foreign philosophies and the local ones then diffused and penetrated; so mixing that they could not be separated again (SarDesai 1989:9-13). One of the remnants of this diffused philosophy, which is still practiced by all Indonesians to date, is the Confucian notion of ''hsiao'' (Pinyin: 'Xiao', 孝; Indonesian: ''menghormati orangtua''). The notion teaches that people must respect their parents above other things. They should prioritize their parents before giving priority to others.

The Chinese school seems to have been primarily developed by a few Indonesians of Chinese ethnicity. Nevertheless, its contribution to the Indonesian philosophical tradition is very significant. [[Sun Yat-senism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Neo-maoism]] are important philosophies that were widespread all over Indonesia in the early 20th century, together with the great growth of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) (Suryadinata 1990:15).

The main philosophers of this school, among others, are: [[Tjoe Bou San]], [[Kwee Hing Tjiat]], [[Liem Koen Hian]], [[Kwee Kek Beng]], and [[Tan Ling Djie]].

===Indian school===
The diffusion of philosophies continued with the coming of [[Hindu]] Brahmans and Buddhists of Indian origin in 322 BC-700 AD. They introduced Hinduist and Buddhist cultures to the native culture, and the native Indonesian culture reciprocated by synthesizing the two into a combined version, known as [[Tantrayana]]. This is clearly shown in the building of [[Borobudur]] Temple by Sailendra Dynasty in 800-850 A.D (SarDesai, 1989:44-47). [[Rabindranath Tagore]], an Indian philosopher who visited Borobudur for the first time, described the temple as un-Indian, since the relics engraved on it represented workers dressed in native Javanese style. He also observed that the native Javanese dances inspired by Indian epics were not similar to Indian dances, although those dances of the two countries had a common source in the same Indian well.

[[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism]]—two philosophies that contradict each other in [[India]]—as well as Javanese local philosophy were reconciled in Indonesia by the genius of [[Sambhara Suryawarana]], [[Mpu Prapanca]], and [[Mpu Tantular]].

===Islamic school===
The 10-century process of Indianization of Indonesia was rivaled by the coming of Persian [[Sufism]], and Sufism had begun to take root in the native philosophical discourse since the early 15th century onwards. The widespread practice of Sufism was encouraged by the massive founding of Islamic [[monarchies|kingdoms]] and [[sultanate]]s in Indonesia (Nasr 1991:262). Kings and [[sultan]]s like [[Sunan Giri]], [[Sunan Gunungjati]], [[Sunan Kudus]], Sultan [[Trenggono]] of Demak, [[Pakubuwana II]], [[Pakubuwana IV]], Sultan [[Ageng Tirtayasa]] of Banten, Sultan [[Alauddin Riayat Syah]], [[Engku Hajji Muda Raja Abdallah]] to Raja Muhammad Yusuf are ''sufi-kings''; they learned Sufism from eminent Sufi teachers (Perpustakaan Nasional 2001:12-39).

Sufism in [[Indonesia]] can be divided into two schools: Ghazalism and Ibn Arabism. Ghazalism takes its main inspiration from [[Al-Ghazali]]’s teachings, whereas Ibn Arabism from [[Ibn Arabi]]’s doctrines. Sufis from the Al-Ghazali line include [[Nuruddin Al-Raniri]], [[Abdurrauf Al-Singkeli]], [[Abd al-Shamad Al-Palimbangi]], [[Syekh Yusuf Makassar]], while the Ibn Arabi line includes [[Hamzah Al-Fansuri]], [[Al-Sumatrani]], [[Syekh Siti Jenar]], and so on (Nasr 1991:282-287).

Arabian [[Wahhabism]] was also adopted by King [[Pakubuwono IV]] and [[Tuanku Imam Bonjol]], who eradicated Sufism and encouraged [[Qur'an]] teachings instead (Hamka 1971:62-64).

When [[Modern Islamic philosophy|Islamic modernism]], whose program was to synthesize Islamic teachings and Western [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy, begun by [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Jamal al-din Al-Afghani]] in Egypt in the end of the 19th century, prevailed in all the Islamic world, [[Moslems]] in Indonesia also adopted and adapted [[modernism]]. This is clearly shown in the works of [[Syaikh Ahmad Khatib]], [[Syaikh Thaher Djalaluddin]], [[Abdul Karim Amrullah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]], [[Mohammad Natsir]], [[Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto]], [[Agus Salim]], [[Misbach]], and so forth (Noor 1996:37).

===Western school===
When the Dutch colonial government in Indonesia implemented ‘The Ethical Politics’ (''Politik Etis'') in the early 20th century, Dutch-style educational institutions mushroomed and were opened for native children of noble, feudal classes who wanted to work in colonial institutions. The Dutch-speaking schools taught [[Western philosophy]], among which [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was taught to Indonesian natives, much later than its 5th century emergence in Europe (Larope 1986:236-238). The alumni of these schools mostly continued their studies in European universities. They soon gathered as a newly emerging elite in Indonesia who comprised the first generation of European-style [[intelligentsia]], and they later advocated Western philosophy instead of their original ethnic philosophies.

Western philosophical traditions inspired most of modern Indonesian socio-political institutions. Indonesia’s [[republic]] government, its [[constitution]] and distribution of power, its political parties and its long-term national economic planning were carried out on a Western model. Even its ideology of ''Pancasila'' (unlike what Soekarno always boasted or what Soeharto later established) was inspired by Western ideals of humanism, social-democracy, and the national socialism of the Nazi party, as clearly shown in the oration of BPUPKI members, a preparatory council of Indonesian independence in August, 1945 (Risalah Sidang 1995:10-79). This leads to a conclusion that ‘Modern Indonesia’ is founded on a Western blueprint.

Even though the elite embraced Western philosophy wholeheartedly, they still felt the need to adapt the philosophy to concrete, contemporary Indonesian situations. For example, [[Soekarno]], who adapted Western democracy to still-feudalistic people, came up with his famous ''Guided Democracy'' (Soekarno 1963:376). [[D.N. Aidit]] and [[Tan Malaka]] adapted [[Marxism]]-[[Leninism]] to Indonesian situations (Aidit 1964:i-iv; Malaka 2000:45-56) and [[Sutan Syahrir]] adapted [[Social Democracy]] to the Indonesian context (Rae 1993:46).

===Christian school===
Together with the Western [[capitalism|capitalist]] search for new colonies in the [[East]], [[Christianity]] came to Indonesian merchants in the middle of the 15th century (Lubis 1990:78). First Portuguese merchants then Dutch capitalists spread [[Catholicism]] and [[Calvinism]] respectively. [[Francis Xavier]], the first Spanish Catholic preacher to go to Indonesia, translated ''Credo, Confession Generalis, Pater Noster, Ave Maria, Salve Regina'', and ''The Ten Commandments'' into Malay between 1546 and 1547, through which Catholicism was propagated among the native people (Lubis 1990:85). Catholic churches were established and Indonesian Catholics crowded, but soon they were expelled or forced to convert to Calvinism by Dutch Calvinists who came to Indonesia around 1596. [[Dutch Reformed Church]]es were erected instead. Jan Pieterszoon Coen, one of the Governor-Generals of VOC in 1618, was a good example of devout Calvinist. He put all Calvinist preachers (in Dutch, ''Ziekentroosters'') under his control (Lubis 1990:99).

Portuguese-style Catholic schools and Dutch-style Calvinist educational institutions were opened for Indonesian natives. Not only did they teach [[theology]] to the natives, but also [[Christian philosophy]]. One school later became thousands. There have been (and still are) private Catholic and [[Protestant]] universities in which Christian philosophy is taught in Indonesia nowadays. Missionaries and preachers of the West who got master's degrees in philosophy from European universities came to lecture at Indonesian Christian universities (Hiorth 1987:4). From those universities graduated many who later mastered Christian philosophy, such as [[Nico Syukur Dister]], [[J.B. Banawiratma]], [[Robert J. Hardawiryana]], [[JB.. Mangunwijaya]], [[T.H. Sumartana]], and so forth.

===Post-Soeharto philosophy===
This school is mainly on the scene to criticize Soeharto’s socio-political policy during his presidency from 1966 to 1998. Its concern is [[political philosophy]] whose main task is to seek alternatives to the corrupt regime. This school dared to challenge [[Soeharto]] after his silencing all philosophers by violence. Before this, there had been some who opposed Soeharto in 1970’s, but they were brutally assaulted in the incidents ''Peristiwa ITB [[Bandung]] 1973'' and ''[[Peristiwa Malari]] 1974''. Since then, philosophy could only be practiced in absentia or in secret; under the New Order, philosophy was repressed and reduced to ideas which officially supported the state. Philosophical [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] was effectively banned. With regard to philosophy, Soeharto's era can be called an era of "philosophical opium," in which all kinds of philosophy from every branch and school could live but could not be practiced in reality.  Philosophy was pacified: reduced to a mere academic exercise and constrained in its content.  In its stead, Soeharto elevated [[Pancasila (politics)|pancasila]] as an official state ideology, one selectively tailored to meet the needs of the New Order (Hidayat 2004:49-55).

Despite repression, some intellectuals began to publicly dissent and philosophize.  They were known as post-Soeharto philosophers, among which are:  [[Sri Bintang Pamungkas]], [[Budiman Sudjatmiko]], [[Muchtar Pakpahan]], [[Sri Edi Swasono]], and [[Pius Lustrilanang]].

'''James Frey''' (born September 12, 1969) is an American writer and businessman.

His two first books, ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' (2003) and ''[[My Friend Leonard]]'' (2005), were best-sellers marketed as memoirs. Large parts of the stories were later found to be exaggerated or [[Literary hoax|fabricated]], sparking a media controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/15/usa.world ''"The man who rewrote his life"''], Laura Barton, September 15, 2006, ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; His 2008 novel ''[[Bright Shiny Morning]]'' was also a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE2DE1639F932A35755C0A96E9C8B63 |title=Bright Shiny Morning-NY Times Bestseller |work=The New York Times |date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frey is the founder and CEO of Full Fathom Five. A [[transmedia]] production company, FFF is responsible for the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] adventure/science fiction series "The [[Lorien Legacies]]" of seven books written by Frey and others, under the collective pen name '''Pittacus Lore'''. Frey's first book of the series, ''[[I Am Number Four]]'' (2010), was made into a feature film by [[DreamWorks Studios]].

==Career==
Frey is a [[Denison University]] alumnus, a history major from the class of 1992.

Frey wrote the screenplays to the films ''[[Kissing a Fool]]'' and ''Sugar: The Fall of the West''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168197/ ''Sugar: The Fall of the West'' at the] [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which he directed as well. Both were produced in 1998.

[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published ''A Million Little Pieces'' in April 2003, promoted as Frey's memoir of drug addiction, crime and eventual journey to sobriety. Reception was positive, with [[Amazon.com]] editors selecting it as their favorite book of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&amp;pwb=1&amp;ean=9780307276902 Barnes &amp; Noble.com – Books: A Million Little Pieces, by James Frey, Paperback&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''A Million Little Pieces''  became a bestseller, ultimately selling in excess of 4.5&amp;nbsp;million copies. In September 2005, [[Oprah Winfrey]] chose ''A Million Little Pieces'' for her monthly book club.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Frey wrote ''[[My Friend Leonard]]'', which continued where ''A Million Little Pieces'' left off. The book centered on the father-son relationship which Frey formed with his friend Leonard, from the [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden]] addiction treatment program. ''My Friend Leonard'' was published in June 2005 by [[Riverhead Books|Riverhead]], and became a bestseller.

In late 2007, Frey signed a new three-book, seven-figure deal with [[Harper Collins]] to release his novel, ''[[Bright Shiny Morning]]'', which was published May 13, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20750314/ |title='Million Little Pieces' author writing a novel |agency=Associated Press |date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/business/media/13book.html?ref=arts |first=Rich |last=Motoko |title=Book Deal for Writer Who Fabricated Parts of Memoir |date=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bright Shiny Morning]]'' appeared on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]], and has received mixed reviews. The ''&lt;nowiki&gt;New York Times'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s Janet Maslin, who had previously been one of Frey's detractors, gave the book a rave review.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/books/12masl.html Maslin, Janet; "Little Pieces of Los Angeles, Done His Way "; nytimes.com; May 12, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' review described the novel as "banal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bright-Shiny-Morning-James-Frey/dp/0061573132 |title=listing for Bright Shiny Morning |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also received highly polarized reviews by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.  The first [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] states: "Nothing in this book should be considered accurate or reliable."

In 2011,  ''[[The Final Testament of the Holy Bible]]'', depicted as "the last book of the Bible" was released on [[Good Friday]], April 22, 2011. He self-published e-editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oldenburg |first=Ann |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/03/james-frey-pens-modern-day-holy-bible-/1 |title=James Frey pens modern-day 'Holy Bible' |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-professed [[atheist]], his work has reflected his attempt to write about a god that he "might actually believe in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIBndlXsluY|title=James Frey on Religion, God and Death|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2010, the ''[[New York Post]]'''s "[[Page Six]]" gossip column reported that Frey has teamed up with executive producers [[Mark Wahlberg]] and Steve Levinson to write the pilot for a one-hour drama for [[HBO]] that will focus on a behind-the-scenes look into the porn industry in Los Angeles. Frey described the show as "a sprawling epic about the porn business in LA. We're going to tell the type of stories no one else has told before, and go places no one has gone before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/internet_thorn_in_porn_world_54TrISW6vpH14ctWEwQkBK | work=New York Post | title=HBO working on a show about porn business | date=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Frey published "A Moving Story", chronicling the workplace organizing of a New York [[moving company]], on the website Libcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/library/moving-story |title=A Moving Story |publisher=Libcom |date=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=October 2014}}

On October 7, 2014, ''[[Endgame: The Calling]]'', the first book in a trilogy of novellas by Frey and Nils Johnson-Shelton, was published by [[HarperCollins]]. It was turned into an [[augmented reality]] game by [[Google]]'s [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic Labs]] and [[20th Century Fox]] bought the movie rights &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/01/new-details-on-james-freys-mammoth-book-movie-endgame-deal-at-fox-664715/|title=New Details On James Frey’s Mammoth Book-Movie ‘Endgame’ Deal At Fox|publisher=Deadline|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Controversy==

===A Million Little Pieces===

====Media skepticism====
On January 8, 2006, ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'' website published an article called "A Million Little Lies: Exposing James Frey's Fiction Addiction", alleging that Frey fabricated large parts of his memoirs, including details about his criminal record.&lt;ref name="thesmokinggun.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Time Waster |url= http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies |title=A Million Little Lies – January 8, 2006 |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One incident in the book that came under particular scrutiny was a 1986 train-automobile collision in [[St. Joseph Charter Township, Michigan|St. Joseph Township, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies?page=0,4 A Million Little Lies – January 8, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website alleged that Frey had never been incarcerated and that he greatly exaggerated the circumstances of a key arrest detailed in the memoir: hitting a police officer with his car, while high on [[Crack cocaine|crack]], which led to a violent melee with multiple officers and an 87-day jail sentence. In the police report that ''TSG'' uncovered, Frey was held at a police station for no more than five hours before posting a bond of a few hundred dollars for some minor offenses. The arresting officer, according to ''TSG'', recalled Frey as having been polite and cooperative.

The book's hardcover ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]) and paperback ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Anchor Books]]) publishers initially stood by Frey, but examination of the evidence caused the publishers to alter their stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burroughs |first=Augusten |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385507755 |title=A Million Little Pieces (9780385507752): James Frey: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the publishers decided to include a publisher's note and an author's note from Frey as disclaimers to be included in future publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheelah |last=Kolhatkar |url=http://observer.com/20060123/20060123_Sheelah_Kolhatkar_pageone_coverstory2.asp |title=The Awful Untruth |work=New York Observer |date=January 23, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202095612/http://www.observer.com/20060123/20060123_Sheelah_Kolhatkar_pageone_coverstory2.asp |archivedate=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' had questioned Frey's claims as early as 2003. Frey responded by saying, "I've never denied I've altered small details."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/462/story/175790.html |title=Is Minnesota memoir a million fabrications? |newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune |date=January 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113042037/http://www.startribune.com/462/story/175790.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2003 interview, Frey claimed that his publisher had fact-checked his first book.&lt;ref name="thesmokinggun.com"/&gt;

On January 11, 2006, Frey appeared with his mother on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on [[CNN]]. He defended his work while claiming that all memoirs alter minor details for literary effect. Frey consistently referred to the reality of his addiction, which he said was the principal point of his work.  Oprah Winfrey called in at the end of the show defending the essence of Frey's book and the inspiration it provided to her viewers, but said she relied on the publisher to assess the book's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200510/tows_past_20051026.jhtml |title=Oprah Winfrey's Official Website – Live Your Best Life |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show====
On January 26, 2006, as more accusations against the book continued to surface, Winfrey invited Frey onto her show. She wanted to hear from him directly whether he had lied to her or "simply" embellished minor details, as he had told [[Larry King]]. Frey admitted to several of the allegations against him. He acknowledged that ''The Smoking Gun'' had been accurate when the website reported that Frey had only spent a few hours in jail rather than the 87 days Frey claimed in his memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_102.jhtml |title=Oprah Winfrey's Official Website – Live Your Best Life |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winrey|first1=Oprah|title=Oprah's Questions for James Frey|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Questions-for-James|website=Oprah.com|publisher=Oprah Winfrey|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher [[Nan Talese]] to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir. Talese admitted that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

Several columnists weighed in on the controversy, including [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref name="truthiness"&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | title =How Oprahness trumped truthiness |work=The New York Times | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]],&lt;ref name="bunk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowd |first=Maureen |title=Oprah's Bunk Club |work=The New York Times |date=January 8, 2006 |url=http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140931/http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html |archivedate=September 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html |publisher=CNN | accessdate=May 5, 2010 | work= Larry King Live | title=Interview With Oprah Winfrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s [[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Richard Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.

====Aftermath====
On January 31, 2006, it was announced that Frey had been dropped by his literary manager, Kassie Evashevski of [[Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]], over matters of trust. In an interview with ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Evashevski said that she had "never personally seen a media frenzy like this regarding a book before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lea|first1=Richard|title=Frey loses support of agent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/01/news.richardlea|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=February 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

On February 1, 2006, [[Random House]] published Frey's note to the reader which was subsequently included in later editions of the book. In the note, Frey apologized for fabricating portions of his book.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On February 24, 2006, Frey's publicist revealed that [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] imprint [[Riverhead Books|Riverhead]] had dropped out of a two-book, seven-figure deal with Frey. Riverhead had previously published Frey's bestselling 2005 book, ''[[My Friend Leonard]]''.

On September 12, 2006, Frey and publisher Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, whereby readers who felt that they had been defrauded by Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces'' would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers had to submit a proof of purchase such as pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hardcover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they had purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14715706/ |title=Frey, Publisher Settle Suits Over 'Pieces' |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2007, at a literary convention in Texas, Nan Talese verbally attacked Oprah for misrepresenting the purpose of the interview on January 26, 2006. Just before air time, both Talese and Frey were told the topic of the show had been changed to "The James Frey Controversy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648140,00.html?cnn=yes |title=Oprah vs. James Frey: The Sequel |accessdate=July 30, 2007 | date=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] published a story about a judgment in favor of readers who felt deceived by Frey's claims of ''A Million Little Pieces'' being a memoir. Although the publisher, Random House, had set aside $2.35&amp;nbsp;million for lawsuits, only 1,729 readers came forward to receive a refund for the book. The refund offer was extended to anyone who had purchased the book prior to Frey's disclosing the falsehoods therein. Chicago lawyer Larry D. Drury, defending the plaintiff, received approximately $1.3&amp;nbsp;million for legal fees, distribution of the legal notice, and charitable donations to three charities, while total claimants' refunds issued to readers only came to $27,348. The publisher also agreed to provide a disclosure at the beginning of the book, citing the somewhat fictitious nature of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Fox News Channel |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307837,00.html |title=Judge Approves 'A Million Little Pieces' Refund Settlement for Disgruntled Readers |accessdate=November 3, 2007 | date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Winfrey had called Frey and apologized for the surprise topic change of the January 26, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/oprah-apologizes-for-slamming-author-james-frey/22495?nc |title=Oprah apologizes for slamming author James Frey |publisher=Yahoo! |agency=Reuters |date=May 13, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521204544/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/oprah-apologizes-for-slamming-author-james-frey/22495?nc |archivedate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made a televised apology in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-Apologizes-to-Author-James-Frey-Video Oprah Apologizes to James Frey], Oprah.com, May 17, 2011. Retrieved May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of Frey's ''Oprah'' appearance, ''[[South Park]]'' created a parody of the events with their character [[Towelie]], entitled "[[A Million Little Fibers]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Million-Little-Fibers-Towelie-ebook/dp/B01C6ZULKU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456741226&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+million+little+fiber&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full Fathom Five===
In 2009, Frey formed Full Fathom Five, a [[young adult novel]] publishing company that aimed to create highly commercial novels like ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]''. In November 2010, controversy arose when an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] student who had been in talks to create content for the company released her extremely limiting contract online. The contract allows Frey license to remove an author from a project at any time, does not require him to give the author credit for their work, and only pays a standard advance of $250. A [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] article entitled "James Frey's Fiction Factory" gave more details about the company, including information about the highly successful "[[Lorien Legacies]]" series, a collaboration between MFA student Jobie Hughes and Frey. The article details how Frey removed Hughes from the project, allegedly during a screaming match between the two authors. In the article, Frey is accused of abusing and using MFA students as cheap labor to churn out commercial young adult books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozes |first=Suzanne |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/69474/ |title=Inside Full Fathom Five, James Frey's Young-Adult-Novel Assembly Line |work=New York |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/11/read_the_brutal_contract_from.html |title=Read the Brutal Contract from James Frey's Fiction Factory – Daily Intel |work=New York |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11848">The '''Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation''' {{ref|JC}} is an American/[[Canada|Canadian]] based [[Standards Organization|Standards Developer Organization]] (SDO). The [[Joint Committee]] represents a coalition of major professional associations formed in 1975 to help improve the quality of standardized [[evaluation]]. The Committee has thus far published three sets of [[Technical standard|standards]] for evaluations. ''The Personnel Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition) {{ref|Personnel}} was published in 1988 and updated in 2008, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition) {{ref|Program}} was published in 1994 (the third edition of which is in draft form as of 2008), and ''The Student Evaluation Standards'' {{ref|Students}} was published in 2003.

The [[Joint Committee]] is a private [[nonprofit organization]].  It is accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]] {{ref|ANSI_Membership}} (ANSI). [[Technical standard|Standards]] approved by [[ANSI]] become [[American National Standard]]s {{ref|ANSI_Listing}}.  In addition to setting standards in evaluation, it also is involved in reviewing and updating its published standards (every five years); training policymakers, evaluators, and educators in the use of the standards; and serving as a clearinghouse on evaluation standards literature.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote [[educational evaluation]]s that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.

==The Personnel Evaluation Standards==
The second edition of the Personnel Evaluation Standards (2008) is based on knowledge about personnel evaluation gained from the professional literature and research/development since 1988.  In this edition, six new standards were added to the original 21 of the first edition.  The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation requires that personnel evaluations be ethical, fair, useful, feasible, and accurate.  The standards also provide special consideration to issues of diversity.

It is not the intent of these standards to design or promote specific systems of evaluation, rather to ensure that whatever system is in place provides a sound process most likely to produce the desired results.

The four attributes of sound educational evaluation practices are:

* The propriety standards require that evaluations be conducted legally, ethically, and with due regard for the welfare of evaluatees and clients involved in.  There are seven standards under this attribute which include service orientation, appropriate policies and procedures, access to evaluation information, interactions with evaluatees, comprehensive evaluation, conflict of interest, and legal viability.
* The utility standards are intended to guide evaluations so that they will be informative, timely, and influential.  There are six standards under this attribute which include constructive orientation, defined uses, evaluator qualifications, explicit criteria, functional reporting, and follow-up/professional development.
* The feasibility standards call for evaluation systems that are as easy to implement as possible, efficient in their use of time and resources, adequately funded, and viable from a number of other standpoints.  There are three standards under this attribute including practical procedures, political viability, and fiscal viability.
* The accuracy standards require that the obtained information be technically accurate and that conclusions be linked logically to the data.  There are eleven standards under this attribute including validity orientation, defined expectations, analysis of context, documented purposes and procedures, defensible information, systemic data control, bias identification and management, analysis of information, justified conclusions, and metaevaluation.

==The Program Evaluation Standards==
* The utility standards are intended to ensure that an evaluation will serve the information needs of intended users. The utility standards for program evaluation incorporate the following:&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;''Programme Policy and Procedures Manual: Programme Operations'', UNICEF, New York, Revised May 2003, pp.109-120.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Stakeholder Identification: the people involved in the evaluation and those who will be affected by the evaluation must be identified so that their needs can be addressed.
::* Evaluator Credibility: the people conducting the evaluation must be trustworthy and competent to perform the evaluation in order for the evaluation's findings to achieve maximum credibility and acceptance.
::* Information Scope and Selection: the collected information must be broadly selected so that it addresses pertinent questions about the program and is able to be responsive to the needs and interests of clients and other specified stakeholders.
::* Values Identification: the perspectives, procedures and rationale used to interpret the findings of the evaluation should be carefully described so that the bases for value judgments are clear.
::* Report Clarity: an evaluation report must precisely describe the program being evaluated, including its context, purposes, procedures and findings so that the essential information is provided and easy to understand.
::* Report Timelines and Dissemination: evaluation reports and any significant interim findings should be disseminated to intended users so that they may be used in a timely fashion. 
::* Evaluation Impact: the way an evaluation is planned, conducted and reported should encourage follow-through by stakeholders in order to increase the likelihood that the evaluation will be used.
* The feasibility standards are intended to ensure that an evaluation will be realistic, prudent, diplomatic, and frugal. The feasibility standards for program evaluation incorporate the following:&lt;ref name="UNICEF" /&gt;
::* Practical Procedures: evaluation procedures should be practical in order to keep disruption to a minimum while relevant and needed information is obtained.
::* Political Viability: whilst planning and conducting the evaluation one must anticipate the different positions of various interest groups so that their co-operation may be obtained. This will also allow one to avert or counteract any possible attempts by these groups to obstruct evaluation operations or to bias or misapply the evaluation's results.
::* Cost Effectiveness: a good evaluation should be efficient and produce information of sufficient value to justify the use of available resources.
* The propriety standards are intended to ensure that an evaluation will be conducted legally, ethically, and with due regard for the welfare of those involved in the evaluation, as well as those affected by its results. The propriety standards for program evaluation incorporate the following:&lt;ref name="UNICEF" /&gt;
::* Service Orientation
::* Formal Agreement
::* Rights of Human Subjects
::* Human Interactions
::* Complete and Fair Assessment
::* Disclosure of Findings
::* Conflict of Interest
::* Fiscal Responsibility
* The accuracy standards are intended to ensure that an evaluation will reveal and convey technically adequate information about the features that determine worth or merit of the program being evaluated. The accuracy standards for program evaluation incorporate the following:&lt;ref name="UNICEF" /&gt;
::* Program Documentation
::* Context Analysis
::* Described Purposes and Procedures
::* Defensible Information Sources
::* Valid Information
::* Reliable Information
::* Systematic Information
::* Analysis of Quantitative Information
::* Analysis of Qualitative Information
::* Justified Conclusions
::* Impartial Reporting
::* Meta-Evaluation

==The Student Evaluation Standards==
* The Propriety standards help ensure that student evaluations are conducted lawfully, ethically, and with regard to the rights of students and other persons affected by student evaluation. 
* The Utility standards promote the design and implementation of informative, timely, and useful student evaluations. 
* The Feasibility standards help ensure that student evaluations are practical; viable; cost-effective; and culturally, socially, and politically appropriate. 
* The Accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

==Sponsoring Organizations==
The Joint Committee includes sixteen Sponsoring Organizations that reflect a balance of primarily client practitioner and evaluation technical specialist perspectives. These organizations appoint and sponsor a member of the Joint Committee. Each Sponsoring Organization is kept informed of the work of the Joint Committee and is afforded an opportunity to contribute to the standard-setting process.

The 3rd Biennial was guided by the theme ''men &amp; animals''. 24 artists from 14 different countries were participating on a field work in [[Orkhon Valley]] and exhibition at UMA art gallery in Ulaanbaatar; curated by Vera Tollmann, texts and essay by [[Brian Holmes]] editor of [[documenta]] 13.

''Catching the Axis - Between the Sky and the Earth'', the forth edition of the Land Art Mongolia 360° seeks the treasure of knowledge behind this axis. Through artistic research and production, the biennial will explore diverse ways to find out, discuss, to question, to remember or to forget, to analyze, and to experience and to experiment the knowledge produced from the point of this axis. It proposes another perspective to perceive the life that surrounds us. Therefore, the biennial gives the opportunity to the artists to push back the urban realities behind and to position oneself at the steps of Mongolia to catch this axis.
The site of the forth Biennial LAM 2016 is located at Dariganga Sum, south east Gobi, the area of the sacred mountains Altain Owoo and Shiliin Bogd, Sukhbaatar Aimag in the south-east Gobi.

== Organization ==
'''MNG 360°''' (MNG 360° БАЙГАЛИЙН УРЛАГ МОНГОЛ) is an [[Ulaanbaatar]] based independent arts organization ([[NGO]]) with the purpose of raising awareness for issues as [[sustainability]], nomadic culture, ecological decentralization and [[democracy]] by  [[contemporary art]] as an impulse generator for [[civil society]] in Mongolia. Constituting the project '''Land Art Mongolia''' ('''LAM 360°''') is its main activity. LAM 360° focuses on [[Land Art]] as a form of spatial visualization of the relations between nature, culture, and social policies. It strongly promotes freedom of expression in joining people and institutions from all sectors of Mongolian society by meshing their respective backgrounds and perspectives through collaboration and networking actions of regional and global scope.

The '''Contemporary Art Institute''' Ulaanbaatar '''C.A.I. - UB''' unifis the body of several initiatives related to the organisation. The activities are complementing the Biennial throughout the year by a more local implementation of the general public and cultural circles in Mongolia. The Contemporary Art Institute UB hosts the LAM residencies, the public art program ARTpublic UB, the LAM Art Award and the constitution of the MOCA UB and the related art collection.

== Editions | participating artists ==
1st Biennial (2010) / 2nd Biennial (2012) /    3rd Biennial (2014) /      4th Biennial (2016)
Each edition of the Biennial is focused on specific curatorial issues. The theme of the first edition was art perspectives on sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/mongolei/de/events/44288&lt;/ref&gt; The second Biennial aimed at creating a dialog of art &amp; politics. The third edition of Land Art Mongolia / LAM 360°, in August 2014, was guided by the relationship of men and animals. Catching the Axis - Between the Sky and the Earth, the forth edition of the Land Art Mongolia 2016 focused on art and shamanistic practice.

{{About|childbirth|other uses|Lying in (disambiguation)}}
'''Lying-in''' is the term given to the European forms of [[postpartum confinement]], the traditional practice involving long [[bed rest]] after giving birth. The term and the practice it describes are old-fashioned or [[archaism|archaic]], but it used to be considered an essential component of the [[postpartum period]], even if there were no medical complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7129/pg7129-images.html The Prospective Mother: A Handbook for Women During Pregnancy], [[J. Morris Slemons]] 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1932 publication refers to lying-in as ranging from two weeks to two months.&lt;ref name="Nusche"&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/675 Lying in by Jan Nusche] quoting ''The Bride's Book — A Perpetual Guide for the Montreal Bride'', published in 1932&lt;/ref&gt;  It also does not suggest "Getting Up" (getting out of bed post-birth) for at least nine days and ideally for 20 days.&lt;ref name="Nusche"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenstad, Janelle Day, ''Lying-in Like a Countess: The Lisle Letters, the Cecil Family, and A Chaste Maid in Cheapside'', Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies - Volume 34, Number 2, Spring 2004, pp. 373-403&lt;/ref&gt; Care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law), or, for those who could afford it, by a temporary worker called the [[monthly nurse]]. These weeks ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. When lying-in was a more common term, it was used in the names of several [[maternity hospital]]s, for example the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] in London.

Women received congratulatory visits from friends and family during the period, and among many traditional customs around the world the ''[[desco da parto]]'' was a special form of painted tray presented to the mother in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]].  The many scenes painted on these trays show female visitors bringing presents, received by the mother in bed, while other women tend to the baby.  No fixed term of lying-in is recommended in Renaissance manuals on family life (unlike in some other cultures), but it appears from documentary records that the mother was rarely present at the [[baptism]], in Italian cities usually held within a week of the birth at the local [[parish church]], normally a few minutes' walk from any house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/renaissance-childbirth/ "Renaissance childbirth"], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In art, the immensely popular scene of the ''[[Nativity of Christ in art|Birth of Jesus]]'' technically shows the Virgin Mary, who reclines on a couch in most medieval examples, lying-in, but in famously un-ideal conditions.  More ideal images of lying-in in well-off households are represented in the subjects, also popular, of the ''[[Birth of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Birth of John the Baptist]]''.  These are generally given contemporary settings, and differ little from other images that are purely secular, especially those on ''desci da parto''.

The '''Mondialogo Engineering Award''' was established by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and [[UNESCO]] to encourage cooperation and dialogue between engineering people from different countries and cultures, working together across continents on a joint project activity. The award invites student engineers from universities around the world to apply for Award. It was supported by the World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([[WFEO]]), who promoted it to its national members and took part in the judging panel.
The scheme has closed with Daimler and UNESCO ending their partnership in 2010. It is not clear if an alternative sponsor or scheme will be created.

==Previous Rounds==

The first round of the competition 2005 ended with a symposium in Berlin while the second round in 2007 ended in Mumbai. In its first round, the Mondialogo Engineering Award brought over 1,700 young engineers from 79 countries together to work on engineering solutions tackling [[poverty]] and promoting [[sustainable development]] in all regions of the world. While in the second round 3200 students from 89 countries participated.

==Goals==

The Mondialogo Engineering Award invited engineering students in developing and developed countries to form international teams to create project proposals that address the [[Millennium Development Goals|United Nations Millennium Development]] to 1) eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and [[hunger]]; 2) achieve [[universal primary education]]; 3) promote [[gender equality]] and [[Empowerment|empower]] women; 4) reduce [[child mortality]]; 5) improve [[maternal health]]; 6) combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental [[sustainability]]; and 8) develop global partnerships for development. Mondialogo encourages proposals that will improve the [[quality of life]] in the developing world, particularly [[Poverty reduction|poverty eradication]] and the promotion of sustainable development.

==Procedure==

International [[Project team|Project Teams]] eligible to apply for the Mondialogo Engineering Award consisted of two student groups from two higher education establishments, with one group from a developing country and the other from a developed country. The Mondialogo Internet Portal www.mondialogo.org acts as a contact centre for groups to meet each other, aiming to function as a virtual office for inter-group communications. Teams had until April 2009 to develop and design their project proposals. An international jury then assessed the entries and decide on the awarding, which formed part of a festive ceremony in latter 2009. Key factors in the assessment are sustainability, technical quality, feasibility of the project proposals and the quality of the intercultural cooperation between the teams.

==Criteria==

The following criteria were taken into consideration when assessing the final project proposals:
Quality of project – quality of analysis and understanding of a relevant problem, quality and innovativeness of project idea and design, and quality of presentation of the project proposal 
Degree to which the project addresses the Millennium Development Goals, especially poverty eradication and sustainable social development 
Relevance of project proposal in mitigating negative impacts of [[climate change]] 
Feasibility of the proposed project – demonstration of the practicality of implementing the proposed project, and benefit to local community; 
Quality of Dialogue – level of communication within project teams and student groups, balanced involvement of both student groups

==Awards==

Ten Mondialogo Engineering Awards of €20,000 went to teams with the top project proposals, with an Honourable Mention and €5,000 earmarked for twenty more teams. Representatives of the 30 finalist project teams (consisting of one member of each student group two members of each International Project Team) were invited to the Mondialogo Engineering Award Symposium. At the Symposium, each team made a presentation of their project proposal, followed by an Award Ceremony where the Mondialogo Engineering Awards and Honourable Mentions were announced. All participating teams that submit project proposals received an official certificate in recognition of their achievements and their commitment to the worldwide exchange of knowledge and intercultural dialogue. Additionally, Daimler and UNESCO publicized the 30 winning projects.

==Eligibility to participate==

Students from all fields of engineering were eligible to register for the Mondialogo Engineering Award. All members of the two (or more) student groups must have been officially registered as students at universities, technical colleges or similar institutions through to May 2009. Employees of commercial institutions and companies or students above 35 years of age were not eligible to participate.

The study of 'music and emotion' seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]]. It is a branch of [[music psychology]] with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], [[music theory]] and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]].
{{TOC limit}}

==Philosophical approaches==

===Appearance emotionalism ===
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]] and [[Jerrold Levinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/music/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2005). "Artistic Expression and the Hard Case of Pure Music", in: Kieran, M. (Ed.), ''Contemporary Debates in Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art'': 179-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding [[dynamic structure]] and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of [[music psychology]].  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.

===The process theory===
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music, and Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 310-13&lt;/ref&gt; assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.

==Conveying emotion through music==
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development.&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=W. J.|title=The development of music perception and cognition|journal=Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Reading|year=2002|pages=481–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref name="Susino and Schubert, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|author2=Schubert, S.|title=Cross-cultural anger communication in music: Towards a stereotype theory of emotion in music|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2017|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |pages=755–788 |chapter=Chapter 27: Cross-cultural similarities and differences | chapterurl=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/me2/uploads/publications/27-Juslin__Sloboda-Ch-27.pdf|isbn=978-0-19-960496-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists']] approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. [[Emotivism|Emotivists]] argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherer|first=K. R.|author2=Zentner, M. R.|title=Emotional effects of music: production rules|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=361–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=C.|title=Emotions and music: A reply to the cognitivists|journal=The Journal of Aesthestics and Art Criticism|year=1989|volume=47|pages=69–76|jstor=431994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:

:''Experienced Emotion'' = ''Structural features'' × ''Performance features'' × ''Listener features'' × ''Contextual features''

where:

:''Structural features'' = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
:''Performance features'' = Performer skill × Performer state
:''Listener features'' = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
:''Contextual features'' = Location × Event&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[amplitude]], and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as [[melody]], [[tempo]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Chapter16" /&gt; There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrielle |first=A. |last2=Stromboli |first2=E. |title=The influence of musical structure on emotional expression |journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research |year=2001 |pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, [[tempo]] is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as [[mode (music)|mode]], [[loudness]], and [[melody]], also influence the emotional valence of the piece.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structural Feature !! Definition !! Associated Emotions
|-
| Tempo || The speed or pace of a musical piece || Fast tempo:happiness, excitement, anger. Slow tempo: sadness, serenity.
|-
| Mode || The type of scale || Major tonality: happiness, joy. Minor tonality: sadness.
|-
| Loudness || The physical strength and amplitude of a sound || Intensity, power, or anger
|-

|-
| Rhythm || The regularly recurring pattern or beat of a song || Smooth/consistent rhythm: happiness, peace. Rough/irregular rhythm: amusement, uneasiness. Varied rhythm: joy.
|}

===Performance features===
Performance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

=== Listener features ===
Listener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Contextual features===
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====Conflicting cues====
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|author2=Schellenburg, E. G. |author3=Schimmack, U. |title=Feelings and perceptions of happiness and sadness induced by music: Similarities, differences, and mixed emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=47–56|doi=10.1037/a0016873}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;  The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. T.|author2=Stastny, B. J.|title=It's a bittersweet symphony: Simultaneously mixed emotional responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Emotion|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0024081|volume=11|pages=1469–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

===Specific listener features===

====Development====
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloboda|first=J. A.|author2=Juslin, P. N.|title=Psychological perspectives on music and emotion|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone.&lt;ref name=Nawrot&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nawrot|first=E. S.|title=The Perception of Emotional Expression in Music: Evidence from Infants, Children and Adults|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=75–92|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mote|first=Jasmine|title=The effects of tempo and familiarity on children's affective interpretation of music.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=618–622|doi=10.1037/a0022573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Terwogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=TERWOGT|first=MARK MEERUM|author2=VAN GRINSVEN, FLORA|title=RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS IN MUSIC BY CHILDREN AND ADULTS|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 December 1988|volume=67|issue=3|pages=697–698|doi=10.2466/pms.1988.67.3.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

=====''Infants''=====
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that the motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant.&lt;ref name=Trehub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first+Sandra E.|author2=Nakata, Takayuki|title=Emotion and music in infancy|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2001|volume=SPEC ISSUE, 2001-2002|pages=37–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation.&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.&lt;ref name=Vist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vist|first=Torill|title=Music Experience in Early Childhood: Potential for Emotion Knowledge?|journal=International Journal of Early Childhood|date=16 November 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1007/s13158-011-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Pre-school children''=====
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt; However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music.&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robazza&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBAZZA|first=CLAUDIO |author2=MACALUSO, CRISTINA |author3=D'URSO, VALENTINA|title=EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO MUSIC BY GENDER, AGE, AND EXPERTISE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 October 1994|volume=79|issue=2|pages=939–944|doi=10.2466/pms.1994.79.2.939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Elementary-age children''=====
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;
Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt; All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;

====Personality effects====
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training.&lt;ref name=Ladinig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E. Glenn|title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schellenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|author2=Mankarious, Monika|title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski Measure"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=J. K.|author2=Eerola, T.|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings&lt;ref name=Ladinig /&gt;  as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores,&lt;ref name=Schellenberg /&gt; other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kratus|first=J.|title=A Developmental Study of Children's Interpretation of Emotion in Music|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 1993|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1177/030573569302100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions.&lt;ref name="Policy Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth|journal=Pediatrics|date=19 October 2009|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1488–1494|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2145|pmid=19841124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus /&gt;  Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.

==Eliciting emotion through music==
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s).&lt;ref name=Garrido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrido|first=S.|author2=E. Shubert|title=Individual differences in the enjoyment of negative emotion in music: a literature review and experiment|journal=Music Perception|year=2011|volume=28|pages=279–295|doi=10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;

===Responses to elicited emotion===
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====''Basic emotions''====
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece.&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.

In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;  However, [[Emotivism|emotivists]] purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [[cognitive reappraisal]], to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement.&lt;ref name="Van den Tol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den TOl|first=A.J.M.|author2=Edwards, J.|title=Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad. |journal=Psychology of Music|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|author2=Peynircioglu, Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2010|volume=27|pages=177–182|jstor=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.177|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.

====''Emotional memories and actions''====
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Tol, A. J. M., &amp;  Ritchie, T. D.(book-chapter in press). Emotion memory and music: A critical review and recommendations for future research.Music, Memory and Autobiography. (Eds: Professor Strollo Maria Rosaria and Dr. Romano Alessandra).&lt;/ref&gt; Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;  Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A. J. M. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 440–465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A.

Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model====

Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Juslin &amp; Daniel V ̈astfj ̈all, 'Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, 2008; 559-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.

''Brain Stem Reflex'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'

''Rhythmic Entrainment'':&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, P. (2011). Music and Emotion: seven questions, seven answers. In I. Deliège, J. Davidson, J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Music and the Mind: Essays in Honour of John Sloboda'' (pp.113-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'

''Evaluative Conditioning'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'

''Emotional Contagion'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'

''Visual Imagery'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'

''Episodic memory'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.'&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. B. (1978). The psychology of music. Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Musical expectancy'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'

====Musical expectancy====

With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = P | last2 = Van Tilburg | first2 = W. A. P. | last3 = Van | first3 =  | last4 = den Tol | first4 = A. J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Meaning in music: Deviations from expectation in music polarize in-group and out-group attitudes | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  155–172| doi = 10.1002/ejsp.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA====

In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juslin | first1 = P. N. | year = 2013 | title = From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: towards a unified theory of musical emotions | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

==Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions==

===Evidence for emotion in music===
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Self-report''====
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vieillard|first=S.|author2=Peretz, I. |author3=Gosselin, N. |author4=Khalfa, S. |title=Happy, sad, scary, and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=4|pages=720–752|doi=10.1080/02699930701503567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt;  Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt; It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Physiological responses''====
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;   Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody.&lt;ref name=Chapter19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsson|first=A.|title=Emotion in strong experiences with music|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=431–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Expressive behavior''====
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial [[electromyography]] (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Strength of effects===
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;

====''Conveyed more than elicited''====
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;  Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.

====''Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited''====
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.&lt;ref name=Kallenin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallenin|first=K|author2=Ravaja, N.|title=Emotion perceived and emotion felt: Same and different|journal=Musicae Scientaie|year=2006|volume=10|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/102986490601000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elicited more than conveyed''====
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt; 
Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Emery|title=Locus of emotion: The effect of task order and age on emotion perceived and emotion felt in response to music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=4|pages=344–368|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zentner|first=Marcel|author2=Grandjean, Didier |author3=Scherer, Klaus R. |title=Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=494–521|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.8.4.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a therapeutic tool==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keen MSocSc | first1 = Alexander W. | year = 2005 | title = Using Music as a Therapy Tool to Motivate Troubled Adolescents | url = | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 39 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–373 | doi = 10.1300/J010v39n03_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Felicity A. | last2 = Gleadhill | first2 = Libby M. | last3 = Dingle | first3 = Genevieve A. | year = 2007 | title = Music therapy and emotional exploration: Exposing substance abuse clients to the experiences of non-drug-induced emotions | url = | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 321–330 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child.&lt;ref name=Robb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robb|first=Sheri L.|title=The effect of therapeutic music interventions on the behavior of hospitalized children in isolation: Developing a contextual support model of music therapy|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118–146|doi=10.1093/jmt/37.2.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = Pam | year = 2009 | title = Music - shelter for the frazzled mind?". | url = | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1018–1020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Pambansang Komisyon para sa Kultura at mga Sining}}, {{lang-ceb|Nasodnong Komisyon alang sa Budaya ug mga Arte}}), is the official government agency for culture in the Philippines. It is the overall policy making body, coordinating, and grants giving agency for the preservation, development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture; an executing agency for the policies it formulates; and task to administering the National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) -- fund exclusively for the implementation of culture and arts programs and projects.

==History==

The successful overthrow of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] administration in 1986 inspired the different sectors of society to rally behind the new government towards the restoration of democracy. In March 12, 1986, the Alliance of Artists for the Creation of a Ministry of Culture (AACMC) drafted and adopted a proposal for the establishment of a Ministry of Culture. The group cited the inability of the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports to devote time and attention to cultural planning due to the gargantuan task of addressing the problems of the [[Education in the Philippines|educational system]]. 

	President [[Corazon Aquino]] responded by issuing Executive Order 118 on January 30, 1987 which established the Presidential Commission on Culture and the Arts (PCCA). It was a diminutive agency compared to the proposal of AACMC but the said order was cognizant of the existence of specialized cultural agencies and that these should only be placed under the umbrella of one agency to coordinate their efforts. 

	In 1992, under the new constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7356 which institutionalized the establishment of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) replacing PCCA. This said law mandated the formulation of national cultural policies and programs according to the following principles:
:a)	pluralistic, fostering deep respect for the cultural identity of each locality, region or ethno-linguistic locality, as well as elements assimilated from other cultures through the natural process of acculturation;
:b)	democratic, encouraging and supporting the participation of the vast masses of our people in its programs and projects;
:c)	non-partisan, open to all people and institution, regardless of creed, affiliation, ideology, ethnic origin, age, gender or class, with no organized group or sector having monopoly of its services; and
:d)	liberative, having concern for the decolonization and emancipation of the Filipino psyche in order to ensure the full flowering of Filipino culture.&lt;ref&gt;Republic Act No. 7356, Sec.5, April 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the NCCA prompted the cultural agencies that were attached to it, by virtue of the same law, to review its existing mandates and programs to harmonize the delivery of cultural services. CCP, for its part, transformed itself to become the national coordinating center for the performing arts. It also sought to remove its “elitist” image by strengthening its outreach programs and developing partnerships with local arts councils.&lt;ref&gt;Sta. Maria, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of Commissioners==
As governed by RA 7356, The National Commission for Culture and the Arts is governed by a Board of Commissioners composed of 15 members, namely:

*Hon. [[Virgilio S. Almario]], NCCA Chairman (Concurrent Chairman, [[Commission on the Filipino Language|Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino]])
*Hon. Francis Joseph G. Escudero (Chairperson, Senate Committee on Education, Arts, and Culture)
*Hon. Ramon Durano VI (Chairperson, House Committee on Basic Education and Culture)
*Hon. Alberto T. Muyot, Commissioner (Undersecretary for Legal and Legislative Affairs, [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]]) 
*Hon. Falconi V. Millar. Undersecretary, [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] 
*Hon. Rene R. Escalante, Commissioner, (Chair, [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]])
*Hon. Jeremy R. Barns, Commissioner (Director IV, [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]])
*Hon. Cesar Gilbert Q. Adriano, Commissioner (Director IV, [[National Library of the Philippines|The National Library of the Philippines]])
*Hon. Victorino Mapa Manalo, Commissioner (Executive Director, [[National Archives of the Philippines]])
*Hon. Aresenio J. Lizaso, Commissioner (President, [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]])
*Hon. Harold Ll. Rentoria, OSA, Commissioner (Head, Subcommission on Cultural Heritage)
*Hon. Teddy Co, Commissioner (Head, Subcommission on the Arts)
*Hon. Orlando B. Magno, Commissioner (Head, Subcommission on Cultural Dissemination)
*Hon. Alphonsus Tesoro, Commissioner (Head, Subcommission on Cultural Communities and Traditional Arts)
*Hon. Rico S. Pableo, Jr. (Executive Director, National Commission for Culture and the Arts)

== Activities ==
It is also responsible for the annual celebration of the National Arts Month (February), UNESCO-ITI World Theatre Week (March 21-27), National Heritage Month (May), National Dance Week (Fourth Week of April), National Literature Month (April), Linggo ng Musikang Pilipino (Last Week of July), Indigenous Peoples Month (October), Museums and Galleries Month (October), and Library and Information Services Month (November).

==Logo==
The NCCA logo is the ''Alab ng Haraya'' (The Flame of Imagination), which symbolizes the spring of Filipino art and culture. It is composed of two basic elements – the fire and the censer. The fire is a stylized character "ka" of the Philippine indigenous script [[Baybayin]], that stands for kadakilaan or greatness. The fire represents the highest level of imagination and emanates from a three-tiered censer. The three tiers stand for organization, economic support, and an orientation rooted on a thorough grasp of tradition and history, which the NCCA provides. It is done in gold to symbolize the immense wealth of Philippine culture.

==Agung==
The agung is a knobbed metal gong of the Philippines used in various communal rituals. Suspended in the air by rope or metal chains, the musical instrument is also employed by some indigenous groups as a means to announce community events, and as an indicator of the passage of time.

Agung, the official newsletter of the NCCA is published on a bimonthly basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/downloads/agung/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentro Rizal==
In celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of [[Jose Rizal]], The National Commission for Culture and the Arts formally established the Philippine’s very first Sentro Rizal at the NCCA Building in Intramuros, Manila on June 28, 2011. Sentro Rizal was recognized by virtue of Section 42 of Republic Act 10066 known as the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 which specifies a center “ whose main purpose is the promotion of Philippine arts, culture and language throughout the world.”

Moreover, Section 43 of the same law, states that the SR “shall be a repository, inter alia, of materials on Philippine arts, culture and language: books, digital video discs, compact discs, films, magazines, artworks, tourism promotion materials, information materials, etc. that shall be made available to the public, both Filipino and foreign”. SR shall also organize cultural programs and activities for Filipinos, especially for children overseas, to promote appreciation and understanding of Philippine culture and the arts.

The purpose of Sentrol Rizal is to educate overseas Filipinos about the culture and arts of the Philippines. Since May 2016, 18 Sentro Rizal offices around the world have been established.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/sentro-rizal-3/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Commission is responsible for bestowing significant awards reflecting Filipino culture and the arts. These awards are the [[National Artists of the Philippines|Orden ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining]] (Order of National Artists), [[National Living Treasures Award (Philippines)|Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan]] (National Living Treasures Award), Gawad Alab ng Haraya (Alab ng Haraya Awards), Dangal ng Haraya (Achievement Award), [[Ani ng Dangal]] (Harvest of Honors), and the Philippine Heritage Awards.

*Orden ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining (Order of National Artists) is the highest national recognition given to Filipino individuals who have made significant contributions to the development of Philippine arts; namely, Music, Dance, Theater, Visual Arts, Literature, Film, Broadcast Arts, and Architecture and Allied Arts. The order is jointly administered by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) and conferred by the President of the Philippines upon recommendation by both institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/national-artists-of-the-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasures Award) was institutionalized through Republic Act No. 7355. The NCCA, through the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan Committee and an Ad Hoc Panel of Experts, conducts the search for the finest traditional artists of the land, adopts a program that will ensure the transfer of their skills to others and undertakes measures to promote a genuine appreciation of and instill pride among our people about the genius of the Manlilikha ng Bayan.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/gamaba/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gawad Alab ng Haraya (Alab ng Haraya Awards) honors outstanding achievements in the performing arts, cultural conservation, arts management, library and information services program, theater production, cultural journalism and documentation, and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/sentro-rizal-3/programs/organizational-awards/gawad-alab-ng-haraya-and-dangal-ng-haraya/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dangal ng Haraya (Achievement Award) is given to living Filipino artists, cultural workers and historians; artistic or cultural groups, historical societies, institutions, foundations and councils, to recognize their outstanding achievements in relevant fields that have made an impact and significant contribution to Philippine culture and arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/sentro-rizal-3/programs/organizational-awards/gawad-alab-ng-haraya-and-dangal-ng-haraya/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ani ng Dangal]] (Harvest of Honors) is a state recognition given by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts under the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. It is an annual event in the Philippines celebrated as a highlight and concluding rite of the Philippine Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ani ng Dangal]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}
*Philippine Heritage Awards is an annual conservation recognition program under which monetary prizes, awards, and citations will be given by the President of the Philippines, upon the recommendation of the NCCA, for special achievements and important contributions and services in the area of heritage preservation and conservation efforts. This is pursuant to Section 37 of Republic Act No. 10066 or the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/philippine-heritage-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Culture==
In 2016, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and its partners in Congress have announced that they will seek to establish a Department of Culture. However, political factors hindered its initial pace. In January 2017, the filing of a bill which seeks to formally establish a holistic Department of Culture was completed. The bill is a priority legislation, which is expected to pass into law in late 2018 or early 2019. The Secretary of the proposed Department of Culture should be an expert in the field of culture and the arts, according to the bill.If the bill passes into law, the Department of Culture will be the only department in government where the head should possess the expertise of the field as a qualification for the job.&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/06/Senator-Legarda-proposes-establishment-of-culture-and-arts-department.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservationists are also proposing for the enactment of a bill where each city and town shall have a singular architectural and landscaping style, like the ordinance in the Heritage City of [[Vigan]], other international [[UNESCO]]-recognized cities, and some countries in [[Europe]]. Through this, a new renaissance of Filipino architecture and landscaping arts 'shall be inevitable'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/162946-ncca-intangible-heritage-department-culture-virgilio-almario&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">'''Polymedia''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] notion that was introduced by  [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and Mirca Madianou&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Daniel and Madianou, M. (2012). Migration and New Media: Transnational Families and Polymedia. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the way most people today use a wide variety of [[Media (communication)|communication media]]. They claim that as individual communication acts are no longer dictated by access and cost, people are likely to be judged on why they selected one particular media rather than others, for example in breaking up a relationship.

Through [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]] on transnational familial communication, particularly between mothers and their children, Madianou and Miller found [[mediated communication]] does not take place over a single technology but by choosing among and commingling a variety of media technologies. According to Mirca Madianou and Daniel Miller, rather than relying on technological determinism “the situation of polymedia is one in which the media are mediated by the relationship as well as the other way around.”&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Daniel and Madianou, M. (2012). Migration and New Media: Transnational Families and Polymedia. London: Routledge, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding on the idea of polymedia, communication scholars Herbig, Herrmann, and Tyma extended the concept, not only as a social and technological practice, but as an important entry point for discussion in a “polymediated age.”  As they note, “The ‘poly’ in polymediation not only signifies the many forms that media take, but the many different interactions we can have with them.”&lt;ref name="Tyma_xx"&gt;Tyma, A, Herrmann, A. F., and Herbig, A. (2015). Introduction: The Beginnings: #WeNeedaWord. In Herbig, A., Herrmann, A. F., &amp; Tyma, A. W. (Eds). (2015). Beyond new media: Discourse and critique in a polymediated age. Lanham, MD:  Lexington Books, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also suggest that polymediation “is both the process and product resulting from media producers—who can be everyone and anyone with access—existing within a converged media state” that “moves beyond media convergence alone, by examining the simultaneous processes and outcomes of convergence and fragmentation" and "Since individuals can act as producers, audiences, and critics, the term polymediation can be utilized as a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb.”&lt;ref name="Tyma_xx"/&gt;

Similarly, according to Calka, polymediation has definitive characteristics: ubiquity, shape-shifting authorship, simultaneous fragmenting and merging of identity, and division/communality.&lt;ref&gt;Calka, Michelle (2015). Polymediation: The Relationship Between Self and Media. In Herbig, A., Herrmann, A. F., &amp; Tyma, A. W. (Eds). (2015). Beyond new media: Discourse and critique in a polymediated age. Lanham, MD:  Lexington Books, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/identity/13-523-future-identities-changing-identities-report.pdf Foresight], p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes polymedia as the way individuals configure a particular combination of media in their communication as an aspect of contemporary identity.

[[Image:Medway Poets 2003.jpg|thumb|Members of [[The Medway Poets]] in 2003: [[Bill Lewis]], [[Sexton Ming]], Robert Earl and [[Billy Childish]].]]
'''Punk literature''' (also called '''punk lit''' and, rarely, '''punklit''') is [[literature]] related to the [[punk subculture]]. The attitude and ideologies of [[punk rock]] gave rise to distinctive characteristics in the writing it manifested. It has influenced the [[transgressional fiction]] literary genre, the [[cyberpunk]] genre and their derivatives.

== Journalism==
{{further|underground press|punk zine}}
The punk rock subculture has had its own underground press in the form of punk zines, which are punk-related print magazines produced independently and distributed on a small scale. Many regional punk scenes have had at least one punk zine, which features news, gossip, social commentary, music reviews and interviews with punk rock bands. Notable punk zines include ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'', ''[[Punk Planet]]'', ''[[Cometbus]]'', ''[[Girl Germs]]'', ''[[Kill Your Pet Puppy]]'', ''[[J.D.s]]'', ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', ''[[Absolutely Zippo]]'', ''Suburban Rebels''  and ''[[Punk Magazine]]''. Notable punk journalists and magazine contributors include [[Mykel Board]], [[John Holmstrom]], [[Robert Eggplant]] and [[Aaron Cometbus]].

== Poetry ==
[[File:Patti Smith performing at Primavera Sound Festival, Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright|Punk poet Patti Smith performing at Primavera Sound Festival, Barcelona.]]

[[File:JohnCooperClarke1979profile.jpg|thumb|upright|Punk poet John Cooper Clarke in 1979.]]
Many punk poets are also musicians, including [[Richard Hell]], [[Jim Carroll]], [[Patti Smith]], [[John Cooper Clarke]], [[Nick Toczek]], [[Raegan Butcher]] and [[Attila the Stockbroker]]. Carroll's autobiographical works are among the first-known examples of punk literature. [[The Medway Poets]], an [[England|English]] punk poetry performance group founded in 1979, included punk musician [[Billy Childish]]. They are credited with influencing [[Tracey Emin]], who was associated with them as a teenager. Members of the Medway Poets later formed the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] art group. [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]'s description of a Medway Poets performance highlights its difference from a traditional poetry reading:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Bill Lewis]] jumped on a chair, threw his arms wide (at least once hitting his head on the ceiling) and pretended he was Jesus. Billy sprayed his poems over anyone too close to him and drank whisky excessively. Miriam told the world about her vagina.

== Fiction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The punk subculture has greatly influenced the [[cyberpunk]] [[literary genre]] and its various derivatives. [[Punk zines]] have spawned a considerable amount of punk-oriented fiction, some of which has made an impact outside of punk circles. Many of the major works of [[Kathy Acker]] reflect themes of punk literature, most notably ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]''. [[Daphne Gottlieb]]'s poetic works are similar in motif. The novelist and screenwriter [[Diablo Cody]] has self-identified as "punk" in the past. ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'' is a comic with a plot involving the [[Los Angeles]] punk scene. Jack O'Donnell, the protagonist in Ben MacNamara's 2004 ''Fire Work'' embodies many of the qualities of the punk ethos.

{{Reading}}

'''Reading education''' is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text. Schoolchildren not capable of reading competently by the end of third grade can face obstacles to success in education. The third grade marks a crucial point in reading because students start to encounter broader variety of texts in their fourth grade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|title=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|website=www.centerforpubliceducation.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the [[United States]] began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies. However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameskim/publications/research-and-reading-wars-0|title=Research and the reading wars|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Competencies for proficient reading ==

Proficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the [[language]] in which the text is written, and the ability to recognize and process printed text. Each of these competencies is likewise dependent on lower level skills and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/overview.html |author1=Hoover, Wesley A. |author2=Gough, Philip B. |title=Overview - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who readily understand spoken language and who are able to fluently and easily recognize printed words do not usually have difficulty with [[reading comprehension]]. However, students must be proficient in both competencies to read well; difficulty in either domain undermines the overall reading process. At the conclusion of reading, children should be able to retell the story in their own words including characters, setting, and the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/framework.pdf |author=Wren, Sebastian  |title=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading researchers define a skilled reader as one who can understand written text as well as they can understand the same passage if spoken.

There is some debate as to whether print recognition requires the ability to perceive printed text and [[translate]] it into spoken language, or rather to [[translate]] printed text directly into meaningful symbolic models and relationships. The existence of speed reading, and its typically high comprehension rate would suggest that the translation into verbal form as an intermediate to understanding is not a prerequisite for effective reading comprehension. This aspect of reading is the crux of much of the reading debate.

The purpose of reading is to have access to the literature of a specific language. Reading materials have traditionally been chosen from literary texts that represent 'higher' forms of culture. According to many traditional approaches, the learner's aim is to study vocabulary items, grammar and sentence structures, with a concern for learning the syntax of these 'higher' cultures. These approaches assume that authentic reading material is limited to the work or experience of great authors.

== Instructional methods ==

A variety of different methods of teaching reading have been advocated in [[English-speaking countries]].
In the United States, the debate is often more political than objective.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=13 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties often divide into two camps which refuse to accept each other's terminology or frame of reference. Despite this both camps often incorporate aspects of the other's methods. Both camps accuse the other of causing failure to learn to read and write.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"/&gt; [[Phonics]] advocates assert that, to read a large vocabulary of words correctly and fluently requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the English language, particularly spelling-speech patterns.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=23, 24 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole Language  advocates assert that students do not need to be able to sound out words, but should look at unknown words and figure them out using context.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Research===
In 2000, the [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) issued a report based on a meta-analysis of published research on effective reading instruction. The report found varying evidence-based support for some common approaches to teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonemic awareness====
The NRP called phonemic awareness (PA) instruction "impressive":

:Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate phonemes in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with a variety of learners across a range of grade and age levels and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.
:
The report singles out PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters as highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

===Lexical reading===
Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involve acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[Whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

Historically, the two camps have been called [[Whole Language]] and [[Phonics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/Reading_Wars.html|title=Reading Wars: Phonics vs. Whole Language|last=Reyhner|first=Jon|website=jan.ucc.nau.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the Whole Language instructional method has also been referred to as "literature-based reading program" and "integrated language arts curriculum".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chall, Jeanne S. and Helen M. Popp, Teaching and Assessing Phonics: Why, What, When and How, Educators Publishing Service, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2007), the differing perspectives are frequently referred to as "balanced reading instruction" (Whole Language) and "scientifically-based reading instruction" (Phonics).&lt;ref&gt;Louisa Moats, Whole Language Lives On: The
Illusion of "Balanced" Reading Instruction, The Fordham Foundation, Oct 2000. Downloaded from http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/moats.pdf July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Whole Word ====

Whole word, also known as "Sight Word" and "Look and Say", teaches reading skills and strategies in the context of authentic literature.  Word recognition accuracy is considered less important than meaning accuracy; therefore, there is an emphasis on comprehension as the ultimate goal.

Students in this method memorize the appearance of words, or learn to recognize words by looking at the first and last letter from rigidly selected vocabularies in progressive texts (such as ''The [[Cat in the Hat]]''). Often preliminary results show children taught with this method have higher reading levels than children learning phonics, because they learn to automatically recognise a small selection of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later tests demonstrate that literacy development becomes stunted when hit with longer and more complex words later.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Sub-lexical reading===
Sub-lexical reading,&lt;ref name='Neural Representations' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sanabria Díaz G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, etal |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441–53 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19899646 |doi=10.1017/S1138741600001827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=NeuroImage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423–35 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of characters with sounds or by using [[Phonics]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with whole language methods.

==== Phonics ====
{{Main|Phonics}}
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27530006|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|first=Nila B.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1957|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nila B.|date=September 1957|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|jstor=27530006|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|volume=51|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonics refers to an instructional method for teaching children to read. The method teaches sounds to be associated with letters and combinations of letters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moats, Louisa |title=Spelling: development, disabilities, and instruction |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-912752-40-8 |oclc=33404834 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Phonics]]" is distinct from the [[linguistics]] terms "[[phoneme]]" and "[[phonetics]]", which refer to sounds and the study of sounds respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Varieties of phonics include:

* [[Whole language|Embedded phonics]] is an instructional approach where letter sounds are taught opportunistically, as the need arises and in meaningful contexts, such as the reading of a storybook. Embedded phonics is often associated with a whole language approach to teaching reading.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* [[Synthetic phonics]] and analytic phonics are different but popular methods of teaching phonics. Synthetic and analytic phonics approaches both generally involve explicit, carefully sequenced instruction that teach a large body of phonics patterns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
** [[Synthetic phonics]] emphasizes the one-to-one correspondences between [[phonemes]] and [[graphemes]]. In synthetic phonics programs students say the sounds for the graphemes they see and orally blend them together to produce a spoken word. In the context of phonics, the word "[[wikt:blend|blend]]" takes on a different meaning from its use in [[linguistics]].
** In analytic phonics, students often learn phonograms, the [[syllable rime|rime]] parts of words including the vowel and what follows it. Students are taught to generalize the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]] to multiple words. The phonogram ''-ail'' can be used to read ''fail, trail, mail, wail, sail'', and other words.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Samuel Orton|Orton phonography]], originally developed to teach brain-damaged adults to read, is a form of phonics instruction that blends synthetic and analytic components. Orton described 73 "phonograms", or letter combinations, and 23 rules for spelling and pronunciation which Orton claimed would allow the reader to correctly pronounce and spell all but 123 of the 13,000 most common English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eslhq.com/forums/esl-articles/teaching-reading-121/|title=Teaching of Reading - ESL Articles - eslHQ|website=www.eslhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronunciation guides ====
In contrast to phonics which teaches the pronunciation rules of English, a new technology [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] directly shows English words' pronunciation by adding diacritical marks on them. This solves the problem that pronunciation rules can often be confusing (for example, "ea" has a wide range of diverse pronunciations in "speak", "steak", "bread", "Korea", "reality", "create" and "ocean").

The pronunciation-guide approach has been proven very successful in reading education for languages with very complex orthography such as Chinese. [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] are systems of phonetic transcription for Mandarin Chinese used in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] respectively, and are printed above or next to Chinese characters in children's books, textbooks and newspapers as a pronunciation guide, and have enabled Chinese-speaking countries to achieve high literacy rates for one of the most difficult languages in the world.

=== Other instructional methods ===

===Guided Reading===
During guided reading teachers work with small groups of students. These are students with similar reading levels. Students will read with teachers in books at their personal reading level, not where the grade level is at. During this time the teachers will work with students to practice decoding, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension skills.

====Native reading====
Some methods of mix phonics and whole word. Native reading, for example, differs from both in that it emphasizes teaching reading beginning at a very early age, when the human brain is neurodevelopmentally most receptive to learning language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativereading.com/introduction.html Native Reading Chapter 1] by Timothy Kailing&lt;/ref&gt; Native readers learn to read as toddlers, starting at the same time they learn to speak, or very soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D. | title = Native Reading | publisher = Elliptical Research Books |year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-4348-4881-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading Workshop ====
Reading Workshop is based on the premise that readers need time to read and discuss their reading.  Readers need access to a wide variety of reading materials of their choice. Classrooms must acquire a wide variety of reading materials to accommodate this need. Readers need to respond to the text and demonstrate quality literate behaviors. There is not a script to follow but a frame work to guide instruction.  Students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences.  There is time for student collaboration and a time for engaged reading.&lt;ref name="Serafini"&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafini|first=Frank |url=http://www.frankserafini.com/MainPages/WorkshopHandouts.html |title=Workshop Handouts Serafini, F. (2008) |work= |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During reading workshop, the teacher models a whole-group strategy lesson and then gives students large blocks of time to read and to practice the strategy.  This practice can occur independently, with partners, or in small groups with a book or text chosen by the student.  The teacher moves around the room and confers with the students about their reading.  The teacher can meet with small, flexible groups to provide additional needs-based instruction.  At the end of the workshop the whole groups comes together to share their learning.&lt;ref name="Goudvis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anne Goudvis |author2=Stephanie Harvey |title=Strategies that work: teaching comprehension for understanding and engagement |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |isbn=1-57110-481-X |oclc=232347335 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Improving Reading===
An adult or peer reads with the student by modeling fluent reading and then asking the student to read the same passage aloud with encouragement and feedback by the adult or peer.
A student listens to a tape of a fluent reader reading text at the student's independent level at a pace of about 80-100 words a minute. The student listens to the tape the first time and then practices reading along with the tape until the student is able to read fluently.
The student reads with a peer partner. Each partner takes a turn reading to the other. A more fluent reader can be paired with a less fluent reader to model fluent reading. The more fluent reader can provide feedback and encouragement to the less fluent reader. Students of similar reading skills can also be paired, particularly if the teacher has modeled fluent reading and the partner reading involves practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Guided Oral Reading?|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-guided-oral-reading|website=Reading Rockets|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the seven important strategies that all readers must be able to apply to text in order to read and understand content. The seven strategies are:
* 1.	Making Connections;
* 2.	Creating Mental Images;
* 3.	Making Inferences/Drawing Conclusions;
* 4.	Asking Questions;
* 5.	Determining What Is Important;
* 6.	Synthesizing; and
* 7.	Monitoring Comprehension and Meaning.&lt;ref name="Serafini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goudvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Debbie S. |title=Reading with meaning: teaching comprehension in the primary grades |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2002 |pages=53–157 |isbn=1-57110-307-4 |oclc=48773960 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading comprehension ====
{{Main|Reading comprehension}}

Reading comprehension requires making sense of text, which allows a reader to gain knowledge, enjoy a story, and make connections with the larger world.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Kate|title=Making Sense of Text:  Skills That Support Text Comprehension and Its Development|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/26618/1/Cain2009IDAPerspectives.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several skills support reading comprehension, including making predictions and inferences, monitoring understanding, using text structures, and using prior knowledge effectively.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Gerald|title=Explaining Reading:  A Resource for Teaching Concepts, Skills, and Strategies|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-075-6|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important aspects of successful comprehension are activating prior knowledge and metacognition, which are two of the principles of learning identified in the National Research Council's report.''&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=M.

Many studies have identified the importance of prior knowledge in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=S. C.|author2=B. Thompson |title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge and Schema Activation Strategies on the Inferential Reading Comprehension of Children With and Without Learning Disabilities|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|year=1996|volume=19|issue=1|pages=49 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ519854&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ519854 |accessdate=2/7/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many researchers have shown that having some prior knowledge about the topic of a passage enables both greater comprehension of the text and better memory for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Priebe SJ, Keenan JM, Miller AC |title=How Prior Knowledge Affects Word Identification and Comprehension |journal=Read Writ |volume=7 |issue= |pages=581–586 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21799586 |doi=10.1007/s11145-010-9260-0 |url= |pmc=3142886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "if we have prior knowledge about a topic in a text, we construct meaning based on our experience, and we can adjust and change those plans as we go along."&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"/&gt; Some authors specify two types of prior knowledge necessary for successful comprehension.  World knowledge aids in understanding fiction and domain-specific knowledge facilitates comprehension of nonfiction.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Importance of Teaching Reading Strategies|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles form the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Teaching_Reading_Strategies_McNamara.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who lack this, request background information, so as to make connections with and within the text.&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKeown|first=Margaret|author2=Isabel Beck |author3=Ronette Blake |title=Reading Comprehension Instruction:  Focus on Content or Strategies?|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Rand_Report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another learning principle that greatly influences reading comprehension is the use of metacognition.  The 'metacognitive' approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them."&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt; A great deal of research indicates that accomplished readers "monitor their comprehension as they read by engag[ing] in strategic processing, such as rereading previous text, to resolve comprehension failure."&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt; Students who are not able to track their own understanding gain neither information or enjoyment from reading as they do not know how to obtain meaning from the text.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many strategies have been applied.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;  Many studies point to the success of strategy instruction, particularly for students who are poor comprehenders.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt; Some strategies that have been helpful are summarization, question generation, making predictions and inferences, image making, knowledge and use of text structure, rereading, self-regulation, activation of prior knowledge, questioning the author, and using graphic organizers.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Carol|title=Working Smarter, Not Harder:  What Teachers of Reading Need to Know and Be Able to Teach|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2012|pages= |url=http://www.winsorlearning.com/site/resources/articles/working-smarter-not-harder/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of strategies allows the teacher to choose a strategy or strategies to suit the text and the needs of the student.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== Non-traditional approaches ====
Programs have been established to provide certified therapy animals, such as dogs, as non-judgmental "listeners" to build motivation and help children build proficiency and gain confidence in their reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westhartford.patch.com/groups/schools/p/read-benefits-all-readers-in-bugbee-classroom |title=Reading with Dogs Benefits All in Bugbee Classroom |last=Newton |first=Ronni (editor) |date=June 21, 2013 |website=West Hartford Patch |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHPAQiGk |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate of reading education in the US==
{{Main|Literacy in the United States}}

National literacy rates range from about 10 percent to 99+ percent.

There are several approaches used to teach reading and the U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program has a compilation of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Teach Balanced Reading and Writing|last=Burns|first=Bonnie|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2006|isbn=1412937418|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a list based on 29 individual studies that identify effective approaches when teaching reading for beginners. The bulk of the studies revealed that successful instructional strategies include [[Synthetic phonics|systematic phonics]] and approaches that focus on connected reading and meaning. These strategies were proved to be more effective than basal alone approaches. Specific studies that show instructional models that achieve high success rates in reading education include the so-called Actual Community Empowerment (ACE) program, which is a small-group tutoring framework that focuses on fluency, [[word recognition]], decoding and the concept of comprehension that is based on the appropriate pace of learning according to individual learning profiles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Action Research: Benefits to Community Members and Service Providers|last=Reeb|first=Roger|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2006|isbn=9780789030467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, thus, has different variations. Once ACE was implemented in 40 locations in [[Philadelphia]], learners posted a 95 percent success rate for significant reading improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Traditional reading instruction approaches that are considered effective include those under a [[Cognitive model|cognitive-based model]], which treats reading acquisition and reading comprehension to be dependent on [[Cognitive development|cognitive development.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Revolution on Educational Psychology|last=Royer|first=James|publisher=Information Age Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1593111630|location=Greenwich, CT|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print exposure ==
[[Print exposure]] the amount of time a child or person spends being visually aware of the written word (reading)--whether that be through newspapers, magazines, books, journals, scientific papers, or more. Research has shown that the amount of print material that a child accesses has deep cognitive consequences. In addition, the act of reading itself, for the most part irrespective of what is being read, increases the achievement difference among children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Children who are exposed to large amounts of print often have more success in reading and have a larger vocabulary to draw from than children who see less print. The average conversations among college graduates, spouses or adult friends contain less rare (advanced) words than the average preschool reading book. Other print sources have increasingly higher amounts of rare words, from children's books, to adult books, to popular magazines, newspapers, and scientific articles (listed in increasing level of difficulty). Television, even adult news shows, do not have the same level of rare words that children's books do.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012|author=Massaro, D. W.|title=Two Different Communication Genres and Implications for Vocabulary Development and Learning to Read. Journal of Literacy Research December 2015 47: 505–527, first published on February 17, 2016 .}}

The issue is that oral language is very repetitive. To learn to read effectively a child needs to have a large vocabulary. Without this, when the child does read they stumble over words that they do not know, and have trouble following the idea of the sentence. This leads to frustration and a dislike of reading. When a child is faced with this difficulty he or she is less likely to read, thus further inhibiting the growth of their vocabulary.

Children who enjoy reading do it more frequently and improve their vocabulary. A study of out-of-school reading of fifth graders, found that a student in the 50th percentile read books about 5 minutes a day, while a student in the 20th percentile read books for less than a minute a day. This same study found that the amount of time a child in the 10th percentile spent reading in two days, was the amount of time a child in the 90th percentile spent reading all year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Print exposure can also be a big factor in learning English as a second language. [[Book flood]] experiments are an example of this. The book flood program brought books in English to the classroom. Through focusing their English language learning on reading books instead of endless worksheets the teachers were able to improve the rate at which their students learned English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Alphabetic principle and English orthography ==
{{Main|Alphabetic principle}}

Beginning readers must understand the concept of the ''alphabetic principle'' in order to master basic reading skills. A [[writing system]] is said to be ''alphabetic'' if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds. In comparison, [[Logogram#Logographic systems|Logographic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kanji]] and [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] use a symbol to represent a word. And both cultures also use [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as Japanese [[kana]] and Chinese [[Yi script]], there are also many Chinese alphabets.

English is one of several languages using the [[Latin Alphabet]] [[writing system]]. The [[orthographic depth]] of such languages varies. The [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and [[Finnish language]]s have the purest, or shallowest orthographies, and [[English orthography]] is the deepest or most complex. In the shallow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography; most words are spelled the way they sound, that is, word spellings are almost always regular. English orthography, on the other hand, is far more complex in that it does not have a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and sounds. English has individual sounds that can be represented by more than one symbol or symbol combination. For example, the long |a| sound can be represented by a-[[consonant]]-e as in ate, -ay as in hay, -ea as in steak, -ey as in they, -ai as in pain, and -ei as in vein. In addition, there are many words with irregular spelling and many [[homophones]] (words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings as well). Pollack Pickeraz (1963) asserted that there are 45 phonemes in the [[English language]], and that the 26 letters of the English alphabet can represent them in about 350 ways.

The irregularity of English spelling is largely an artifact of how the language developed.
English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language with substantial influences and additional vocabulary from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[French language|French]], among others. Imported words usually follow the spelling patterns of their language of origin.&lt;ref name="King 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diana Hanbury King |title=English isn't crazy!: the elements of our language and how to teach them |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=2000 |pages=xii, 15|isbn=0-912752-59-9 |oclc=45166702 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced English phonics instruction includes studying words according to their origin, and how to determine the correct spelling of a word using its language of origin.

Clearly, the complexity of [[English orthography]] makes it more difficult for children to learn decoding and encoding rules, and more difficult for teachers to teach them.&lt;ref name="King 2000"/&gt; However, effective [[word recognition]] relies on the basic understanding that letters represent the sounds of spoken language, that is, word recognition relies on the reader's understanding of the [[alphabetic principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling reform ===

Attempts to make English spelling behave phonetically have given rise to various campaigns for [[spelling reform]]; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections to spelling reform, including this objection. See, for example, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling.''&lt;ref&gt;Rondthaler, Edward and Edward J. Lias, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' (New York: The American Language Academy, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lounsbury presented a devastating rebuttal to all reasonable objections to spelling reform in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lounsbury, Thomas Raynesford |title=English spelling and spelling reform |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1970 |pages=331–341 |isbn=0-8371-4264-4 |oclc=134359 |url=https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections to spelling reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bob C. Cleckler |title=Lets End Our Literacy Crisis: The Desperately Needed Idea Whose Time Has Come |publisher=American University &amp; Colleges Press |location=Salt Lake City |year=2005 |pages=166–170 |isbn=1-58982-230-7 |oclc=636405856 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists documenting the sounds of speech use various special symbols, of which the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most widely known. Linguistics makes a distinction between a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and phoneme, and between [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/phono.htm|title=Language differences - Phonetics and phonology|last=Shoebottom|first=Paul|website=esl.fis.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of words and their structure is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and the smallest units of meaning are [[morpheme]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntid.rit.edu/sea/processes/wordknowledge/grammatical/whatare|title=What are Morphemes? {{!}} SEA - Supporting English Acquisition|website=www.ntid.rit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of the relationship between words present in the language at one time is [[etymology|synchronic etymology]], part of [[descriptive linguistics]], and the study of word origins and evolution is [[etymology|diachronic etymology]], part of [[historical linguistics]]

[[English orthography]] gives priority first to morphology, then to etymology, and lastly to phonetics. Thus the spelling of a word is dependent principally upon its structure, its relationship to other words, and its language or origin. It is usually necessary to know the meaning of a word in order to spell it correctly, and its meaning will be indicated by the similarity to words of the same meaning and family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myenglishlanguage.com/linguistics-language-guide/english-orthography/|title=English Orthography - The English Writing System - English Spelling|work=My English Language|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[English language|English]] uses a 26 letter [[Latin alphabet]], but the number of [[grapheme]]s is expanded by several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], and [[tetragraph]]s, while the letter "q" is not used as a grapheme by itself, only in the digraph "qu"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-grapheme|title=What is a grapheme?|work=TheSchoolRun|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each grapheme may represent a limited number of phonemes depending on [[etymology]] and location in the word. Likewise each phoneme may be represented by a limited number of graphemes. Some letters are not part of any grapheme, but function as etymological markers. Graphemes do not cross [[morpheme]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prowritingaid.com/art/317/What-are-Phonemes,-Graphemes,-and-Digraphs.aspx|title=What is the Difference Between a Phoneme, a Grapheme and a Digraph?|website=prowritingaid.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes are spelled consistently, following rules inflection and word-formation, and allow readers and writers to understand and produce words they have not previously encountered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tesol-direct.com/tesol-resources/english-grammar-guide/morphemes/|title=Morphemes in English grammar {{!}} TESOL Direct|work=TESOL Direct|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Initial teaching alphabet ====
{{Main|Initial teaching alphabet}}
This method was designed to overcome the fact that English orthography has a many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes. The method fell into disuse because children still had to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] and the conventional English spellings in order to integrate with society outside of school. It also recreated the problem of dialect dependent spelling, which the standardization of spelling had been created to eliminate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/|title=Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation {{!}}   What is i.t.a.?|website=itafoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Augmenting spelling with pronunciation information ===

Unlike spelling reforms, we can actually keep a word's original spelling intact but add pronunciation information to it, e.g. using diacritics. [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] is a Chrome browser extension that automatically adds such a pronunciation guide to English words on Web pages, for English-speaking children to recognize a written word's pronunciation and therefore map the written word to the mental word in his mind.

== Practical application ==

In practice, many children are exposed to both "Phonic" and "Whole Language" methods, coupled with reading programs that combine both elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/whole-language-or-phonics-which-approach-is-best|title=Whole Language or Phonics: Which Approach Is Best?|website=www.allaboutlearningpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the extremely popular book, ''Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons'', by Siegfried Engelman, et al. ({{ISBN|0-671-63198-5}}), teaches pronunciation and simple phonics, then supplements it with progressive texts and practice in directed reading. The end result of a mixed method is a casually phonetic student, a much better first-time pronouncer and speller, who still also has look-say acquisition, quick fluency and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. Using an eclectic method, students can select their preferred learning style. This lets all students make progress, yet permits a motivated student to use and recognize the best traits of each method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/13/72233.php|title=Eclectic approach to teaching language|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Speed reading]] continues where basic education stops. Usually after some practice, many students' reading speed can be significantly increased. There are various speed-reading techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/speed-reading_b_5317784.html|title=How I Learned to Read 300 Percent Faster in 20 Minutes|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|date=2014-05-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, speed reading does not guarantee comprehension or retention of what was read.

[[Readability]] indicates the ease of understanding or comprehension due to the style of writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/using-readability-analysis-to-make-students-stronger-writers|title=Using readability analysis to make students stronger writers|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Reading recovery]] is a method for helping students learn to read&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://readingrecovery.org/reading-recovery/teaching-children/basic-facts/|title=Basic Facts - Reading Recovery Council of North America|work=Reading Recovery Council of North America|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Alice-gorham-burt-1905.png|upright|thumb|1905 edition cover of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable'']]
In colonial times, reading instruction was simple and straightforward: teach children the code and then let them read. At that time, reading material was not specially written for children but consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays; the most influential early textbook was ''[[The New England Primer]],'' published late 1680s. There was little consideration for how best to teach children to read or how to assess reading comprehension.
&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1990 |pages=21–25 |isbn=0-262-01112-3 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the mid-19th century did this approach change significantly. Educators, in particular [[Horace Mann]], began to advocate changes in reading instructional methods. He observed that children were bored and "death-like" at school, and that instruction needed to engage children's interest in the reading material by teaching them to read whole words.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The [[McGuffey Readers]] (1836) were the most popular of these more engaging [[graded reader]]s. In the mid-19th century, [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]] developed a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and [[spelling]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/history-reading-education-us|title=History of Reading Education in the U.S. {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the 1890s to at least 1910, A. L. Burt of New York and other publishing companies published series of books aimed at young readers, using simple language to retell longer classics. Mrs J. C. Gorham produced three such works, ''Gulliver's Travels in words of one syllable'' (1896), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable]]'' (1905), and ''Black Beauty retold in words of one syllable'' (1905). In the UK, Routledge published a similar series between 1900 and 1910.

The meaning-based curriculum did not dominate reading instruction until the second quarter of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. [[Phonics]] was not to be taught except sparingly and as a tool to be used as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

In the 1950s [[Rudolf Flesch]] wrote a book called ''Why Johnny Can't Read'',&lt;ref name="Flesch, R"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flesch, Rudolf Franz |title=Why Johnny can't read: and what you can do about it |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-06-091340-1 |oclc=12837722 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; Addressed to the mothers and fathers of America, he also hurled severe criticism at publishers' decisions that he claimed were motivated by profit, and he questioned the honesty and intelligence of experts, schools, and teachers.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The book was on the best seller list for 30 weeks and spurred a hue and cry in general population. It also polarized the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

This polarization continues to the present time. In the 1970s an instructional philosophy called [[whole language]] (which de-emphasizes teaching phonics out of context) was introduced, and it became the primary method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] instruction in the 1980s and 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpingeverychildtoread.com/index.php/causes-of-difficulty/reading-theories/whole-word-method|title=Whole Word Method|website=www.helpingeverychildtoread.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, researchers (such as the [[National Institute of Health]]) conducted studies showing that early [[Learning to read|reading acquisition]] depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sight-word (Whole Word) method was invented by Rev. [[Thomas H. Gallaudet]], the director of the American Asylum at Hartford in the 1830s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sightwords.com/sight-words/lessons/|title=Sight Words Teaching Strategy {{!}} Sight Words: Teach Your Child to Read|website=www.sightwords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was designed for the education of the [[Deaf]] by juxtaposing a word, with a picture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/reverend-thomas-hopkins-gallaudet.htm|title=Reverend Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|last=Vicars|first=William|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.In 1830, Gallaudet provided a description of his method to the American Annals of Education which included teaching children to recognize a total of 50 sight words written on cards and by 1837 the method was adopted by the Boston Primary School Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/gallaudet-thomas-hopkins3.htm|title=Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Horace Mann]] the then Secretary of the Board of Education of [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]] favored the method and it soon became the dominant method statewide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By 1844 the defects of the new method became so apparent to [[Boston]] schoolmasters that they issued an attack against it urging a return to an intensive, systematic phonics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Again Dr. [[Samuel Orton]], a [[neuropathologist]] in [[Iowa]] in 1929 sought the cause of children's reading problems and concluded that their problems were being caused by the new sight method of teaching reading&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=View source for Reading education in the United States|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_education_in_the_United_States?action=edit|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:CILVII,45=RIB152Bath.jpg|thumb|Dedication from [[Roman Britain]] announcing that a local official has restored a ''locus religiosus''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VII.45 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 4920.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''religiō'', origin of the modern [[lexeme]] ''[[religion]]'' (via [[Old French]]/[[Middle Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:75.&lt;/ref&gt;) is of ultimately obscure etymology. It is recorded beginning in the 1st century BC, i.e. in [[Classical Latin]] at the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]], notably by [[Cicero]], in the sense of "scrupulous or strict observance of the [[mos maiorum|traditional ''cultus'']]".

==Etymology==
The classical explanation of the word,  traced to [[Cicero]] himself, derives it from  ''re-'' (again) + ''lego'' in the sense of "choose", "go over again" or "consider carefully".
Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligo}}'' "bind, connect", probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re-'' (again) + ''ligare'' or "to reconnect," which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation of [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. {{ISBN|0-88762-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem with these etymologies, regardless of whether one favours  ''lego'' or ''ligo'', is that the now-familiar prefix [[:wikt:re-|re-]] "again" is not attested prior to its occurrence in ''religio'' and is itself in need of an etymological explanation.

==Significance in Roman religion==
Within the system of what we would now call "[[ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] (in the modern sense of the word), the term ''religio''   originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], "The Augural Law", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16 (1986), p. 2180, and in the same volume, G.J. Szemler, "Priesthoods and Priestly Careers in Ancient Rome," p. 2322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p.33, 1889. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']; [[Max Müller]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, ''religio'' might be translated better as "religious scruple" than with the English word "religion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of ''religio'' offered by [[Cicero]] is ''cultus deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' 2.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Religio'' among the Romans was not based on "[[faith]]", but on knowledge, including and especially [[orthopraxy|correct practice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religio'' (plural ''religiones'') was the [[pietas|pious practice]] of Rome's traditional cults, and was a cornerstone of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 279: "Care for the gods, the very meaning of religio, had [therefore] to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was "necessary". Religious behavior – ''pietas'' in Latin, ''eusebeia'' in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats."&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional social norms that regulated public, private, and military life. To the Romans, their success was self-evidently due to their practice of proper, respectful ''religio'', which gave the gods what was owed them and which was rewarded with social harmony, peace and prosperity.

Religious law maintained the proprieties of divine honours, sacrifice, and ritual. Impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitia]]'' (faults, hence "vice," the English derivative); excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities, and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were ''[[superstitio]]''; neglecting the ''religiones'' owed to the traditional gods was [[atheism]], a charge leveled during the Empire at Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 360, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, and Epicureans.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide D. Simpson, "Epicureans, Christians, Atheists in the Second Century," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 72 (1941) 372–381.&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (''ira deorum'') and, therefore, harm the State.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard ''et al''., ''Literacy in the Roman world'', Ann Arbor, Mich.: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 1991, Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Religion in ancient Rome]].

''Religiosus'' was something pertaining to the gods or marked out by them as theirs, as distinct from ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'', which was something or someone given to them by humans. Hence, a graveyard was not primarily defined as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'' but a ''locus religiosus'', because those who lay within its boundaries were considered belonging to the [[di Manes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. De Visscher "Locus religiosus" ''Atti del Congresso internazionale di Diritto Romano'', 3, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Places struck by lightning were [[taboo]]&lt;ref&gt;Warde Fowler considers a possible origin for ''sacer'' in taboos applied to holy or accursed things or places, without direct reference to deities and their property. W. Warde Fowler "The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', I, 1911, p.57-63&lt;/ref&gt; because they had been marked as ''religiosus'' by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- the Varro's presumably a fragment - no idea which one, so this needs checking --&gt;Varro. LL V, 150. See also Festus, 253 L: "A place was once considered to become ''religiosus'' which looked to have been dedicated to himself by a god": "''locus statim fieri putabatur religiosus, quod eum deus dicasse videbatur"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Romania}}
'''Romanian humour''', like many other [[culture of Romania|Romanian cultural aspects]], has many affinities with five other groups: the Latins (namely the [[French people|French]] and [[Italians]]), the Balkan people ([[Greeks]], the [[Slavs]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]), the [[Germans]] and the [[hungarian people|Hungarians]].

==Characters==

The earliest Romanian character found in anecdotes is [[Păcală]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} His name is derived from ''a (se) păcăli'' ('to fool oneself/somebody') and, since this word cannot be found in any other related language, we can safely assume that his name is part of the pure Romanian humour.

The [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] influence brought the Balkan spirit and with it, other characters and situations. [[Anton Pann]]'s character, [[nasreddin|Nastratin Hogea]], is a classic example of an urban tradesman. As Jewish people settled in many Romanian regions, two other characters joined Romanian humour: ''Iţic'' and ''Ştrul'', a pair of cunning Jews, mainly seen as ingenious, but avaricious shopkeepers.

With modernization and urbanization, especially during the Communist regime, Romanians needed a new character, different from the traditional Păcală, and he was found in [[Bulă]], the tragicomic absolute idiot. In 2006 Bulă was voted the [[100 Greatest Romanians|59th greatest Romanian]].

With the fall of communism and facing capitalism, a new kind of joke became popular: that of ''Alinuţa'', a sadistic and stupid 10-year-old girl. Example: Alinuţa: "Mum, I don't like grandma." Mum: "Shut up, we eat what we have!"

Other popular characters are [[Ion]] and [[Maria (given name)|Maria]], a pair of young married or engaged innocent peasants, sometimes depicted as gypsies.Almost all jokes including them are sexually oriented.
Another well-known character is [[Badea Gheorghe]], mainly depicted as an old shepherd with a very simplistic view of life, death and material possessions.
The newest character is Dorel, the archetype of a careless construction worker, engineer or electrician.  Dorel is often depicted as the sole author of weird construction works as door-less balconies or even stairs leading to nowhere.

==Ethnic jokes==

''Gypsies'':
: Jokes about  Ţigani (Gypsy) [[ethnic minority]] in Romania. Recurring themes are: stealing, refusing to work, having too many children, atrocious personal hygiene and bad personal finance management – essentially, the major [[stereotype]]s about gypsies in Romania.
''Scotsmen'' are presented as stingy, mean, dumb and feisty kilt-wearing skulks, who act against common sense just to save a small amount of money.

''Russians'':
: A poor Russian fisherman catches a little fish which grants him three wishes. The first wish was "A big vodka". The wish is granted and the fisherman drinks it, then asks the fish for another one. "I want that the whole Volga to be made out of vodka." The wish is granted and the fisherman swims in it and drinks from it. Afterward he is asked for the last wish. He says "You know what? I want another vodka".

''Somalis'' are seen as underweight and hungry.

: Q: In what part of Somalia is the density of population greatest?
: A: It depends on the direction of the wind.

''Albanians'' are seen as very technologically impaired.

: Q: How can you stop an Albanian tank?
: A: You shoot the soldier that is pushing it.

: Q: Why is there a rubber-band shortage in Albania?
: A: They're saving them for their satellite launch.

''Hungarians'' are seen as proud, but naive. The stereotypical Hungarian is called [[Janos (disambiguation)|Ianoş]] and usually is accompanied by a Romanian named [[Ion (name)|Ion]].
:The [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] local administration discusses the setting up of a statue of [[Avram Iancu]]. A councilor says "The statue should have a hand pointing to [[Hungary]], so the Hungarians would know we're watching them". Another one suggests that "in one hand, Iancu should hold a noose, so they would know what to expect should they try to steal [[Transylvania]]". Another councilor suggests that "there should be a Hungarian in the noose". Then, [[Gheorghe Funar]] (the well-known [[Nationalism|nationalist]] former Mayor of Cluj) says "I say we replace the Hungarian every day!".

==Regions of Romania==
One feature of Romanian humour is that, apart from the ethnic jokes, there are also jokes about people of other regions. They are usually told, setting examples of the way each region uses the [[Romanian language]]. For example, [[Moldavia]]ns pronounce /tʃ/ as /ʃ/ and /e/ as /i/, [[Oltenia]]ns make use of the perfect simple (rarely used in other regions) and the [[Transylvania]]ns use some words of Hungarian and German origin such as 'musai' (meaning ''must'') or 'fain' (meaning ''nice''), as well as the start of most sentences with the interjection "No" (not as a negative answer, but meaning ''So'' or ''Well).
* [[Oltenia]]ns (''Olteni'') and [[Muntenia]]ns (''Munteni'') are seen as trying to be [[ingenuity|ingenious]] and fast-paced, but failing every time. They do [[compulsive talking| talk a lot]] too – people from other regions think that they even talk before thinking. Oltenians are said to be especially [[pride|proud]]. [[Nea Mărin]] is a character created in the 1970s by [[Amza Pellea]] (himself an Oltenian) who is the archetypal traditional Oltenian.
* [[Moldavia]]ns (''Moldoveni'') are [[wit|witty]] and [[pride|proud]], and  [[alcoholism|drink a lot]].
* [[Transylvania]]ns (''Ardeleni'') are seen as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and slow, both in thinking/speaking and in acting.

==Stereotypes==

''Policemen'': Most Romanian people are not fond of the law enforcement institutions and try to avoid contact with constables. Romanian public opinion about policemen says that they are primitive, uneducated and totally corrupt. Some of these [[police]] jokes belong to the absurd genre.

: Q: A policeman is shaving. The telephone rings. Why does he cut himself?
: A: To know where to resume from.

: Q: How do you choose a stupid policeman from a group of policemen?
: A: At random.

==Politics==

Especially during the [[socialist Republic of Romania|communist regime]], [[joke|political joke]]s were very popular, although they were illegal and dangerous to tell.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Banc]] and [[Alan Dundes]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0838632459 "First Prize: Fifteen Years. An Annotated Collection of Political Jokes"] (1986) {{ISBN|0-8386-3245-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the democratic Romania, these jokes are still popular, although the themes changed: now the politicians are seen either, as hopelessly corrupt, greedy, or as nationalist madmen.

As Ben Lewis put it in his essay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7412 "Hammer &amp; tickle"], ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'', May 2006, essay by Ben Lewis on jokes in Communist countries
&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Communism]] was a humor-producing machine. Its economic theories and system of repression created inherently funny situations. There were jokes under [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] too, but those systems did not create an absurd, laugh-a-minute reality like communism."

: In Ceaușescu's time, a line is forming around the street's corner. A man passing by sees it and asks the last one in line: "What do they sell here?" "I have no idea", he replies, "go ask someone ahead". The man goes to the middle of the line and asks another person: "What do they sell here?" "I have no idea", the answer comes and he is sent farther ahead to seek for an answer. The man goes straight to the first person in line and asks him: "What do they sell here?" The other one answers: "Nothing, I just felt sick and took support on this wall." "Well then, why are you still here?", the man asked. "Because I've never been the first in such a long line", the answer came.

: [[Bill Clinton]], [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Ion Iliescu]] are invited to see an airplane built entirely out of gold. They are told that they can enter it and look around for as long as they like, but they can't take anything. Clinton goes first, stays five minutes, upon his exit the metal detector blares; Clinton had taken a screw and a nail with him. Yeltsin goes second, stays five minutes, upon his exit the metal detector blares again; Yeltsin had stolen a fistful of screws. Finally, Iliescu enters the plane, and stays there five minutes. And another five minutes. And another... Suddenly, the plane takes off.

''[[Radio Yerevan jokes|Radio Yerevan]]'': just like in the most countries of the former Eastern bloc, Radio Yerevan jokes were popular during the communist times.

[[File:Sensoaesthetic Tasting Spoons.jpg|thumb|Copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel spoons, by [[Zoe Laughlin]].]]
'''Sensoaesthetics''' is the application of scientific methods to the study of the aesthetic, sensual and emotional aspects of materials.

==Overview==

The purpose of Sensoaesthetics is to understand how people interact with materials, and use that understanding to improve design and incorporate [[multisensory integration]] into the process. Another priority of Sensoaesthetics is to connect the Materials Science community with other disciplines such as Art and the design world, and reverse a perceived eradication of interest in the sensual and aesthetic properties of materials.&lt;ref name="Institute of Making, Research, Sensoaesthetic Materials"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensoaesthetic Materials|url=http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/research/sensoaesthetic-materials|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 79, No. 10, pp. 1635–1641, 2007."&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Miodownik|title=Towards designing new sensoaesthetic materials|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2007/pdf/7910x1635.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The field has been developed by Materials Science academics, Professor [[Mark Miodownik]] and Dr [[Zoe Laughlin]] at [[King's College London]] and [[University College London|UCL]], and through the work of the Materials Library at King's College, and the [[Institute of Making]].

==Spoon Experiment==

The event was held in May, 2012 at Quilon, a Michelin starred Indian restaurant in London, by Zoe Laughlin and Mark Miodownik. 
The purpose was to study the taste of solid metals, and involved inviting a group of people including chef [[Heston Blumenthal]] and food science writer [[Harold McGee]] to eat Indian food using seven different freshly polished spoons in copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel.

The tastes of copper and zinc were found to be "bold and assertive, with bitter, metallic tastes". The silver spoon "tasted dull", while the stainless steel had a "faintly metallic flavour". Miodownik observed that the guests were not just tasting the spoons, but eating them, as with every lick they consumed "perhaps a hundred billion atoms".&lt;ref name="Sensoaesthetic Spoons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediblegeography.com/sensoaesthetic-spoons/|accessdate=21 March 2014|title=Sensoaesthetic Spoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoon fed: how cutlery affects your food|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/776ba1d4-93ee-11e1-baf0-00144feab49a.html#axzz1twPxXo4i|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a set of the spoons Laughlin designed were included in the new permanent collection of London's [[Design Museum]] and are on display in the Designer Maker User gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designer-maker-user|title=Designer Maker User|website=Design Museum|language=en-GB|others=Fabrique &amp; Q42|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Structured English Immersion (SEI)''' is a technique for rapidly teaching English to [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English Language Learners]].  The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's]] successful [[French immersion]] programs.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced [[language policies of the Canadian provinces and territories|many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces]] before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.

More recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are  based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., ''Structured English Immersion,'' Corwin Press, 2002)

In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than [[bilingual education]]. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author      = SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.

== SEI Framework ==
Only Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:
* Significant amounts of the school day are dedicated to the explicit teaching of the English language, and students are grouped for this instruction according to their level of English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "The English language is the main content of SEI instruction. Academic content plays a supporting, but subordinate, role."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "English is the language of instruction; students and teachers are expected to speak, read, and write in English."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Teachers use instructional methods that treat English as a foreign language."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Students learn discrete English grammar skills."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Rigorous time lines are established for students to exit from the program."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* SEI program graduates continue to receive support services until they are reclassified as "fluent English proficient" whereby Federal law then requires students be monitored for two years after reclassification.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;

'''Ilmu Tajul''' is the most commonly used name for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] system of [[geomancy]], comprising [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[geomantic]] principles considered when siting or designing buildings to improve and maintain well-being. It was traditionally practiced by shamans ([[dukun]] or [[bomoh]]) and architects from [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The term actually alludes to a book entitled ''Tajul Muluk'' which covered a number of other topics including herbal medicine, astrology and dream interpretation along with geomancy. While all these subjects may be categorised under the term ''ilmu tajul'', it usually refers to the otherwise unnamed set of rites and rules for constructing buildings in Malay culture.

==Terminology==
*'''tiang seri''' / '''tiang ibu''' ("shining pillar" / "mother pillar"): The main pillar in traditional Malay buildings
*'''depa''' (armspan): A unit of measurement drawn from the armspan of the matriarch of the house
*'''rumah ibu''' ("mother house"): The main part of a house
*'''baris Laksmana''': A symbol drawn onto a beam to protect the house from evil. Named after the magic line drawn by [[Laksmana]] to protect [[Sita|Sita Dewi]]

==Origins==
The history of Malay geomancy has never been documented, but the system contains cultural symbolism of [[India]]n origin, indicating that it has existed as far back as the [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] period of [[history of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]]. Some conjecture that it may have been influenced by Indian [[Vastu Shastra|vastu sastra]] or Chinese [[Feng Shui|feng shui]], both of which have traditionally been practiced in the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The earliest account of the art comes from the book ''Taj-al-Mulk'' (meaning "Royal Crown of Jewels" in Arabic) written for [[Aceh]]nese royalty. The title was pronounced "Tajul Muluk" in [[Malay language|Malay]] so the information it contained was referred to as ''ilmu tajul muluk'' or just ''ilmu tajul'', meaning "knowledge of Tajul Muluk".

According to British civil servant Walter William Skeat in his book ''Malay Magic'', originally published in 1900, the rituals of tajul muluk were once commonplace.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even in the making of roads through the forest it would appear that sacrificial ceremonies are not invariably neglected. On one occasion I came upon a party of Malays in the Labu jungle who were engaged in making a bridle-track for the
[[Selangor]] Government. A small bamboo censer, on which [[incense]] had been burning, had been erected in the middle of the trace ; and I was informed that the necessary rites (for exorcising the demons from the trace) had just been successfully concluded.&lt;ref name="Skeat"&gt;{{cite book |title=Malay Magic: Being an introduction to the folklore and popular religion of the Malay Peninsula |author=Walter William Skeat |date=1965 |publisher=Frank and Cass, Co Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With the rise of the [[Islamic revival|Islamization movement]] of Southeast Asia during the 1980s, animistic and [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] aspects of Malay culture were discouraged. Today tajul muluk is considered a superstitious relic of the past and books written on the subject are sometimes banned in Malaysia.

==Rules and theories==
===Soil and location===
The auspiciousness of a location is determined by the colour, taste and smell of the soil, as well as the formation of its surface. In general, the colours of the soil from best to worst are white, red, yellow, grey and black (the [[Malay language]] also categorizes brown as a shade of yellow). Soil which is greenish-yellow, fragrant and tart-tasting will ensure an abundance of gold and silver unto the third generation. If the soil is red and sour, the dweller will be loved by their family. White soil with a sweet smell and taste is said to bring wealth and happiness. Foul-smelling earth of the wrong colour and texture will bring sickness and poverty. Soil that is full of holes will cause the occupants to die poor. 

Aside from the soil, the lay of the land must also be taken into consideration. The best site for a house, city or orchard is level. The best aspect of the land's surface is that which is low on the north and high in the south, thought to bring the occupants absolute peacefulness. Land which is low on the west and high in the east is also auspicious. The reverse of these directions (i.e. high in the north and low to the south, or high to the west and low to the east) will bring poverty and death. The worst land is hilly or full of holes. A house that inclines from the southwest causes one to lose their livelihood or source of income. A house that inclines from the south brings death to its owner. If the house inclines from the west, the occupant will waste away all their money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Royal Healer |author=Roland Werner |date=2002 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siting ritual===
Once the ground has been cleared, the [[dukun]] or [[bomoh]] begins smoking the area with [[incense]] (''kemenyan''). He then measures one depa of [[bamboo]] and sticks it in the ground together with a container of water. [[Incense]] is burnt again as the [[dukun]] recites incantations. At dawn the next morning, the stick and water are checked. If the pail of water has spilled or the [[bamboo]] has shortened, the plot is bad luck. If the water has overflowed or the stick has lengthened, it is very auspicious. Once the site has been chosen, a hole is dug in the ground for the house's main pillar. The shaman places seven grains of [[rice]] into the hole and recites [[mantra|mantera]] before inserting the pillar. If any of the rice grains are missing the next day, the site has negative energy. It is important to note however that an area which is bad for one family may be good for another since the ritual is based on the matriarch's armspan.

Another, perhaps older, method involves [[dreams]]. After clearing the area, the [[dukun]] lays four sticks in its centre and calls the name of the presiding local deities or spirits. Taking a handful of soil, he recites the following chant:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Hai anak Menteri Guru 
:Yang duduk empat penjuru alam 
:Aku memohonkan tanah ini
:Jikalau baik, tunjukkan alamat baik 
:Jikalau jahat, tunjukkan alamat jahat 

:Ho, children of Mentri Guru 
:Who dwell in the four corners of the world
:I crave this plot as a boon
:If it is good, show me a good omen
:If it is bad, show me a bad omen  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The soil is then wrapped in white cloth, fumigated with incense and placed under the occupant's pillow at night. Before sleeping, the last two lines of the aforementioned charm are repeated. If the occupant has a nightmare, the house cannot be built. If the dream is good, the four corners of the site are pegged with sticks. A dead branch is then taken and heaped with earth before being set on fire. When it has been reduced to ashes, it is swept up and covered. A similar incantation is then spoken:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Hai, segala orang yang memegang tanah ini empat penjuru alam 
:Kama aku hendak berbuat rumah 
:Jikalau baik, tunjukkan alamat baik 
:Jikalau jahat, tunjukkan alamat jahat

:Ho, holders of this land who dwell in the four corners of the world
:I wish to build a house on this site
:If it is good, show me a good omen
:If it is bad, show me a bad omen
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The next morning, the ashes are uncovered and God will show a sign of the plot's good and bad potential. This method is no longer practiced today because of its pre-Islamic origin. The name ''Menteri Guru'', which translates literally as "minister teacher", may be an alternate form of ''Betara Guru'' (from the [[Sanskrit]] term ''Bhattara Guru'' meaning "teacher-lord"), an epithet for the Hindu god [[Shiva|Siwa]] or ''Shiva''. The [[Four corners of the world|four corners]] mentioned in the incantation is found in Malay, [[India]]n and [[Chinese spiritual world concepts]]. In [[Hindu cosmology]] the surface of the earth is represented as a square in reference to the horizon's relationship with sunrise and sunset.

===Erecting the main pillar===
Traditional Malay buildings have at their centre a main pillar called the ''tiang seri'' where the spirit of the house (''semangat rumah'') is said to dwell. Sometimes it may decorated with the family [[kris]] wrapped in yellow cloth. The construction of any building begins by digging a hole for this central post, accompanied by the recitation of a charm. The best time of day for this is 7 a.m. The workers must ensure that their shadows do not fall on the hole or on the post itself, or illness will follow. Certain materials are then deposited into the hole such as brazilwood (''kayu sepang''), ebony (''kayu arang''), scrap metal, tin-ore, a copper coin, a broken hatchet-head, or a candle-nut (''buah gorek''). To appease the local earth-spirit or demon (''jembalang tanah'' or ''puaka''), the head, feet and blood of an animal are also deposited in the hole. Depending on the malignity of the earth-spirit, the animal may be either a [[fowl]] (''ayam''), a [[goat]] (''kambing'') or a [[domestic Asian water buffalo|buffalo]] (''kerbau''). For a small demon, an egg will suffice. Among the natives of ancient [[Borneo]] the victim of this sacrifice would have been human, and the Malay custom of killing an animal for the purpose arose from what was once human sacrifice. As recently as the beginning of the 20th century, the Malaysian government would bury human skulls under the foundation of any large structure.

A number of methods are used to ascertain whether the hole is in a propitious location. In one example a white cup is filled with water, fumigated with [[incense]], and left in the hole overnight. If the cup is still full the next day or has live insects inside, it is a good sign. If the insects are dead or the water has lessened, it is a bad omen. Alternatively, one could wait until everyone has left the area before picking up three clods of soil, holding them over incense, and reciting a certain [[mantra|mantera]] or mantra. The soil must be taken home without ever turning to look back. Upon arrival, the earth is placed under the occupant's pillow before sleeping. If they have a bad dream, one of the clods is thrown away. This process continues until it results in a good dream, when the clod of earth which induced the dream is placed in the hole and serves as the tiang seri pole's foundation.

An example of a charm recited when erecting the tiang seri runs as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hai Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru, daripada tajar menyenseng 
Engkaulah anak Betara Guru 
Hai hantu tanah, benah tanah
Aku tahu asal kau jadi: Jembalang tanah 
Daripada kilat sabung-menyabung 
Undur kau dari sini ke laut yang dalam 
Aku tahu asal kau jadi: Ke rimba yang sunyi
Daripada embun setitik
Antara aku dengan engkau, aku tahu asal kau jadi

Ho Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru
Thou art sons of Bhattara Guru
Ho, ghost of the earth, blight of the earth
I know the origin from which you sprang: Demon of the earth
From the flashing lightning
Retire ye hence to the depths of the sea
I know the origin from which you sprang: To the peace of the forest
From a single drop of dew
Betwixt you and me, I know the origin from which you came into being
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Length of the threshold===
As with the Chinese [[Ba gua|bagua]] and the guardians of [[Jambudvipa]] in Indian culture, Malay astrology and geomancy also uses eight points of divination. Known as the "eight beasts", each one corresponds to an animal possessing its own characteristics. The eight beasts regulate the length of a house's threshold. This is measured in a unit called ''depa'', the length of the house-mistress's armspan. After measuring off a depa on a piece of string, the string is folded into three before one-third of its length is cut off. The remainder is folded into eight and reduced to one-seventh. The remaining seventh is checked against the threshold's length, and the number of times it is contained therein determines which animal it corresponds to. If the measurement is unlucky, the threshold would be cut shorter. The ominous significance of the eight beasts is often illustrated in rhyme. An example, recorded by Walter William Skeat,&lt;ref name=Skeat/&gt; reads as follows:

;1.[[Dragon]]
:"A dragon of bulk, a monster dragon 
:Is this dragon that turns round month by month
:Wherever you go you will be safe from stumbling-blocks 
:And all who meet you will be your friends" 

;2. Dairy cow  
:"There is the smoke of a fire in the forest 
:Where Che Ali is burning lime
:They were milking the young dairy-cow 
:And in the midst of the milking it sprawled and dropped dead"

;3. [[Asiatic lion|Lion]]
:"Lion of courage, lion of valour 
:Is the lion gambolling at the end of the Point 
:The luck of this house will be lasting
:Bringing prosperity from year to year" 

;4. [[Dog]] 
:"The wild dog, the jackal 
:Barks at the deer from night to night 
:Whatever you do will be a stumbling-block
:In this house men will stab one another" 

;5. [[Cow]]
:"The big cow from the middle of the clearing 
:Has gone to the deep forest to calve there
:Great luck will be your portion 
:Never will you cease to be prosperous"

;6. [[Asiatic wild ass|Donkey]] 
:"The ass within the fort 
:Carries grass from morn to eve 
:Whatever you pray for will not be granted 
:Though big your capital, the half will be lost" 

;7. [[Asian elephant|Elephant]]
:"The king's big riding-elephant 
:Has its tusks covered with amalgam 
:Good luck is your portion 
:No harm or blemish will you suffer" 

;8. [[Crow]]
:"A black crow soaring by night 
:Has perched on the house of the great Magic Prince 
:Great indeed is the calamity which has happened
:Within the house its master lies dead"

===House height===
The rules of a house's height are also determined by the matriarch's armspan. Ideally the main pillar should be a round number (e.g. 5 depa) but the actual measurement usually contains a fraction (e.g. five and two-tenths depa). Depending on the amount of extra length, there would be a different result.

|}

Malay village houses were built so that they could be disassembled and rebuilt when the situation demanded it such as war, floods or famine. Some have noted that these rules consider the number four unlucky, just as in [[China|Chinese]] superstition.

===Direction of the door===
The direction that the house's door faces is also said to play a part in determining the occupants' well-being. The worst direction for the door to face is south, which brings bad career luck. A door which faces the west is said to bring knowledge or encourages the coming of someone well-learned, especially in matters of religion. This is probably a reference to the fact that foreigners, particularly the Indian Muslims who introduced Islam in the region, sailed to the [[Malay Peninsula]] from the west. A door that faces east ensures many grandchildren and a life of tranquility. A north-facing door brings wealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">'''Texturising''' or '''texturizing''' is the process by which [[synthetic fibres]] are modified to change their texture - the physical appearance of the [[fibre]]. Texturising techniques can include [[bulking]] (where [[thermoplastic]] fibres are twisted, heat set and untwisted), [[Crimping (manmade fibre)|crimping]] and [[coiling]], amongst others. Texturising takes advantage of the thermoplastic nature of synthetic fibres, and uses it to set texturised features in place.

Fibres may be texturised to improve the fibre's insulation properties (as processes like bulking allow it to trap air better), to minimise a shiny, synthetic-looking appearance, to reduce the silky nature of the fibre, or to create special effects ([[fancy yarns]]). 

These modifications will also affect the eventual [[fabric]], and fibres may be folded, looped, coiled or crinkled in order to improve the drape, appearance, lustre, warmth, elasticity or handle of the finished fabric. Texturising can reduce the "synthetic" appearance of a finished fabric, bringing its appearance closer to that of a natural fibre fabric.

A ''thesis statement'' usually appears at the middle or end&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; of the introductory [[paragraph]] of a [[Scholarly paper|paper]], and it offers a concise [[Abstract (summary)|summary]] of the main point or claim of the [[essay]], [[Academic paper|research paper]], etc. It is usually expressed in one sentence, and the statement may be reiterated elsewhere. It contains the topic and the controlling idea. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essaymaps.com|title=Academic Essay Writing Coach|last=Raver-Lampman|first=Greg|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of thesis statements: direct and indirect. The indirect thesis statements does not state the explicit reasons, while the direct thesis statement does. If I write, "I love New York for three reasons," the fact that I love New York is the topic, and "three reasons" are an indirect thesis statement. The essay will contain the three reasons. If I write, "I love New York because of the food, the jazz clubs and the Broadway Shows," that's a direct thesis statement that tells what each section or body paragraph is going to be about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essaymaps.com|title=Online Academic Essay Writing Coach|last=Raver-Lampman|first=Greg|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="LastUpdated7April2014"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170606015841/https://wts.indiana.edu/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml "How To Write a Thesis Statement"]. ''indiana.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis statement is developed, supported, and explained in the course of the paper by means of examples and [[evidence]]. Thesis statements help organize and develop the body of the writing piece. They let readers know what the writer's statement is and what it is aiming to prove. A thesis statement does not necessarily forecast organization of an essay which can be more complex than its purpose.

==Structure==
The thesis statement will reflect the kind of paper being written. There are three kinds of papers: [[Philosophical analysis|analytical]], [[expository]], and [[argument|argumentative]]. The structure of a thesis statement depends upon the nature of controlling essay type. In simple terms, first a thesis statement will have a main [[topic sentence]] formed from questioning it, then the writer's statement regarding the topic sentence, and finally ends with the specific supporting points detailing the writer's statement for justifying its relation with the topic sentence. In general, it should have a supportable opinion (specific/focused) and clear intent for the essay.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips and Examples for Writing Thesis Statements|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/545/01/|website=Purdue OWL|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timothy Asch''' (July 16, 1932 – October 3, 1994) was a noted [[anthropologist]], [[photographer]], and [[ethnographic film]]maker. Along with [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]] and [[Robert Gardner (anthropologist)|Robert Gardner]], Asch played an important role in the development of [[visual anthropology]]. He is particularly known for his film ''[[The Ax Fight]]'' and his role with the [[USC Center for Visual Anthropology]].

==Background==
Asch was born in Southampton, [[New York (state)|New York]] and attended [[The Putney School]].  He studied at [[Columbia University]], where he received his B.S. in anthropology in 1959.  While at Columbia, he served as a teaching assistant for [[Margaret Mead]], who encouraged his work in [[visual anthropology]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |title=Timothy Asch, 62, Professor Who Filmed Remote Societies |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 October 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/08/obituaries/timothy-asch-62-professor-who-filmed-remote-societies.html |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950-1951, he served apprenticeships with [[Minor White]], [[Edward Weston]] and [[Ansel Adams]] through the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]  (formerly known as the California School of Fine Arts).&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=E.D. |chapter=Introduction: Timothy Asch in America and Australia |title=Timothy Asch and Ethnographic Film |year=2004 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=E.D. |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134336883}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his M.A. in [[African Studies]] from [[Boston University]] (with an anthropology concentration at [[Harvard University]]) in 1964.

==Career==
Asch was known for his work as an ethnographic filmmaker on the [[Yanomami]] in conjunction with [[Napoleon Chagnon]]. He also worked in Indonesia with anthropologists [[Linda Connor]], [[James J. Fox]] and [[E. Douglas Lewis]].

In 1968, Asch and John Marshall co-founded [[Documentary Educational Resources]] (DER), a non-profit organization whose mission is to support, produce, and distribute ethnographic, non-fiction, and documentary films. Asch's film work continues to be distributed through DER.

Asch taught at [[New York University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Harvard University]], and was a Research Fellow at the [[Australian National University]] prior to joining the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in 1982. He became the Director of the ''[[USC Center for Visual Anthropology|Center for Visual Anthropology]]'' after the death of founder [[Barbara Myerhoff]].  During his period at USC, he was involved with the [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]].

Asch acted as Director of the Center for Visual Anthropology up until his death from cancer on October 3, 1994. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071126180156/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/888.html] The Spring 1995 issue of ''Visual Anthropology Review'' (Vol. 11, No.1) was dedicated to Asch.

==Marriage and family==
Asch married Patricia Wood.  Together they acted as partners with other anthropologists in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Indonesia]] to produce films widely used in education and research.  They had four children. They had two daughters,  Caya and Kim (who was adopted from South Korea) and sons Gregory (also known as [[DJ Olive]])  and Alexander.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

'''Zar cave''' ({{lang-az|Zar mağarası}}) is an archaeological site of prehistoric human habitation during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. It is located in the southern part of [[Zar, Azerbaijan|Zar]] village, in [[Kalbajar Rayon]], [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite website

During an archaeological campaign in the [[Kalbajar Rayon]] during 1981 to 1987, [[cave paintings]] of prehistoric humans were discovered. Flint knives, arrowheads and bone combs were also found during the excavations. Traces of dents on discovered boards indicate that they were used for milling wheat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These boards resemble ones found in the [[Tağlar Cave]]. It is assumed that occupants of both caves belong to the same group or are related and have interacted. Numerous of the artifacts and items produced in the [[Tağlar Cave]] were used at the Zar site.

The outer apartments for guests and men are called the ''Mardana''. Conceptually in those that practice [[purdah]] it is the South Asian equivalent of the [[harem]].

Christian missionaries were able to gain access to the zenanas through the [[zenana missions]]; female missionaries who had been trained as doctors and nurses were able to provide these women with health care and also evangelise them in their own homes.

== Mughal court life ==

Physically, the zenana of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court consisted of exceptionally luxurious conditions, particularly for princesses and women associated to high-ranking figures. Because of the extreme restrictions placed on access to the women's quarters, very few reliable accounts of their description are available. Still, modern scholars evaluating court records and travelogues contemporary with the Mughal period detail  the women's lodgings as offering courtyards, ponds, fountains and gardens. The palaces themselves were decorated with mirrors, paintings and marble.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_in_Mughal_India_1526_1748_A_D.html?id=T_mC-s_K-6sC|title=Women in Mughal India|last=Misra|first=Rekha|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal|year=1967|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=76–77|oclc=473530}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahanara Begum|Jahanara]], daughter of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], famously lived in her own apartment decorated with valuable carpets, and murals of flying angels. Other amenities depicted in illustrations of court life include running water and meticulous gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|title=The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, art and culture|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books LTD|location=London|isbn=1861891857|page=155|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7sewQQzOHUC|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resident population ===

Rather than being the prison-like space of licentious activity popularized by European imagination, the zenana functioned as the domain of female members of the household, ranging from wives to concubines to widows, unmarried sisters and cousins, and even further distant relations which were considered dependent kin. In addition to the women of rank, the zenana was populated by attendants of various skill and purpose to provide for the needs of the ladies residing within. All visiting friends, servants, and entertainers were invariably female, down to the highly trained corps of armed guards, known as [[urdubegis]], who were assigned to escort and protect the women in the zenana of [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hambly|first1=Gavin|editor1-last=Hambly|editor1-first=Gavin|title=Women in the medieval Islamic world : Power, patronage, and piety|date=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312224516|pages=429–467|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_in_the_Medieval_Islamic_World.html?id=jDXdyMCx4xYC&amp;source=kp_cover|chapter=Chapter 19: Armed Women Retainers in the Zenanas of Indo-Muslim Rulers: The case of Bibi Fatima}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fatehpur-Fatehpur Sikri India0002.JPG|left|thumb|Fortified entrance to the zenana at [[Fatehpur Sikri]].]]

=== Administration ===
According to [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]], author of the [[Akbarnama]], the zenana of [[Akbar]] at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was home to more than five thousand women, who had each been given her own suite of rooms. The size of the zenana meant that it was a community within itself, and it thus required systematic administration to maintain. Abu'l Fadl describes the zenana as being divided into sections, with (female) [[daroghas]] appointed to tend to the financial and organizational needs of the residents.&lt;ref name="Abu 'l-Fazl Allami"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abu 'l-Fazl Allami|last2=Blochman|first2=H|editor1-last=Phillot|editor1-first=Lieut.

Then there were the [[mahaldars]], the female servant of highest authority chosen from within the ranks of the daroghas, who often acted as an intelligence source from the zenana directly to the emperor. The [[anagas]], or royal wet-nurses, were elevated to positions of rank though their purpose was not strictly administrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jABuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%22Kishori+Saran+Lal%22&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Kishori+Saran+Lal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir5oHA27bNAhVBPiYKHdKzCXEQ6AEIRjAJ|title=The Mughal Harem|last=Lal|first=K.S.|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|year=1988|isbn=8185179034|location=New Delhi|pages=14, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political influence ===
It was because male members of Mughal society did not closely define the concept of purdah as a reflection of their own honor that wives, daughters, and particularly unmarried women in the upper-echelons of the empire were able to extend their influence beyond the physical structures of the zenana. That less-constrictive interpretation of purdah allowed the ladies of the Mughal court to indirectly participate in public life, most notably in civic building projects. Jahanara herself was responsible for the major alteration of [[Shahjahanabad]], by constructing the now famous [[Chandni Chowk]] market. Altogether, wives, daughters, and even a courtesan were the primary patrons to 19 major structures in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Stephen P.|editor1-last=Hambly|editor1-first=Gavin|title=Women in the medieval Islamic world : Power, patronage, and piety|date=1998|publisher=St. Martin’s Press|location=New York|isbn=0312224516|pages=407–428|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_in_the_Medieval_Islamic_World.html?id=jDXdyMCx4xYC|chapter=Chapter 18: Contributors to the urban Landscape: Women builders in Safavid Isfahan and Mughal Shahjahanabad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the cultural precedent set by their [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ancestors, it was comparatively more acceptable for Mughal women to perform civic charity in the form of building projects and even engage in leisure activities outside the zenana like hunting, polo and pilgrimage, than it would have been for their [[Safavid]] contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=The Begims of the Mystic Feast: Turco-Mongol Tradition in the Mughal Harem|jstor=20721773|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=123–147|doi=10.1017/S0021911809992543|last1=Balabanlilar|first1=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nur Jahan]] seems to be unique in that she had a particular affinity for hunting, and was able to gain permission to accompany her husband [[Jahangir]] on several outings, even once killing four tigers easily with her excellent marksmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_in_Mughal_India_1526_1748_A_D.html?id=T_mC-s_K-6sC|title=Women in Mughal India|last=Misra|first=Rekha|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal|year=1967|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=100–101|oclc=473530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adherence to purdah ===
Despite the social freedom that came with being a member of the royal household, Mughal women did not go about unveiled and were not seen by outsiders or men other than their family. Instead, when they traveled they covered their heads and faces in white veils, and they were transported in [[Howdah]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Chaudoles]], carriages and [[Palanquin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with covering on all sides, to maintain the modesty and seclusion required of purdah. When entering or exiting the zenana itself, female pall bearers carried their palanquins, and they were only transferred to male servants and eunuchs outside the walls of the zenana. Should outsiders be required to enter the zenana, as in the case of an illness where the lady could not be moved for her health, the visitor was covered from head to foot in a shroud and led blindly to the lady by a eunuch escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-2TyjzZhZEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=46&amp;f=false|title=Royal Mughal Ladies and their Contributions|last=Mukherjee|first=Soma|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|year=2001|isbn=8121207606|location=New Delhi|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
