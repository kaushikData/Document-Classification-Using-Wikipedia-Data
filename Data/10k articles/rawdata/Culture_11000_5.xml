{{nihongo|'''''69'''''|シクスティナイン|Shikusutinain}} is a [[roman à clef]] novel by [[Ryu Murakami]]. It was published first in 1987. It takes place in 1969, and tells the story of some [[high school]] students coming of age in an obscure [[Japan]]ese city who try to mimic the [[counter-culture]] movements taking place in [[Tokyo]] and other parts of the world.

==Synopsis==
Thirty-two-year-old narrator Kensuke Yazaki takes a nostalgic look back at the year 1969, when he was an ambitious and enthusiastic seventeen-year-old, living in [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], in western [[Kyushu]], where he gets into antics with his equally ambitious and enthusiastic best friends, Iwase and Adama. 
Their priorities are girls, cinema, music, literature, pop culture, organising a [[school festival]] to be called "The Morning Erection Festival", besting teachers and enemies, and finding a way to change the world somehow.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
The [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''[[69 (film)|69]]'' is based on Murakami's novel.

{{Expand Portuguese|A Rosa do Povo|date=July 2012}}
'''''A Rosa do Povo''''' (''The People's Rose'')  is a book of modernist poetry written by the Brazilian writer and poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], between the years of 1943 and 1945. It is the most extensive work of the author, being composed of 55 poems, and considered the first mature work and extensive social expression of lyricism and modernism in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Araújo2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Araújo|first=Vera Romariz Correia de|title=Só ou bem acompanhado? (Reflexões sobre literatura e cultura)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIuyhl1cwXcC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=26 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=UFAL|isbn=978-85-7177-325-7|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered by some as a translation and interpretation of the living time of the author, reflecting not only the individual author at the age and time in which he lived in, but as a collective of the people in Brazilian Society.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Historical Context==
'''A Rosa do Povo'' had been written during the Second World War, in a time where Nazi Germany had been losing battles and retreating from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] due to the increasing advance of Russian Troops, foreshadowing the eventual [[Surrender of Nazi Germany]] and the end and [[Aftermath of World War II]]. Meanwhile, in Brazil [[Getúlio Vargas]] had established the new [[Estado Novo (Brazil)]] government, though economically innovating, had been losing popular support and inspired the author to take in different approaches and views toward Brazilian Life and Society.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10396">'''"As the Stomach Turns"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett &amp; Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection)|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967–68 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977–78. However, the final installment of "As the Stomach Turns" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett &amp; Company''. This was the only installment of "As the Stomach Turns" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.

==Premise==
The sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967–1978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|work=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera, and in this sketch Marion's last name was Clayton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life. For example, Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by the devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. The town exterminator/freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]], using the same faux-Romanian dialect that he would use to play character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) was forced to exorcise the demon from her body, a story that was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.

The sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying "Hello" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.

In addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.

One of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's "ne'er-do-well" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says "Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter," then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.&lt;ref name="emmytvlegends.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).

The sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection)|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.

==Trivia==
* In her 1996 memoir, "As My World Still Turns", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for "As the Stomach Turns".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called "As the Stomach Turns".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the "Stomach Turns" sketch did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of "As the Stomach Turns" as Pocahontas Pirelli, "the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed," which was a play on her hit song of the time, "[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]." She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.
* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.

In 2015, the Archive commissioned ''Fragment'', a film anthology by [[Lav Diaz]], [[U-Wei Haji Saari]], [[Sherman Ong]] and others. It premiered on 30 October at Singapore's [[The Projector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragment World Premiere|url=http://asianfilmarchive.org/10/?events=fragment|website=Asian Film Archive|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2010, a group of Singapore filmmakers, including [[Tan Pin Pin]], [[Royston Tan]] and [[Kelvin Tong]], protested AFA's head [[Tan Bee Thiam]]'s supposed conflict of interest. Their letter led to Tan's resignation as executive director in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frater|first1=Patrick|title=Filmmaker protest movement leads to Tan's AFA departure|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/filmmaker-protest-movement-leads-to-tans-afa-departure|website=Film Business Asia|accessdate=4 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003310/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/filmmaker-protest-movement-leads-to-tans-afa-departure|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26273">{{Assyrian people}}

'''Assyrian culture''' is that of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], an [[Eastern Aramaic]]-speaking people indigenous to [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. The Assyrian people gradually converted from the ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] to [[East Syrian Rite]] [[Christianity]] between the 1st and 4th centuries AD (although the final traces of Mesopotamian religion did not die out until as late as the 17th century AD), and many Assyrian cultural practices today are linked to their Christian faith, together with their ancient [[Mesopotamian]] ancestry and language.

Many Assyrians (estimates of fluent speakers range from 500,000) still speak, read and write distinct [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] influenced dialects of [[Eastern Aramaic]]. They are predominantly adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ancient Church of the East]]. Some are followers of the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. A few Assyrians, though, are [[secular]] or [[irreligious]].

==Annual celebrations==
Throughout the years, Assyrians celebrate many different kinds of traditions within their communities, with the majority of the traditions being tied to religion some way. Some include [[Calendar of Saints|feasts]] ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: hareh) for different patron saints, the [[Nineveh Rogation]] ({{lang|syc|ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܝܐ}}), Ascension day (Syriac: Kaalu d-Sulaqa), and the most popular, the [[Kha b-Nisan]] ({{lang|syr|ܚܕ ܒܢܝܣܢ}}).
Some of these traditions have been practiced by the Assyrians for well over 1,500 years.

===Premta d'Simele; Martyr's Day===
{{main|Simele massacre}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Mardyrsdaysymbol.jpg|thumb|150px|August in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with the number 7 is often the symbol marking martyr's day.]] --&gt;
The [[Simele]] massacre ({{lang|syr|ܦܪܡܬܐ ܕܣܡܠܐ}}: ''Premta d-Simele'') was the first of many [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] committed by the [[Government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] during the systematic targeting of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] of Northern Iraq in August 1933. The killing spree that continued among 63 Assyrian villages in the [[Dohuk Governorate|Dohuk]] and [[Mosul Governorate|Mosul]] districts, led to the deaths of an estimated 3,000 Assyrians.&lt;ref name = "IFHR"&gt;International Federation for Human Rights — "[http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/iq350a.pdf  Displaced persons in Iraqi Kurdistan and Iraqi refugees in Iran]", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AINA"&gt;[http://www.aina.org/books/oadoan.pdf The Origins and Developments of Assyrian Nationalism].&lt;/ref&gt;

August 7 officially became known as ''Martyrs Day'' or ''National Day of Mourning'' by the Assyrian community in memory for the Simele massacre, as it was declared so by the [[Assyrian Universal Alliance]] in 1970. In 2004, the [[Politics of Syria|Syrian government]] banned the Assyrian political organization and the Assyrian community of Syria from commemorating the event, and threatened arrests if any were to break the ban.&lt;ref name = "Zinda"&gt;[http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2004/8.10.04/index_tue.php#GoodMorningAssyria  Good Morning Assyria], Zinda Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, Assyrians in the homeland and in the diaspora get together in local community clubs, and share poems about the incident, revial new art work, etc.

===Resha'D Nisan; Start of Spring or Assyrian New Year===
{{main|Assyrian New Year}}

The Assyrian new year festival, known as ''Resha'D Nisan'' (Literally Translated as the Start of Spring), is celebrated on first day of spring and continues for 12 days. 
 
Celebrations involve holding parades and parties. They also gather in clubs and social institutions and listen to the poets who recite "the story of creation".{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} The men and women wear traditional clothes and dance in parks for hours.
 
After the formation of the [[Turkey|Turkish state]], Resha'D Nisan along with the Kurdish [[Newrouz]] were banned from public to celebrate. Assyrians in Turkey were first allowed to publicly celebrate Resha'D Nisan in 2006, after organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's [[European Union|EU]] membership bid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/bs/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2005/04/11/nb-10 Assyrians Celebrate New Year for First Time in Turkey (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Som Baoutha; Nineveh Feast===
The Nineveh Feast ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: Baoutha d-Ninwaye) is a three-day celebration that is composed of prayers and fasting that Assyrians of [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] (as well as [[The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] and [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] in India) consider sacred. The word Bo'utho/Ba'uta is a  [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word for "pleading", and from this meaning we receive the title of this commemoration. 
This annual observance occurs exactly 3 weeks before the start of lent.  This tradition has been practiced by the Syriac Christians since the 6th century.

In the 6th century, a plague inflicted the Northern regions of modern-day Iraq or what was called at the time, [[Nineveh]]. The plague was devastating the city and the villages surrounding it, and out of desperation the people ran to their bishop to find a solution. The bishop sought help through the scriptures and came upon the story of [[Jonah]] in the [[Old Testament]].

[[Image:Ninevehfeastjonah.jpg|left|thumb|150ppx|Jonah]] In the Old Testament story, [[God]] sent the prophet Jonah to warn the city of Nineveh of great destruction unless they repent for their sins or as it is directly quoted: "the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amathi, saying: Arise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me." Jonah did not wish for Nineveh to be saved since they (the people of Nineveh) were the enemies of [[Israel]] and preferred Nineveh to be destroyed. Instead of listening to God Jonah fled to Tarshish (modern day [[Spain]]), across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. During his voyage a violent storm occurred. The other sailors feared the boat would be completely destroyed and kill everyone if they did not get rid of Jonah. So they decided to throw Jonah overboard.  As soon as Jonah hit the water, a giant fish swallowed Jonah whole. Jonah found himself in the dark, in stomach of the fish. Jonah began to pray earnestly for God to save him. For three days and nights Jonah prayed and asked for forgiveness for his disobedience.

On the third night the fish became violently ill and swam near to the seashore where it vomited Jonah onto the beach. Jonah thankful that he had been spared started on the journey to Nineveh. Reaching the walls of Nineveh, he began preaching to people as he walked through its streets, "In forty days God will destroy this city because of your great sins." The king of [[Assyria]] became disturbed at the message that Jonah preached. He called his people together and commanded them to wear sackcloth clothing and to let neither man nor animals eat as the people prayed and repented of their wicked ways. All of the people of the city cried and prayed and asked God to forgive them for their sins. The city then was not destroyed.

Upon looking at the story the bishop therefore ordered a 3-day fast to ask for God's forgiveness.  At the end of the 3-day fast, the plague had miraculously stopped, therefore, on the 4th day the people rejoiced.

To this day, Assyrians of both faiths, Catholic and Orthodox, both in their original lands and in the diaspora, still observe the fast 3 days each year.

===Somikka; Holy Halloween===
Somikka shares some common themes with the American festival of [[Halloween]], but its meaning is very much different. The main purpose of Somikka is to motivate and discipline Assyrian children to fast during Lent. This is done by scaring children into the discipline of observing lent, when people would abstain from eating eggs, meat and any dairy or animal products for the seven weeks preceding Easter.

The evening before the fast began, or what is called "Somikka night" (Assyrian: Laleh d'Somikka), small groups of young men would dress in scary Halloween like clothes, wearing masks and also carry accessories such as wooden swords and shields. 
These men then would knock on Assyrian homes and scare the children into fasting. The parents in return would give the "Somikka" money (food items in the old times) and tell their children that this was to bribe Somikka off them. They would also warn them that if they broke their fast during Lent, Somikka would come and punish them with misery and a hard life. To the permissive Western mind, this might seem a little abusive, or even cruel. But in the [[Eastern World]], discipline was the hallmark of raising children to grow up into God-fearing and upright adults.

[[Assyrian Villages]] in [[Urmia]] had another custom relating to Lent. The head of every family would stick seven colored feathers into a large onion, the feathers representing the seven weeks of fasting. He would then tie the feathered onion with a string and hang it from the ceiling of their living room, where it would spin every time there was a draft when the door was opened. This attracted attention and served to remind the children of the fast. Every Sunday night he would remove, ceremoniously, one feather to indicate that one week of fasting was over, until all the feathers were gone by Easter night, the last day of fasting, before celebrating the Lord’s Resurrection.

===Kalu d'Sulaqa; Bride of the Ascension===
The legend of Kalu d’Sulaqa/Kaltho d'Suloqo tells of a young Malik Shalita, governor of the Assyrian homeland’s capital Mosul, who was first noticed by Tamerlane after he had successfully fought and defeated his initial attack on the city.  The battle is then described as Assyrian freedom fighters, both Christian and Muslim, defended against the Mongolian attack.

It was during this time that, according to legend, Malik Shalita’s wife organized Assyrian women dressed in white, and was given the responsibility to collect provisions from the nearby towns in order to feed the men fighting at the front. Having heard of the fate that had befallen their countrymen in Tikrit and Mardin, they knew very well the fate in store for them if they were to lose this battle. Instead of running and hiding the women prepared for the battle and joined the ranks of the defenders against hopeless odds.

The historical account is in keeping with the legend, as both describe a brutal battle of attrition, in which both men and women joined together and defended themselves against Tamerlane’s attack. Malik Shalita and his wife - according to the legend dressed in white – are recorded as having been killed in this fateful battle.

The Assyrian historian Arsanous states that the young boys and girls represent the dead young men and women who ascended to heaven because they died for the cause of Christianity and in defence of their homeland. The tragic nature of the 1401 event had left such an indelible impression on the minds of the survivors that they remembered the final battle and have honoured the memory of the fallen by re-enacting the camaraderie of the Assyrian men and women who died defending their homeland.

There are many traditional practices that Assyrians observe when celebrating Kalu Sulaqa (Ascension Day). Most commonly, in Hakkari, prior to the First World War, girls in each village would gather and choose the prettiest one among them to be the Kalu d- Sulaqa / Kaltho d-Suloqo (the Bride of the Ascension) for that year. She would be dressed in a traditional Assyrian wedding costume and then paraded around the village singing and asking for ''gawzeh w-kishmeesheh/yabeesheh'' (walnuts and raisins), which they would then share amongst themselves in a feast held afterwards in honour of the ‘bride’.

Assyrians would celebrate this day like any other “Shahra / Shahro”, with music, dancing, food and drink - but also a few differences. Apart from the little girls dressed as brides there was also a peculiar custom practiced by Assyrians living in Hakkari, whereby ropes were tied to strong branches of large trees common to that district. After this was done, all those present would attempt to climb one, and any not doing so would mean bad luck for them, while anyone reaching the end of the rope and the branch would have the best of luck for the coming year. This was done to represent the Ascension of Christ into Heaven and the eventual resurrection of the dead and final judgment. This custom is seldom practiced today apart from certain areas in the northernmost extremities of Iraq.

In Urmi, on the other hand, it was customary for the little girls in the villages to dress as brides and when doing their rounds of their villages would also ask for pennies or trinkets - although this is only a reflection of the generally greater wealth of the Assyrians in the plains of that region.

It is also said that the very same custom was used during fierce battles. Young girls, dressed as brides, were ordered to take provisions to the men fighting on the battlefield. Their mothers, knowing that they may never return, used this custom to instill courage in their young daughters.

In Syria young girls and boys would join together and form a couple, dressed as bride and a groom, and then go from door to door, singing. They were usually rewarded, not with money or candy, but rather people would give pirdha (wheat), rice, fruits, and so on, then at the end the children would go out to a field to cook and eat what they had collected on the day.

This custom, peculiar to members of the Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church, survives in these communities worldwide and is always marked by a party, often women only. It is also a new custom to hold a mock wedding reception. It is held just like any other traditional Assyrian wedding reception - khigga, slow dance, dinner, cake and all, the only difference being that the Bride, Groom, Best-Man and Matron-of-Honour are all young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atour.com/~aygv/nakosha/nakosha40.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041441/http://www.atour.com/~aygv/nakosha/nakosha40.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage rituals==
Assyrian rituals consist of many different types of elements that have shaped today's modern rituals for the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week and consisted of different rituals for each day. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last for 2 to 3 days while Assyrian weddings in the diaspora go for 1 or 2 days. During the wedding reception most women have a Yalikhta to dance with different colors and noises to distract evil spirits.

===The Blanket Ritual===
A week before the Marriage all the women of the neighborhood and the women in the family go to house of the bride and make her a very big honeymoon blanket. Everybody had to make sure they sewed a bit of that blanket. So the needle would be passed from one woman to the other and this way all the women sewed a bit. The  younger women would dance around it and the older women would sing and dance khigga. During the party food and sweets are served, and the  party ends when the blanket was done.

===The Washing of the Groom===
Also referred to as ''khyapta d'khitna'' or ''zyapta d'khitna''. Before the wedding all the men in the neighborhood and the men who are related to the groom 
go to his house and they cut his hair and shave his face. The groom's male relatives give a him a good scrubbing from head to toe, cleaning him of ''evilness''.  A young boy is usually bathed first, typically by his mother or aunts, then the groom takes a shower or bath afterwards.

===Bridewealth===
[[Bride price]] (''niqda'') is commonly practiced, even among those who reside in the [[western world]]. The tradition would involve the bridegroom's family paying to the father of the bride. The amount of money of the niqda is reached at by [[negotiation]] between groups of people from both families. The [[social state]] of the groom's family influences the amount of the bridewealth that's ought to be paid. When the matter is settled to the contentment of both menages, the groom's father may kiss the hand of the bride's father to express his chivalrous regard and [[gratitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/articles/yoab.htm Assyrian Rituals of Life-Cycle Events by Yoab Benjamin]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== P'alatat Kalo ===
A tradition symbolic of the bride leaving the home of her parents. Usually the bride is in her home taking pictures with family and the groom's family visits to take her out of the home and to the church. While in the house, the women sing tradition lilyaneh and dola and zurna is played as they dance. Before the bride leaves the house, a member of the bride's family usually a cousin, niece/nephew, uncle/aunty etc ... stands at the door and receives an amount of money from a member of the grooms family usually a Father, or brother, the amount is decided by who's holding the door.

===Burakha===

The wedding tradition where the bride and groom are blessed by a priest in a church. The burakha traditionally lasted about four hours, but more recently the event goes for about one hour. Pins in the shape of two crosses are usually placed on the groom's back. There are some details during the ceremony that differ from village to village. The Assyrians of the village of [[Baz, Turkey|Baz]] are known to have someone poke the groom with a needle to ward off any evil spirits while Assyrian from the village of Tyari make noise with the cutting motion of scissors to ward off evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FBMC_Weddings&amp;CISOPTR=625&amp;DMSCALE=29.06977&amp;DMWIDTH=600&amp;DMHEIGHT=600&amp;DMMODE=viewer&amp;DMFULL=0&amp;DMOLDSCALE=6.61376&amp;DMX=0&amp;DMY=0&amp;DMTEXT=&amp;DMTHUMB=1&amp;REC=8&amp;DMROTATE=0&amp;x=63&amp;y=173&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the burakha as the bride and groom are coming out of the church, dola and zorna is played while rice, candies, and coins are thrown at the bride and groom and people take part in traditional Assyrian dances.

===Henna===
[[Henna]] is mud-like material that is prepared on the day before the wedding. On night for the wedding, in the old days all the ladies would gather at the house of the bride (but nowadays it's mixed, also male relatives and family friends are invited.) A bowl is filled with henna. Henna is celebrated differently throughout the Assyrian community.
In some areas, whoever holds the bowl with the henna will dance with it around the others. 
The groom and bride put in the bowl their little finger and their little finger will be wrapped and connected to each other by a ribbon.
In other areas, everyone is given a turn to wrap his finger with henna, and after everyone, the person that is getting henna in his hand starts the chant of praise for the future couple, as everyone else follows him.

==Funeral rituals==
===Ancient===
The burial rituals of the Assyrians is described by [[Surma D'Bait Mar Shimun]] and the manner by which Assyrians of the highland cared for their dead relatives resemble what Olmsted wrote about how the ancient Assyrian cared for theirs. Surma wrote: "In some districts-as in Tkhuma for instance - food is also placed on the graves and in this valley the graves are often made with a little niche in the side of them both for this purpose and for the putting of the light."  &lt;ref name="Shimoun p.40"&gt;S urma D 'beit-mar Shimoun, "Assyrian Church Customs and the Murder of Mar Shimoun", Mar Shimoun Memorial Fund 1983 p.40&lt;/ref&gt; About the burial customs of the ancient Assyrians Olmsted writes: "always the lamp was left in a niche, and even the smoke can still be seen. A large water jar, a jug, and several dishes formed the remainder of the equipment needed for the after-life..." &lt;ref&gt;A.T. Olsmtead, "History of Assyria" The University of Chicago Press 1968 third edition p.625&lt;/ref&gt; Surma further adds; On the morning of the resurrection day before day light Assyrians in the highland visited the graves of their loved ones and lighted tapers on their resting site. The usual greeting at this time was "light to your departed".&lt;ref name="Shimoun p.40" /&gt;

===Contemporary===
In the modern tradition, the [[mourning]] family host guests in an open house style just after a loved one passes way. Only [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] coffee and tea are served, showcasing the sorrowful state of the family. Symbolically, some will not drink the coffee in front of them at all. On the funeral day, a memorial mass is held in the church. At the graveyard, the people gather and burn [[incense]] around the grave as [[clergy]] chant [[hymn]]s in the [[Syriac language]]. The closest female relatives traditionally bewail or [[lament]] (''bilyaya'') in a public display of grief, with some beating their chest, as the casket descends. Other women may sing a [[dirge]] or a sentimental [[threnody]] (''jnana'', which are short, rhymed chants) to passionately heighten the mood of the mourning at the cemetery. [[Zurna]] and [[davul]] may be used if the departed is a young, unmarried male.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/articles/yoab.htm Assyrian Rituals of Life-Cycle Events] by Yoab Benjamin&lt;/ref&gt;

During all these occasions, everyone is expected to dress in complete black, passively informing the community that they have recently buried a loved one. Following the burial, everyone would return to the church hall for afternoon lunch and [[eulogy]]. At the hall, the closest relatives sit on a long table facing the guests (akin to a bridegroom’s table at a wedding) as many people walk by before leaving shaking hands, offering their condolences. At the hall, [[date (fruit)|dates]] and [[halva]] may served to offer some "sweetness" in the bitter grieving period. On the third day, mourners would customarily visit the grave site with a [[pastor]] to burn incense, symbolising Jesus’ triumph over death on the third day, and 40 days after the funeral (representing Jesus ascending to heaven), and in conclusion one year to the date. Mourners also wear only black until the 40 day mark, with no jewellery and would typically not dance or celebrate any major events for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Troop, Sarah. “The Hungry Mourner.” Modern Loss, 22 Jul 2014. Web. 24 Jan 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Attack From Atlantis''''' (1953) is a [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Lester del Rey]]. The story follows the new ''U.S.S. Triton'' submarine on her maiden voyage, but trouble happens when the crew comes face to face with the inhabitants of the underwater city [[Atlantis]].

''Attack from Atlantis'' is one of the thirty-five juvenile novels that comprise the [[Winston Science Fiction]] set, which novels were published in the 1950s for a readership of teen-aged boys. The typical protagonist in these books was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers.

The story is set partly on the atomic powered submarine Triton. In the foreword, titled "Land Under the Sea", the author, although not a proper scientist, mentions the first real-life atomic sub: "The [[Nautilus]] is already being built. And just as this is being written, word has come that the first tests of an atomic power plant for the ship have been successful" (ix). del Rey spends quite some time in his novel trying to explain the difference between the engine on the real nuclear submarine of the [[Nautilus]] and that of his own, fictional ''U.S.S. Triton''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Attack-Atlantis-Lester-Del-Rey/dp/0345305019&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Certain crystals obtained from undersea volcanoes, when stimulated by small amounts of electricity, generate a forcefilm bubble that excludes liquids and solids with unlimited force. During the last Ice Age the Cro-Magnon ancestors of the Atlanteans discovered the forcefilm bubbles by accident, but then, through trial and error, developed the technology that enabled them to use the bubbles to live under the sea.

==Plot summary==
At age seventeen, Don Miller is already an accomplished electronics technician, helping his uncle, Dr. Edward Simpson, with the testing of a new kind of submarine, the ''Triton I''. Accompanied everywhere by his dog Shep, a [[schipperke]], he has assumed that he would be aboard the boat for its sea trials, though he mans the communications gear on the surface support ship during the submarine's first test run somewhere south of Puerto Rico. That test run is commanded by Dr. Oliver Drake, who designed the submarine's new nuclear propulsion system. The test run is successful, in spite of some problems with the control systems and stress on certain crew members that has made them believe that they have seen, on the television screens that give a view of the outside of the submarine, men encased in form-fitting bubbles.

For the full test run the Triton will descend into the [[Milwaukee Deep]], north of Puerto Rico. Because the United States Navy has taken an interest in Triton and has partly funded her development, the commanding officer on the test run will be Admiral Robert Haller. Dexter, the president's science advisor, and Senator Kenney are to accompany the crew as observers. Another of the observers going along is Sid Upjohn, a reporter. As they descend they find that they are losing control of the boat and, further, that they are being rammed by a whale. Unable to maneuver, they come down on an undersea plateau, twelve hundred fathoms (7200 feet) below the surface. Again they catch glimpses of men encased in bubbles, something that should be impossible. Emerging from the submarine in a bathysuit, Don makes the necessary repairs and the Triton leaves the plateau to head for the surface.

Now the bubble-men attack openly in full force, cementing rocks to Triton's hull to drive her down again. Again the crew bring their boat down on the plateau where they had stopped for repairs. Again Don prepares to go out in the bathysuit to remove the rocks, but the bubble-men, which the crew have taken to calling Atlanteans, have sealed the hatch through which the bathysuit must emerge. As the crew watches helplessly through their closed-circuit televisions, the Atlanteans attach thick ropes to the submarine and then bring in [[ichthyosaurs]] that have evolved to breathe water to tow the boat off the plateau. As they pull Triton deeper, the Atlanteans envelope the boat in a forcefilm bubble, obliging the navigator, Kayne, to shut down the engines. Even with the boat being towed, without power, the helmsman, Paul Cavanaugh, continues to steer the boat to give them a smoother ride.

Three miles below the surface they come to a town of about 20,000 people that they call [[Atlantis]]. Lying under a larger version of the bubbles that enclose the people surrounding the submarine, the town is illuminated by some [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] substance. There Triton is towed through the forcefilm dome that covers the town and into a pool large enough to accommodate her. Then the Atlanteans break into the boat and take the crew prisoner, knocking them out with some kind of electric stungun.

Don regains consciousness in a cell where he meets Muggins, an American whom the Atlanteans had rescued from a ship sunk in the war, fifty years previously. Muggins tells Don that the people call their town Mlayanu and he introduces him to K'mith, the president of Mlayanu. Don discovers that K'mith, his family, and several other Atlanteans speak English, having learned it from Muggins in order to read the books that they find in sunken ships and to understand the radio messages that they pick up occasionally through a floating antenna.

Because Shep resembles the dog-god that the more superstitious Atlanteans worship, it is decided that Don and Shep will live with K'mith and his family. In K'mith's home he meets K'mith's wife and twelve-year-old daughter and his nephew S'neifa, the son of his deceased older brother K'mayo, who had rescued Muggins. As Don gets settled into K'mith's house, S'neifa tells him how an outcast European tribe, some 28,000 years ago, made some accidental discoveries that enabled them to live underwater and develop the Atlantean civilization. Because he's under eighteen, the Atlanteans assume that Don is uneducated, but S'neifa suspects and then confirms the truth. He then gives Don a copy of a radio message that the Atlanteans have picked up: it tells Don that the garbled distress call from Triton had been misinterpreted and that the United States has accused another country of capturing the submarine.

Later Don goes for a walk with Shep and finds the building where the town's dome is created and controlled open and unguarded. Sneaking around inside the building, he discerns how the system works and he takes a discarded diagram as he leaves. That evening he takes the diagram to show to Dr. Drake and his uncle. Little can be gleaned from the diagram, but the men do discern that the forcefilm could protect a city from a nuclear attack. Returning to K'mith's house, Don tells K'mith of the discovery, but K'mith already knows about it. As for Don's plea to let the Triton and her crew return to the surface, K'mith shows Don another intercepted radio message: the United States and the country it had accused of taking the Triton have exchanged ultimatums and nuclear war is less than a week away.

That night S'neifa brings Don a bubble suit so that he can free the Triton's crew from the small bubble-dome in which they are imprisoned. At a certain signal S'neifa will activate the forcefilm bubble around Triton so that she can escape her confinement in Mlayanu. All goes well until several fights break out. Kayne and Senator Kenney reach the submarine, board her, and give the signal. S'neifa activates the forcefilm and Kayne takes the boat out of Mlayanu, leaving Don and the rest of the crew behind to be recaptured. Later Kayne and Kenney are brought into the jail, having been recaptured just after reaching the surface.

Kept in a cell separate from the rest of Triton's crew, Don asks Muggins to bring him some metal tubing and tools so that he can make a tin whistle to pass the time. He then makes an ultrasonic dog whistle, which he uses to call Shep. After several incidents when Shep comes at his call the dog is chained up and then begins to howl when Don calls him. An angry mob forces K'mith and the dome technicians to allow Don to designate the dome-control building as the dog-god's shrine. Don then uses a signal generator that he had retrieved from Triton to modulate the current creating the dome forcefilm, causing a loud hum and salt rain to come from the dome and terrify the mob. Don then discovers that K'mith has had his own agenda which meshes perfectly with what Don had intended: the Atlanteans have been unable to find any more of the crystals that they need and he had hoped that scientists on the surface world might be able to make more. Don assures him that they can and will. Thus Don and the crew of the Triton are released and the Triton, fitted with a forcefilm that will allow the boat's engines to run when it is turned on, leave Myalanu with K'mith and S'neifa aboard.

[[File:Bob Dylan - Great White Wonder.png|thumb|250px|The first popular [[rock music|rock]] bootleg, [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', released in July 1969]]
A ''' bootleg recording''' is an [[sound recording|audio]] or [[video]] recording of a performance that was not officially released by the artist or under other legal authority. The process of making and distributing such recordings is known as '''bootlegging'''. Recordings may be copied and traded among fans of the artist without financial exchange, but some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit, sometimes by adding professional-quality sound engineering and packaging to the raw material. Bootlegs usually consist of either unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with an unpredictable level of quality.

The concept of releasing unauthorised performances had been established before the 20th century, but reached new levels of popularity with [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', a compilation of studio outtakes and demos released in 1969 using low-priority pressing plants. The following year, the [[Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Live'r Than You'll Ever Be]]'', an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Subsequent bootlegs became more sophisticated in packaging, particularly the [[Trademark of Quality]] label with [[William Stout]]'s cover artwork. [[Compact disc]] bootlegs first appeared in the 1980s, and [[internet]] distribution became increasingly popular in the 1990s.

Changing technologies have affected the recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry. The [[copyright]]s for the song and the right to authorise recordings often reside with the artist, according to several international [[copyright treaty table|copyright treaties]]. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide officially released alternatives to satisfy the demand.

==Definitions==
The word "bootleg" originates from the practice of smuggling illicit items in the legs of tall boots, particularly the smuggling of alcohol during the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]] era. The word, over time, has come to refer to any illegal or illicit product. This term has become an umbrella term for illicit, unofficial, or unlicensed recordings, including vinyl LPs, silver CDs, or any other commercially sold media or material.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=6}} The alternate term ROIO (an [[acronym]] meaning "Recording of Indeterminate / Independent Origin) or VOI (Video....) arose among [[Pink Floyd]] collectors, to clarify the recording source and copyright status was hard to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Netmusic: your complete guide to rock and more on the Internet and online services|first=Ben|last=Greenman|publisher=Random House|year=1995|page=159|isbn=978-0-679-76385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unofficial and unlicensed recordings had existed before the 1960s, the very first rock bootlegs came in plain sleeves with the title [[rubber stamp]]ed on it.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=45}} However, they quickly developed into more sophisticated packaging, in order to distinguish the manufacturer from inferior competitors.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=92}} With today's packaging and desktop publishing technology, even the layman can create "official" looking CDs. With the advent of the [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[CD-R]], however, some bootlegs are traded privately with no attempt to be manufactured professionally. This is even more evident with the ability to share bootlegs via the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=483}}

Bootlegs should not be confused with ''counterfeit'' or ''unlicensed'' recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that ''any'' record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=7}}

[[File:Who's Zoo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Who's Zoo'' compiled early singles and B-sides by [[The Who]], which had not been commercially released in the U.S. Like several [[Trademark of Quality]] bootlegs, it featured cover artwork by [[William Stout]].]]
The most common type is the live bootleg, or audience recording, which is created with [[sound recording]] equipment smuggled into a [[concert|live concert]]. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collectible '70s: A Price Guide to the Polyester Decade|publisher=Krause Publications|page=44|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4402-2748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bootlegs may be [[soundboard recording]]s taken directly from a multi-track [[mixing console]] used to feed the [[public address system]] at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this,{{efn|A bootleg of [[Bruce Springsteen]] was distributed after the band's sound engineer left a cassette in his car while it was being repaired. A bootlegger copied the cassette during the work, then returned it without arousing suspicion.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=278}}}} which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified and sent to the desk.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=256}}

Some bootlegs consist of private or professional studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including [[demo (music)|demos]], works-in-progress or discarded material. These might be made from private recordings not meant to be widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a [[recording studio]] or the offices of a [[record label]], or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=44}} A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted records]], such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The ''Who's Zoo'' bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album ''[[Odds And Sods]]'', which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the ''[[Nuggets (series)|Nuggets]]'' series of albums.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=196}}

==History==

===Pre-1960s===
According to enthusiast and author [[Clinton Heylin]], the concept of a bootleg record can be traced back to the days of [[William Shakespeare]], where unofficial transcripts of his plays would be published.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=17}} At that time, society was not particularly interested in who a particular author was, but the "cult of authorship" became established in the 19th century, resulting the first [[Berne Convention]] in 1886 to cover copyright. The US did not agree to the original terms, resulting in many "piratical reprints" of sheet music being published there by the end of the century.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=20–21}}

During the early 20th century,  [[film soundtrack]]s were often bootlegged; if the officially released soundtrack had been re-recorded with a house orchestra, there would be demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of [[Judy Garland]] performing ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', before [[Betty Hutton]] replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=37}} The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] took a dim view of unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=31}} The Wagern-Nichols Home Recordist Guild recorded numerous performances at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] and [[Columbia Records]] (who held the official rights to the recordings), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=32}}

===1960s===
[[File:Kum Back.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Kum Back]]'', a collection of recordings by [[The Beatles]] in early 1969, appeared before the official release of ''[[Let It Be]]''.]]

The first popular rock music bootleg resulted from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing from the public eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, and the release of ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in [[Los Angeles]]. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a [[reel to reel tape]] containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if it would be possible to manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with ''Great White Wonder'' rubber stamped on it.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=45}} Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with [[Bob Dylan bootleg recordings|numerous releases]].{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=394}}

[[File:The Rolling Stones - Live'r Than You'll Ever Be original.jpg|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Live'r Than You'll Ever Be]]'', released in late 1969, received a rave review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'']]
When The Rolling Stones announced their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1969|1969 American tour]], their first in the U.S. for several years, an enterprising bootlegger known as "Dub" decided to record some of the shows. He purchased a [[Sennheiser]] 805 [["shotgun" microphone]] and a [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] 4000 reel to reel [[tape recorder]] specifically for recording the performances, smuggling them into the venues.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=60}} The resulting bootleg, ''Live'r Than You'll Ever Be'', was released shortly before Christmas 1969, mere weeks after the tour had finished, and in January 1970 received a rave review in ''Rolling Stone'', who described the sound quality as "superb, full of presence, picking up drums, bass, both guitars and the vocals beautifully&amp;nbsp;... it is the ultimate Rolling Stones album".{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=61}} The bootleg sold several tens of thousands of copies, orders of magnitude more than a typical classical or opera bootleg,{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=65}} and its success resulted in the official release of the live album ''[[Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert|Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]]'' later in the year. "Dub" was one of the founders of the [[Trade Mark of Quality]] (TMOQ or TMQ) bootleg record label.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=66}}

===1970s===
During the 1970s the bootleg industry in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of stadium rock or [[arena rock]]. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as [[Kornyfone]] and TMQ.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=102}}  The large followings of rock artists created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on [[gramophone record|vinyl]], as it became evident that more and more fans were willing to purchase them.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=117}} In addition, the huge crowds which turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of covert recording equipment difficult. [[Led Zeppelin]] quickly became a popular target for bootleggers on the strength and frequency of their live concerts; ''[[Live on Blueberry Hill]]'', recorded at the [[LA Forum]] in 1970, was sufficiently successful to incur the wrath of manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]].{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=69–70}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]] recorded numerous concerts for radio broadcast in the 1970s, which resulted in many Springsteen bootlegs.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=116–117}}

[[File:Dark side of the moo.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Pink Floyd]] bootleg ''[[The Dark Side of the Moo]]'' collected early singles and B-sides. When released, it was the only way to hear the studio version of "[[Astronomy Domine]]" in the U.S, as it was not included on the U.S. issue of ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'']]
Some bootleggers noticed rock fans that had grown up with the music in the 1960s wanted rare or unreleased recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of ''[[Golden Eggs]]'', a bootleg of outtakes by [[The Yardbirds]] had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's [[Keith Relf]] for the sequel, ''[[More Golden Eggs]]''.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=98}} Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become [[The Band]]) at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=73–74,76}}

In [[Los Angeles]] there were a number of record mastering and pressing plants that were not "first in line" to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These pressing plants were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=63}} Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1974 Pink Floyd bootleg called ''Brain Damage'' was released under the name The Screaming Abadabs, which was one of the band's early names.&lt;ref name="Backtrax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backtrax-records.co.uk/floydboots/pages/history.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070203141848/http://backtrax-records.co.uk/floydboots/pages/history.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2007 |title=A Brief History Of Bootlegs |accessdate=23 September 2009 |last=Slugbelch |first= |year= |month= |work=The Pink Floyd Vinyl Bootleg Guide |publisher=Backtrax Records }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to get records and covers pressed unquestioned by these pressing plants, bootleggers were able to produce artwork and packaging that a commercial label would be unlikely to issue – perhaps most notoriously the 1962 recording of The Beatles at the Star Club in [[Hamburg]], which was bootlegged as ''[[The Beatles vs. the Third Reich]]'' (a parody on an early US album entitled ''[[The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons]]''), or ''[[Elvis' Greatest Shit]]'', a collection of the least successful of [[Elvis Presley]]'s recordings, mostly from film soundtracks.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=188}}

Bootleg collectors in this era generally relied on ''[[Hot Wacks]]'', an annual underground magazine listing known bootlegs and information about recent releases. It provided the true information on bootlegs with fictitious labels, and included details on artists and track listings, as well as the source and sound quality of the various recordings.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=130–131}}{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=105}}

Initially, knowledge of bootlegs and where to purchase them spread by word of mouth.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=174}} The pioneering bootlegger Rubber Dubber sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in an attempt to get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, [[Columbia Records]] objected, Rubber Dubber counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=103}} Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap [[photocopying|photocopies]]. The packaging became more sophisticated towards the end of the decade and continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Galloway"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.moremusic.co.uk/links/features/bootleg.htm| title = Bootlegs, an insight into the shady side of music collecting| accessdate = 23 September 2006| last = Galloway| first = Simon| year = 1999| month =| work =| publisher = ''More Music'' e-zine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Punk rock]] saw a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg ''[[Spunk (album)|Spunk]]'', a series of outtakes by [[The Sex Pistols]]. The album received a good review from [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]' Chas de Whalley, who said it was "an album that no self-respecting rock fan would turn his nose up at."{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=170}}

===1980s===
[[File:Prince Brussels 1986.jpg|thumb|The ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|Black Album]]'' by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was withdrawn from sale shortly before its official release date in December 1987, becoming a popular bootleg.]]
The 1980s saw the increased use of audio cassettes and [[videotape]]s for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private [[dubbing (transferring)|dubbing]] equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=79}} Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. [[Cassette culture]] and [[tape trading]], propelled by the [[DIY ethic]] of the [[punk subculture]], relied on an [[honour system]] where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=123–4}} For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the [[Glastonbury Festival]] sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, by the end of the 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=428}}&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt;

One of the most critically acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is ''[[The Black Album (Prince)|The Black Album]]'' by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. The album was to have been a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of R&amp;B and Soul: Smokey Robinson and the Miracles ; The Temptations ; The Supremes ; Stevie Wonder|first=Bob|last=Gulla|p=494|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-313-34046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=163}} Towards the end of the 1980s, the ''[[Ultra Rare Trax]]'' series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that [[digital remastering]] onto [[compact disc]] could produce a high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=282–3}}

===1990s–present===
Following the success of ''Ultra Rare Trax'', the 1990s saw an increased production of bootleg CDs, including reissues of shows that had been recorded decades previously. In particular, companies in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] exploited the more relaxed [[copyright]] laws in those countries by pressing large numbers of CDs and including catalogs of other titles on the inlays, making it easier for fans to find and order shows direct.&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt;{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=369}} Similarly, relaxed copyright laws in [[Australia]] meant that the most serious legal challenge to unauthorised releases were made on the grounds of [[trademark]] law by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1993. Court findings were in favour of allowing the release of unauthorised recordings clearly marked as "unauthorised". The updated [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT 1994]] agreement soon closed this so-called "protection gap" in all three aforementioned countries effective 1 January 1995.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=279}}

By this time, the [[internet]] had increased in popularity, and bootleg review sites began to appear. The quality control of bootlegs began to be scrutinised, as a negative review of one could adversely harm sales.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=458}} Bootlegs began to increase in size, with multi-CD packages being common. In 1999, a 4-CD set was released containing three and a half hours of recording sessions for the [[Beach Boys]]' "[[Good Vibrations]]", spanning seven months.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=462}}

The tightening of laws and increased enforcement by police on behalf of the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as [[tax evasion]]—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground.&lt;ref name="Galloway" /&gt; Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as [[eBay]], and other specialised websites, though by the end of the decade, eBay had clamped down on bootlegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=ebay+bootlegs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh0cCBjOvJAhUCOBQKHdOZDn4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ebay%20bootlegs&amp;f=false|title=half.com, buy.com Team on Latest Used Goods Sites|work=Billboard|date=18 November 2000|p=115|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1990s saw an increase in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of [[audio file format]]s such as [[MP3]] and [[Real Audio]], combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of [[Napster]] in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=476}} Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were [[ripping|ripped]] to computer hard disks, and new material was created with [[digital recording]] of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and [[downloading]] bootlegs of individual songs.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Keith.

''NPF Magazine''.  November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while [[King Crimson]]'s [[Robert Fripp]] and, infamously, [[Metallica]] were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|pp=478–9}}

The rise in popularity of the video sharing website [[YouTube]] has caused it to be a major carrier of bootleg recordings. YouTube's owner, [[Google]] believes that under the "safe-harbor" provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content, allowing bootleg media to be hosted on it without fear of a lawsuit. As the technology to host videos is open and available, shutting down YouTube may simply mean the content migrates elsewhere.{{sfn|Hilderbrand|2009|p=242}} An audience recording of one of [[David Bowie]]'s last concerts before he retired from touring in 2004 was uploaded to YouTube and received a positive review in ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bootleg-of-the-week-david-bowie-live-in-atlantic-city-5-29-04-20151204|title=Bootleg of the Week: David Bowie Live in Atlantic City 5/29/04|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|date=4 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, YouTube removed a 15-minute limit on videos, which has allowed entire concerts to be uploaded by fans and bootleggers.&lt;ref name=knopper&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/top-artists-adjust-to-new-world-of-youtube-bootlegs-20121217|title=Top Artists Adjust to New World of YouTube Bootlegs|first=Steve|last=Knopper|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 December 2012|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.{{sfn|Heylin|2010|p=289}}

In the US, bootlegs had been a grey area in legality, but the 1976 Copyright Act extended copyright protection to all recordings, including "all misappropriated recordings, both counterfeit and pirate". This meant bootleggers would take a much greater risk, and several were arrested.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=125}} Bootlegs have been prohibited by federal law (17 USC 1101) since the introduction of the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] (URAA, PL 103-465) in 1994, as well as by state law. The federal bootleg statute does not pre-empt state laws, which also apply both prior to and since the passage of the federal bootleg statute. The ''[[US v. Martignon]]'' case challenged the constitutionality of the federal bootleg statute, and in 2004, U.S. District Judge [[Harold Baer Jr.]] struck down the port banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Official releases==
{{main|List of commercially released bootlegs}}
[[File:Springsteen Jersey Devil.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bruce Springsteen]] has mixed feelings over bootlegs of his popular live performances.]]
Record companies have described bootlegs as "grey area, live recordings", describing them as "semi-condoned".{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=106}} Research into bootleg consumers found that they are committed fans of the artist; a study of Bruce Springsteen fans showed 80% felt some bootlegs were essential purchases despite owning every official release.{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=106}} Springsteen has said he understands why fans buy bootlegs, but dislikes the market due to the lack of quality control and making profit over pleasing fans.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=136}} [[Frank Zappa]] hated bootlegs and wished to control his recordings, so he created the [[Beat The Boots]] boxed sets, each containing eight LPs that were direct copies of existing bootlegs. He set up a hotline for fans to report bootlegs and was frustrated that the FBI were not interested in prosecuting. The first set included ''As An Am Zappa'', in which he can be heard complaining about bootleggers releasing new material before he could.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|pp=195,395}}

Throughout their career, the [[Grateful Dead]] were known to tolerate taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, and the concept of taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=156}} They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=157}} The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product.{{sfn|Heylin|1994|p=397}} In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality.{{sfn|Cummings|2013|p=158}} Other bands, including [[Pearl Jam]], [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]] tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.{{sfn|Shuker|2013|p=105}}

Many recordings first distributed as bootleg albums were later released officially by the copyright holder. Provided the official release matches the quality of the bootleg, demand for the latter can be suppressed. One of the first rock bootlegs, containing [[John Lennon]]'s performance with the [[Plastic Ono Band]] at the 1969 [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]], was released officially as ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'' by the end of the year, effectively killing sales of the bootleg.{{sfn|Heylin|1994}} The release of Bob Dylan's 1966 ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|Royal Albert Hall]]'' concert on Vol. 4 of his Bootleg Series in 1998 included both the acoustic and electric sets, more than any bootleg had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-bootleg-series-vol-4-the-royal-albert-hall-concert-mw0000600853|title=The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Dave Matthews Band released ''Busted Stuff'' in response to the Internet-fuelled success of ''[[The Lillywhite Sessions]]'' which they had not intended to release. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] released 100 bootlegs for sale as downloads on the band's official website, with profits going to the [[Mercury Phoenix Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econsultancy.com/press-releases/496-queen-take-on-the-bootleggers-with-download-of-own|title=Queen take on the Bootleggers with downloads of their own|publisher=EConsultancy|date=11 November 2004|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the recording of concerts by [[King Crimson]] and its guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] is prohibited, Fripp's music&amp;nbsp;company [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) sells concert recordings as downloads, especially "archival recordings" produced from the recordings from the concerts' [[mixing console]]s. With an even greater investment of [[sound engineering]], DGM has released "official bootlegs", which are produced from one or more fan bootlegs.&lt;ref name="Bambarger86" &gt;{{harvtxt|Bambarger|1998|p=86}}: {{cite journal|title=Fripp&amp;nbsp;label does it his way: Guitarist follows own muse in business, too |last=Bambarger|first=Bradley |journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Fripp+label+does+it+his+way:+Guitarist+follows+own+muse+in+business,+too#v=onepage&amp;q=Fripp%20label%20does%20it%20his%20way%3A%20Guitarist%20follows%20own%20muse%20in%20business%2C%20too&amp;f=false|volume=110|pages=13 and&amp;nbsp;86|date = 11 July 1998|ref=harv|issue=28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  DGM's [[reverse engineering]] of the [[fence (criminal)|distribution-networks]] for bootlegs helped it to make a successful transition to an age of digital distribution, "unique" (in 2009) among music labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|first=''Belfast Telegraph''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20648653.html|title=Jam and the joys of music distribution in today's world|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media PLC|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012|ref=harv|id=(subscription required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, artists responded to the demand for recordings of live shows by experimenting with the sale of authorized bootlegs made directly from the soundboard, with a superior quality to an audience recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusic.com/encore/|title=The Encore Series|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher =themusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica, Phish and Pearl Jam have been regularly distributing instant live bootlegs of their concerts. In 2014, Springsteen announced he would allow fans to purchase a [[USB stick]] at concerts, which could be used to download a bootleg of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-formalizes-plans-for-instant-live-bootlegs-20140117|title=Bruce Springsteen Formalizes Plans for Instant Live Bootlegs|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in ''Rolling Stone'', many artists have now concluded that the volume of bootlegged performances on YouTube in particular is so large that it is counterproductive to enforce it, and they should use it as a marketing tool instead. Music lawyer Josh Grier has said "Most of the artists have kind of conceded to it."&lt;ref name=knopper/&gt; [[Justin Bieber]] has embraced the distribution of video clips via [[Twitter]] in order to increase his fanbase.&lt;ref name=knopper/&gt;

'''Boston Blackie''' is a fictional character created by author Jack Boyle (October 19, 1881 &amp;ndash; October 1928). Blackie, a jewel thief and [[safecracker]] in Boyle's stories, became a detective in adaptations for films, radio and television—an "enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend."

Actor [[Chester Morris]] was the best-known Blackie, playing the character in 14 [[Columbia Pictures]] films (1941–1949) and in a 1944 [[NBC Red Network|NBC]] radio series. Boston Blackie is the role for which Morris is best remembered.

==Literature==
Writer Jack Boyle grew up in Chicago, Illinois. While working as a newspaper reporter in San Francisco, he became an opium addict, was drawn into crime, and was jailed for writing bad checks. Later convicted of robbery, Boyle was serving a term in [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] when he created the character of Boston Blackie.&lt;ref name="Backer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Backer |first=Ron |date=2010 |title=Mystery Movie Series of 1940s Hollywood |location=Jefferson, North Carolina, and London |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=978-0-7864-4864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|149}} The first four stories appeared in ''[[The American Magazine]]'' in 1914, with Boyle writing under the [[pen name]] "No. 6066". From 1917 to 1919, Boston Blackie stories appeared in ''[[Redbook|The Red Book]]'' magazine, and from 1918 they were adapted for motion pictures.

When Boston Blackie began to find success on the screen, Boyle edited the ''Red Book'' magazine stories into a book, ''Boston Blackie'' (1919). He revised and rearranged the order of the stories to create a cohesive narrative—a common practice at the time. This was the only appearance of Boston Blackie in book form, but his adventures continued to appear in periodicals.&lt;ref name="Backer"/&gt;{{Rp|149–150}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=Jack |date=1919 |title=Boston Blackie |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100338414 |location=New York |publisher=[[A.

[[File:Boston Blackie's Little Pal (1918) - 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rhea Mitchell]] (Mary) and [[Bert Lytell]] (Boston Blackie) in ''Boston Blackie's Little Pal'' (1918), a lost film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BostonBlackiesLittlePa1918.html |title=Boston Blackie's Little Pal |website=Progressive Silent Film List |publisher=Silent Era |access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest Boston Blackie film adaptations were silent, dating from 1918 to 1927. [[Columbia Pictures]] revived the property in 1941 with ''[[Meet Boston Blackie]]'', a fast, 58-minute [[B movie]] starring [[Chester Morris]]. Although the running time was brief, Columbia gave the picture good production values and an imaginative director, [[Robert Florey]]. The film was successful, and a series followed.

In the Columbia features, Boston Blackie is a reformed jewel thief who is always suspected when a daring crime is committed. In order to clear himself, he investigates personally and brings the actual culprit to justice, sometimes using disguises. An undercurrent of comedy runs throughout the action/detective series.

In one of these films, ''[[After Midnight with Boston Blackie]]'', the character's real name was revealed to be Horatio Black.

Morris gave the Blackie character his own personal charm: he could be light and flippant or stern and dangerous, as the situation demanded. His sidekick, the Runt, was always on hand to help his old friend. [[George E. Stone]] played Runt in all but the first and last films. Charles Wagenheim and Sid Tomack, respectively, substituted for Stone when he was not available.

Blackie's friendly adversaries were Inspector Farraday{{efn|The surname of Boston Blackie's police adversary was spelled Faraday in only the first film, ''[[Meet Boston Blackie]]''. In all subsequent films it was spelled Farraday.&lt;ref name="AFI Meet"/&gt;}} of the police (played in all the films and the radio series by [[Dick Lane (TV announcer)|Richard Lane]]) and his assistant, Sergeant Matthews. Matthews was originally played as a hapless victim of circumstance by [[Walter Sande]]; he was replaced by [[Lyle Latell]], who played it dumber, and then by comedian [[Frank Sully]], who played it even dumber.

Blackie and Runt were often assisted in their endeavors by their friends: the cheerful but easily flustered millionaire Arthur Manleder (almost always played by [[Lloyd Corrigan]]; Harry Hayden and Harrison Greene each played the role once), and the streetwise pawnbroker Jumbo Madigan (played by [[Cy Kendall]] or [[Joseph Crehan]]). A variety of actresses including [[Rochelle Hudson]], [[Harriet Nelson|Harriet Hilliard]], [[Adele Mara]] and [[Ann Savage (actress)|Ann Savage]] took turns playing various gal-Friday characters.

The films are highly typical of Columbia's [[B movie]]s of the 1940s, with an assortment of veteran character actors (including [[Clarence Muse]], [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]], [[George Lloyd (actor)|George Lloyd]], [[Byron Foulger]]), new faces on the way up ([[Larry Parks]], [[Dorothy Malone]], [[Nina Foch]], [[Forrest Tucker]], [[Lloyd Bridges]]) and stock-company players familiar from Columbia's features, serials, and short subjects ([[Kenneth MacDonald (American actor)|Kenneth MacDonald]], George McKay, [[Eddie Laughton]], [[John Tyrrell (actor)|John Tyrrell]]). The series was also a useful training ground for promising directors, including [[Edward Dmytryk]], [[Oscar Boetticher]], [[William Castle]], and finally [[Seymour Friedman]], who went on to work prolifically in Columbia's television department. The Boston Blackie series ran until 1949.

A new incarnation of the ''Boston Blackie'' radio series aired April 11, 1945 – October 25, 1950, starring [[Richard Kollmar]]. [[Maurice Tarplin]] played Inspector Farraday; [[Jan Miner]] was Mary.

[[Kent Taylor]] starred in the [[Ziv Television Programs|Ziv]]-produced half-hour TV series ''The Adventures of Boston Blackie''.

==Graphic novels==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Scripter [[Stefan Petrucha]] and artist Kirk Van Wormer created the graphic novel ''Boston Blackie'' ([[Moonstone Books]], 2002) with a cover by Tim Seelig. A jewel heist at a costume ball goes horribly wrong, and the five-year-old son of the wealthy Greene family disappears and is presumed dead; the body is never found. The main suspect is Boston Blackie, who is still haunted seven years later by what happened that night. Drawn back into the case, he finds that the truth of what happened that night is awash in a watery grave. A sequel to the graphic novel was published years later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Chinese folklore''' encompasses the folklore of [[China]], and includes songs, poetry, dances, puppetry, and tales. It often tells stories of [[human nature]], historical or legendary events, love, and the supernatural, or stories explaining natural phenomena and distinctive landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Giskin, Howard.  ''Chinese Folktales.''  (NTC Publishing Group, Chicago, 1997).  {{ISBN|0-8442-5927-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Chinese mythology]] it forms an important element in [[Chinese popular religion]].

==Folktales==
[[File:Niulang and Zhinv (Long Corridor).JPG|thumb|The reunion of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]''. Artwork in the [[Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]].]]

The main influences on Chinese folk tales have been [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Some folktales may have arrived from Germany; others have no known western counterparts, but are widespread throughout East Asia.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China"&gt;Eberhard, Wolfram, ''Folktales of China.''(1965). University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1965. University of Congress Catalog Card Number: 65-25440&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folktales include a vast variety of forms such as myths, legends, fables, etc. A number of collections of such tales, such as [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', now remain popular. 

Chinese folklore contains many symbolic folk meanings for the objects and animals within the folktales. One example of this is the symbolic meaning behind frogs and toads. In the "Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, Chang E", frogs and toads are a symbol of wealth and prosperity as well as symbolize fertility, regeneration, yin, and immortality. Each Chinese folktale includes this kind of representation of various objects and animals and uses symbolic messages through its characters and usually strives to convey a message that instills the reader with some sort of virtuous insight. These messages are vital to Chinese culture and through these folktales, they will be passed down to future generations to also learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Shanshan, Y. (2016). Frogs and Toads in Chinese Myths, Legends, and Folklore. Chinese America: History &amp; Perspectives, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of folklore on other media==
[[File:Mawangdui silk banner from tomb no1.jpg|thumb|The Journey to eternal life of Lady Dai (Xin Chui). Mawangdui, [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], about 168 [[before the Common Era]].]]

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for Chinese writers and poets for centuries. Folk songs which were originally partnered with dance and other styles of performing arts, provided inspiration for courtly poetry. Classical fiction began in the [[Han Dynasty]] and was modeled after oral traditions, while [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era dramatic plays were influenced by folk plays.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for visual imagery by Chinese weavers, painters and watercolorists, florists. One of the most striking examples is a silk funerary banner (circa 168 BC) that contains a number of stories from early China.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=cuddgTWyx50C&amp;dq=hare+and+toad+on+the+moon&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Chinese Myths, by Anne Birrell. University of Texas Press, Sep 15, 2000 - Literary Criticism - 80 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern iterations of traditional Chinese stories can be found internationally as well as in native Chinese literature.  [[Laurence Yep]]'s ''[[The Magic Paintbrush]]'', [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]'s ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' all borrow from Chinese folklore traditions.

==Study of Chinese folklore==
The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', the earliest known Chinese collection of poetry, contains 160 folk songs in addition to courtly songs and hymns. One tradition holds that [[Confucius]] himself collected these songs, while another says that an emperor compiled them as a means to gauge the mood of the people and the effectiveness of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in the ''Classic of Poetry'', helping to secure the ''Classic of Poetry'''s place among the ''[[Five Classics]]''. After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confucius's endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1910s, Chinese folklore began to gain popularity as an area of study with the beginnings of the movement to formally adopt [[Vernacular Chinese]] as the language of education and literature. Because Vernacular Chinese was the dialect in which most folklore was created, this movement brought to scholars' attention the influences that Vernacular Chinese folklore had upon classical literature. [[Hu Shih]] of the [[Peking University]], who had published several articles in support of the adoption of Vernacular Chinese, concluded that when Chinese writers drew their inspiration from folk traditions such as traditional tales and songs, Chinese literature experienced a renaissance. When writers neglected these sources, they lost touch with the people of the nation. A new emphasis on the study of folklore, Hu concluded, could therefore usher in a new renaissance of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

The Folksong Studies Movement became a key contributor to establishing Chinese Folklore as a modern academic discipline. This movement was founded by students and professors at Peking University in 1918. They were successful in creating a field of study that focused on literature pertaining to Chinese folklore and attempted to bring to light the early traditions and culture of Chinese folklore in order to reestablish China's national spirit.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A rising sense of national identity was also partially responsible for spurring the new interest in traditional folklore.  The first issue of the ''Folk-Song Weekly'', a publication issued by the Folk-Song Research Society, stated that "Based on the folk songs, on the real feeling of the nation, a kind of new national poetry may be produced."&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Some folklore enthusiasts also hoped to further social reforms by their work. To help improve the condition of the Chinese people, it was believed, it was necessary to understand their ideas, beliefs, and customs.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt; After China emerged from the [[Maoism|Maoist]] period in the late 1970s, the state had an increasingly more accepting position toward academic research on China’s cultural traditions and folklore. Forbidden traditions and practices in early Chinese history were at this point in time becoming more relevant and accepted within the Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Communist and Communist thinkers were especially energetic in this belief. In the time leading up to the founding of the [[Communist Party of China]], many folk songs and stories were collected by Communist thinkers and scholars. Often, they were reinvented and reinterpreted to emphasize such themes as the virtue of the working commoner and the evil of aristocracy, while stories that expressed praise for the emperor were frequently left out of Communist collections. Some folk tales and folk plays that exist today may in fact have been deliberately written by Communist authors to emphasize particular social morals.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (circa 1935)]] '''Conversation''' is interactive [[communication]] between two or more people.

The development of conversational skills and [[etiquette]] is an important part of [[socialization]]. The development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of [[language teaching]] and [[language learning|learning]].

[[Conversation analysis]] is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction, with a more specific focus on conversational interaction.

==Definition and characterization==
No generally accepted definition of conversation exists, beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together.{{sfn|Warren|2006|p=8}}  Consequently, the term is often defined by what it is not. A ritualized exchange such as a mutual [[greeting]] is not a conversation, and an interaction that includes a marked status differential (such as a boss giving orders) is also not a conversation.{{sfn|Warren|2006|pp=8–9}}  An interaction with a tightly focused topic or purpose is also generally not considered a conversation.{{sfn|Warren|2006|p=9}}  Summarizing these properties, one authority writes that "Conversation is the kind of speech that happens informally, symmetrically, and for the purposes of establishing and maintaining social ties."{{sfn|Thornbury|Slade|2006|p=25}}

From a less technical perspective, a writer on etiquette in the early 20th century defined conversation as the polite give and take of subjects thought of by people talking with each other for company.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, Mary Greer. 1738. ''Conversation: What to Say and How to Say It,'' pp. 21–32. New York and London: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversations follow rules of etiquette because conversations are social interactions, and therefore depend on social convention. Specific rules for conversation arise from the [[cooperative principle]].  Failure to adhere to these rules causes the conversation to deteriorate or eventually to end. Contributions to a conversation are responses to what has previously been said.

Conversations may be the optimal form of [[communication]], depending on the participants' intended ends. Conversations may be ideal when, for example, each party desires a relatively equal exchange of information, or when the parties desire to build social ties. On the other hand, if permanency or the ability to review such information is important, written communication may be ideal. Or if time-efficient communication is most important, a speech may be preferable.

Conversation involves a lot more nuanced and implied context that lies beneath just the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90002-3 |title=Understanding natural language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–191 |year=1972 |last1=Winograd |first1=Terry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversation is generally face-to-face person-to-person at the same time (synchronous) – possibly online with video applications such as Skype, but might also include audio-only phone calls.  It would not generally include internet written communication which tends to be asynchronous (not same time – can read and respond later if at all) and does not fit the 'con'='with' in 'conversation'.  In face to face conversation it has been suggested that 85% of the communication is non-verbal/body language – a smile, a frown, a shrug, tone of voice conveying much added meaning to the mere words.  Short forms of written communication such as sms are thus frequently misunderstood.  Yet the convenience and apparent control makes them increasingly popular now that many people seem to prefer to communicate via short text or Facebook post and/or 'like' than actually meeting face to face.

Face to face conversation is increasingly deemed less important when people have already seen all the relevant news about the other person they have already shared online.  Also people would typically never say face to face some things they might easily write with the apparent impunity of anonymous online posts.  To this extent the decreasing popularity of face to face conversation can be seen as a loss to society and civility.

==Classification==

=== Banter ===
{{Redirect|Banter|the BBC radio show|Banter (radio show)}}
Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults, misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should "top" the one before it and in short a verbal war of wit without any physical contact.

Films that have used banter as a way of structure in conversations are:
* [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|''The Big Sleep'' (1946)]]
* [[His Girl Friday|''His Girl Friday'' (1940)]]
* [[Bringing Up Baby|''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938)]]

Important factors in delivering a banter is the subtext, situation and the rapport with the person. Every line in a banter should be able to evoke both an emotional response and ownership without hurting one's feelings. Following a structure that the involved parties understand is important, even if the subject and structure is absurd, a certain level of progression should be kept in a manner that it connects with the involved parties.

Different methods of story telling could be used in delivering banter, like making an unexpected turn in the flow of structure (interrupting a comfortable structure), taking the conversation towards an expected crude form with evoking questions, doubts, self-conscientiousness (creating intentional misunderstandings) or layering the existing pattern with multiple anchors...etc. It is important to quit the bantering with the sensibility of playground rules, both parties shouldn't obsess on topping each other, continuously after a certain point of interest. It is as Shakespeare said "Brevity is the soul of wit."&lt;ref&gt;William C. Martell, 2011{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion ===
One element of conversation is discussion: sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation. In polite society the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or [[controversy|controversial]]. For example, if theology is being ''discussed'', no one is insisting a particular view be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, Mary Greer (1912). ''Conversation: What to Say and How to Say It''. pp. 35–60 New York and London: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject===
Many conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content:
* '''Subjective ideas''', which often serve to extend understanding and awareness.
* '''Objective facts''', which may serve to consolidate a widely held view.
* '''Other people''' (usually absent), which may be either [[criticism|critical]], competitive, or supportive. This includes [[gossip]].
* '''Oneself''', which sometimes indicate [[attention-seeking]] behavior or can provide relevant information about oneself to participants in the conversation.

Practically, few conversations fall exclusively into one category. Nevertheless, the proportional distribution of any given conversation between the categories can offer useful psychological insights into the mind set of the participants. This is the reason that the majority of conversations are difficult to categorize.

===Functions===
Most conversations may be classified by their goal.  Conversational ends may, however, shift over the life of the conversation.
* '''Functional conversation''' is designed to convey information in order to help achieve an individual or group goal.
* '''[[Small talk]]''' is a type of conversation where the topic is less important than the social purpose of achieving [[human bonding|bonding]] between people or managing [[personal distance]], such as 'how is the weather' might be portrayed as an example, which conveys no practicality whatsoever.

==Aspects==

===Differences between men and women===

A study completed in July 2007 by Matthias Mehl of the [[University of Arizona]] shows that contrary to popular belief, there is little difference in the number of words used by men and women in conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1139940 |pmid=17615349 |laysummary=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12203-men--the-other-talkative-sex.html |laysource=New Scientist |laydate=July 6, 2007 |title=Are Women Really More Talkative Than Men? |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5834 |page=82 |year=2007 |last1=Mehl |first1=M. R. |last2=Vazire |first2=S. |last3=Ramirez-Esparza |first3=N. |last4=Slatcher |first4=R. B. |last5=Pennebaker |first5=J. W. |bibcode=2007Sci...317...82M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that on average each of the sexes uses about 16,000 words per day.

===Between strangers===
There are certain situations, typically encountered while traveling, which result in strangers sharing what would ordinarily be an intimate social space such as sitting together on a bus or airplane. In such situations strangers are likely to share intimate personal information they would not ordinarily share with strangers. A special case emerges when one of the travelers is a mental health professional and the other party shares details of their personal life in the apparent hope of receiving help or advice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/business/28psych.html "Cornered: Therapists on Planes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814174117/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/business/28psych.html |date=14 August 2016 }},  Liz Galst. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 27 September 2010, accessed 28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narcissism===
Conversational [[narcissism]] is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.

Derber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves. "Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America," he wrote. "It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derber|first1=Charles|title=The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195135504|page=19|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmOXQPc6eEC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509175038/https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmOXQPc6eEC&amp;pg=PA19|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Derber describes as "conversational narcissism" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an [[Egotism|egotist]].

Derber distinguishes the "shift-response" from the "support-response". A shift response takes the focus of attention away from the last speaker and refocuses on the new speaker, as in: "John: I'm feeling really starved. Mary: Oh, I just ate." Whereas a support response maintains the focus on the last speaker, as in: "John: I'm feeling really starved. Mary: When was the last time you ate?"

===Artificial intelligence===
The ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence (The [[Turing Test]]).  A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. If the judge cannot tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. One limitation is that the conversation is limited to a text, not allowing tone to be shown.

===One's self===
Also called [[intrapersonal communication]], the act of conversing with oneself can help solve problems or serve therapeutic purposes like avoiding silence.

==In the media==
As a prominent and useful figure in most human lives, conversation is often used in the media, e.g. talk shows such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]]'s [[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]] or the [[Dick Cavett|Dick Cavett Show]].

==Literature==
Authors who have written extensively on conversation and attempted to analyze its nature include:
* Milton Wright wrote ''The Art of Conversation'', a comprehensive treatment of the subject, in 1936.  The book deals with conversation both for its own sake, and for political, sales, or religious ends.  Milton portrays conversation as an art or creation that people can play with and give life to.
* Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Al Switzler, and Ron McMillan have written two [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' bestselling]] books on conversation. The first one, ''Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, teaches skills for handling disagreement and high-stakes issues at work and at home. The second book, ''Crucial Accountability: Tools for Resolving Violated Expectations, Broken Commitments, and Bad Behavior'', McGraw-Hill, 2013, teaches important skills for dealing with accountability issues.
* [[Charles Blattberg]] has written two books defending an approach to politics that emphasizes conversation, in contrast to negotiation, as the preferred means of resolving conflict. His ''From Pluralist to Patriotic Politics: Putting Practice First'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-829688-6}}, is a work of political philosophy; and his ''Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada'', Montreal and Kingston: [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7735-2596-3}}, applies that philosophy to the Canadian case.
* Paul Drew &amp; [[John Heritage]] – ''Talk at Work'', a study of how conversation changes in social and workplace situations.
* [[Neil Postman]] – ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' (Conversation is not the book's specific focus, but discourse in general gets good treatment here)
* [[Deborah Tannen]]
** ''The Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words''
** ''Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends'',
** ''Gender and Discourse''
** ''I Only Say This Because I Love You''
** ''Talking from 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work''
** ''[[That's Not What I Meant!]]''
** ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]: Women and Men in Conversation''
* [[Daniel Menaker]] – ''A Good Talk:  The Story and Skill of Conversation'' (published 2010)
* Stephen Miller – ''Conversation: A History of a Declining Art'': provides an extensive history of conversation which dates back to the ancient Greeks with Socrates, and moving forward, to coffeehouses around the world, as well as the modern forces of the electronic age, talk shows, etc.

=== In fiction ===
* ''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]'' (1969) is one of the main novels by the Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].

===In "Six Benefits of Better Conversation"===
The benefits are:
# Being better understood

==Orientations==
Contemporary ecological art has been articulated across interdisciplinary and scholarly groups in terms of life-centered issues, community participation, public dialogue, and ecological sustainability. In 1996, the educator and activist, Don Krug identified concepts frequently addressed by ecological artists that can be used by to interpret ecological perspectives and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of British Columbia, Department of Curriculum &amp; Pedagogy|title=Don Krug, Research Interests|url=http://edcp.educ.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/don-krug/|website=UBC Faculty of Education|publisher=EDCP|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following four orientations were identified: Environmental Design, Ecological Design, Social Restoration, and Ecological Restoration.

*[[Environmental design]] – Some artists work with nature as a resource for particular aesthetic endeavors. Artists with an orientation to environmental design are interested in achieving particular formal aesthetic effects. In the 1980s and 90s, artists, architects, designers, and civil engineers explored ways to link art, aesthetics, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neperud|first1=Ronald W.|last2=Hochman|first2=Maria|title=Environmental Design|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/envdesign.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ecological design]] –   Artists who work in the area of ecological design create art that is contingent on direct experiences and interactions with a particular place where the art is created. An ecological view of design considers the artwork within larger contexts of how people, plants, and animals are interconnected with each other, the site, and/or the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Don|title=Ecological Design|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ecodesign.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social restoration – An ecological ethic where humans live in relationship to larger communities of life to catalyze socially responsible artwork. Socio-ecological artists critically examine everyday life experiences. These artists scrutinize relations of power that produce community tensions about ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Elizabeth|title=Social Restoration|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/socrestore.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ecological restoration]] – Some artists attempt to alert viewers to environmental issues and problems through scientific exploration and educational documentation. They seek to restore fragile places and educate the public to the systemic character of bioregions through the use of communication, ritual, and performance. Some ecological artists engage people directly in activities or actions by confronting environmentally unhealthy practices with social, ethical, and moral ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Don|title=Ecological Restoration|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ecorestore.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7784">'''Ethiopian philosophy''' is the philosophical corpus of the territories of present-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. Besides via oral tradition, it was preserved early in written form through [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] manuscripts. This [[philosophy]] occupies a unique position within [[African philosophy]].

==Beginnings of Ethiopian philosophy==
The character of Ethiopian philosophy is determined by the particular conditions of evolution of the Ethiopian culture. Thus, Ethiopian philosophy arises from the confluence of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Patristic]] philosophy with traditional Ethiopian modes of thought. Because of the early isolation from its sources of Abrahamic spirituality – [[Byzantium]] and [[Alexandria]] – Ethiopia received some of its philosophical heritage through Arabic versions.

The sapiential literature developed under these circumstances is the result of a twofold effort of creative assimilation: on one side, of a tuning of [[Orthodoxy]] to traditional modes of thought (never eradicated), and vice versa, and, on the other side, of absorption of Greek pagan and early Patristic thought into this developing Ethiopian-Christian synthesis. As a consequence, the moral reflection of religious inspiration is prevalent, and the use of narrative, [[parable]], [[apothegm]] and rich imagery is preferred to the use of abstract argument. This sapiential literature consists in translations and adaptations of some Greek texts, namely of the ''Physiolog'' (cca. 5th century A.D.), ''The Life and Maxims of Skendes'' (11th century A.D.) and ''The Book of the Wise Philosophers'' (1510/22).

==Mature Ethiopian philosophy==
In the 17th century, the religious beliefs of Ethiopians were challenged by King [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Suseynos]]' adoption of Catholicism, and by a subsequent presence of Jesuit missionaries. The attempt to forcefully impose Catholicism upon his constituents during Suseynos' reign inspired further development of Ethiopian philosophy during the 17th century. [[Zera Yacob]] (1599–1692) is the most important exponent of this renaissance. His treatise ''[[Hatata]]'' (1667) is a work often included in the narrow canon of universal philosophy.

===Zera Yacob===
Zera Yacob had a culture entirely theological. Although of humble birth, he earned respect for his intellectual capacities, and went on to pursue the traditional Ethiopian theological education. Zera Yacob mastered Coptic theology and Catholic theology, and he had extensive knowledge of Jewish and Islamic religions. His spiritual ''vade mecum'' was David’s ''Book of Psalms'', in which he sought comfort and inspiration.

Knowing thus two Christian interpretations of the Bible, as well as the two other Abrahamic religions, and seeing the contradictions between them, Zera Yacob is led to refuse the authority of the Ethiopian tradition and of any tradition in general. He comes to think that the tradition is infested by lies, because men, in their arrogance, believe that they know everything and thus refuse to examine things with their own mind, blindly accepting what has been transmitted to them by their forefathers. The philosopher accepts then as unique authority his reason, and accepts from the Scriptures and from the dogmas only what resists a rational inquiry. He affirms that the human reason can find the truth, if it searches it and does not get discouraged in front of the difficulties.

Thus, by his piece-meal examination (this is what ''hatätä'' means), Zera Yacob arrives at an argument for the existence of God (an essence uncreated and eternal), based on the impossibility of an infinite chain of causes, and at the conviction that the Creation is good, because God is good. This belief is the basis for a criticism of ascetic morals and of some Jewish and Islamic moral precepts as well. By identifying the will of God with what is rational Zera Yacob rejects most of these moral precepts (e.g. concerning polygamy, or fasting, or sexual or alimentary interdictions) as blasphemy. He seems to think that all is good for the good one, reminding thus of the mode of thought expressed in the profession of faith of the other great Zera Yaqob, the Emperor from the 15th century.

===Walda Heywat===
Zera Yacob had a disciple, [[Walda Heywat]], who also wrote a philosophical treatise, systematising his master’s thought. He accorded more attention to the practical and educational problems, and he tried to connect Zera Yacob’s philosophy with the kind of wisdom expressed in the earlier sapiential literature. Walda Heywat recurs intensively to illustrations and parables, and many times the source of his examples is the ''Book of the Wise Philosophers''. Although his work is arguably less original than that of his master's, it can be considered "more Ethiopian", since it represents a synthesis through which some ideas engendered by Zera Yacob's rejection of tradition are brought together with traditional Christian-inspired wisdom. It is "more Ethiopian" also in the sense that it addresses some practical, social and moral issues that most Ethiopians of his time encountered in their lives. Thus, Walda Heywat's work is less speculative, but more national in character than the treatise of his master, Zera Yacob.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

[[Evolution (term)|Evolutionary]] ideas during the periods of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment | the Enlightenment]] developed over a time when [[natural history]] became more sophisticated during the 17th and 18th centuries, and as the [[scientific revolution]] and the rise of  [[mechanical philosophy]] encouraged viewing the natural world as a machine with workings capable of analysis. But the evolutionary ideas of the early 18th century were of a religious and spiritural nature. In the second half of the 18th century more materialistic and explicit ideas about biological [[evolution]] began to emerge, adding further strands in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].

==17th and early 18th century==
The word ''evolution'' (from the [[Latin]] ''evolutio'', meaning "to unroll like a scroll") appeared in English in the 17th century, referring to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. Notably, in 1677 Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], attacking the [[atheist]]ic [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]], used the term ''evolution'' to describe his opponent's ideas that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void &amp;mdash; without divine intervention &amp;mdash; had formed "Primordial Seeds" (semina) which were the "immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=Matthew R.|title=Atomism, Atheism, and the Spontaneous Generation of Human Beings: The Debate over a Natural Origin of the First Humans in Seventeenth-Century Britain|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=63| issue =  2|pages=207–224|date=April 2002|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hale, this mechanism was "absurd", because "it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the '''evolution''' whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist ... and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002" /&gt;

While Hale (ironically) first used the term evolution in arguing ''against'' the exact mechanistic view the word would come to symbolize, he also demonstrates that at least some [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] theories explored between 1650 and 1800 postulated that the universe, including life on earth, had developed mechanically, entirely without divine guidance. Around this time, the [[mechanical philosophy]] of [[Descartes]], reinforced by the [[physics]] of [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], began to encourage the machine-like view of the universe which would come to characterise the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 33-38&lt;/ref&gt; However, most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]] (and mocked by [[Schopenhauer]]), held that evolution was a fundamentally ''spiritual'' process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being "a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] postulated in 1714 that "[[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s" inside objects caused motion by internal forces, and maintained that "the 'germs' of all things have always existed ... [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses" to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly felt that evolution proceeded on divine principles &amp;mdash; in his ''De rerum originatione radicali'' (1697), he wrote: "A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[J. G. von Herder]], expressed similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, pp. 183–184, 279–280, 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1613 [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] was a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]] awaiting execution; in this period he wrote a history of the world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it he wondered whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on [[Noah's Ark]]. A very serious question at the time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of all animal species were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared to solve the problem of the Ark's tonnage.

==Mid 18th century==
In his ''Venus Physique'' in 1745, and ''System of Nature'' in 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species. He also anticipated in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers. [[G. L. L. Buffon]] suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties. He thought that the members of what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern [[scientific classification]] would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through [[spontaneous generation]]; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. He speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original forms. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were "internal molds" that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were entirely and eternally distinct. Thus, lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 75–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2004 pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Darwin's foreword to his 6th edition of ''Origin'' credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], he also wrote that "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin 1872 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 18th-century writers speculated about human evolution. [[John Mitchell (geographer)|John Mitchell]], a [[physician]] and [[cartographer]], wrote a book in 1744 called ''An Essay upon the Causes of the Different Colours of People in Different Climates'' in which he claimed that the first [[race (classification of humans)|race]] on earth had been a brown and reddish colour he said "that an intermediate tawny colour found amongst Asiatics and Native Amerindians" had been the “original complexion of mankind” and that others races came about by the original race spending generations in different climates.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1767 and 1792 [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from other primates, but also that, in response to their environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. He also produced research on the evolution of [[linguistics]], which was cited by Erasmus Darwin in his poem ''Temple of Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Andrew Henderson states that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] presented, in his ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', what he referred to as “a daring venture of reason”, in which “one organic being [is] derived from another organic being, although from one which is specifically different; e.g., certain water-animals transform themselves gradually into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Kant 1792 Section 80&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century philosophers, such as [[Eric Voegelin]], credit Kant with foreshadowing modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, CW VOL 3,Chapter 14, The Unfolding of the World of Organic Forms pp 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1796, [[Erasmus Darwin]] published his ''[[Zoönomia]]'', which suggested "that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1818 Vol I section XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt; in response to stimuli, with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations. In his 1802 poem ''Temple of Nature'', he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in the mud to its modern diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,&lt;br&gt;
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;&lt;br&gt;
These, as successive generations bloom,&lt;br&gt;
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;&lt;br&gt;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,&lt;br&gt;
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''[[flag]] of [[Malawi]]''' was officially adopted on 6 July 1964 when the colony of [[Nyasaland]] became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi.

==Design==
The first flag of independent Malawi was adopted on 6 July 1964. The rising sun represents the dawn of hope and freedom for the continent of Africa (when the flag was created, more countries in Africa were [[decolonisation of Africa|gaining independence]] from European rule). The 31 rays of the sun represent the fact that Malawi was the 31st African nation at the time of its independence. The black represents the indigenous people of the continent, the red symbolizes the blood of their struggle, and the green represents nature. The flag resembles the [[Pan-African flag]] designed by [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]], with the red and black bands reversed and a red sun in the top. It also resembles the [[flag of Biafra|flag]] of the now-defunct Republic of [[Biafra]].

==2010–2012==
A new  flag of Malawi was adopted on {{Nowrap|29 July}} 2010, as proposed by the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi)|Democratic Progressive Party]]-led government. The stripes were altered from the previous flag to match the original [[Pan-African Flag]] layout, with the red stripe at the top, the black stripe in middle, and the green stripe at the bottom. The rising sun at the flag's top was replaced with a full, centred white sun with 45 rays representing the [[economy of Malawi|economic progress]] [[Malawi]] has made since becoming independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/have-your-say-the-proposed-new-malawi-national-flag.html The proposed new Malawi national flag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619133214/http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/have-your-say-the-proposed-new-malawi-national-flag.html |date=19 June 2010 }}, Nyasa Times&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition [[United Democratic Front (Malawi)|United Democratic Front]] announced that it would challenge the legitimacy of flag change in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/flag-change-to-be-challenged-in-court-udf.html Flag change to be challenged in court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155556/http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/flag-change-to-be-challenged-in-court-udf.html |date=22 July 2011 }}, Nyasa Times&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was endorsed by the President of Malawi, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]], who approved the flag change on 29 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3415:bingu-endorses-new-flag-bill&amp;catid=1:national-news&amp;Itemid=3 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723220456/http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3415%3Abingu-endorses-new-flag-bill&amp;catid=1%3Anational-news&amp;Itemid=3 |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was much public outcry about whether there was a need to change the flag, but the process continued despite being unwelcome to much of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyasatimes.com/.../malawi-fly-new-modified-flags-despite-public-outcry.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was pejoratively nicknamed "Bingu's flag" by the majority of the nation who saw it as an illegitimate flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdzezimbabwe.co.uk/2012/05/malawi-ditches-bingus-flag.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010736/http://www.newsdzezimbabwe.co.uk/2012/05/malawi-ditches-bingus-flag.html |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many objected to the new flag, perceiving its adoption as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/04/09/dear-president-banda-a-piece-of-advice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002232/http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/04/09/dear-president-banda-a-piece-of-advice/ |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flower seller''', normally a woman, traditionally sells flowers on the street. Often the flowers are carried, in a basket for example. The subject matter has been a favorite of artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], 
[http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/The-Flower-Seller.html The Flower Seller].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diego Rivera]], [http://www.globalgallery.com/enlarge/32116/ The Flower Seller, 1942].&lt;/ref&gt; The profession has mostly died out in countries like the United Kingdom, but still exists in others such as India.

The 1920s series of British ''[[Squibs (1921 film)|Squibs]]'' films were constructed around the adventures of a [[London]] flower girl played by [[Betty Balfour]].

[[File:Free Clinic of Simi Valley.jpg|thumb|Free Clinic of Simi Valley, [[Simi Valley]], [[California]]]]
A '''free clinic''' is a [[health care provider|health care facility]] in the United States offering services to economically disadvantaged individuals for free or at a nominal cost. The need for such a clinic arises in societies where there is no universal healthcare, and therefore a [[social safety net]] has arisen in its place. Core staff members may hold full-time paid positions, however, most of the staff a patient will encounter are volunteers drawn from the local medical community. Care is provided free of cost to persons who have limited incomes, no [[health insurance]] and do not qualify for [[Medicaid]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. To offset costs, some clinics charge a nominal fee to those whose income is deemed sufficient to pay a fee. Many free clinics offer services to underinsured individuals; meaning those who have only limited medical coverage (such as catastrophic care coverage, but not regular coverage), or who have insurance, but their policies include high medical deductibles that they are unable to afford. Clinics often use the term "underinsured" to describe the [[working poor]].

Most free clinics provide treatment for routine [[Acute care|illness or injuries]]; and long-term [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and high cholesterol. Many also provide a limited range of medical testing, prescription drug assistance, women's health care, and dental care. Free clinics do not function as emergency care providers, and most do not handle employment related injuries. Few if any free clinics offer care for [[chronic pain]] as that would require them to dispense [[narcotics]]. For a free clinic such care is almost always cost-prohibitive. Handling narcotics requires a high level of physical security for the staff and building along with more paperwork and government regulation compared to what other prescription medications require.

==History==
The modern concept of a free clinic originated in [[San Francisco]] when Dr. David Smith founded the [[Haight Ashbury Free Clinics|Haight Ashbury Free Clinic]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, Richard (1987) ''The Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinics: Still free after all these years, 1967-1987''. San Francisco, California: Partisan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From there free clinics spread to other California cities and then across the United States. Each one offered a unique set of services, reflecting the particular needs and resources of the local community. Some were established to provide medical services in the inner cities while others opened in the suburbs and many student-run free clinics have emerged that serve the underserved as well as provide a medical training site for students in the health professions. What they share in common is that care is made possible through the service of volunteers, the donation of goods and community support. There is little – if any – government funding for most free clinics, so a free clinic's chances of success is largely determined by the support it receives from its own community.

In 2001 the [[National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics]] (NAFC) was founded in Washington, D.C. to advocate for the issues and concerns of free and charitable clinics. Free clinics are defined by the NAFC as "safety-net health care organizations that utilize a volunteer/staff model to provide a range of medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and/or behavioral health services to economically disadvantaged individuals. Such clinics are [[501c3|501(c)3]] tax-exempt organizations, or operate as a program component or affiliate of a 501(c)(3) organization."&lt;ref name="Definition of Free Clinic"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[National Association of Free Clinics]] |website= nafcclinics.org |title= What is a Free or Charitable Clinic? |url= http://nafcclinics.org/about-us/what-is-free-charitable-clinic |accessdate= 25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time various state and regional organizations where formed including the Free Clinics of the Great Lakes Region, Lone Star Association of Charitable Clinic (Texas), North Carolina Association of Free Clinics, Ohio Association of Free Clinics and the Virginia Association of Free Clinics. In 2005 Empowering Community Healthcare Outreach (ECHO) was established to assist churches and other community organizations start and run free and charitable clinics.

==Patient demographics==
Of the 41 million uninsured people in the United States, the 355 officially registered free clinics in the country are only able to provide services to about 650,000 of them. On average, free clinics have annual budgets of $458,028 and have 5,989 annual patient visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=Mohan M.|last2=Philbrick|first2=John T.|date=2005-07-01|title=Free Clinics: A National Survey|url=http://www.amjmedsci.org/article/S0002-9629(15)32962-1/fulltext|journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|language=English|volume=330|issue=1|pages=25–31|doi=10.1097/00000441-200507000-00005|issn=0002-9629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another survey of three free clinics, 82% of patients reported that they began using a free clinics because they have are uninsured, and 59% were referred by friends/family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keis|first=Rachel Mott|last2=DeGeus|first2=Linda Gifford|last3=Cashman|first3=Suzanne B.|last4=Savageau|first4=Judith|date=2004-11-05|title=Characteristics of Patients at Three Free Clinics|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/174824|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=603–617|doi=10.1353/hpu.2004.0062|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992-1997 survey of the Charlottesville Free Clinic, the patient body consists largely of a low income working class that reflects the demographics of the Charlottesville area. Most of the patients reported that without the free clinic, they would either seek the emergency room or do nothing at all if they got sick. There has been a shift over the years from patients seeking urgent care to patients seeking treatment for chronic illnesses. Combined, these factors suggest that free clinics will require additional resources to order to meet the rising demands of their patient population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadkarni|first1=M|last2=Philbrick|first2=J|date=2003|title=Free Clinics and the Uninsured: The Increasing Demands of Chronic Illness|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=14|issue=2|pages=165–174|pmid=12739297|doi=10.1353/hpu.2010.0804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and services==
Some free clinics specialize in providing primary care (acute care), while others focus on long-term chronic health issues, and many do both. Most free clinics start out seeing patients only one or two days per week, and then expand as they find additional volunteers. Because they rely on volunteers, most are only open a few hours per day; primarily in the late afternoon and early evening. Some free clinics are [[Religion|faith]]-based, meaning they are sponsored by and affiliated with a specific church or religious denomination, or they are [[interfaith]] and draw support from several different denominations or religions.

Free clinics rely on donations for financial support. The amount of money they take in through donations to a large degree determines how many patients they are able to see. Because they are unlikely to have the resources to see everyone who might need their help, they usually limit who they are willing to see to just those from their own community and the surrounding areas, and especially in chronic care will only see patients from within a limited set of medical conditions.

Free clinics function as health care [[Social safety net|safety nets]] for patients who cannot afford or access other forms of healthcare. They provide essential services regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Hospital [[Emergency department|emergency rooms]] are required by federal law to treat everyone regardless of their ability to pay, so people who lack the means to pay for care often seek treatment in emergency rooms for minor ailments. These hospitals function as [[safety net hospital]]s. Treating people in the ER is expensive, though, and it ties up resources designed for emergencies. When a community has a free clinic, hospitals can steer patients to the clinic who otherwise would have been seen in the ER, patients who have a simple ear ache, pink eye, strep throat, flu, etc.  For this reason most hospitals are supportive of free clinics. Hospitals are a primary source for equipment and supplies for free clinics. When they upgrade equipment, they will often donate the older equipment to the local free clinic. In addition some hospitals supply most or all of a local clinics day-to-day medical supplies, and some do lab work free of cost as well.

==Medical malpractice liability==
Free clinics can be granted [[medical malpractice]] coverage through the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] (FTCA). FTCA coverage includes health care professionals who are acting as volunteers.  In addition it covers officers, board members, clinic employees, and individual contractors. Medical malpractice coverage does not occur automatically, each organization must be "deemed" eligible by the US Department of Health and Human Services.  To be eligible the clinic must be an IRS recognized nonprofit, that does not accept payments from insurance companies, the government, or other organizations for the services it performs. It also must not charge patients for services. It may receive donations from anyone and any organization; the stipulation is that it may not receive financial reimbursement for service rendered, which by definition a free clinic does not.
 
The [[Volunteer Protection Act]] of 1997 provides immunity from tort claims such as negligence, bodily injury, pain and suffering that might be filed against the volunteers of nonprofit organizations. Thus, volunteers working on behalf of a nonprofit free clinic are covered under the Volunteer Protection Act from most liability claims.

Individual states may offer additional legal protections to free clinics, usually under the states [[Good Samaritan law]]s.  Free clinics must still carry [[Liability insurance|general liability insurance]], to cover non-medical liability, such as slips and falls in the parking lot.

==Prescription assistance programs==
Some pharmaceutical companies offer assistance programs for the drugs they manufacture. These programs allow those who are unable to pay for their medications to receive prescription drugs for free or at a greatly reduced cost. Many free clinics work to qualify patients on behalf of these programs. In some cases the clinic receive and then distribute the medications themselves, in others they verify that the patient is eligible for the program, and the medication is then shipped to the patient, or patient receives the medication from a local pharmacy.
 
Some free clinics sole mission is to help those who do not have prescription drug coverage, and cannot afford for their medications, to enroll in prescription assistance programs. Such clinics are known as "clinics without walls" because they dispense with the need to have their own building, exam rooms, or clinical equipment.

==Dentistry==
Some free clinics are able to assist with dental problems. This is handled either at the clinic itself, if the clinic has its own dental facilities and a dentist; or it is facilitated through a partnership with one or more local dentist who are willing to take referred patients for free. For example, a clinic might have ten local dentists who will each accept two patients per month, so this allows the clinic to treat a total of twenty dental patients each month.
  
Some clinics use a referral system to handle other forms of specialized medical care.

==Student-run clinics==
Student-run clinics (SRC) are an increasingly prevalent part of U.S. medical school curricula, and they are designed to improve health-care delivery to underserved populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Scott A. |last2=Long |first2=Judith A. |title=Medical Student-Run Health Clinics: Important Contributors to Patient Care and Medical Education |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |date=5 January 2007 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=352–356 |doi=10.1007/s11606-006-0073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of these clinics are free-of-charge and they have been shown to result in high patient satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellett |first1=JD |last2=Campbell |first2=JA |last3=Gonsalves |first3=WC |title=Patient satisfaction in a student-run free medical clinic|journal=Family medicine |date=January 2010 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=16-18 |pmid=20063215 |url=http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2010/January/Justin16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preventive medicine interventions offered at this clinics have been proved to have significantly high health and economic impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arenas |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Lett |first2=Lanair A. |last3=Klusaritz |first3=Heather |last4=Teitelman |first4=Anne M. |last5=van Wouwe |first5=Jacobus P. |title=A Monte Carlo simulation approach for estimating the health and economic impact of interventions provided at a student-run clinic |journal=PLOS ONE |date=28 December 2017 |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=e0189718 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0189718 |pmid=29284026 |pmc=5746244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, students who are exposed to SRCs are more likely than their peers to continue to work with underserved populations after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Porterfield |first1=DS |last2=Konrad |first2=TR |last3=Porter |first3=CQ |last4=Leysieffer |first4=K |last5=Martinez |first5=RM |last6=Niska |first6=R |last7=Wells |first7=B |last8=Potter |first8=F |title=Caring for the underserved: current practice of alumni of the National Health Service Corps |journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved |date=May 2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=256-71 |doi=10.1353/hpu.2010.0812 |pmid=12739304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of Student-Run Free Clinics (SSRFC) hosts a national inter-professional platform for student-run clinics. This allows the sharing of ideas, collaborate on research, information about funding resources and encourages the expansion of existing clinics as well as the cultivate of the new ones. The SSRFC faculty network works to facilitate collaboration between student-run free clinics.

==Effectiveness==
There are several proposed advantages to free clinics. They tend to be located in communities where there is a great need for health care. Free clinics are more flexible in structure than established medical institutions. They are also much less expensive - hence the title "free clinic."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadkarni|first1=M|last2=Philbrick|first2=J|date=2005|title=Free Clinics: A National Survey|journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|volume=330|issue=1|pages=25–31|doi=10.1097/00000441-200507000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their small size, their organization tends to be more egalitarian and less hierarchical, which allows for more direct exchange of information across the clinic. Unlike regular regular practices, they also attempt to do more than just provide healthcare. Some were created as political acts meant to advocate for socialized medicine and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoeckle |first1=JD |last2=Anderson |first2=WH |last3=Page |first3=J |last4=Brenner |first4=J |title=The free medical clinics. |journal=JAMA |date=31 January 1972 |volume=219 |issue=5 |pages=603-5 |doi=10.1001/jama.1972.03190310033008 |pmid=5066806|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, they do come with their own set of problems. For instance, they are a solution aimed towards serving tens of millions of uninsured Americans, but they function solely on the spirit of altruism. Volunteers must be willing to be available during strange hours of the day and provide professional-level care all without the possibility of financial reimbursement. Additionally, the ability of free clinics to provide long term, sustainable service and maintain continuity of care for patients is questionable, considering the instability of funding and providers. One proposition towards overcoming these challenges involves the creation of a national foundation that officially assists and connects free clinics, allowing them to evolve as necessary.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelleher|first1=K|date=1991|title=Free Clinics A Solution That Can Work... Now!|journal=JAMA|volume=266|issue=6|pages=838–840|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470060100035|pmid=1865524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

Free clinics are usually located near the people they are trying to serve. In most cases they are located near other nonprofits that serve the same target community such as food-banks, Head Start, Goodwill Industries, the Salvation Army and public housing. Because free clinics often refer people to other medical facilities for lab work, dentistry, and other services, they may also be found in the same area of town as those medical facilities. Some clinics have working agreements with the other facilities that are willing to assist with the clinics mission. Being close to the other medical facilities makes it easier for patients to get from one to the other. Being close to other medical facilities also makes it easier to find medically trained volunteers.
 
Most free clinics start out using donated space; others start by renting or leasing space. In time and with enough community support, many go on to acquire their own buildings. Donated space may be an entire building, or it might be a couple of rooms within a church, hospital, or another business. Because the clinic will house confidential medical records, prescription medications, and must remain as clean as possible, donated space is usually set aside for the sole use of the clinic even when the clinic is closed.

The National Association of Free &amp; Charitable Clinics maintains a database of 1,200 free and charitable clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafcclinics.org/|title=National Association of Free &amp; Charitable Clinics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;caption&gt;

The '''German Orthographic Conference of 1901''' (the '''Berlin II Orthographic Conference'''; {{lang-de|Zweite Orthographische Konferenz}} or ''{{lang|de|II. Orthographische Konferenz}}'') took place in Berlin from 17th till 19 June 1901. The results of the conference became official in the [[German Empire]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Peter von Polenz: ''Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart – Band III – 19. und 20. Jahrhundert''. Walter de Gruyter, 1999, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kopke: ''Rechtschreibreform und Verfassungsrecht''. J.C.B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck) Tübingen, 1995, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GdIiD"&gt;Edited by Werner Besch, Anne Betten, Oskar Reichmann, Stefan Sonderegger: ''Sprachgeschichte: Ein Handbuch zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und ihrer Erforschung – 2., vollständig neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage – 3. Teilband'' (''Hanbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft'', Band 2.3), Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 2495 (chapter "Geschichte der Interpunktionssysteme im Deutschen").&lt;/ref&gt; 
The standardized [[German spelling]] that resulted from the conference was largely based on the [[Prussian]] school spelling, but also on the [[Orthographic Conference of 1876]].

The conference results removed numerous existing variant forms.
Soon after the conference, its results were criticized by people{{who|date=June 2015}} who believed there should be further changes.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The spelling was used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], apart from the replacement of ''[[ß]]'' with ''ss'' in Switzerland in later years.
The ''Erziehungsrat des Kantons Zürich'' stopped the teaching of ''ß'' in schools in 1935 with the Kanton Zürich being the first to do so, and the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' as last Swiss newspaper stopped using ''ß'' in 1974. However, some Swiss book publishers still use ''ß''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon: ''Die deutsche Sprache in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Das Problem der nationalen Varietäten''. Walter de Gruyter, 1995, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Gerhard Helbig, Lutz Götze, Gert Henrici, Hans-Jürgen Krumm: ''Deutsch als Fremdsprache. Ein internationales Handbuch. 1. Halbband''. Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 496f.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 95 years later that the German spelling was changed with a [[German spelling reform of 1996|reform in 1996]].

The '''Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites''' are the location of hundreds of stone [[dolmen]] which were used as grave markers and for ritual purposes during the first millennium BCE when the Megalithic Culture was prominent on the [[Korean Peninsula]].  The sites were designated as a [[World Heritage]] Site by [[UNESCO]] in 2000.  [[Korea]] is said to contain more than 40% of the world's [[dolmen]], which are mostly concentrated in these three sites.

The [[megalithic]] stones are invaluable because they mark the graves of the ruling elite.  Pottery, [[gogok|comma-shaped jewels]], bronzes, stone tools, and other funerary artifacts have been excavated from these dolmen.  The culture of the people during this time can be gleaned from the evidence left by the dolmen.  Additionally, it can be induced from the stones how the stone was quarried, transported, and used to build the dolmen. 

Dolmen in Korea have been dated to the seventh century BCE in locations such as [[Gochang]] and the practice ended around the third century BCE.  The dolmen culture is linked with the [[Neolithic]] and bronze cultures of Korea. 

Excavation at the sites did not begin until 1965.  Since, then multiple digs have been sponsored and an extensive program of inventory and preservation has been initiated by the Korean government.

== Origin ==
There are three main theories about the origin of the ancient Korean Dolmen. First, the theory that it was spread through the sea in Southeast Asia, secondly, the theory that it was derived from a stone tomb in the north, and third, the theory that it originated in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1745075&amp;cid=49373&amp;categoryId=49373&amp;expCategoryId=49373|title=The origin of Korean Dolmen|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-25|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The theory of spreading from South Asia ===
It is a theory that the Dolmen spread through Southeast Asia along with the rice culture. Dolmen are distributed along the west coast of Korea and In that the distribution of the Dolmen is consistent with the southern part of the culture, the Dolmen was spread from Southeast Asia along with agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=028&amp;aid=0000066125|title=Dolmen is standing on megalithic culture|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-25|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The theory of spreading from Northern Asia ===
This theory is derived from the theory that the Dolmen developed from the stone tomb of the Manchuria because it is closely related to the Bronze age culture in the north. If a stone mound is exposed to the ground due to the large size, the stone will be a stone-shaped table. Although it is very persuasive in terms of shape, it is not distributed in northern Asia such as Manchuria and Siberia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201805251814005&amp;code=960100|title=Dolmen - Under 300 tons of rock, the life of the Bronze Age is dormant.|last=|first=|date=2018-05-25|work=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The theory of originating  in Korea ===
In the background of this theory, the dolmen are the most distributed in Korea. They are also diverse in shape and are timed ahead of those of other countries. It is highly likely that the culture of the South and the North will have developed a unique Dolmen culture in Korea. The peninsula originated from its geographical location, where it provided easy access to the culture of the north and south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newscj.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=270173|title=Megalithic culture, Dolmen|last=|first=|date=2014-12-22|work=천지일보|access-date=2018-11-25|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Dolmen are generally classified in two types in East Asia.  The table/northern-type and the go-board/southern-type.  In the former, four stones were positioned to make the walls of a box and were capped by a stone which lay on top of the supports.  The latter is characterized by underground burial with stones that supported the capstone.

===Gochang Dolmen Site===
[[File:Korea-Gwangju-Gochang Dolmens 5349-06.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|One of the tallest Dolmens at Gochang Dolmen site]]
This group of dolmen are the largest and most varied.  They are known as the Jungnim-ri dolmens and are centered in Maesan village, [[Gochang County]], [[North Jeolla]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1392236&amp;cid=62346&amp;categoryId=62352|title=Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-25|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dolmens were built from east to west at the foot of a series of hills at an altitude of 15 to 50 meters/49 feet to 164 feet.  Generally, the capstones of the dolmens are around 1 to 5.8 meters/3.2 to 19 feet in length and may weigh up to 225 tons. 442 dolmen have been documented and classified based on the size of the capstone.

This group is believed to have been constructed around the seventh century BCE.

The Gochang Dolmen Site is listed as Historic Site #391.

===Hwasun Dolmen Sites===
[[File:Korea-Hwasun Dolmen sites01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Dolmens at Hwasun Dolmen Site]]
Found in [[Hwasun County]], [[South Jeolla]], {{Coord|34.9775414|126.931551|display=inline}}, these dolmens are also located on the slopes of hills and follow the Jiseokgang river.  The Hyosan-ri group contains 158 dolmens and the Dasin-ri group, 129.  These dolmens are less well preserved than the Jungnim-ri group.   The quarry where some of the stones of this group were carved out has been located.  This group is dated to around the sixth or fifth century BCE.

===Ganghwa Dolmen Sites===
[[Image:GMJ 0153.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An example of a go-board/southern-type dolmen on Ganghwa]]
These dolmens are located on [[Ganghwa Island]], [[Ganghwa County]], [[Incheon]].  They are located on the slopes of mountains and are thus higher in elevation than their counterparts.  These dolmens are believed to be earliest ones made because the dolmen groups in Bugeun-ri ({{lang|ko-Hang|부근리}}, in Hajeom-myeon) and Gocheon-ri ({{lang|ko-Hang|고천리}}, in Naega-myeon) resemble the early dolmens.  However, this has not been conclusively proved.

A notable dolmen at Ganghwa is a northern/table-type dolmen where it was believed ancestral rites were performed.  It is the biggest stone in South Korea with measures of 2.6 × 7.1 × 5.5 meters, but it has only two supporting stones. Combined the supporting stones and the capstone weigh between 150 and 225 tons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9144">The '''Hector Medal''' (formerly known as the '''Hector Memorial Medal''')&lt;ref name=Transactions1918/&gt; is a science award given by the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] in memory of Sir [[James Hector]] to researchers working in New Zealand. It is awarded annually in rotation for different sciences – currently there are three: chemical sciences; physical sciences; mathematical and information sciences. It is given to a researcher who "has undertaken work of great scientific or technological merit and has made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of the particular branch of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/hector-medal/ |title=Hector Medal |publisher=Royal Society of New Zealand |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously rotated through more fields of science – in 1918 they were: botany, chemistry, ethnology, geology, physics (including mathematics and astronomy), zoology (including animal physiology).&lt;ref name=Transactions1918&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_50/rsnz_50_00_004140.html |title=Hector Memorial Research Fund |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute |volume=50 |year=1918 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a few years it was awarded biennially – it was not awarded in 2000, 2002 or 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/hector-medal/background/ |title=Background of the Medal |publisher=Royal Society of New Zealand |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 it was overtaken by the  [[Rutherford Medal (Royal Society of New Zealand)|Rutherford Medal]] as the highest award given by the Royal Society of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/rutherford-medal/ |title=Rutherford Medal « Medals &amp; Awards « Funds, Medals &amp; Competitions « Royal Society of New Zealand |publisher=Royalsociety.org.nz |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HongKongTourismBoardHKG.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong Tourism Board at the Hong Kong International Airport]]

The '''Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB)''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 香港旅遊發展局) is a [[Government of Hong Kong|Government]]-subvented body founded in 2001. The Board replaced the '''Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 香港旅遊協會) established in 1957. It has 15 branch offices and representative offices in 6 markets around the world, and its primary mission is to maximise the social and economic contribution that tourism makes to the community of Hong Kong, and consolidate the city's position as a desired destination. In fulfilling this, it works with the Government, [[travel industry]] and other partners to market and promote Hong Kong worldwide, improve the range and quality of visitor facilities and tourism service standards, and enhance the experiences of visitors once they have arrived.

==Visitor centres==
* Hong Kong International Airport – Transfer Area and Buffer Halls A and B, Arrivals Level, Terminal 1 
* Lo Wu – Arrival Hall, 2/F, Lo Wu Terminal Building, [[Lo Wu Control Point]]
* Hong Kong Island – The Peak Piazza
* Kowloon – [[Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier|Star Ferry Concourse]], Tsim Sha Tsui

==HKTB Board==
The HKTB Board is appointed by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR Government and is made up of 20 members from various industries. The Commissioner for Tourism, who is an government official, holds the capacity as Deputy Chairman of the HKTB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/about-hktb/structure-and-management/hktb-board-members.jsp|title=HKTB Board Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality Tourism Services (QTS) scheme==
Launched in November 1999, the '''Quality Tourism Services (QTS) Scheme''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 優質旅遊服務) is an accreditation programme aimed at promoting service excellence among local businesses and assisting customers to identify quality service providers. To qualify, merchant must fulfill stringent criteria and undergo annual assessment. All accredited merchants must display the gold and black QTS sign on their shop windows for recognition. 

Initially, shops and restaurants were the only 2 categories covered by the QTS scheme. The scheme was extended to visitor accommodations and hair salons in November 2006 and March 2010 respectively.

As at March 2010, over 7,200 merchant outlets have been accredited under the QTS scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/jsp/doc/listDoc.jsp?charset=en&amp;doc_id=130857| title=Press Release: HKTB EXTENDS QUALITY TOURISM SERVICES SCHEME TO HAIRDRESSING INDUSTRY| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QTS scheme is one of the most successful consumer protection programmes in Hong Kong. The Intellectual Property Department reported in 2008 that 4,700 outlets had joined its "No Fakes Pledge" – another well-known consumer protection programme in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ipd.gov.hk/eng/pub_press/press_releases/Press_Release_e.pdf| title=Press Release: 10th anniversary celebration of "No Fakes Pledge" scheme| author=Intellectual Property Department| date=19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the launch of the QTS scheme, the use of membership badges bearing the iconic red junk logos of the former HKTA was discontinued in 2000. The HKTA membership badge was first introduced in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/about-hktb/images/2007-2008-02.pdf| title=HKTB Annual Report 2007/2008 – 50 Years of Hong Kong Tourism| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV commercial===
Starring famous Hong Kong actor/singer/producer [[Andy Lau]], the 2003 commercial was inspired by Lau's 2002 blockbuster movie [[Infernal Affairs]] – a movie about an undercover cop and a bad cop working for the triads. The core message of the commercial is shops selling genuine goods and providing high standard service should set themselves apart from dishonest merchants by getting the QTS accreditation. The commercial has been aired from time to time till these days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/jsp/doc/HKTB_listDoc.jsp?charset=&amp;doc_id=61456 |title=Press Release: Quality Tourism Services Scheme Enhancement Ensures Better Protection For Visitors |author=Hong Kong Tourism Board |date=19 December 2003 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3B9a_-lWWE| title=Quality Tourism Services (QTS) Scheme API| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The QTS commercial is often confused with another [[public service announcement]] (PSA) promoting quality services which was also fronted by Andy Lau. The PSA was filmed in 2002 by the [[Information Services Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.info.gov.hk/isd/tvapi/service1/english/high_eng.htm| title=TV Announcement: Success Starts with Quality Service| author=Information Services Department| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF_sRQQS8No| title=優質服務 致勝之道| author=Information Services Department| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 5 different versions all featuring rude vs. courteous shop assistants and drivers. Titled "Success Starts with Quality Service" (優質服務 致勝之道), the PSA was a huge success as one of Lau's lines, "Service like this just isn't good enough in today's standard"(今時今日咁嘅服務態度未夠架) has become a popular Hong Konger slang used to describe a poor service or a bad tempered person.

===VIP offers===
Simply by presenting his/her travel document and a copy of QTS promotional leaflet at a participating QTS merchant, visitor could enjoy special privileges ranging from exclusive discount to small gift (e.g. a free silk tee for purchasing a suit at a custom tailor). In addition to displaying the QTS gold and black sign, participating QTS merchants would also display the red VIP Offers sign as recognition. The VIP Offers programme was discontinued on 31 Dec 2008.

===Incidents===
====3D-GOLD Jewellery ({{sehk|0870}})====
Investigations were launched against one of the 3D-GOLD outlets after 40 customers complained they had been harassed by staff and prevented from leaving the shop.  The entire 3D-GOLD chain store was stripped of its QTS status with effect from 1 Dec 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/jsp/doc/listDoc.jsp?charset=en&amp;doc_id=75710| title=Press Release: Termination of QTS Status of 3D-GOLD| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| date=23 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first termination in the scheme's history.

The original 3D-GOLD Jewellery Holdings got into more controversies with the sudden death of its chairman, delisting from the stock exchange and it was on the verge of liquidation by the end of 2008. In July 2009, the jeweller was officially taken over by Hong Kong Resources Holdings ({{sehk|2882}}). 

The QTS status of the new 3D-GOLD chain was later reinstated after it had passed the assessment.

====Director of Audit's report====
The [[Audit Commission (Hong Kong)|Audit Commission]] carried out a comprehensive audit on the HKTB in 2006 – 07. In the report released in October 2007, an entire section was devoted to the QTS scheme. The commission made 3 recommendations suggesting HKTB should take action to improve the scheme and reduce the number of complaints, explore ways to achieve self-financing and encourage more operators to apply for the QTS Visitor Accommodation Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e49ch06_sum.pdf| title=Report No. 49 of the Director of Audit| author=Audit Commission| date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, HKTB committed to create more places in the quality training workshops for merchants and co-operate with the [[Home Affairs Department]] to proactively promote QTS Visitor Accommodation Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/primg/Summary%20table-E%20Final.pdf| title=Director of Audit No. 49 – Hong Kong Tourism Board Summary of Improvement Measures| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bird's nest vendors====
The QTS status of 3 merchants specialised in [[Bird's nest soup|bird's nest]] – a Chinese delicacy – were terminated on 27 July 2007. The 3 merchants had publicly admitted infringement of another merchant's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://partnernet.hktb.com/pnweb/jsp/doc/listDoc.jsp?charset=en&amp;doc_id=102181| title=Press Release: Statement of Termination| author=Hong Kong Tourism Board| date=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outsourcing====
In a bid to save HK$2 million annually (US$256,000) in operating costs, HKTB announced on 5 Nov 2010 that the assessment work of QTS merchants has been outsourced to the [[Hong Kong Productivity Council|Productivity Council]], while the work to engage merchants to offer discounts for visitors has been outsourced to AQ Communications. The saving will fund extra marketing work for the QTS scheme. As a result, the jobs of 17 permanent and contract staff of the Partnership &amp; Quality Tourism Services Department had been made redundant with immediate effect. Only 5 staff would be retained to monitor the outsourced work.&lt;ref name=scmp&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=927db64a8fc1c210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=Hong+Kong&amp;s=News| title=Tourism Board cutbacks queried| author=South China Morning Post| date=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local media reported that the staff affected were first notified at 3pm on the same day of the announcement and were asked to leave by day's end.

HKTB Deputy Executive Director Daisy Lam later reiterated to the media at an event launch function that the outsourcing was a result of an organizational review conducted a year ago in 2009.&lt;ref name=hkdn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=131184| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006140622/http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=131184| dead-url=yes| archive-date=6 October 2011| title=「優質旅遊」外判 旅發局17員工遣散| author=Hong Kong Daily News| date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview to local newspapers, Legislator [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] questioned about the quality of work after the outsourcing.&lt;ref name="scmp"/&gt; Lee also concerned that the affected staff will be unable to secure another job as the end of the year nears. Another lawmaker [[Wong Kwok-hing]] critisied HKTB for setting a bad example and he feared the private sector may follow suit.&lt;ref name="oncc"/&gt; 

Daisy Lam responded to critics that in addition to compensation, those affected may consider a transfer to the two outsourced bodies. Lam was not worried others would follow HKTB's move as other companies should make their own judgment call.&lt;ref name="hkdn"/&gt;

The five dimensions consist of [[ethnoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[Financescape|financescapes]], and '''ideoscapes'''. The suffix -''scape'' denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. Because cultural exchange and transactions have typically been restricted in the past due to geographical and economical aspects, Appadurai’s five dimensions give the opportunity for cultural transactions to occur.

'''Indian martial arts''' refers to the [[martial arts|fighting systems]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A variety of terms are used for the English phrases “Indian martial arts”, usually deriving from Sanskrit or Dravidian sources. While they may seem to imply specific disciplines (e.g. archery, armed combat), by Classical times they were used generically for all fighting systems.

Among the most common terms today, ''śastra-vidyā'', is a compound of the words ''{{IAST|śastra}}'' (weapon) and ''{{IAST|vidyā}}'' (knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;attested in [[Classical Sanskrit]] only, specifically in the [[Anargharāghava]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dhanurveda'' derives from the words for bow (''{{IAST|dhanushya}}'') and knowledge (''{{IAST|veda}}''), the “science of archery” in [[Puranas|Puranic]] literature, later applied to martial arts in general.&lt;ref&gt;attested from [[Epic Sanskrit]]; see {{cite book |last=Luijendijk |first=D.H. |title=Kalarippayat: The Essence and Structure of an Indian Martial Art |year=2008 |publisher=Oprat (LuLu.com) |isbn=1-58160-480-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vishnu Purana]] text describes dhanuveda as one of the traditional eighteen branches of “applied knowledge” or [[upaveda]], along with ''shastrashastra'' or [[military science]].&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/power.html |title=Actualizing Power and Crafting a Self in Kalarippayattu |publisher=Spa.ex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later term, ''yuddha kalā'', comes from the words ''yuddha'' meaning fight or combat and ''kalā'' meaning art or skill. The related term ''śastra kalā'' (lit. weapon art) usually refers specifically to armed disciplines. Another term, ''yuddha-vidyā'' or “combat knowledge”, refers to the skills used on the battlefield, encompassing not only actual fighting but also battle formations and strategy. Martial arts are usually learnt and practiced in the traditional [[akhara]]s.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

{{Further|Military history of India|Origin of Asian martial arts}}

===Antiquity (pre-Gupta)===
''Dhanurveda'', a section found in the [[Vedas]] (1700 BCE - 1100 BCE) contains references to martial arts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychophysical Acting: An Intercultural Approach After Stanislavski|page=66|publisher=Routledge|author1=Phillip B. Zarrilli |author2=Peter Hulton }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|page=182|author1=Denise Cush |author2=Catherine A.

The oldest recorded organized unarmed fighting art in the Indian subcontinent is [[malla-yuddha]] or combat-wrestling, codified into four forms and pre-dating the [[Vedic Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathinayoga.com/KalariWorld/Articles/other_article3.html |title=Kalarippayattu, The divine martial art of Kerala |date=16 May 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516231037/http://www.kathinayoga.com/KalariWorld/Articles/other_article3.html |archivedate=16 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories describing [[Krishna]] report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt; Based on such accounts, Svinth (2002) traces press-ups and squats used by Indian wrestlers to the pre-classical era.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;

In Sanskrit literature the term ''dwandwayuddha'' referred to a duel, such that it was a battle between only two warriors and not armies. Epics often describe the duels between deities and god-like heroes as lasting a month or more. The [[malla-yuddha]] (wrestling match) between [[Bhima]] and [[Jarasandha]] lasts 27 days. Similarly, the ''dwandayuddha'' between [[Parasurama]] and [[Bhishma]] lasts for 30 days, while that between [[Krishna]] and [[Jambavan]] lasts for 28 days. Likewise, the ''dwandwayudda'' between [[Bali (Ramayana)|Bali]] and Dundubhi, a demon in the form of a [[water buffalo]], lasts for 45 days. The [[Manusmṛti|Manusmriti]] tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during such a fight or duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing.

The ''Charanavyuha'' authored by [[Shaunaka]] mentions four ''upaveda'' (applied Vedas). Included among them are archery (''dhanurveda'') and military sciences (''shastrashastra''),&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; the mastery of which was the duty (''dharma'') of the warrior class. Kings usually belonged to the [[kshatria]] (warrior) class and thus served as heads of the army. They typically practiced archery, wrestling, boxing, and swordsmanship as part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Daily Life in Ancient India |author=Jeanine Auboyer |year=1965 |pp=58 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=France |isbn=1-84212-591-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include such rulers as [[Siddhartha Gautama]] and [[Rudradaman]]. The Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]] writes that the emperor [[Harsha]] was light on his feet despite his advancing age and managed to dodge and seize an assailant during an assassination attempt.&lt;ref name=Xuanzang/&gt;

Many of the popular sports mentioned in the [[Vedas]] and the epics have their origins in military training, such as boxing (''[[musti-yuddha]]''), wrestling (''maladwandwa''), chariot-racing (''rathachalan''), horse-riding (''aswa-rohana'') and archery (''dhanurvidya'').&lt;ref name="Timechart"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Timechart History of India |year=2005 |publisher=Robert Frederick Ltd. |isbn=0-7554-5162-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions were held not just as a contest of the players' prowess but also as a means of finding a bridegroom. [[Arjuna]], [[Rama]] and [[Siddhartha Gautama]] all won their consorts in such tournaments.

In the 3rd century, elements from the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], as well as finger movements in the ''nata'' dances, were incorporated into the fighting arts.&lt;ref name=Svinth&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Taylor |url=http://ejmas.com/kronos |title=Kronos: A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports |publisher=Ejmas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Indian fighting styles remain closely connected to [[yoga]], dance and performing arts. Some of the choreographed sparring in kalaripayat can be applied to dance&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zarrilli |first=Phillip B. |title=When the Body Becomes All Eyes: Paradigms, Discourses and Practices of Power in Kalarippayattu, a South Indian Martial Art |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kathakali]] dancers who knew [[kalaripayat]] were believed to be markedly better than other performers. Until recent decades, the [[chhau dance]] was performed only by martial artists. Some traditional Indian classical dance schools still incorporate martial arts as part of their exercise regimen.&lt;ref name="Luijendijk 08"&gt;Luijendijk 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Written evidence of martial arts in Southern India dates back to the [[Sangam literature]] of about the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD. The [[Akananuru]] and [[Purananuru]] describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and [[silambam]] in the Sangam era. The word [[kalari]] appears in the ''Puram'' (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and ''Akam'' (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word ''kalari tatt'' denoted a martial feat, while ''kalari kozhai'' meant a coward in war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmlandtours.net/kerala/tours/kalari/kalaripayatte/kalari.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829143736/http://www.palmlandtours.net/kerala/tours/kalari/kalaripayatte/kalari.htm |date=29 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military training&lt;ref&gt;Subramanian, N. (1966). ''Sangam polity''. Bombay: Asian Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; in target practice and horse riding. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (''vel''), sword (''val''), shield (''kedaham''), and bow and arrow (''vil ambu''). The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors to [[kalaripayat]].&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1"/&gt; References to “Silappadikkaram” in Sangam literature date back to the 2nd century. This referred to the [[silambam]] staff which was in great demand with foreign visitors.&lt;ref name=Raj&gt;{{cite book |last=Raj|first=J.

The ten fighting styles of northern sastra-vidya were said to have been created in different areas based on animals and gods, and designed for the particular geography of their origin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Tradition ascribes their convergence to the 6th-century Buddhist university of [[Takshashila]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} ancient India's intellectual capital. Located in present-day Panjab, Pakistan, the Ramayana ascribes the city's founding to [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] who named it after his son Taksha. From the 7th to the 5th centuries BC it was held in high regard as a great centre of trade and learning,&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt; attracting students from throughout present-day Pakistan and northern India. Among the subjects taught were the “military sciences”, and archery was one of its prime arts.

Some measures were put into place to discourage martial activity during the Buddhist period. The [[Khandhaka]] in particular forbids wrestling, boxing, archery, and swordsmanship. However, references to fighting arts are found in early [[Buddhist texts]], such as the [[Lotus Sutra]] (c. 1st century AD) which refers to a boxing art while speaking to [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref name=Haines&gt;Bruce A. Haines (1995). ''Karate's History and Traditions'' (p. 23-25). Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8048-1947-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also categorised combat techniques as joint locks, fist strikes, grapples and throws. The [[Lotus Sutra]] makes further mention of a [[martial art]] with dance-like movements called ''Nara''. Another [[Buddhist]] [[sutra]] called ''Hongyo-kyo'' (佛本行集經) describes a “strength contest” between Gautama Buddha's half-brother [[Nanda (Buddhism)|Prince Nanda]] and his cousin [[Devadatta]].&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; Siddhartha Gautama himself was a champion wrestler and swordsman before becoming the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;

===Classical period (3rd to 10th centuries)===
Like other branches of [[Sanskrit literature]], treatises on martial arts become more systematic in the course of the 1st millennium AD. [[Vajra-musti]], an armed grappling style, is mentioned in sources of the early centuries AD.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt; Around this time, [[Tantra|tantric]] philosophers developed important metaphysical concepts such as [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], [[chakra]], and [[mantra]].&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;

The ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' (c. 4th century) identifies 107 vital points on the human body&lt;ref&gt;G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). ''Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita''.&lt;/ref&gt; of which 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt; [[Sushurata|Sushruta]]'s work formed the basis of the medical discipline [[ayurveda]] which was taught alongside various martial arts.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt; With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that [[Indian subcontinent]]'s early fighters knew and practised attacking or defending vital points.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1992&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zarrilli, Phillip B. |year=1992 |title= To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu |url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html|journal=Journal of Asian Martial Arts |volume=1 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 630, King [[Narasimhavarman]] of the [[Pallava dynasty]] commissioned dozens of granite sculptures showing unarmed fighters disarming armed opponents. This is similar to the style described in the ''Agni Purana''.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;

Martial arts were not exclusive to the [[kshatriya]] caste, though the warrior class used them more extensively. The 8th-century text ''Kuvalaymala'' by Udyotanasuri recorded fighting techniques being taught at educational institutions, where non-kshatriya students from throughout the subcontinent “were learning and practicing archery, fighting with sword and shield, with daggers, sticks, lances, and with fists, and in duels (''niyuddham'')”.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1/&gt; Hindu priests of the traditional [[gurukula]] still teach unarmed fighting techniques to their students as a way of increasing stamina and training the physical body{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

The [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] came into power during the 7th century and founded a kyshatria dynasty in northern India which exceeded the preceding Gupta Empire. During this period, Emperor Nagabhata I (750–780 AD) and Mihir Bhoja I (836–890) commissioned various texts on martial arts, and were themselves practitioners of these systems. ''Shiva Dhanuveda'' was composed in this era. The ''khadga'', a two-handed broad-tipped heavy longsword, was given special preference. It was even used for ''khadga-puja'', ritualised worship of the sword. The Gurjara-Pratiharas continuously fought off Arab invasions, particularly during the [[Caliphate campaigns in India]]. The Arab chronicler Sulaiman wrote of the Gurjara ruler as the greatest foe to Islamic expansion, while at the same time praising his cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Middle Ages (11th to 15th centuries)===
[[Kalaripayat]] had developed into its present form by the 11th century, during an extended period of warfare between the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] and [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] dynasties.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1998"/&gt; The earliest treatise discussing the techniques of malla-yuddha is the ''Malla Purana'' (c. 13th century), unlike the earlier ''Manasollasa'' which gives the names of movements but no descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alter |first=Joseph S. |title=The Wrestler's Body: Identity and Ideology in North India |date=August 1992b |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of several centuries, invading Muslim armies managed to occupy much of present-day Pakistan and northern India. In response to the spread of Muslim rule,&lt;ref name="Kannadaempire"&gt;Historians such as [[P. B. Desai]] (''History of Vijayanagar Empire'', 1936), [[Henry Heras]] (''The Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagara'', 1927), [[B.A. Saletore]] (''Social and Political Life in the Vijayanagara Empire'', 1930), G.S. Gai (Archaeological Survey of India), William Coelho (''The Hoysala Vamsa'', 1955) and Kamath (Kamath 2001, pp157–160)&lt;/ref&gt; the kingdoms of [[south India]] united in the 14th century to found the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Physical culture was given much attention by both royalty and commoners in the empire, with wrestling being particularly popular with both men and women.&lt;ref name=Kamath&gt;{{cite book |author=Suryanath U. Kamath |title=A concise history of Karnataka: from pre-historic times to the present|origyear=1980|year= 2001|publisher= Jupiter Books|location= Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters of Vijayanagara, and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nilakanta Sastri|first= K.A.|title=   A history of South India from prehistoric times to the fall of Vijayanagar|origyear=1955|year=2002|publisher= Indian Branch, Oxford University Press|location= New Delhi|isbn= 0-19-560686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling. One account describes an [[akhara]] in [[Chandragiri]] where noblemen practiced jumping exercises, [[musti-yuddha|boxing]], fencing and [[malla-yuddha|wrestling]] almost everyday before dinner to maintain their health, and observed that “men as old as seventy years look only thirty”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagara |author=[[Henry Heras]] |year=1927 |location=Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian traveller [[Pietro Della Valle]] wrote of cane-fighting in southern India. According to Pietro, it was the custom for soldiers to specialise in their own particular weapon of expertise and never use any other even during war, “thereby becoming very expert and well practised in that which he takes to”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pietro Della Valle - The Travels |author=Edward Grey |year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As their ancient predecessors, swordplay and wrestling were commonly practiced by the royalty of Vijayanagara. [[Krishna Deva Raya]] is said to have arranged a duel between a champion swordsman and the prince of [[Odisha]] who was known for being an expert with both the sword and dagger. The prince accepted the challenge until he learned he would be fighting one not of royal blood and so killed himself rather than having to “soil his hands”. [[Fernao Nunes]] and the Persian envoy Adbur Razzak relate that [[Deva Raya II]] survived an assassination attempt “as he was a man who knew how to use both sword and dagger better than anyone in his kingdom, avoided by twists and turns of his body the thrusts aimed at him, freed himself from him, and slew him with a short sword that he had.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India |author=Robert Sewell |year=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of victories, the [[Central Asia]]n conqueror [[Babur]] established [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in north India during the 16th century. The Mughals were patrons of India's native arts, not only recruiting akhara-trained Rajput fighters for their armies but even practicing these systems themselves.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[Akbarnama]] tells that Emperor [[Akbar]] practiced [[gatka]] every day&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ausanasa Dhanurveda Sankalanam'' dates to the late 16th century, compiled under the patronage of [[Akbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bogenloewe.de/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1269&amp;language=en|title= Dhanurveda: The knowledge of the bow|author=Wiethase, H|website=bogenloewe|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' tells that the Mughal court had various kinds of fighting men from around the [[Mughal Empire|empire]] who would demonstrate their skills every day in exchange for rewards. Among them were said to be both native and [[pehlwani|Mughal wrestlers]], slingers from [[Gujarat]], Hindustani athletes, [[musti-yuddha|boxers]], stone-throwers and many others.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“There are several kinds of gladiators, each performing astonishing feats. In fighting they show much speed and agility and blend courage and skill in squatting down and rising up again. Some of them use shields in fighting, others use cudgels. Others again use no means of defence, and fight with one hand only; these are called ''ek-hath''. Those who come from the eastern districts of Hindostan use a small shield called “''chirwah''”. Those from the southern provinces have shields of such magnitude as to cover a man and a horse. This kind of shield is called ''tilwah''. Another class use a shield somewhat less than the height of a man. Some again use a long sword, and seizing it with both hands they perform extraordinary feats of skill. There is another famous class called Bankúlis. They have no shield but make use of a peculiar kind of sword which, though curved towards the point, is straight near the handle. They wield it with great dexterity. The skill that they exhibit passes all description. Others are skilful in fighting with daggers and knives of various forms; of these there are upwards of a hundred thousand. Each class has a different name; they also differ in their performances. At court there are a thousand gladiators always in readiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ain I Akbari of Abul Fazl 'Allami |year=1993 |publisher=Gorgias Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Avid hunters, a popular sport among the Mughals was ''shikar'' or tiger-hunting. While often done with arrows and later even rifles, it was considered most impressive to kill a tiger with a hand-to-hand weapon such as a sword or dagger.&lt;ref name=Capwell&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia Of Knives, Daggers And Bayonets |author= Tobias Capwell |year=2009 |publisher=Anness Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; A warrior who managed to best a tiger would be awarded the title of ''Pachmar''.

In the 16th century, [[Madhusudana Saraswati]] of Bengal organised a section of the Naga tradition of armed [[sannyasi]] in order to protect Hindus from the intolerant Mughal rulers. Although generally said to abide by the principle of non-violence (''ahimsā''), these Dashanami monks had long been forming [[akhara]] for the practice of both [[yoga]] and martial arts. Such warrior-ascetics have been recorded from 1500 to as late as the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10689/9526/5/Chapter%201_1%20-%20108p.pdf|format=PDF|title= A history of Dasnami Naga Sanyasis, Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Sri Panchayati Akhara Mahanirvani, Allahabad|publisher=Dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although tradition attributes their creation to the 8th-century philosopher [[Sankaracharya]]. They began as a stratum of [[Rajput]] warriors who would gather after harvest and arm peasants into militarised units, effectively acting as a self-defense squad. Prevalent in [[Rajasthan]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Bengal]], they would give up their occupations and leave their families to live as mercenaries. Naga sadhu today rarely practice any form of fighting other than wrestling, but still carry [[trishula]], swords, canes and spears. To this day their retreats are called ''chhauni'' or armed camps, and they have been known to hold mock jousts among themselves. As recently as the 1950s, it was not unusual for Naga sadhu to strike to kill someone over issues of honour.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-15/allahabad/36352194_1_naga-sadhu-akharas-hindus|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|work=The Times of India|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maratha dynasty (1674–1859)===
[[File:Shivaji statue Mumbai.JPG|210px|thumb|Statue of [[Shivaji]], the warrior-king who brought the Maratha people and fighting style to prominence]]
Coming from a hilly region characterized by valleys and caves, the [[Maratha]]s became expert horsemen who favoured light armour and highly mobile cavalry units during war. Known especially as masters of swords and spears, their heavily martial culture and propensity for the lance is mentioned as early as the 7th century by [[Xuanzang]].&lt;ref name=Xuanzang&gt;Destruction of Maharashtra and the Marathas in the first half of seventh century “Travels of Hsuen Tsang,” Vol. IV, Samual Beal, P, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; After serving the Dakshin sultanates of the early 17th century, the scattered Marathas united to found their own kingdom under the warrior [[Shivaji|Shivaji Raje]].

===Paika Rebellion===
Paika is the [[Odia language|Odia]] word for fighter or warrior. Their training schools, known as [[paika akhada]], can be traced back to ancient [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] and their art was at one time patronised by King [[Kharavela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissaannualreference/ORA-2004/pdf/martial_tradition_of_orissa.pdf |title=Odisha Government Portal |publisher=Orissa.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1817, under the leadership of [[Bakshi Jagabandhu|Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mohapatra]], nearly 400 Khanda of Ghumusar in [[Ganjam]] marched towards [[Khordha]] in protest against British colonial rule. Many government buildings were burnt down and all the officials fled. The British commander of one detachment was killed during a battle at Gangapada. The paika managed to capture two bases at Puri and Pipli before spreading the rebellion further to Gop, Tiran, Kanika and [[Kujang, Odisha|Kujang]].

===Modern period (1857—present)===
Indian martial arts underwent a period of decline after the full establishment of British colonial rule in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1992/&gt; More European modes of organizing kings, armies and governmental institutions, and the increasing use of firearms, gradually eroded the need for traditional combat training associated with caste-specific duties.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1998/&gt; The British colonial government banned [[kalaripayat]] in 1804 in response to a series of revolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luijendijk |first=D.H. |title=Kalarippayat: India's Ancient Martial Art |year=2005 |publisher=Paladin Press |location=Boulder |isbn=1-58160-480-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silambam]] was also banned and became more common in the [[Malay Peninsula]] than its native Tamil Nadu. Nevertheless, traditional fighting systems persisted, sometimes even under the patronage of enthusiastic British spectators who tended to remark on the violence of native boxing and the acrobatic movements characteristic of Indian fighting styles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The British took advantage of communities with a heavily militaristic culture, characterising them as “[[martial races]]” and employing them in the armed forces. Sikhs - already known among Indians for their martial practices - were particularly valued by the colonists as soldiers and guards, and were posted throughout not only India but Southeast Asia and other parts of the British Empire{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Members of the army were allowed to box as a way of settling disputes, provided that they were still able to carry out their duties as soldiers after a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Saturday Magazine|author1=Runjeet Singh |author2=Chief of Lahore |date=June 1838 |issue=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular form of boxing used by the Punjabi soldiers was ''loh-musti'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} as the [[kara (Sikhism)|kara]] worn by Sikhs could be wielded like [[brass knuckles]].

The resurgence of public interest in [[kalaripayat]] began in the 1920s in Tellicherry as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout [[south India]] which characterised the growing reaction against British colonial rule.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1998/&gt; During the following three decades, other regional styles were subsequently revived such as [[silambam]] in Tamil Nadu, [[thang-ta]] in Manipur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.indiapress.org/thang_ta.php|title=Martial Arts in India|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[paika akhada]] in Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iakoweb.com/pakhada.html|title=Welcome to IAKOWEB.COM|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032151/http://www.iakoweb.com/pakhada.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==

===Agni Purana===
One of the earliest extant manual of Indian martial arts is in the [[Agni Purana]] (dated to between the 8th and the 11th century),&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1992/&gt; The dhanurveda section in the Agni Purana spans chapters 248–251, categorizing weapons into thrown and unthrown classes and further divided into several sub-classes.  It catalogs training into five major divisions for different types of warriors, namely charioteers, elephant-riders, horsemen, infantry, and wrestlers.

The nine [[asana|asanas]] (stances) in the fight are listed below:
#''{{IAST|samapada}}'' (“holding the feet even”): standing in closed ranks with the feet put together (248.9)
#''{{IAST|vaiśākha}}'': standing erect with the feet apart (248.10)
#''{{IAST|maṇḍala}}'' (“disk”): standing with the knees apart, arranged in the shape of a flock of geese (248.11)
#''{{IAST|ālīḍha}}'' (“licked, polished”): bending the right knee with the left foot pulled back (248.12)
#''{{IAST|pratyālīḍha}}'': bending the left knee with the right foot pulled back (248.13)
#''{{IAST|jāta}}'' (“origin”): placing the right foot straight with the left foot perpendicular, the ankles being five fingers apart (248.14)
#''{{IAST|daṇḍāyata}}'' (“extended staff”): keeping the right knee bent with the left leg straight, or vice versa; called ''{{IAST|vikaṭa}}'' (“dreadful”) if the two legs are two palm-lengths apart (248.16)
#''{{IAST|sampuṭa}}'' (“hemisphere”)  (248.17)
#''{{IAST|swastika}}'' (“well-being”): keeping the feet 16 fingers apart and lifting the feet a little (248.19)

Then there follows a more detailed discussion of archery technique.

The section concludes with listing the names of actions or “deeds” possible with a number of weapons, including 32 positions to be taken with sword and shield (''{{IAST|khaḍgacarmavidhau}}''),&lt;ref&gt;
''{{IAST|(1.) bhrāntam (2.) udbhrāntam (3.) āviddham (4.) āplutaṃ (5.) viplutaṃ (6.) sṛtaṃ }}''
''{{IAST|(7.) sampātaṃ (8.) samudīśañca (9.-10.) śyenapātamathākulaṃ}}'' (251.1)
''{{IAST|(11.) uddhūtam (12.) avadhūtañca (13.) savyaṃ (14.) dakṣiṇam eva ca}}''
''{{IAST|(15.-16.) anālakṣita-visphoṭau (17.-18.) karālendramahāsakhau}}'' (251.2)
''{{IAST|(19.-20.) vikarāla-nipātau ca (21.-22.) vibhīṣaṇa-bhayānakau}}''
''{{IAST|(23–24.) samagrārdha (25.) tṛtīyāṃśapāda (26.-28.) pādardhavārijāḥ}}'' (251.3)
''{{IAST|(29.) pratyālīḍham (30.) athālīḍhaṃ (31.) varāhaṃ (32.) lulitan tathā}}'' (251.4ab)
&lt;/ref&gt; 11 names of techniques of using a rope in fighting, along with 5 names of “acts in the rope operation” along with lists of “deeds” pertaining to the [[chakram]] (war-quoit), the spear, the ''tomara'' (iron club), the [[gada (mace)]], the axe, the hammer, the ''bhindipāla'' or ''laguda'', the [[vajra]], the dagger, the slingshot, and finally deeds with a bludgeon or cudgel. A short passage near the end of the text returns to the larger concerns of warfare and explains the various uses of war elephants and men. The text concludes with a description of how to appropriately send the well-trained fighter off to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nmmkM0fVS-cC&amp;pg=PA467 |title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas - Swami Parmeshwaranand|page=467 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthashastra===
The [[Arthashastra]], c. 4th century BCE, typically attributed to [[Chanakya]] chief advisor of [[Chandragupt Maurya]] is one of the earliest treatises on state craft, including diverse topics such as economics, politics, diplomacy and military strategy.

===Others===
There is an extant ''Dhanurveda-Samhita'' dating to the mid-14th century, by Brhat Sarngadhara Paddhati (ed. 1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcat.unigoa.ac.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=1637|title=Vasisthas Dhanurveda Samhita : (Text with English Translation)|website=Goa University Library|accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Other scattered references to fighting arts in medieval texts include the:
&lt;br /&gt;''Kamandakiya Nitisara'' (c. 8th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/kamandakiyanitis00kamarich#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Kamandakiya Nitisara or, The Elements of polity, in English.|author=Manmatha Nath Dutt|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ed. Manmatha Nath Dutt, 1896),

&lt;br /&gt;The ''[[Manasollasa]]''  of [[Somesvara III]] (12th century)

==Weapons &amp; Arts==
A wide array of weapons are used in the Indian subcontinent, some of which are not found anywhere else. According to P.C. Chakravati in ''The Art of War in Ancient India'', armies used standard weapons such as wooden or metal tipped spears, swords, thatched bamboo, wooden or metal shields, axes, short and long bows in warfare as early as the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art of War in Ancient India |author=P.C. Chakravarti |year=2004 |publisher=Low Price Publications |isbn=978-8185557472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military accounts of the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. 240–480) and the later Agni Purana identify over 130 different weapons.

The ''[[Agni Purana]]'' divides weapons into thrown and unthrown classes. The thrown (''mukta'') class includes twelve weapons altogether which come under four categories, viz.
[[File:Katar &amp; sheath Art Museum SF B84W3.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Katara (dagger)|katara]], the most characteristic&lt;ref name=Capwell/&gt; of daggers in the Indian subcontinent.]]

*''yantra-mukta'': projectile weapons such as the sling or the bow
*''pāṇi-mukta'': weapons thrown by hand such as the javelin
*''mukta-sandarita'': weapons that are thrown and drawn back, such as the rope-spear
*''mantra-mukta'': mythical weapons that are thrown by magic incantations ([[mantra]]), numbering 6 types

These were opposed to the much larger unthrown class of three categories.
*''hasta-śastra'' or ''amukta'': melee weapons that do not leave the hand, numbering twenty types
*''muktāmukta'': weapons that can be thrown or used in-close, numbering 98 varieties
*''bāhu-yuddha'' or ''bhuja-yuddha'': weapons of the body, i.e. unarmed fighting

The duel with bow and arrows is considered the most noble, fighting with the spear ranks next, while fighting with the sword is considered unrefined, and wrestling is classed as the meanest or worst form of fighting. Only a [[Brahmin]]s could be an [[acharya]] (teacher) of sastravidya, [[Kshatriya]] and [[vaishya]] should learn from the Acharya, while a [[shudra]] could not take a teacher, left to “fight of his own in danger”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agni Purana |publisher=Sri Satguru Publications |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, weaponry evolved and India became famous for its flexible [[wootz]] steel. The most commonly taught weapons in the Indian martial arts today are types of swords, daggers, spears, staves, cudgels and maces.&lt;ref name=Draeger/&gt;

Weapons are linked to several superstitions and cultural beliefs in the Indian subcontinent. Drawing a weapon without reason is forbidden and considered by Hindus to be disrespectful to the goddess [[Chandi]]ka. Thus the saying that a sword cannot be sheathed until it has drawn blood. It was a mother's duty to tie a warrior's sword around his waist before war or a duel. In addition, she would cut her finger with the sword and make a [[tilak]] on his head from a drop of her blood. Weapons themselves were also anointed with tilak, most often from the blood of a freshly-decapitated goat (''chatanga''). Other taboos include looking at one's reflection in the blade, telling the price or source of acquisition, throwing it on the ground or using it for domestic purposes.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/departments-arms-armour.asp?lk=dp9|title=National Museum, New Delhi|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mel-Puttah-Bemoh.jpg|thumb|100px|A southern two-handed sword]]

===Swordsmanship (Khadgavidya)===

[[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]] are said to be skilled swordsmen in [[Mahabharata]]. Sword-fighting is one of the common Indian fighting arts. Varieties include the curved single-edge sword, the straight double-edge sword, the two-handed longsword, the [[pata (sword)|gauntlet-sword]], and the [[urumi]] or flexible sword. Techniques differ from one state to another but all make extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the user's head. The flexible nature and light weight of Indian swords allows for speed but provides little defensive ability, so that the swordsman must instead rely on body maneuvers to dodge attacks. Entire systems exist focusing on drawing the sword out of the opponent's body. Stances and [[kata|forms]] traditionally made up the early training before students progress to free sparring with sticks to simulate swords in an exercise called [[gatka]], although this term is more often used in English when referring to the Panjabi-Sikh fighting style. A common way to practice precision-cutting is to slice [[clove]]s or [[lemon]]s, eventually doing so while blindfolded. Pairing two swords of equal length, though considered impractical in some parts of the world, is common and was considered highly advantageous in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Draeger/&gt;

===Staffplay (Lathikhela)===

Stick-fighting ([[lathi khela]]) may be taught as part of a wider system like [[Gatka]], [[silambam]] or on its own{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. In the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' the sage [[Vātsyāyana]] enjoins all women to practice fighting with single-stick, quarterstaff, sword and bow and arrow in addition to the art of love-making. The stick (''lathi'' in [[Prakrit]]) is typically made of [[bamboo]] with steel caps at the ends to prevent it from splintering{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Wooden sticks made from Indian ebony may also be used{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. It ranges from the length of a cudgel to a staff equal to the wielders height{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. The stick used during matches is covered in leather to cushion the impact{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Points are awarded based on which part of the body is hit. Techniques differ from system to system, but northern styles tend to primarily use only one end of the staff for attacking while the other end is held with both hands{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

Sikh martial art [[Gatka]] was developed in the North by sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib and it was further developed and preached by tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Gatka is associated with the Sikhs history and an integral part of an array of Sikh Shastar Vidiya developed during 15th century for self-defense. Southern styles like also make use of this technique but will more often use both ends of the staff to strike. The latter is the more common method of attacking in the eastern states and [[Bangladesh]], combined with squatting and frequent changes in height.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Spearplay===

[[Yudhishthira]] is said to be a master in spearplay warfare in ''[[Mahabharata]]'', while [[Shalya]] was also noted to be an excellent warrior in the field of spearplay. Also according to Indian Hindu myths, [[Kartikeya]], the son of Lord [[Shiva]], is said to be skilled in spear-fighting, by holding his divine spear called [[Vel]]. The Indian spear is typically made of [[bamboo]] with a steel blade. It can be used in hand-to-hand combat or thrown when the fighters are farther apart. Despite primarily being a thrusting weapon, the wide spearhead also allows for many slashing techniques. By the 17th century, Rajput mercenaries in the Mughal army were using a type of spear which integrated a pointed spear butt and a club near the head, making it similar to a mace. On the other hand, the longer cavalry spear was made of wood, with red cloth attached near the blade to prevent the opponent's blood from dripping to the shaft. The Marathas were revered for their skill of wielding a ten-foot spear called ''bothati'' ({{lang|pa|ਬੋਥਾਟੀ}}) from horseback. Bothati fighting is practiced with a ball-tipped lance, the end of which is covered in dye so that hits may easily be confirmed. In solo training, the spear is aimed at a pile of stones. From this was eventually developed the uniquely Indian ''vita'' which has a {{convert|5|ft|m}} length of cord attached to the butt end of the weapon and tied around the spearman's wrist. Using this cord the spear can be pulled back after it has been thrown.&lt;ref name=Draeger&gt;{{cite book |title=Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] and Robert W. Smith |year=1969 |publisher=Kondansha International Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social life in Maharashtra under the Peshwas |last=Desai |first=Sudha Vishwanath |year=1980 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |oclc= 8243834 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archery (Dhanurvidya)===

Archery is noted to be one of the noblest form of defense within Indian cultural heritage. [[Siddharta Gautama]] was a champion with the bow, while [[Rama]], [[Arjuna]], [[Karna]], [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]] and [[Ekalavya]] of the epics were all said to be peerless archers. 

Indian bows were described as the height of their users by [[Arrian]], and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] bows in 1518 as “long like those of England”.&lt;ref&gt;no primary attribution, quoted in Dirk H.A. Kolff. Naukar, Rajput, &amp; Sepoy. The ethnohistory of the military labour market in Hindustan, 1450-1860. University of Cambridge Oriental Publications no. 43. Cambridge University Press 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Composite bows]] are shown in [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] artwork. 

Traditional archery is today practiced mainly in the far northern states of [[Ladakh]] and [[Arunachal]]. One sport which has persisted into the present day is ''thoda'' from [[Himachal Pradesh]], in which a team of archers attempt to shoot blunt arrows at the legs of the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Timechart"/&gt;

===Mace-fighting (Gadayuddha)===

Mace (gada) is the weapon of God [[Hanuman]] in [[Ramayana]]. Lord [[Vishnu]] also carries a gada named [[Kaumodaki]] in one of his four hands. In the Mahabharata epic, the fighters [[Bhima]], [[Duryodhana]], [[Jarasandha]] and [[Balarama]] were said to be masters of the gada. In the mace combat, Bhima wins the final battle against Duryodhana by hitting his inner thigh. Such an attack below the waist was said to be against the etiquette of mace duels, implying a degree of commonality to this type of fighting. It was and still is used as training equipment by wrestlers. The traditional [[gada (mace)]] was essentially a wooden or steel sphere mounted on a handle and with a single spike at the top. An alternative mace-head was the lotus-shaped ''padam''. According to the ''[[Agni Purana]]'', the gada can be handled in twenty different ways. Due to its weight, the gada is said to be best suited to fighters with a large build or great strength. The Mughal club or mace, known as a ''gurj'' or ''gargaj'', had a head consisting of 8-10 petal-shaped blades. Fitted with basket-hilt, a spherical pommel, and a spiked top, this type of club was designed for beating down armour-clad opponents. Alternatively, some gurj had a spiked top and a hand-guard.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=63&amp;id=9&amp;lk=dp9|title=National Museum, New Delhi|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling (Mallayuddha) {{anchor|Wrestling}}===
{{Main|Pehlwani|Malla-yuddha}}

Grappling arts (''malla-vidya''), practiced either as sport or fighting style, are found throughout the entirety of the Indian subcontinent. True combat-wrestling is called [[malla-yuddha]], while the term [[malakhra]] refers to wrestling for sport. Malla-yuddha was codified into four forms which progressed from purely sportive contests of strength to actual full-contact fights known as ''yuddha''.&lt;ref name=Draeger/&gt; Due to the extreme violence, this final form is generally no longer practised. The second form, wherein the wrestlers attempt to lift each other off the ground for three seconds, persists in [[Karnataka]]. Traditional malla-yuddha is virtually extinct in the north where it has been supplanted by kusti, but another form called [[malakhra]] still exists in parts of India and [[Sindh]], Pakistan{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. [[Vajra-musti]] was another old grappling art in which the competitors wrestled while wearing a horned knuckleduster. In a later style called ''naki ka kusti'' (claw wrestling), the duellists fought with [[bagh nakha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book Of The Sword |author=[[Richard F. Burton]] |year=1884 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |isbn=0-486-25434-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous styles of folk wrestling are also found in India's countryside, such as [[mukna]] from [[Manipur]] and [[Inbuan wrestling]] from [[Mizoram]].

===Boxing (Mushtiyuddha)===

Boxing ([[musti-yuddha]]) is traditionally considered the roughest form of Indian unarmed combat. In ancient times it was popular throughout northern Indian subcontinent, but is rarely practiced today. Boxers harden their fists by striking stone and other hard objects. Matches may be either one-on-one or group fights. All kinds of strikes and grabs are allowed, and any part of the body may be targeted except the groin.&lt;ref name=Draeger/&gt; Another form of boxing was ''loh-musti'' (meaning “iron fist”), said{{By whom|date=August 2014}} to have been practiced by the God [[Krishna]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. In this variation, boxers fought while wielding a [[kara (Sikhism)|kara]] or steel bracelet like a knuckleduster{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Grabs, kicks, biting and attacks to the groin were all legal, the only prohibition being spitting on the opponent which was considered crude and dishonourable{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. The kara used for regular matches was unadorned{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but the form employed during war had one or more spikes around its edge{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. The kara may be paired with one on each hand{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but it was generally only worn on one hand so the other hand could be left free{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. In some cases the free hand could be paired with another weapon, most commonly the [[bagh nakha]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

===Kicking===
Kick-fighting(''aki kiti'') is the preserve of tribes from [[Nagaland]]. While the entire [[Naga people|Naga population]] of northeast India and northwest Myanmar was traditionally known for their skill with broadswords (''dao'') and other weapons, disputes among tribesmen and between tribes were settled with a solely kick-based form of unarmed fighting. The goal is to either drive the opponent to their knees or outside of the ring. Only the feet are used to strike, and even blocking must be done with the legs.&lt;ref&gt;“Nagaland Kickboxing”. ''Last Man Standing''. BBC and Discovery USA. 17 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pugilism===
Many forms of unarmed combat (''bāhu-yuddha'' or ''bhuja-yuddha'') incorporate too wide an array of techniques to be accurately categorized. In modern times when the carrying of weapons is no longer legal, teachers of the martial arts often emphasise the unarmed techniques as these are seen to be more practical for self-defense purposes. A warrior who fights unarmed is referred to as a ''bhajanh'', literally meaning someone who fights with their arms. The bare-handed components of Indian fighting arts are typically based on the movements of animals or Hindu deities. Binot, a Central Indian art which focuses on defending against both armed and unarmed opponents, may be the earliest system of its kind. In the Mughal era, such fighters were known as ''ek-hath'' (lit. “one-hand”), so named because they would demonstrate their art using only one arm.&lt;ref name=Draeger/&gt;

===Bal Vidya===
64 different types of skills &amp; arts existed in ancient India which lead to well developed individuals boosting their mind, body and intellect making them capable of performing their responsibilities efficiently and effectively on personal, social and national level. Today, unhealthy and irregular lifestyles, frustrations and rising competitions in every sphere of life are affecting the health of people, especially the youth. In such a scenario, one of the ancient Indian arts referred to as “Bal Vidya” can help not only to improve the physical health but also upscale the mental and intellectual well-being of a person. A strong mind and intellect is equally important along with a strong body. Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation (Mumbai, India) attempts to review these ancient Indian martial arts form and provides “Bal Vidya” training to both men and women free of charge. Art forms like Mudgal Vidya, Vajra Mushthi, Surya Bhedan, Ashwa and various types of Yashwanti Malla Vidya using various weapons like Laathi (iron-bound bamboo stick), Kaathi (Pole), Fari-Gadga, Dorkhand (rope)and Dandpatta (gauntlet-sword).  A book detailing all these art forms with the title “Bhartiya Prachin Bal Vidya” (The Ancient Indian Bal Art) is also available for achieving proficiency through practice post attending training sessions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ancientindianmartialarts.blogspot.in/2011/08/bal-vidya-and-yashwanti-mall-vidya.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aniruddhafoundation.com/compassion-bala-vidya-men-women/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kal%C4%81]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/ashoknene/sixty-four-arts-of-ancient-india-45933958&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems==

As in other respects of [[Indian culture]], Indian martial arts can be roughly divided into northern and southern styles. The northern systems (including Pakistan and Bangladesh) may generically be referred to as ''shastra-vidiya'', although this term is often used synonymously with [[gatka]]. The main difference is that [[north India|the north]] was more exposed to [[Persianate]] influence during the [[Mughal period]], while [[south India|the south]] is more conservative in preserving ancient and medieval traditions. The exception to this rule are the northeastern states which, due to their geographic location, were closed off from most pre-European foreign invaders. As a result, northeast Indian culture and fighting methods are also closely related to that of [[Southeast Asia]]. In addition to the major division between north and south, martial systems in the Indian subcontinent tend to be associated with certain states, cities, villages or ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=vajramushti/&gt;

===Regional Styles===
;Andhra Pradesh
Masters in Andhra Pradesh trace their lineage to the Vijayanagara empire, popular in [[Konaseema]] region. The native system of ''Chedi Talimkhana'' or ''yudhkaushalya che talim'' is often abbreviated to '''Talimkhana''' or simply '''Talim'''. The art makes use of several weapons which are used in preset forms. These include knife fighting (''baku samu''), sword fighting (''katti samu''), and staff fighting (''kara samu'') in addition to other weapons such as the [[gada (mace)]] and [[pata (sword)|pata (guantlet sword)]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ancient-martial-art-form-still-in-vogue/article831534.ece|title=Ancient martial art form still in vogue|author=B.V.S.

;Bengal (West Bengal and Bangladesh)
Bengali war-dances bear testament to the weapons once used in the Bengal region. Today most of these weapons are used only in choreographed fights, including ''dao khela'' (knife fighting) and ''fala khela'' (sword fighting){{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Traditional stick-fighting ([[lathi khela]]) is still used in free sparring today{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. The sticks may be short like a cudgel or a long staff. The former are sometimes paired with a shield.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

;Bihar
“Pari-khanda” is a fighting form created by [[Rajputs]] and is still practised in many parts of [[Bihar]]. “Pari” means shield and “khanda” means sword according “Chhau” region, therefore this art uses sword and shield for fighting. This fighting form has given birth to a local dance form named “Chhau” dance and its martial elements have been fully absorbed by this dance. It is even practised in some parts of [[Jharkhand]] and [[Odisha]]. Chhau is the name of the traditional dance- drama of the eastern regions of India and is of three types. The three forms of “Chhau” are named after the district or village where they are performed, i.e. the Purulia Chau of [[Bengal]], the Seraikella Chau of [[Bihar]] and the Mayurbhanj Chau of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].

;Karnataka
The Kannada fighting arts are taught exclusively at traditional training halls or ''garadi mane''. Disciplines include unarmed combat (''kai varase''), staff-fighting (''kolu varase'') and sword-fighting (''katti varase'') among various other weapons. These are most often seen today only during choreographed demonstrations at festivals.&lt;ref name=vajramushti/&gt;

;Kashmir
Kashmiri swordsmanship is said to have an ancient history, but it was only much later that it acquired its modern name of [[sqay]]. Sqay survived a decline following the [[partition of India]] by adopting competitive methodologies of karate and taekwondo. Types of competition include sparring, breaking, and forms or ''khawankay''. Pracitioners spar using fake swords called ''tora'' which are paired with a shield. Sparring is point-based, the points being awarded for successful hits with the tora or with the foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icsqay.com/ |title=International Council of Sqay|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vaalum-parichayum.jpeg|230px|thumb|Kalaripayat sword-fighting]]
;Kerala
The Keralite art of fighting came into its present form through the [[kalari]], the local variation of the [[gurukula]] educational institution. Historically, the warrior groups of Kerala practiced Kalaripayut. Today there are three branches of [[kalaripayat]]: northern, central and southern. Training progresses from footwork and stances to unarmed techniques, blunt weapons, and finally to edged weapons. The most common weapons today are the staff, stick, sword, shield, spear, dagger and flexible sword.&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1998"/&gt;

;Maharashtra
The Marathas developed their fighting style based on the state's hilly geography. [[Mardani khel]] today teaches armed techniques for use in single combat as well as defense against several opponents. Other weapons include the sword, shield, spear, dagger, kukri, double deer horns, and bow and arrow.&lt;ref name=vajramushti/&gt;

;Manipur
The Manipuri art of ''huyen lalong'' was once practiced by the state's indigenous hill tribes who would engage in duels governed by strict rules of conduct. The armed component called [[thang-ta]] is named after the system's main weapons, the ''thang'' (sword) and ''ta'' (spear). Practitioners spar through ''cheibi gatka'' in which a foam sword is used together with a shield. Unarmed huyen lalong is called ''sarit-sarak'' and is used in conjunction with thang-ta when the fighter loses their weapon.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt;

;Odisha
The Orissan martial art traces back to the ''paika'' class of warriors who were particularly known{{By whom|date=August 2014}} for their use of the ''khanda'' or double-edge straight sword{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. During times of peace, the paika would hone their skills through martial dances, forms-training and various acrobatics{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Their descendants have preserved these exercises in training halls called [[paika akhada]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and demonstrate them mainly through street performances. Their method of sword training called ''pari-khanda'' is still used as the first part of the [[chhau dance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Other weapons include the staff and guantlet-sword.

;Panjab region and Rajasthan
Martial arts in northwest India and adjacent Pakistan were traditionally referred to by several terms but the most common today is ''shastara-vidiya'' or “science of self defense”{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Swordsmen practiced their techniques either in routines using real swords, or freestyle sparring with wooden sticks called [[gatka]], a form of stick-fighting. Gatka is associated with the Sikhs history and an integral part of an array of Sikh Shastar Vidiya. During the colonial period, the term ''gatka'' was extended to mean northwestern martial arts in general{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Some aspects of the art, such as the unarmed techniques or fighting in armour, are today practiced almost exclusively by the [[Nihang]] order of Sikhs{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Gatka incorporates several forms, each with their own set of weapons, strategies and footwork. In the late 18th century, this martial art further developed as a recreational game and Panjab University Lahore codified its rules for playing it as a game.

;Tamil Nadu
The native Tamil martial art has come to be referred to as [[silambam]] after its main weapon, the bamboo staff. Training begins with footwork patterns before progressing to stances and subsequently fighting techniques. Aside from its namesake, silambam includes a variety of weapons such as the sword, twin sticks, double deer horns, whip, sword, shield and sword, dagger, flexible sword and sickle. Unarmed silambam (''kai silambam'') is based on animal movements such as the snake, eagle, tiger and elephant. Other Martial Arts of Tamil Nadu are [[Varma Kalai]], Kalari payattu, Adi Thadi, [[Malyutham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Keeping Silambam spinning |author=Marco Ferrarese |journal=Penang Monthly |date=July 2014 |pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; AND Gusthi (Boxing form of Tamil Nadu, not to be confused with North Indian [[Kushti]] which is a [[Wrestling]] art.)

The '''Kerameikos steles''' are a collection of sculptures used as grave-markers ([[steles]], sing. stele) in the [[Kerameikos]] necropolis of Attica. [[Kerameikos]] is located outside the [[Themistoclean Wall]]'s [[Dipylon Gate]]. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hook|first=LaRue|date=1932|title=On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos|jstor=498389|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=36|issue=3|pages=290–292|doi=10.2307/498389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Lord Smithson|Smithson, E.]] (1968). The Tomb of a Rich Athenian Lady, CA. 850 B.C. ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens,'' ''37''(1), 77-116. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/147539&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many vase paintings of grave scenes wreaths are seen resting at the base of stele. This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.

== History ==
The first steles were dated from the [[Early Bronze Age]], around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the [[Geometric art|Protogeometric period]] c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Blegen, C. (1952). Two Athenian Grave Groups of about 900 B.C. ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens,'' ''21''(4), 279-294. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org.proxy.wm.edu/stable/146860&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The site was first excavated in 1870 by German archaeologists looking for grave-goods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexandridou|first=Alexandra|date=2016|title=Funerary Variability in Late Eighth-Century B.C.E. Attica (Late Geometric II)|jstor=10.3764/aja.120.3.0333|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=120|issue=3|pages=333–360|doi=10.3764/aja.120.3.0333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the fragments and inscriptions found in the present came from the remnants of the [[Themistoclean Walls]], which were built after the [[Persian Wars]], using any and all stone available. Many graves and buildings had been destroyed so they were used as building material.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
[[File:Dexileos.JPG|left|300x300px|thumb|Grave Stele of Dexileos]]
Athenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from.

Some steles at Kerameikos used a style known as [[naiskos]] ("small temple"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the [[Grave Stele of Dexileos]] and the [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]].

== Notable burials and graves ==
After the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, [[Lacedaemonian]] soldiers of [[Pausanias of Sparta|King Pausanias]]' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, L. (1932). On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos. ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' ''36''(3), 290-292. doi:10.2307/498389&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Terracotta lekythos (oil flask) MET 835.jpg|thumb|346x346px|Lekythos vase depicting a woman visiting a stele grave and carrying with an offering for the gods. Note the wreath decoration.]]
The [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]] is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, L.M.W. (1905). ''A History of Ancient Sculpture''. New York: Dodd, Mead, &amp; Co. pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
Today the Kerameikos grave monuments can be found at the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]] where many of them are preserved and kept on display.

The Bushong [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] are responsible for some of the most beautiful and sophisticated [[masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] or dance traditions in Africa. 

==''Ngesh'' and masquerade==
Origin stories for some [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] masking traditions describe how the mask's creators first encountered a ''[[ngesh]]'' in the forest and, after a period of disorientation, returns home to carve a likeness of the ''ngesh''. While ''ngesh'' are rarely represented by figurative sculpture, they are thought to be personified in masquerade figures, which are in turn empowered by these nature spirits. 

The potential for masked performers to become aggressive is a fundamental part of Kuba masquerade,and it is a reflection of the influence of the unpredictable nature of ''ngesh'' on Kuba masked dancers. The association between ngesh and masquerade is also underscored by strict rules that forbid spectators from touching the masks or coming too close to a masked dancer.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mukanda'' initiation rites==
Kuba initiation rites for boys and young men and associated masquerade figures are related to ''mukanda'' initiation rites, practiced by many peoples residing in the southern savanna of [[Central Africa]] from [[Angola]], through the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and into western (london]], including [[Manchester people|Chokwe]], Lwena, [[Luvale]], Lwembe, Chesterfield, [[Mbunda]], [[Mbwela]], [[Yaka people|Yaka]], Suku, [[Pende people|Pende]], and southern [[Lunda people|Lunda]].

There are two forms of initiation that occur in the Kuba region. One form, called ''babande'', is practiced in many Ngeende, [[Ngongo (language)|Ngongo]], Mbeengi, Bokila, [[Shoowa]] and Bushoong villages in the central and northern Kuba region. Babanede initiation rites take place within the village proper, and sometimes within the walled compound of the village chief. By contrast, southern  initiation practices must take place outside the community in a secret forest location.  Southern Kuba initiation rites are called ''buadi'' in Northern Kete villages and ''nkaan'' in Southern Bushoong villages. Both of these words translate to "secret," underscoring the unseen dimension of the rite.

==Royal masquerade==
Initiation rituals at the Kuba capital of Nshern were suspended during the late nineteenth century and were not reinstated. Due in part to the absence of these rituals, discussions of Kuba masking traditions at Nsheng has centered on three masking traditions described as royal- ''Mwaash aMbooy mu shall'', ''Bwoom'' and ''Ngady mwaash''. These are interpreted as representing the king, the commoner and the wife of Mwaash aMbooy respectively.&lt;ref name="Cornet 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Art Royal Kuba|year=1982|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Kuba masks==
There are more than twenty different types of masks that function within the men's initiation society. ''Mwaash aMbooy mu shall'' is one of the three most important and represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba believe themselves to be descended. ''Mwaash aMbooy mu shall'' masks are worn by the nyimi, or king, of the Kuba or by chiefs in villages. The nyimi's mask is usually made of leopard skin, while those of chiefs are made of antelope skin.&lt;ref name="Cornet 1982" /&gt;

One of the principal Kuba dance masks is called ''pwoom itok''. The chief identifying characteristic is the shape of the eyes, whose centers are cones surrounded by holes through which the wearer sees. Like many Kuba types of masks, ''pwoom itok'' is extensively polychromed, or multicolored.&lt;ref name="Brooklyn Museum 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Seigmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639 |author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Look at the Harlequins!''''' is a [[novel]] written by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], first published in 1974. The work was Nabokov's final published novel before his death in 1977.

==Plot summary==
''Look At the Harlequins!'' is a fictional [[autobiography]] narrated by Vadim Vadimovich N. (VV), a Russian-American writer with uncanny biographical likenesses to the novel's author, Vladimir (Vladimirovich) Nabokov.
VV is born in pre-revolutionary [[St. Petersburg]] and raised by his aunt, who advises him to "look at the harlequins" "Play! Invent the world! Invent reality!". After the revolution, VV moves to Western Europe. Count Nikifor Nikodimovich Starov becomes his patron (is he VV's father?). VV meets Iris Black who becomes his first wife. After her death—she is killed by a Russian émigré—he marries Annette (Anna Ivanovna Blagovo), his long-necked typist. They have a daughter, Isabel, and emigrate to the United States. The marriage fails; and, after Annette's death, VV takes care of the pubescent Isabel, now known as Bel. They travel from motel to motel. To counter ugly rumors, VV marries Louise Adamson while Bel elopes with an American to Soviet Russia. After the third marriage fails, VV marries again, a Bel  lookalike (same birthdate, too), referred to as "you", his final love.

VV is an [[unreliable narrator]] who gives conflicting information (e.g., on the death of his father) and seems to suffer from some psychological affliction. When making a full turn while walking—mentally, that is—and tracing his steps back, he is unable to execute the reversion of the surrounding vista in his imagination. He also has the notion that he is a double of another Nabokovian persona.

==Criticism==

===Doppelgänger vs. Parody===
Literary criticism has weighed in on both sides of this debate, some even claiming that Vadim is both a [[parody]] ''and'' a double or [[Doppelgänger]] of Nabokov. For example, Nabokov’s ''Lolita'' is acted out by the narrator of ''Look at the Harlequins!'' through his fondling of the nymphet, Dolly von Borg. The attribution of a string of wives to the narrator may be understood in the context of Nabokov's strictly monogamous life.  After the publication of ''Lolita'' the wider public and many critics thought that its author must be a "sexual daredevil". With the serial polygamy related in ''Look At The Harlequins!'', Nabokov can be seen to be poking fun at these perceptions. V.V.'s final wife is simply addressed as "You", which parallels Nabokov’s addressing his wife, [[Véra Nabokov|Véra]], simply as "you" in his autobiography ''[[Speak, Memory]]''. The fact that the final object of V.V.'s love is a perfect image of V.V.'s daughter, "Bel," parallels the search by Humbert Humbert, the main character of ''Lolita'', for a girl-child just like "Anna''bel''", his first love when he himself was aged 12.

If V.V. is afflicted by feelings of being the double of another Nabokovian persona, this is because he bears in fact significant resemblances to the main character of the novel ''The Real Life of Sebastian Knight'' from 1941.

Herbert Grabes is among the critics who believe that Vadim is Nabokov’s “parodic double” {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (151).  Pekka Tammi agrees: “any fictive [narrator] can be, even at best, only a ‘parody’ of the artist who is responsible for the ultimate fiction” {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (289).  Lucy Maddox calls ''Look at the Harlequins!'' “an oblique, satiric self-portrait” {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (144). In ''Speak, Memory'', Nabokov had written that much of his own life had appeared in his fictional works in the past, and that he felt as though he had lost these memories as they were crystallized into text, abstracted into fictions. His thoughts on the inevitably autobiographical nature of fiction seem to manifest, playfully, here. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Biographical reading of the novel===
One popular explanation for Vadim’s personal and literary similarity to Nabokov is that Vadim is a parody of bungled biographical renderings of the author. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The composition of ''Look at the Harlequins!'' followed on the heels of [[Andrew Field]]’s biography ''Nabokov: His Life in Part'', a biography that eventually resulted in the termination of Nabokov’s relations with Field and in the novelist’s failed attempt at legal suppression of the biography. Nabokov felt that Field had created a character named Vladimir Nabokov in his biography—a character whom the real author could not recognize (Johnson, 330).  Nabokov “had already perfected the role of his own biographer—in a series of mock biographies that began with a game he invented in adolescence, and that continued in his memoir ''[[Speak, Memory]]'' (1966) and his fiction.  The encounter with Field, his first real-life biographer, produced. . .[the] parodic text. . .''Look at the Harlequins!'' (1974). . .” {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (Sweeney 295-6).

The book begins with a list of "Other Books by the Narrator" (that is, Vadim rather than Vladimir Nabokov). Many (if not all) of these titles appear to be doppelgangers of Nabokov’s real novels.

* ''Tamara'' (1925), relates to ''[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]''
* ''Pawn Takes Queen'' (1927), relates to ''[[King, Queen, Knave]]'' combined with ''[[The Defense]]''&lt;ref name="everything2.com"&gt;http://everything2.com/e2node/Look%2520at%2520the%2520Harlequins%2521&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Plenilune'' (1929), relates to ''[[The Defense]]''
* ''Camera Lucida (Slaughter in the Sun)'', relates to ''[[Laughter in the Dark (novel)|Laughter in the Dark]]'' (UK title, "Camera Obscura")
* ''The Red Top Hat'' (1934), relates to ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]''
* ''The Dare'' (1950), relates to ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'' ("Dar", in Russian) and ''[[Glory (novel)|Glory]]''. There is also mention of the protagonist of this novel writing a book similar to that of ''[[Despair (novel)|Despair]]''
* ''See under Real'' (1939), relates to ''[[The Real Life of Sebastian Knight]]'', combined with ''[[Pale Fire]]''&lt;ref name="everything2.com"/&gt;
* ''Esmeralda and Her Parandrus'' (1941)
* ''Dr. Olga Repnin'' (1946), relates to ''[[Pnin]]''
* ''Exile from Mayda'' (1947), a short story collection, relates to ''[[Pale Fire]]'' or ''Spring in Fialta and Other Stories''
* ''A Kingdom by the Sea'' (1962), relates to ''[[Lolita]]''
* ''Ardis'' (1970), relates to ''[[Ada or Ardor]]''

''Look at the Harlequins!'' was heavily influenced by Nabokov's reading of [[Martin Gardner]]'s book ''[[The Ambidextrous Universe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. Barton (1984), "The Ambidextrous Universe of Nabakov's ''Look at the Harlequins!''"; In: Roth, Phyllis (ed.), ''Critical Essays on Vladimir Nabokov''; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. Katherine (1984), "Ambivalence: Symmetry, Asymmetry, and the Physics of Time Reversal in Nabokov's ''Ada''", in the same author's ''The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century'', [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] live in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Uganda]]. In '''Lugbara mythology,''' [[Adroa]] appeared in both good and evil aspects; he was the creator god and appeared on [[Earth]] as a [[man]] who was near death.  He was depicted as a very tall white man with only one half of a body, missing one [[Human eye|eye]], one leg, etc.  His children were called the Adroanzi.

The Adroanzi were nature gods of specific [[river]]s, [[tree]]s and other sacred wild areas.  At night, they followed people and protected them from [[animal]]s and bandits as long as they did not look over their shoulder to ensure that an Adroanzi was following; if the person did so, the Adroanzi killed them. The people they killed, they ate. They were also sometimes known as water snakes. Some Africans consider them gardeners.

==Hero-ancestors==
God created Gborogboro (‘the person coming from the sky’) and a woman named Meme (‘the person who came alone’). Meme bore a boy and girl who in turn produced a male and female pair. The names and number of generations vary according to various myths. Some myths say the [[siblings]] did not have intercourse but women gave birth after goat’s blood was poured on their legs to symbolize [[menstruation]]. Lugbara believe [[Fertilisation|conception]] occurs three to four days after menstruation. However, all versions state that [[bridewealth]] was not given. All this took place at a place called Loloi by Lugbara, somewhere in [[Southern Sudan]].

The last pair of siblings produced the two hero-ancestors, Jaki and Dribidu (‘the hairy one’) who came to the present land of Lugbara and begot many sons (founders of the current clans). Both heroes could perform supernatural and magical feats. Jaki died on Mount Liru while Dribidu died on Mount Eti (Wati) in Terego where he had settled. His other name was Banyale (‘Eater of men’) because he ate his children until he was discovered and driven away from his earlier home in the East bank of the [[Nile]]. He enjoyed the human [[liver]] a lot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2133">'''Maio Creole''' is the name given to the variant of [[Cape Verdean Creole]] spoken mainly in the [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio Island]] of [[Cape Verde]]. It belongs to the [[Sotavento Creoles]] branch. It numbers the entire island population which includes a small part which also speaks Portuguese, in 2005, the percentage was 1.36%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.cv/Temas/Demografia/Reparticaopercentual.asp?Choix=1The population who spoke a variant of the Cape Verdean creole in 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the eight and one of the least spoken Cape Verdean Creole and is after [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and ahead of [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]].

==Characteristics==
Besides the main characteristics of [[Sotavento Creoles]] the Maio Creole has also the following ones:
* The progressive aspect of the present is formed by putting ''stâ'' before the verbs: '''''stâ'' + V'''.
* The unstressed final vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} frequently disappear. Ex.: ''cumádr’'' {{IPA|/kuˈmadɾ/}} instead of ''cumádri'' {{IPA|/kuˈmadɾi/}} “midwife”, ''vilúd’'' {{IPA|/viˈlud/}} instead of ''vilúdu'' {{IPA|/viˈludu/}} “velvet”, ''bunít’'' {{IPA|/buˈnit/}} instead of ''bunítu'' {{IPA|/buˈnitu/}} “beautiful”, ''cantád’'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtad/}} instead of ''cantádu'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtadu/}} “sung”.
* The sound {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (that originates from old Portuguese, written ''j'' in the beginning of words) is partially represented by {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Ex. ''jantâ'' {{IPA|/ʒɐ̃ˈtɐ/}} instead of ''djantâ'' {{IPA|/dʒɐ̃ˈtɐ/}} “to dine”, ''jôg’'' {{IPA|/ʒoɡ/}} instead of ''djôgu'' {{IPA|/ˈdʒoɡu/}} “game”, but in words like ''djâ'' {{IPA|/dʒɐ/}} “already”, ''Djõ'' {{IPA|/dʒõ/}} “John” the sound {{IPA|/dʒ/}} remains.

The '''Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Prize''' for the Arts is awarded by The [[Canada Council]] for the Arts. Two prizes are awarded annually to distinguished individuals. One prize is awarded in the arts, one in the social sciences and humanities. The prizes are $50,000 each, and intended to encourage continuing contribution to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Canada.

==Endowment==
Funded by an endowment from the Molson Foundation, the prizes are administered by the Canada Council for the Arts in cooperation with the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]. Laureates are chosen by a peer assessment committee appointed jointly by the Canada Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

==Eligibility==
Candidates must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. To be nominated, candidates must have made a substantial and distinguished contribution over a significant period of time. In the words of the deed of gift, the prizes are intended "to encourage Canadians of outstanding achievement in the fields of the [[Arts]], the [[Humanities]] or the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] to make further contribution to the cultural or intellectual heritage of Canada". The terms of reference are interpreted as follows:
*outstanding achievement must have already been amply demonstrated
*further contribution implies that the laureates should still be very active and productive. 

In other words, the prize is not intended as an "end of service" reward or as recognition for one great accomplishment. Past assessment committees have been quite consistent in choosing laureates who are close to the top of an outstanding career. Corporations and other organizations are excluded from consideration, as are posthumous awards. No individual may be awarded the prize more than once. The prizes are accessible to qualified persons from Aboriginal Peoples and diverse cultural and regional communities. Members of the board of the Canada Council for the Arts and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council are not eligible to be considered for this prize during the course of their terms as members nor for six months following the end of their term.

==Nomination process==
Candidates may not apply for the Canada Council for the Arts Molson Prizes on their own behalf. They must be nominated by three individuals or three organizations, or a combination of individuals and organizations. Nominations are sought from persons and organizations that have the interest and capacity to nominate appropriate individuals. Nominators may submit one letter signed by the three nominating individuals or organizations, or submit three separate letters of nomination. Nominators are responsible for gathering and providing relevant documentation to the Canada Council.

==Selection procedure==
The two laureates are chosen by a single, multidisciplinary peer assessment committee co-chaired by the Chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts and the President of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Members are chosen to ensure fair representation of gender, the two official languages, the various regions and cultures of Canada, and the various types of artistic and scholarly disciplines. Committee members are among the most accomplished individuals in their respective fields and, ideally, have interests that extend beyond the confines of a single discipline.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Nara, Nara|Nara Prefecture]] in Japan, she moved to [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] and finished high school in 1956. She was admitted to [[Tsuda College]], English Language major, and studied abroad during her senior year to graduate in 1962.&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{cite web | title = KATAKURA Motoko - Researcher - researchmap | url = http://researchmap.jp/read0053177 | access-date = 28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |group=notes|name=newsletter02|Studying in the United States in 1961, Katakura had a chance to talk with an activist for the independence of Algeria which she recalled when she encountered with Islam culture.&lt;ref name=newsletter01&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sabakue...|trans-title=To desert...|language=ja|last=Suita|first=Yasuko|page=3|url=http://moko-f.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/e43227fed9efaaf652bc69ad7b1523191.pdf|journal=News Letter|publisher=Motoko Katakura Foundation for Desert Culture|issue=1|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} She took Master of Letters, in 1968 at the [[Chuo University]] Graduate School,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; and researched at [[Columbia University]] between 1971 and '72 as a Visiting Research Fellow.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

== Islamic world and multicultural studies ==
Katakura's main field of study was focused on the Islamic world including bedouin, and multicultural studies. In late 1960s she visited bedouin camps in [[Saudi Arabia]] for her first field research in Islamic culture, while the Katakuras lived there.
Abdur-Rahim Al Aḥmadī was the best supporter for Katakura's field work in Saudi Arabia since the early stage of her research in late 1960s. He witnessed that Katakura went into the nomad society of [[Wadi]] Fatima (western Saudi Arabia) and lived among those people for a period, and she visited them several times over the years.&lt;ref name=newsletter01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In early 1980s her husband was appointed as the Japanese ambassador to the [[United Arab Emirates]], and Katakura revisited her field of research in the desert of Wadi Fatima (western Saudi Arabia).&lt;/ref&gt; Katakura proceeded on-site research while winning the trust and affection of those people, observing the cultural heritage of their society.
Working as a lecturer at her alma mater Tsuda College between 1973 and '74,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; she obtained PhD. of Geology at Graduate School of [[University of Tokyo]], faculty of Science in 1974.&lt;ref name=education/&gt; Promoted as an associate professor, she continued working at Tsuda College,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; and her hard work and tenacity on research and field work was rewarded when she published the survey results in her first book under the title of "Bedouin Village" in 1977.{{refn|group=notes|name=reviews|"Bedouin village" attracted much reviews.

== Among academic circles ==
With thorough academic papers followed the first book, she proofed that scientific values and her challenges in cultural anthropology was confirmed. Katakura started to extend the basis of her research during and after her tenure as a lecturer at University of Tokyo between 1975 and 1977,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; that Katakura gave lectures at International Christian University for the term of 1975/76 and 1977/78.&lt;ref name=education/&gt; Her teaching career extended at Tsuda College in 1978 to 1981. At the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Ethnographic Museum]] in [[Osaka]] she researched the Islamic world and multicultural studies including bedouin and desert culture in 1981 to 1993 at National Museum of Ethnology as a professor,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; where she became a professor emeritus in later years.

For multiculture studies, she actively researched abroad on many offers such as a Visiting Professor at [[University of British Columbia]] (1985 - 1986), a Visiting Research Fellow at Research Center for Arabian Literature (1987 - 1988).&lt;ref name=education/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ibunka kankyo ni okeru musurimu  ― Kanada ni okeru arabu musurimu shakai no keisei|trans-title=Muslims in a Non-Islamic Environment ―With Focus on Arab Musulims in Canada|last=Katakura|first=Motoko|journal=Research report|number=12|location=Osaka|pages=681–726|issn=0385-180X|publisher=National Museum of Ethnology, Japan|url=https://minpaku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&amp;item_id=4350&amp;item_no=1&amp;attribute_id=18&amp;file_no=1|date=15 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming back to Japan, she was a professor at the [[Graduate University for Advanced Studies]] (1989 - 1993).&lt;ref name=education/&gt;&lt;ref name=vancou&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ibunka kankyo no arabu musurimu ― Bankuba no ejiputojin musurimu no jireikenkyu|trans-title=Muslims in a Non-Islamic Environment ―A Case Study of Egyptian Community in Vancouver, Canada|last=Katakura|first=Motoko|journal=Research report|number=14|location=Osaka|pages=821–889|issn=0385-180X|publisher=National Museum of Ethnology, Japan|url=https://minpaku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&amp;item_id=4301&amp;item_no=1&amp;attribute_id=18&amp;file_no=1|date=19 March 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunio Katakura was appointed the Ambassador to Iraq and spent years over there during the early part of [[Gulf War]]. In Japan, in May 1990, the Japanese Association of Arid Land Studies was founded with Katakura as the first vice director.{{refn|group=notes|name=aridland|Since 2014, the Motoko Katakura Foundation for Desert Culture has been presenting an annual prize "Katakura Motoko Prize" at the Japanese Association of Arid Land Studies, in honor of Motoko Katakura with a silver medal. The first prize was presented to two scholars of desert research and studies from [[Tottori University]].&lt;ref name=JASLS&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://moko-f.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/e43227fed9efaaf652bc69ad7b1523191.pdf|title=Sono hoka no hokoku|trans-title=Other reports|language=ja|journal=News Letter|page=8|publisher=Motoko Katakura Foundation for Desert Culture|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
It was in 1993 when Katakura professed at [[Chuo University]] at the Faculty of Policy Studies which started the same year,&lt;ref name=researchmap01&gt;{{cite web|title=KATAKURA Motoko|url=http://researchmap.jp/read0053177/?lang=english|date=1 February 2011|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; before she was nominated and became the director of the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]] in May 2005. The director of that Center had been succeeded from [[Takeshi Umehara]] to [[Hayao Kawai]] and Tetsuo Yamaori, all who were past professors at the Center, and Katakura filled her post as the first woman  director without former tenure with them. Following her retirement in 2008, she became a professor emeritus at the Center.

== Episodes ==
She was married to Kunio Katakura&lt;ref&gt;Kunio Katakura later took on Professor of International Relations at [[Daito Bunka University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and lived overseas as a wife of a diplomat.&lt;ref name=newsletter01/&gt; In the United States of America, they made acquaintance with [[Hisashi Owada]] who was also a diplomat, and she recalled many times that she and her husband met his daughter Masako, the future [[Masako, Crown Princess of Japan|Crown Princess of Japan]] during those years. During the early part of the Gulf War, she was on her research in Japan, while her husband was appointed in Iraq.

Katakura applied hiragana transcription when she got married and changed her family name to Katakura. A fortune teller advised Katakura that there were no problem to apply kanji to both her first and maiden name, or Motoko Shintani. However, the combination of both her first name and married name in kanji did not show good omen. Based on that advice, she transcribed her first name in kana rather than in kanji. On the first day at the National Museum of Ethnology as a professor, it was not quite comfortable for her to find her name inscribed in kanji only on the nameplate to her office, as she confessed in her essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sabaku e nobiyakani|last=Katakura|first=Motoko|publisher=Chikuma shobo|isbn=9784480853905|oclc=672666966|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Musevisa''''' (''The Mouse Song'') is a Norwegian [[Christmas music|Christmas song]] by singer-songwriter [[Alf Prøysen]] from 1946. Prøysen wrote the lyrics for the song in 1946, to a traditional tune.&lt;ref name="lyrics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/NonEnglish/musevisa.htm|title=Musevisa|publisher=The Hymns and Carols of Christmas|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musevisa'' is a secular song, where a family of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[mouse|mice]] are preparing for Christmas. The mouse-mother specifically warns her children against the dangers of the [[mousetrap]].&lt;ref name="lyrics"/&gt; In December 2008 the alleged rediscovery of a missing verse from the song attracted the attention of the Norwegian media. Though an alternative ending was originally written for the song, the discovery in question was eventually revealed to be a hoax.

==Creation==

In the late autumn of 1946, Prøysen (1914–1970), who had just left his job as a farm hand, received a commission from the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) to write a Christmas song for children. Before presenting the song to the network, he met with his friend [[Arnljot Høyland]] near the [[Oslo]] railway station [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon|Vestbanen]], to get his opinion on the song he had written. Prøysen said he was worried about the happy and sympathetic [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of the song, since the subject was mice, considered a [[Pest (organism)|pest]]. For this reason he had written an alternative ending to the lyrics. Høyland told him not to worry, correctly predicting that this would not be an issue. Prøysen presented the song in its original form, it was accepted and became an instant classic. Høyland never heard the alternative ending.&lt;ref name="Røsbak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/article2812093.ece|title=Bare tull om "Musevisa"|last=Røsbak|first=Ove|date=2008-12-10|publisher=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery of missing verse==
[[File:Alf Prøysen.jpg|thumb|upright|Alf Prøysen c. 1949. It was assumed that the poet, had he been alive, would have appreciated the hoax.]]
In December 2008, NRK-presenter [[Vidar Lønn-Arnesen]] claimed to have found the missing verse. In Lønn-Arnesen's version, it was children's program host "Onkel" [[Lauritz Johnson]] who had objected to the original verse, and asked Prøysen to write a new one. In the original version the mice were eaten by a cat, which Johnson found too disturbing for children's radio. The original verse had been thrown away, but a cleaning maid had picked it up. The woman had kept the piece of paper, but fifty years later{{spaced ndash}}now living in [[Thailand]]{{spaced ndash}}she sent it back to NRK. Then, in 2008, Lønn-Arnesen was editing a Christmas songbook, and decided to include the original verse and the story behind it.&lt;ref name="Bruheim"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6333849|title=Ukjent vers på Musevisa|last=Bruheim|first=Magnhild|date=2008-12-02|publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story attracted widespread attention in Norwegian newspapers, but not everybody was ready to accept it. [[Ove Røsbak]], who had written a biography on Prøysen, had interviewed Høyland and others, and debunked Lønn-Arnesen's story as false. The song in its present version was in fact the original, according to Røsbak, and if another version existed this had to be a discarded early draft. Pointing out the poor literary quality as the reason why the extra verse had been abandoned, he still conceded that the verse was written by Prøysen: "There is no doubt about that, but there's a reason why it ended up in the dustbin."&lt;ref name="Rogn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6338955|title=Strid om musevisa|last=Rogn|first=Hallgrim|date=2008-12-04|publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Røsbak also took issue with the late Johnson being presented as a prude who censored controversial content.&lt;ref name="Røsbak"/&gt; Lønn-Arnesen stuck to his version of the events, but insisted that he had never intended any disrespect to Johnson, who had been his colleague.&lt;ref name="Kleve"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2008/12/08/kultur/alf_proysen/jul/3972968/|title= - Prøysen var ingen musedrapsmann |last=Kleve|first=Marie L.|author2=Pål Stokka|date=2008-12-08|publisher=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoax revealed==
[[File:Ivar Kalleberg.jpg|thumb|Ivar Kalleberg]]
On 23 December 2008, former NRK-photographer Ivar Kalleberg revealed that it was in fact he who had written the missing verse, as a hoax. Kalleberg had used an old yellowed piece of paper, and copied Prøysen's handwriting from a letter he had once received from him. He then asked his neighbor if she would compose a letter, posing as the fictional retired cleaning lady. Kalleberg claimed to have used the [[Hitler Diaries]] as an inspiration for the hoax.&lt;ref name="Thorkildsen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2008/12/23/kultur/musikk/musevisa/4137788/|title= "Musevisa"-verset var bare bløff |last=Thorkildsen|first=Joakim|date=2008-12-23|publisher=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; To back up his claim, Kalleberg referred to an autobiography he had written in 2003, where he had reproduced the verse from memory, almost verbatim.&lt;ref name="Røiseland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6374436|title=- Jeg skrev Museviseverset|last=Røiseland|first=Hilde|date=2008-12-23|publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Røsbak appreciated Kalleberg's hoax, though he commented that the episode did raise some issues about source criticism in the Norwegian publishing business.&lt;ref name="Næsheim"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6374695|title=- En storartet bløff!|last=Næsheim|first=Anne|date=2008-12-23|publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lønn-Arnesen admitted that, although he didn't believe Kalleberg's story,&lt;ref name="oppspinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=555689|title=- Det niende Musevisa-verset er oppspinn|date=2008-12-23|publisher=[[Verdens Gang]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; if he had indeed been the victim of a practical joke, it was a good one.&lt;ref name="Thorkildsen"/&gt; Kalleberg, meanwhile, was convinced that Prøysen would have appreciated the hoax had he been alive. The poet was once, in the 1950s, informed about an impostor who performed under his name. He reacted with a shrug and replied "Perhaps he sings better than I do."&lt;ref name="Thorkildsen"/&gt;

==Swedish version==
There is a Swedish version of the song - without the false verse - called "Mössens julafton" ("Christmas Eve for the Mice") written by Prøysen's long time co-operative partner, the popular Swedish composer and songwriter [[Ulf Peder Olrog]]. In Sweden, Olrog usually is known as the composer of the song's melody.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30332">[[File:Фонтан Рошен 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Roshen]] Musical Fountain in the [[Ukraine]]]]

A '''musical fountain''', also known as a '''dancing fountain''', is a type of [[animate]]d [[fountain]] for [[entertainment]] purposes that creates an [[aesthetic]] design (including [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images). This is achieved by employing the effects of timed [[sound waves]] and timed light (including [[laser]]) against water particles. The water [[refract]]s and [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]]s the light, and in doing so, three-dimensional images can be produced.

Installations can be large scale, employing hundreds of water jets and lights, and costing into the [[million]]s of [[dollar]]s, or in smaller household forms, where a budget of one [[thousand]] dollars is feasible. Musical features tend to be complex, and require a degree of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and electronic components out of view that might be as impressive to its audience as the show itself.

==Fountains that are choreographed to music==
The earliest musical fountains were played manually by a live operator, who usually controlled pumps or valves and sometimes lights by way of switches on a control panel. Music was almost always live. Later, [[choreography]] could be prerecorded on a punched paper card which was scanned by a computer; and even later, it could be recorded on magnetic tape or, in the most modern shows, on a CD along with the music. Even so, the choreography is still usually painstakingly programmed by hand, some types of shows being played live from a control console and connected to a computer that records the operator's actions for later automatic playback. Recent advances in technology provides for [[Musical fountain#Fully automated musical fountains|unattended automatic choreography]] that can rival manual programming.

==The earliest choreographed musical fountains==

===The Bodor Fountain===
[[Péter Bodor]] was a Hungarian [[gadgeteer]] and [[mechanical engineer]] (born on June 22, 1788, died August 17, 1849) who built a musical or chiming fountain in the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Târgu Mureş|Marosvásárhely]] (now [[Târgu Mureş]], [[Romania]]) between 1820 and 1822.

His fountain (see pictures [http://www.erdelyweb.hu/mvhely/bodor.htm here]) had a round floor-plan, with two arched stairs on the sides, and a dome roof supported by pillars. The mechanical core was a [[hydraulic]] structure driven by the force of water that played popular chimes at every hour. There was a gilded Neptune (or Apollo) statue on the top, that turned round in 24 hours. The fountain was destroyed in 1836 by a [[snow storm]], and was never restored. However, an almost identical copy was built in [[Budapest]]'s [[Margit Island]] in 1936 that did not operate by hydraulic means, but used electricity instead. This latter was partly destroyed during the [[Second World War]], but was restored in 1954 and again in 1997. Now it is a tourist attraction that plays music at every hour during the day.

===Křižík's light fountain===
[[Image:Križikovi vodoskoci 2.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Výstaviště Praha#Křižík's light fountain|Křižík's light fountain]]]]
[[Výstaviště Praha#Křižík's light fountain|Křižík's light fountain]] was built by the [[Czech people|Czech]] inventor and electrical engineer [[František Křižík]] in 1891 on the occasion of the World Exhibition in [[Prague]]. It became a unique European attraction. The fountain was rebuilt in the 1920s by architect Z. Stašek. The bottom of the fountain plate is equipped with 1300 multicolored reflectors and water circuits composed of more than two kilometers of pipes with almost 3000 nozzles. In June 2018, the fountain has interrupted its operation.

===The work of F.W. Darlington===
'''Prismatic Fountain''', [[Denver, Colorado]] - May 30, 1908
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mayor Robert W. Speer and F.W. Darlington, an engineer with the Denver Interurban Railway, dedicate the new marvel in City Park Lake--The Prismatic Electric Fountain.  The Fountain features electric lighting effects that have not been seen before by the public.  Eleven columns of brightly coloured light stream through the dramatic changing patterns of water.  High in the north tower of the City Park Pavilion, an operator sits at a roll top desk, moving levers to undulate the twelve sets of water features and make the columns of light change color to the sounds of the Denver Municipal Band."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
::Denver Municipal Facts--May 22, 1909

F.W. Darlington was a pioneer in electrical fountain control as well as water design. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Darlington had several signature water feature elements in his fountain designs.  The multiple spray rings with "[[basket-weave]]" [[nozzle]] placement is one that shows up in photographs of several fountains, including some not yet credited to Darlington.  The "fan" effect, a complicated triple spray ring with multiple nozzle sizes and angles is yet another water effect seen in several "Electric Fountains." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
::(from "Friends of the Electric Fountain" -early pictures available)

'''Prismatic Fountain''', [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] - 1915

The Darlington fountain in New Orleans' [[West End, New Orleans|West End]] and was likely completed around 1915 or 1916 as the last date on the original drawings are from February 1915. The fountain served as an icon for the West End Park and surrounding yacht clubs and numerous restaurants that were located in the area.

All of Darlington’s fountains required an operator to change the water effects and lighting and were likely used in conjunction with music played by a band or orchestra for special events. It is unknown if the fountain was operated in a static mode when there were no performances or if it was shut off.

Restoration of this fountain is planned by the Friends of West End in New Orleans.

'''[[Garfield Park (Indianapolis)#Conservatory and Sunken Gardens|Garfield Park]]''', [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] - 1916

In 1915, the new [[greenhouse]]s and conservatory were built. The dedication of the Sunken Garden took place October 29, 1916.  In 1916, Darlington was hired to design and build the fountains at the east end of the Sunken Garden. The fountains were the first in the country to be equipped with the mechanics that allowed the changing of the spray and displayed lights, according to the season and holiday. For [[Memorial Day]], the fountain's lights were alight with red, white, and blue, and on other days, gold and white. Today, the fountains are still an attraction for visitors.  This fountain was restored by The Fountain People in 1997 and with a musical control system by Atlantic Fountains in 2003.

'''Pool of Industry, [[1939 New York World's Fair]]'''

An early notable example of a musical fountain choreographed live was the Pool of Industry at the 1939 New York World Fair, where three operators controlled the fountain, guided by a paper program that unscrolled under a glass window like the paper roll of a [[player piano]] - rather than controlling the effects directly like a piano roll, it was marked with commands that told the operators when to push the buttons and throw the switches. This fountain was more than just water and lights, however.  Besides 3 million [[watt]]s of lights and a gigantic pool containing 1,400 water nozzles, there were over 400 [[gas]] jets with a mechanism that caused colored flames and [[fireworks]] were shot from over 350 launchers, creating a nighttime spectacle on a grand scale. Music was played live by the fair's band and broadcast by large speakers to the areas surrounding the display. The updated show displayed at the same fairgrounds in 1964 lacked the colored flames but used punched cards for the choreography, had prerecorded music, and utilized the then-revolutionary system of [[dichroic]] light filtering (developed by Bausch and Lomb for the fountain) which now allowed a dark colored lens and a light colored lens to produce the same brightness of light. It was by this process that 700,000 watts of light produced over 3 [[megacandela]]s. This show also had single lights with multiple sliding color filters for mixing colors, and arrays of nozzles that could be adjusted, their direction changed by hydraulic or [[pneumatic]] actuators.

==Later water fountains==
The Dancing Waters style of water show is a linear display of pumps and lights. In the United States, similar fountains are the Musical Waters. Musical Waters shows use the basic Dancing Waters mechanics. The fountains use single-speed pumps and do not offer variable water heights, and the revolving nozzles are not present since the Dancing Waters design having been prone to jamming. Despite lacking the rotating nozzles that usually define this type of show, the Musical Waters shows are one of the few of this kind that still retain most of the simple elegance that defined Otto Przystawik's first fountains, including the visual attraction of the human element with live "fountaineers" controlling the effects.  Otto Przystawik water shows went well beyond previous musical fountains.  While previous fountain merely change scenes during a performance, Przystawik introduced moving water that that created the first true Dancing Fountains.

[[Image:Bellagio Fountains01.JPEG|thumb|Dancing fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas]]
Other United States based companies such as Waltzing Waters Inc, owned by Przystawik's family, [[WET (Water Entertainment Technologies)|WET]] (Water Entertainment Technologies), Fontana Fountains, Atlantic Fountains, Fountain People, Formosa Fountains, Hall Fountains, and Waterworks International have built fully computer controlled musical fountains since 1980.  These include two to six meter wide systems available to the homeowner as well as large corporate, municipal and show fountains in excess of fifty meters in length—and in the case of WET's [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)#Fountains of Bellagio|Fountains of Bellagio]], {{convert|9|acre|abbr=on}} in size. These include proportional, interactive and audio spectral control that bring musical fountains to a wide audience. Fountain shapes are not limited to linear layout stage shows but include geometric and freeform shapes as well. Moreover, latest technology allows the construction of Floating watershows. Fontana Fountains first introduced the use of Stainless Steel floaters allowing bigger water show applications even in coasts and lakes.

Manufacturers in the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Far East]], in places such as [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], also produce musical fountains. Many of them have updated the look with individually [[servomotor]]-controlled nozzles, large water screens on which video can be projected, and laser effects. Shows are built not only in the standard linear form, but in circular, semicircular and oblong shapes, in multiple pools, and many other layouts. In many places in India, a musical fountain is a must-have attraction for any city, and there will often be at least one local company ready to build them. Firms also rent shows.

===International Fountain===
{{main|International Fountain}}
[[Image:International Fountain (2890741537).jpg|thumb|International Fountain in Seattle, Washington]]
Built for the [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle]] in 1962, the International Fountain's original design had changing water and light patterns, with a background of classical music (though the patterns weren't specifically intended to be synched with the music.) The fountain was very large, designed as a concrete bowl around a 'moonscape' of broken limestone, at the center of which was a tiled dome studded with pointy black nozzles. The fountain was not originally designed for interaction but was redesigned in 1995 by [[WET (Water Entertainment Technologies)|WET]] to make the fountain more inviting, interactive and safe. Switching out the multicolored lights for white, WET added fog nozzles, a ring of their Shooters set into the pavers around the base of the dome, and four large SuperShooters hidden in the upper surface of the dome. The restored fountains behaves as its predecessor did for most of the day, producing changing water patterns as music plays, but it now marks each hour by bringing out other effects, like fog, and performs a choreographed show.

===CESC Fountain of Joy, Kolkata===

India’s most spectacular musical fountain – the [[CESC]] Fountain of Joy – was  inaugurated in Kolkata, India on 16 October 2012.  
[[File:CESC Fountain of Joy.ogv|thumb|CESC Fountain of Joy]]

According to Sanjiv Goenka, Chairman, RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, “The CESC Fountain of Joy is a small gift from the Power Company which has been serving consumers in this area since 1899.”  Goenka recalled, “During the Calcutta-300 Celebrations, Mr. R P Goenka, Chairman, CESC, decided to gift a musical fountain  to the city which was inaugurated in the Maidan in 1991.  He added " The new fountain will once again be a major attraction and rejuvenate the evenings for both Kolkatans and tourists. The CESC Fountain of Joy which was inaugurated at the same site just before the Durga Pujas, is far more spectacular both in terms of technology and visual effect.”&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-06/kolkata/34293218_1_fountain-intermediate-pool-water-effects|title=Fountain of Joy to spring back to life|date=October 6, 2012|work=[[The Times Of India]]|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fountain of Joy - CESC.jpg|thumb|Fountain of Joy - Powered by CESC]]
[[File:Fountain kolkata.jpg|thumb|CESC Fountain of Joy Kolkata]]
This musical fountain is unique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yahoo|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/fountain-comeback-puja-223116104.html|title=Fountain comeback by Puja|date=October 6, 2012|work=[[Yahoo News]]|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has 150 channels available for water and light effects – old fountain had 20 channels for water.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  The concept of three-tier fountain pool, with musical fountain in the upper pool surrounded by architectural and dynamic fountains in the intermediate and lower pools, is quite unique in this subcontinent.

The CESC Fountain of Joy has a centre-fed circular water screen of 6 metre height and 18 metre width.  In the upper pool, the CESC Fountain of Joy will have 99 water effects, while the intermediate pool will have 20 water effects and another 30 special water effects in the lower pool.  There will be a large water cascading area – more than 80 metre long from upper pool to the intermediate pool.

The CESC Fountain of Joy comes with an enormous number of lights as also LED and PAR lamps, as also high watt reflectors, capable of constantly changing the colours to make the fountain attractive and eye-catching.

According to CESC sources, the Fountain of Joy is integrated with ultra-fast technology, in which water effects will be controlled by the pneumatically assisted solenoid valves, capable of opening and shutting 12 times in a second, thereby resulting in water shooting in air at a spectacular speed.

According to Mr. Sanjiv Goenka, “The inspiration for creating the new CESC Fountain of Joy in the Maidan comes from Chief Minister, Smt Mamata Banerjee, who is so keen to turn Kolkata into a beautiful megapolis.”

The estimated cost is around Rs. 3 crore.

===Fountains of Bellagio Hotel===
[[File:Bellagio casino fountain feature (medium quality).ogv|thumb|Bellagio musical fountain|left]]
[[WET (Water Entertainment Technologies)]] also designed the Fountains of [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] in Las Vegas, which are set in a man-made lake {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long with an area of {{convert|9|acre|abbr=on}}. The fountain is formed as a pair of large concentric rings and a long, curved arc, and two smaller circles are attached to the arc near each end. Shooters outline all aspects of the layout, allowing for the arc and circles to rise as columns and curtains of water, as well as providing high-speed chase sequences. Re-engineered HyperShooters fire jets nearly {{convert|240|ft|m}} into the air, and more recently added ExtremeShooters are capable of reaching heights of {{convert|500|ft|m}}. Needing a better way to define smoother passages of music, WET engineers developed the Oarsman nozzle, a robotic water jet that can be moved 120 degrees from side to side, to front and back, grouped with a pod of lights that follow the water stream. With the direction, water height, and light of every Oarsman controllable independently from every other Oarsman, a nearly infinite variety of patterns can be created on the lake. A fog generating device rises from beneath the water to blanket the entire lake with fog, and about 4000 individually controllable underwater lights follow the water patterns' precise movements, sparkling on the water or glowing through the fog. Performing to everything from opera to classical to Broadway to pop, the Fountains of Bellagio run every day on the half-hour, and every quarter-hour during the evening. A team of dive-certified engineers is on-site at all times, maintaining the fountain's complex mechanical, electrical and hydraulic systems.

Despite the scale of such shows as the Fountains of Bellagio, these shows must still be programmed and choreographed by hand. Computers aid the process, but engineers must still spend weeks or months on each new performance before it is ready to be placed in rotation with the other shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Branson Landing ===
Branson Landing located in [[Branson, Missouri]] features a picturesque [[boardwalk]] along the Taneycomo Lakefront. The Landing's center attraction is the Town Square, which is home to a $7.5 million choreographed water attraction designed by [[WET (Water Entertainment Technologies)|WET]]. The fountains at Branson Landing include dancing and blasting water shooters, blasting water up to {{convert|125|ft|m}} in the air, fire, light and music.

===Grand Haven===
{{main|Grand Haven Musical Fountain}}
One other notable fountain of the choreographed type is the [[Grand Haven Musical Fountain]] in [[Grand Haven, Michigan]]. Built in 1962 by volunteers and designed by a local engineer, this fountain was based on a Przystawic show seen in Germany and was the largest musical fountain in the world when it was built. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the [[Peacock]], and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the back curtain and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the back curtain, and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called "sweeps" provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side. A patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used punched paper cards, though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared-for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. Even with the simplest of the many programs used to create shows for this fountain, choreographing one three-minute song can take anywhere from two to four hours. The Grand Haven Musical Fountain still performs nightly, and is viewable from a grandstand on the waterfront in Grand Haven.

===Kangwon Land Multimedia Fountain===
{{main|Kangwon_Land}}
[[File:Multimedia Fountain Kangwon Land Resort.jpg|thumb|Multimedia Fountain [[Kangwon Land]] Resort]]
Multimedia Fountain [[Kangwon Land]] was opened in August 2007. It is considered Asia’s largest musical fountain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesouthkoreatravelguide.com/gangwon-do/gohan/high-one-resort_attraction-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; Multimedia system consists of 180&amp;nbsp;m water fountains, water screen, video, light, 12 multi-coloured fire units, and laser. The Magical Box multimedia show consists of the big cube system and the fountain. In combination with the fountain during daylight hours the box appears mirrored, but at night it is illuminated to reveal its interior. At night a globe can be seen, some 20 meters in diameter. The special lighting effects give the impression that the globe is rotating and displays the five continents of the world.

Inside the globe is the "Dome Cinema". The "Dome Cinema" has a diameter of 18 meters and is used as the projection area. Video images from TV, DVD, or VHS sources are projected directly into the dome. These images fill almost two thirds of the space. As a result of the various depths of the room, a new laser video system is used to ensure that the images are not distorted. Outside the "Miracle World Box" is the largest fully automatic screen (24 m x 24 m) in the world! Lighting effects, laser projections and synchronized choreographies ensure a unique and unforgettable experience. All of the technology used in and around the "Miracle World Box" was designed, developed and installed by [[Emotion Media Factory]].

It is 275&amp;nbsp;m (902&amp;nbsp;ft) long and shoots water 150&amp;nbsp;m (490&amp;nbsp;ft) into the air (equivalent to a 50-story building), accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and world music. It was built at a cost of 218 million Dollars. The fountain was formally opened by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on May 8, 2009, along with the Dubai Mall. Situated in front of the [[Burj Khalifa]], it is best viewed by the public from the Souk al Bahar or [[The Dubai Mall]].

===Disney's World of Color===
{{main|World of Color}}

World of Color is a new nighttime show at [[Disney California Adventure Park]], part of the [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[Anaheim, California]].  The entire show cost $75,000,000 USD to design, manufacture and build. The process of assembling, installing, and testing the show's numerous components and equipment in Paradise Bay spanned a period of approximately 15 months. It premiered on Friday June 11, 2010 as part of "[[Summer Nightastic!]]". Conceived by VP Parades and Spectaculars, Steve Davison and designed by [[Walt Disney Creative Entertainment]], the show has more than 1,200 fountains and includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.

===Disney Dreams!===
{{main|Disney Dreams!}}
Disney Dreams! is the new show at Disneyland Paris, based on Peter Pan's shadow story. It includes HD projections onto the castle, with pyrotechnics, synchronized fireworks ; water screens and fountains were provided by the French company Aquatique Show International.
The project took 18 months to be entirely built, including tests and changes, and cost €10,000,000 (~$13,000,000). It has been a daily show since April 2012, and modifications were added for the first anniversary: two new scenes from The Lion King and Brave. From November 10, 2013 to January 6, 2014 a new show remplaces it: Disney Dreams! of Christmas.

===Opryland Hotel Delta Fountain===

Located indoors in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] under a glass dome at the [[Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center]], this musical fountain features an 85-foot high center geyser surrounded by 68 vertical and 28 arching jets, each with its own [[RGB]] [[LED]] fixture, plus a fog system and 5 articulating color theatrical lights from above. The sophisticated system was designed by water feature specialists Aquatic Creations, Inc., and plays original music shows choreographed by H2Oarts.com, both of [[California]]. The Delta fountain is on a deck rather than in a basin, so it is possible to experience close enough to get lightly misted.

===Blackpool Pleasure beach fountains===

The Blackpool fountains, created by French company Aquatique Show International, are located at a well known theme park Blackpool Pleasure beach UK. The fountains dance every 30 minutes to a wide range of music. They opened in 2009 letting people run through them. In 2010 they stopped peopled going in them due to health and safety so now they have security guards when the show is on round the fountain. The fountain has 25 jets which can shoot up to 100&amp;nbsp;ft.

===Multimedia fountain Roshen===
{{main|Vinnytsia Fountain Roshen}}
[[File:Inventions_Show_Multimedia_Fountain_Roshen.jpg|thumb|[[Vinnytsia Fountain Roshen|Multimedia Fountain Roshen]], [[Vinnytsia]], [[Ukraine]]]]
[[Vinnytsia Fountain Roshen|Multimedia fountain Roshen]] is located in [[Vinnytsia]], a city in west-central [[Ukraine]], located on the banks of the [[Southern Bug|Southern Buh]]. Built in 2011 it is considered as one of the largest floating fountains in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roshen Fountain in Vinnitsa was opened! :: Confectionery Corporation ROSHEN|url = http://roshen.com/en/news/corporate-news/fontan-roshen-v-vinnice-772-772-772/|website = roshen.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150710232509/http://roshen.com/en/news/corporate-news/fontan-roshen-v-vinnice-772-772-772|archivedate = 2015-07-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the major multimedia attraction in the city.

The multimedia shows are combining water effects (fountain), music, lasers and 3D projection on the water screen. For the fountain shows the super powerful LED lights are used allowing applying very bright and showy backlighting resulting in various picturesque effects. Despite other fountains in Ukraine, Roshen multimedia fountain has moving particles reaching verticity due to which the water spring angle is changing dynamically. The sound power of the audio system is 3840 Watt. The height of the central spring reaches 65–70 metres, the projection screen dimension is around 16 metres height and 45 metres width, and the frontal water dispersion constitutes 140 metres. The project design and development was performed by [[Emotion Media Factory]].

===Aquanura at the Efteling ===
{{main|Aquanura}}
Opened in May 2012, Aquanura boasts being the largest water fountain show in Europa and the third largest in the world. It was built on a lagoon near the main entrance of the [[Efteling]], one of Europe's oldest and largest theme parks. Aquanura means "water frogs" and tells the story of [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in a spectacle of water, music, lights and fire. The water fountain was designed and built by [[WET (Water Entertainment Technologies)|WET]] and features over 200 brightly colored fountains that come to live in a 12-minute-show each day. The show premiered for the 60th anniversary of the theme park and can be seen daily. It is included in the entrance price to the Efteling, however during the summer, separate tickets are sold just to be able to see Aquanura.

Before Aquanura opened, the Efteling had an indoor musical fountain ('waterorgan'). It used to be  hand-operated, with pedals and levers, but was later automated. When it opened in 1966, it had live music, but as of 1979, a recording was used. The waterorgan was put out of operation in August 2010, its venue being reused as a studio for a children's television program. It is not clear whether the installation has only been covered up temporarily, or if it has been permanently removed.

==Fully automated musical fountains==
[[File:Miracle Mile Shops Automated Musical Fountain - July 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Miracle Mile Automated Musical Fountain, Las Vegas]]

While all pre-programmed musical fountain shows involve computerized [[show control]] systems, the use of computer technology to spontaneously "self-choreograph" a fountain to random musical input is novel. Possibly the most sophisticated full-scale implementations in use are at the [[Miracle Mile Shops]] in Las Vegas, [[Washington Park (Cincinnati, Ohio)]], and [[Washington Harbour]] in the District of Columbia, using a system developed by H2Oarts.com. Unlike conventional musical fountains, which must be manually pre-programmed moment-to-moment, the H2Oarts' Musical Water Feature Automation System uses the venue's own live background music to animate the water and lights in real time. Beyond basic [[light organ]]-style responses to [[loudness]], [[Bass (sound)|bass]], and [[Treble (sound)|treble]], H2Oarts employs [[rhythm]], [[dynamic range]], [[transient (acoustics)]], and other subtler components of music to control water and light.

A '''pillbox hat''' is a small hat, usually worn by women, with a flat crown, straight, upright sides, and no brim.  It is named after the small cylindrical or hexagonal cases that pills used to be sold in.&lt;ref name=fashion&gt;[http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Pillbox-Hats.html "Pillbox Hats"] on ''The Fashion Encyclopedia'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
Historically, the precursor to the pillbox hat was military [[headgear]]. During the late [[Roman Empire]], the ''pileus pannonicus'' or "Pannonian cap" &amp;ndash; headgear similar to the modern pillbox hat &amp;ndash; was worn by Roman soldiers. A similar hat was popular with the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In some countries, especially those of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a pillbox-like [[forage cap]], often with a chin strap, can still be seen on ceremonial occasions. The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] [[dress uniform]] includes such a hat, and similar caps were standard issue for the [[Victorian era]] [[British Army]].  Another cap called a [[Balmoral bonnet|kilmarnock]] is a modern version of the traditional headdress worn by members of virtually all [[Gurkha]] regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson History &amp; Research Center, [http://www.militaryheadgear.com/types/599/items/3 ''10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles Pillbox Cap'']. Retrieved 2010-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern woman's pillbox hat was invented by [[millinery|milliners]] in the 1930s, and gained popularity due to its elegant simplicity.  Pillbox hats were made out of [[wool]], [[velvet]], [[organdy]], [[mink fur|mink]], [[lynx]] or [[fox fur|fox]] [[fur]], and [[leopard skin]], among many other materials.  They were generally designed in solid colors and were unaccessorized, but could include a [[veil]].&lt;ref name=fashion /&gt;

[[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1961 to 1963, was well known for her "signature pillbox hats", designed for her by [[Halston]], and was wearing a pink one to match her [[Pink Chanel suit of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy|outfit]] on the day of her husband President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Spurlin, William J. 'I'd Rather Be the Princess Than the Queen' in Kear, Adrian and Steinberg, Deborah Lynn (eds.) ''Mourning Diana: Nation, Culture and the Performance of Grief''. London: Routledge, 1999. p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Pillbox hats are a satirical subject of the song "[[Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat]]" by [[Bob Dylan]]. The song first appeared on his 1966 album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''. Actress [[Natalie Portman]] wore the pillbox hat in the film ''[[Jackie (2016 film)|Jackie]]'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/12/04/jackie-natalie-portman-pink-suit/94958238/ |title=Natalie Portman on the 'symbolic' power of Jackie Kennedy's pink suit |first=Patrick |last=Ryan |date=4 December 2016 |access-date=9 September 2018 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reductress''''' is an American feminist [[satire]] website that parodies articles found in media targeted towards women, especially [[List of women's magazines|women's magazines]]. Founded in 2013 by [[comedian]]s Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo, the site has received praise from reviewers for its satirical pieces including [[advice column]]s, news stories, and [[listicle]]s.

==History==
Beth Newell began taking classes and performing at [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] (UCB) in 2005, later teaching at New York's [[Magnet Theater]].&lt;ref name="dailydot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunn|first1=Gaby|title=Meet the women behind Reductress, the feminist Onion|url=http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/reductress-feminist-satire-news-interview/|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=May 2, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828012023/http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/reductress-feminist-satire-news-interview/|archivedate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Pappalardo was a comedy performer and writer while attending college in Chicago and worked as a freelance writer.&lt;ref name="dailydot" /&gt; The two founded ''Reductress'' in April 2013 after a conversation between Newell and Pappalardo about tropes they observed in [[List of women's magazines|popular media targeted towards women]].&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crocker|first1=Lizzie|title=Inside the Feminist 'Onion': The Satirical Bite of 'Reductress'|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/03/inside-the-feminist-onion-the-satirical-bite-of-reductress.html|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130205828/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/03/inside-the-feminist-onion-the-satirical-bite-of-reductress.html|archivedate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferrier|first1=Morwenna|title=How to be a Sexier Woman By Clicking On This Article (and other top tips)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/03/how-to-be-a-sexier-woman-by-clicking-on-this-article-and-other-top-tips-feminism-reductress|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221221404/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/03/how-to-be-a-sexier-woman-by-clicking-on-this-article-and-other-top-tips-feminism-reductress|archivedate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2016, the site reached 1.7 million monthly global visits, with a record monthly readership of 2.4 million hits in November 2014.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reductress.com|url=https://www.quantcast.com/reductress.com#/trafficCard|website=[[Quantcast]]|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, in response to a comedian being banned from UCB after being accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women, ''Reductress'' dedicated its entire [[landing page]] to stories satirizing the tactics of rapists and [[rape culture]].&lt;ref name="jezebel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Madeleine|title=Reductress Is Devoting Its Entire Site to Rape Jokes That Punch Up|url=http://jezebel.com/reductress-is-devoting-its-entire-site-to-rape-jokes-th-1785404690|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Emma|title=Reductress devoted its whole website to dismantling rape culture|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/18/reductress-rape-culture/|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[Mashable]]|date=August 18, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819201433/http://mashable.com/2016/08/18/reductress-rape-culture/|archivedate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website has an office in the [[Flatiron District]] of Manhattan, New York.&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;

In October 2016, ''Reductress'' released a book, ''How To Win At Feminism: The Definitive Guide To Having It All—And Then Some!'' Written by Newell, Pappalardo, and Anna Drezen, the book was published by [[HarperOne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PenzeyMoog|first1=Caitlin|title=''Reductress''{{'}} clever, funny book teaches women ''How To Win At Feminism''|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/reductress-clever-funny-book-teaches-women-how-win-244673|accessdate=October 27, 2016|work=[[The A.V.

==Style and content==
''Reductress'' is a feminist [[news satire]] site.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raftery|first1=Brian|title=How Reductress Became the Most Brutally Truthful Comedy Site Out There|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/reductress-pitch-perfect/|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=August 19, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820181843/http://www.wired.com/2016/08/reductress-pitch-perfect/|archivedate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived as a parody of women's magazines and the [[clickbait]] headlines they often employ, the site gradually expanded its focus to satirizing the ways women's media attempt to capitalize on feminism while still espousing values "that make [women] feel inadequate."&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The site has also parodied aspects of feminism, such as [[white feminism]] or feminism that lacks awareness of [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]].&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;

''Reductress'' publishes satirical [[advice column]]s, news stories, [[Confessional writing|confessionals]], [[listicle]]s, and profiles, paired with a [[Stock photography|stock photo]].&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; The style of its articles has been compared to that of ''The Onion''.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; Newell and Pappalardo have expressed interest in creating more video content for the site.&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;

==Reception==
Gaby Dunn of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' described ''Reductress'' as "not only biting, 'goes-there' hilarious, [but] a fantastic, sad, and much-needed look at the way the media talks down to women".&lt;ref name="dailydot" /&gt; Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Morwenna Ferrier said that the site's "headlines are cutting, but the comedy is sometimes subtle enough to dupe readers", citing the headline "We're Piercing My Baby's Tongue" as an example.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Brian Raftery opined in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' that ''Reductress'' "quickly became one of the funniest and most focused humor outlets on the web" with articles like "Actually, I'm an Intersectional Men's Rights Activist" and "How To Friendzone Ethan While He's Still Inside You".&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; Particular praise was levied for ''Reductress''{{'s}} August 2016 series of articles regarding rape which were viewed as a powerful reaction to a national pattern of sexual violence and a strong example of the power of humor to "confront even the most seemingly unseemly topics, so long as it's done with honesty, empathy, and a shit-ton of sagacious fury."&lt;ref name="mashable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jezebel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

'''''Roseanna's Grave''''' (also known as '''''For Roseanna''''') is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film directed by [[Paul Weiland]]. In his review, [[Roger Ebert]] concludes that ''Roseanna's Grave'' "isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears of the plot are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 25, 1997 |title=For Roseanna |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970725/REVIEWS/707250302/1023 |publisher= |work=Chicago Sun-Times}} ''For Roseanna'' was the name given to the film in its festival release.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sequel'''  is a [[literature]], [[film]], [[theatre]], [[television]],  [[music]] or [[video game]] that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a [[narrative]] work of [[fiction]], a sequel portrays events set in the same [[fictional universe]] as an earlier work, usually [[chronological]]ly following the events of that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sequels of Hit Films Now Often Loser|work= The New York Times|date=March 12, 1991|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/movies/sequels-of-hit-films-now-often-loser.html?scp=9&amp;sq=robocop&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-09 | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. A sequel can lead to a [[film series|series]], in which key elements appear repeatedly. Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some [[media franchise]]s have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as such or not.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Sequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings. Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels financially appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Creative Bankruptcy|work= Call It Like I See It|date=June 15, 2011|url= http://www.callitlikeiseeit.com/?p=230 | first=David | last=Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In movies, sequels are common. There are many name formats for sequels. Sometimes, they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added on the end. More commonly, they have numbers at the end or have an added word on the end.{{CN|date=October 2017}} It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or have a subtitle. In the 1930s, many musical sequels had the year included in the title. Sometimes sequels are released with different titles in different countries, because of the perceived brand recognition. There are several ways that subsequent works can be related to the [[chronology]] of the original. Various [[neologism]]s have been coined to describe them.

==Chronologies==
The most common approach is for the events of the second work to directly follow the events of the first, either picking up dangling plot threads or introducing a new conflict to drive the events of a second story. This is often called a '''direct sequel'''. A '''legacy sequel''' is a work which follows the continuity of the original work or works but takes place longer in the future, often focusing on new characters but with the original ones still present.&lt;ref&gt;https://filmschoolrejects.com/6-films-that-are-waiting-for-their-legacy-sequels-5851c0912005/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/12/do-legacy-sequels-fail-if-they-pander-to-the-fans/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/creed/251731/creed-2-loses-sylvester-stallone-as-director&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy sequels are sometimes also direct sequels which ignore previous sequels in the cronology, sometimes even [[retconning]] preceding sequels to the original work. An example of this is [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'' (2018)]] which is a direct sequel to [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'' (1978)]]. When a work is set in the same universe, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a '''standalone sequel'''. ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Son of the Mask]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' are examples of stand-alone movie sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Andre-Driussi|title=Lexicon Urthus, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9neV_vyIX14C&amp;pg=PP21|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=978-0-9642795-1-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinematicslant.com/2018/08/14/five-films-show-how-2008-redefined-the-movies/|title=Five Films Show How 2008 Redefined the Movies|date=14 August 2018|publisher=Cinematic Slant|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel to the first sequel might be referred to as a "third installment" or '''threequel''' or second sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kenneth Muir|title=Horror Films of the 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ1vcmaOd7wC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=30 July 2013|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5501-0|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Soanes, Stevenson | year = 2008 |title=[[Concise Oxford English dictionary]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 1501 | isbn= 0199548412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel that portrays events prior those of the original work is called a '''[[prequel]]'''.&lt;ref name=Silverblatt&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverblatt|first=Art|year=2007|title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|isbn=9780765616708|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R7ixUTC8EpwC&amp;pg=PA211 211]|quote=Prequels focus on the action that took place ''before'' the original narrative. For instance, in ''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' the audience learns about how Darth Vader originally became a villain. A prequel assumes that the audience is familiar with the original—the audience must rework the narrative so that they can understand how the prequel leads up to the beginning of the original.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels or '''paraquels''' are stories that run at the same point in time within the universe of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary {{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/parallel|title=parallel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Paraquel?", ''[[The Storyteller's Scroll]]''; Sunday, March 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf, ''Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation''; 210&lt;/ref&gt; '''Midquels''' refers to works which take place between evens, there are different types of "midquels".&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf; ''The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt; Such as '''interquels''' which are stories that take place in between two preceding stories and serve as a sequel to one and a prequel to another simultaneously. For example, if Movie C is an interquel of movies A and B, the events of movie C take place after the events of movie A but before the events of movie B. ''[[Rogue One]]'' of the Star Wars series is an "interquel" since it takes place between ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''. '''Intraquels''' on the other hand are works which focus on events between the events of the same film. ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'' which taker place on the [[Christmas]] between the beginning and the end of the film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' is often called a "midquel" but is more exactly an "intraquel".&lt;ref&gt;William D. Crump, ''How the Movies Saved Christmas: 228 Rescues from Clausnappers, Sleigh Crashes, Lost Presents and Holiday Disasters''; 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes; ''The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf; ''The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standalone sequels==
When a work is set in the same universe, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a '''standalone sequel'''. ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Son of the Mask]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' are examples of stand-alone movie sequels.

==History==
In ''The Afterlife of a Character'', David Brewer describes a reader's desire to "see more", or to know what happens next in a narrative after it has ended.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David A. ''The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825.'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity for expansive curiosity is certainly not restricted to a particular era in human history. Indeed, we can point to Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a sequel to the ''[[Iliad]]'' in the sense that it expands upon plot and character elements established in the first text. That both the ''Odyssey'' and the ''Iliad'' were written in the 8th century B.C.E. and are traditionally held to represent the first extant works of [[western literature]] lends credence to the ubiquity of sequels in literary history. The Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] is also a common referent in that sense; many of the works included in the Hebrew Scriptures can be classified as sequels in that they continue and expand on a very general narrative that is pre-established by previous books in the same collection. In addition, the development of an official [[Biblical canon|canon]] allows for the distinction between official and unofficial sequels; in this context, [[apocrypha]] might be considered an early form of informal sequel literature. 
Sequels, then, become an important facet of Western literature throughout history. The medieval genre of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]], in particular, contains massive networks of prequel and sequel literature.

===Sequels of the novel===
The origin of the sequel as we think of it in the 21st century developed from the [[novella]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] traditions in a slow process that culminated towards the end of the 17th century.

The substantial shift towards a rapidly growing [[print culture]] and the rise of the market system by the early 18th-century meant that an author's merit and livelihood became increasingly linked to the number of copies of a work he or she could sell. This shift from a text-based to an author-centered reading culture&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
led to the "professionalization" of the author — that is, the development of a "sense of identity based on a marketable skill and on supplying to a defined public a specialized service it was demanding".&lt;ref&gt;To Renew Their Former Acquaintance': Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth-Century Sequels by Betty A. Schellenberg from Part Two: Reflections on the Sequel&lt;/ref&gt; In one sense, then, sequels became a means to profit further from previous work that had already obtained some measure of commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Budra, Paul, and Betty Schellenberg. "Introduction." Part Two Reflections on the Sequel (Theory / Culture). New York: University of Toronto, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As the establishment of a readership became increasingly important to the economic viability of authorship, sequels offered a means to establish a recurring economic outlet.

In addition to serving economic profit, the sequel was also used as a method to strengthen an author's claim to his literary property. With weak copyright laws and unscrupulous booksellers willing to sell whatever they could, in some cases the only way to prove ownership of a text was to produce another like it. Sequels in this sense are rather limited in scope, as the authors are focused on producing "more of the same" to defend their "literary paternity".&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"&gt;Schellenberg, Betty A. "To Renew Their Former Acquaintance': Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth-Century Sequels." Part Two Reflections on the Sequel (Theory / Culture). Ed. Paul Budra and Betty A. Schellenberg. New York: University of Toronto, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As is true throughout history, sequels to novels provided an opportunity for authors to interact with a readership. This became especially important in the economy of the 18th century novel, in which authors often maintained readership by drawing readers back with the promise of more of what they liked from the original. With sequels, therefore, came the implicit division of readers by authors into the categories of "desirable" and "undesirable"—that is, those that interpret the text in a way unsanctioned by the author. Only after having achieved a significant reader base would an author feel free to alienate or ignore the "undesirable" readers.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"/&gt;

This concept of "undesirable" readers extends to unofficial sequels with the 18th century novel. While in certain historical contexts unofficial sequels were actually the norm (for an example, see [[Arthurian literature]]), with the emphasis on the author function that arises in conjunction with the novel many authors began to see these kinds of unauthorized extensions as being in direct conflict with authorial authority. In the matter of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (an early novel, perhaps better classified as a satirical romance), for example, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] disapproved of [[Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda]]'s use of his characters in ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha'', an unauthorized sequel. In response, Cervantes very firmly kills the protagonist at the end of the Second Part to discourage any more such creative liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, E.C. "Three Versions of Don Quixote". ''The Modern Language Review'' 68.4 (173). JSTOR. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Samuel Richardson]], an 18th-century author who responded particularly strongly against the appropriation of his material by unauthorized third parties. Richardson was extremely vocal in his disapproval of the way the protagonist of his novel ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' was repeatedly incorporated into unauthorized sequels featuring particularly lewd plots. The most famous of these is [[Henry Fielding]]'s parody, entitled ''[[Shamela]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David A. The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''To Renew Their Former Acquaintance: Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth Century Sequels'', Betty Schellenberg theorizes that whereas for male writers in the 18th century sequels often served as "models of paternity and property", for women writers these models were more likely to be seen as transgressive. Instead, the recurring readership created by sequels let female writers function within the model of "familiar acquaintances reunited to enjoy the mutual pleasures of conversation", and made their writing an "activity within a private, non-economic sphere." Ironically, through this created perception women writers were able to break into the economic sphere and "enhance their professional status" through authorship.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"/&gt;

Dissociated from the motives of profit and therefore unrestrained by the need for continuity felt by male writers, Schellenberg argues that female-authored sequel fiction tended to have a much broader scope.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He says that women writers showed an "innovative freedom" that male writers rejected to "protect their patrimony." For example, [[Sarah Fielding]]'s ''Adventures of David Simple'' and its sequels ''Familiar Letters between the Principal Characters in David Simple'' and ''David Simple, Volume the Last'' are extremely innovative and cover almost the entire range of popular narrative styles of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, Allen. "Far From Simple: Sarah Fielding's Familiar Letters and the Limits of the Eighteenth-Century Sequel" On Second Thought, Edited by Bourdeau and Kraft. Cranbury, NJ: Rosemont, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}

==Media franchises==
{{Main|Media franchise}}
In some cases, the characters or setting of an original film or video game become so valuable that they develop into a [[media franchise]]. Generally, a whole series of sequels is made, along with [[merchandising]]. Multiple sequels are often planned well in advance and actors and directors may sign extended contracts to ensure their participation. This can extend into a franchise's initial production's plot to provide story material to develop for sequels called sequel hooks. 

===Box office===
Movie sequels do not always do as well at the box office as the original, but they tend to do better than non-sequels, according to a study in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Business Research. The shorter the period between releases, the better the sequel does at the box office. Sequels also show a faster drop in weekly revenues relative to non-sequels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541522/ Newswise: Researchers Investigate Box Office Impact Vs. Original Movie] Retrieved on June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media shifting===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Sequels are most often produced in the same medium as the previous work (e.g. a film sequel is usually a sequel to another film). Producing sequels to a work in another medium has recently become common, especially when the new medium is less costly or time-consuming to produce.

A sequel to a popular but discontinued television series may be produced in another medium, thereby bypassing whatever factors led to the series cancellation. 

Some highly popular movies and television series have inspired the production of multiple novel sequels, sometimes rivaling or even dwarfing the volume of works in the original medium.

For example, the 1956 novel ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', its [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|1961 animated adaptation]] and that film's [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|1996 live-action remake]] each have a sequel unrelated to the other sequels: respectively ''[[The Starlight Barking]]'' (1967), ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]'' (2003, direct to video) and ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' (2000).

==Unofficial sequels==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Sometimes sequels are produced without the consent of the creator of the original work. These may be dubbed unofficial, informal, unauthorized, or illegitimate sequels. In some cases, the work is in the [[public domain]], and there is no legal obstacle to producing sequels. An example would be a book or movie that served as a sequel to the original book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]],'' which is in the public domain (as opposed to the 1939 movie). In other cases, the original creator or their heirs may assert [[copyright]]s and challenge the creators of the sequels. 

Another example of an unofficial sequel would be ''[[Never Say Never Again]],'' a James Bond movie starring Sean Connery that was not produced by [[Eon Productions]], which has handled nearly all of the other Bond films.

A '''speech sound disorder''' ('''SSD''') is a [[speech disorder]] in which some speech sounds (called [[phoneme]]s) in a child's (or, sometimes, an adult's) language are either not produced, not produced correctly, or are not used correctly. The term protracted phonological development is sometimes preferred when describing children's speech to emphasize the continuing development while acknowledging the delay.

== Classification ==

Speech sound disorders may be subdivided into two primary types, '''articulation disorders''' (also called '''phonetic disorders''') and '''phonemic disorders''' (also called '''phonological disorders'''). However, some may have a mixed disorder in which both articulation and phonological problems exist. Though speech sound disorders are associated with childhood, some ''residual'' errors may persist into adulthood.

=== Articulation disorders ===
Articulation disorders (also called phonetic disorders, or simply "artic disorders" for short) are based on difficulty learning to physically produce the intended phonemes. Articulation disorders have to do with the main articulators which are the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum, glottis, and the tongue. If the disorder has anything to do with any of these articulators, then it is an articulation disorder. There are usually fewer errors than with a phonemic disorder, and distortions are more likely (though any omissions, additions, and substitutions may also be present). They are often treated by teaching the child how to physically produce the sound and having them practice its production until it (hopefully) becomes natural. Articulation disorders should not be confused with [[motor speech disorders]], such as [[dysarthria]] (in which there is actual paralysis of the speech musculature) or [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (in which [[motor planning]] is severely impaired).

=== Phonemic disorders ===
In a phonemic disorder (also called a phonological disorders) the child is having trouble learning the sound system of the language, failing to recognize which sound-contrasts also contrast meaning. For example, the sounds /k/ and /t/ may not be recognized as having different meanings, so "call" and "tall" might be treated as [[homophones]], both being pronounced as "tall." This is called ''phoneme collapse'', and in some cases many sounds may all be represented by one — e.g., /d/ might replace /t/, /k/, and /g/. As a result, the number of error sounds is often (though not always) greater than with articulation disorders and substitutions are usually the most common error. Phonemic disorders are often treated using ''[[minimal pair]]s'' (two words that differ by only one sound) to draw the child's attention to the difference and its effect on communication.

Some children with phonemic disorders may seem to be able to hear phoneme distinctions in the speech of others but not their own. This is called the ''[[fis phenomenon]]'' based on scenario in which a speech pathologist will say, "Did you say 'fis,' don't you mean 'fish'?" To which the child responds, "No, I didn't say 'fis,' I said 'fis'." In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fromkin | first1 = Victoria. | work = Linguistics : an introduction to linguistic theory | date = 2000 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Mass. ; Oxford, U.K. | isbn = 978-0-631-19711-9 | oclc=  43577669| chapter = Phonology }}&lt;/ref&gt; – because those sounds are not phonemically unique to speakers of the language.

Though phonemic disorders are often considered language disorders in that it is the language system that is affected, they are also speech sound disorders in that the errors relate to use of phonemes. This makes them different from ''[[specific language impairment]]'', which is primarily a disorder of the [[syntax]] (grammar) and usage of language rather than the sound system. However, the two can coexist, affecting the same person.

Other disorders can deal with a variety of different ways to pronounce consonants.  Some examples are glides and liquids.  Glides occur when the articulatory posture changes gradually from consonant to vowel.  Liquids can include /l/ and /.1/ .

=== Mixed speech sound disorders ===
In some cases phonetic and phonemic errors may coexist in the same person. In such case the primary focus is usually on the phonological component but articulation therapy may be needed as part of the process, since teaching a child how to use a sound is not practical if the child does not know how to produce it.

=== Residual errors ===
Even though most speech sound disorders can be successfully treated in childhood, and a few may even outgrow them on their own, errors may sometimes persist into adulthood rather than only being not [[age appropriate]]. Such persisting errors are referred to as "residual errors" and may remain for life.

== Presentation ==

Errors produced by children with speech sound disorders are typically classified into four categories:

*Omissions: Certain sounds are not produced — entire syllables or classes of sounds may be deleted; e.g., fi' for fish or 'at for cat.
*Additions (or Epentheses/Commissions): an extra sound or sounds are added to the intended word; e.g. puh-lane for plane.
*Distortions: Sounds are changed slightly so that the intended sound may be recognized but sounds "wrong," or may not sound like any sound in the language.
*Substitutions: One or more sounds are substituted for another; e.g., wabbit for rabbit or tow for cow.  
Sometimes, even for experts, telling exactly which type has been made is not obvious — some distorted forms of /r/ may be mistaken for /w/ by a casual observer, yet may not actually be either sound but somewhere in between. Further, children with severe speech sound disorders may be difficult to understand, making it hard to tell what word was actually intended and thus what is actually wrong with it. Some terms can be used to describe more than one of the above categories, such as [[lisp]], which is often the replacement of /s/ with /th/ (a substitution), but can be a distortion, producing /s/ just behind the teeth resulting in a sound somewhere between /s/ and /th/.

There are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of an error that is produced:
# Sounds the patient can produce
##A: Phonemic- can be produced easily; used meaningfully and contrastively
##B: Phonetic- produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or contrastively; not used in connected speech
# Stimulable sounds
##A: Easily stimulable
##B: Stimulable after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor)
# Cannot produce the sound
##A: Cannot be produced voluntarily
##B: No production ever observed

Note that omissions do not mean the sound cannot be produced, and some sounds may be produced more easily or frequently when appearing with certain other sounds: someone might be able to say "s" and "t" separately, but not "st," or may be able to produce a sound at the beginning of a word but not at the end. The magnitude of the problem will often vary between different sounds from the same speaker.

== Causes ==
Most speech sound disorders occur without a known cause. A child may not learn how to produce sounds correctly or may not learn the rules of speech sounds on his or her own. These children may have a problem with speech development, which does not always mean that they will simply outgrow it by themselves.  Many children do develop speech sounds over time but those who do not often need the services of a Speech-Language Pathologist to learn correct speech sounds.{{Clarify| reason = This paragraph is a waffly muddle, and largely pointless.|date=February 2012}}

Some speech sound errors can result from other syndromes or disorders such as:

* [[developmental disorders]] (e.g. [[autism]])
* [[genetic disorders]] (e.g. [[Down syndrome]])
* [[hearing loss]], including temporary hearing loss, such as from ear infections
* [[cleft palate]] or other physical anomalies of the mouth
* illness
* [[neurological disorders]] (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]])

==Diagnosis ==
In a typical 2-year-old child, about 50% of speech may be intelligible. A 4-year-old child's speech should be intelligible overall, and a 7-year-old should be able to clearly produce most words consistent with community norms for their age. Misarticulation of certain difficult sounds (''l'', ''r'',
''s'', ''z'', ''th'', ''ch'', ''dzh'', and ''zh'') may be normal up to 8 years. Children with speech sound disorder have pronunciation difficulties inappropriate for their age, and the difficulties are not caused by [[hearing loss|hearing problems]], congenital deformities, [[motor disorder]]s or [[selective mutism]].&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Speech Sound Disorder, 315.39 (F80.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DSM-5]] diagnostic criteria are as follows:&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:0em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 8px #ccc;padding:0.5em"&gt;
*A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages.
*B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.
*C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
*D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological conditions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Treatment==
For most children, the disorder is not lifelong and speech difficulties improve with time and [[speech-language pathology|speech-language treatment]]. Prognosis is poorer for children who also have a [[language disorder]], as that may be indicative of a learning disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2767">In mathematics, the '''Sturm series'''&lt;ref name="Sturm1829"/&gt; associated with a pair of [[polynomial]]s is named after [[Jacques Charles François Sturm]].

==Definition==
{{See|Sturm chain}}
Let &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; two univariate polynomials. Suppose that they do not have a common root and the degree of &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the degree of &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;. The ''Sturm series'' is constructed by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p_i := p_{i+1} q_{i+1} - p_{i+2} \text{ for } i \geq 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is almost the same algorithm as [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's]] but the remainder &lt;math&gt;p_{i+2}&lt;/math&gt; has negative sign.

==Sturm series associated to a characteristic polynomial==
Let us see now Sturm series &lt;math&gt;p_0,p_1,\dots,p_k&lt;/math&gt; associated to a [[characteristic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the variable &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
P(\lambda)= a_0 \lambda^k + a_1 \lambda^{k-1} + \cdots + a_{k-1} \lambda + a_k
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\{1,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt; are rational functions in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; with the coordinate set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The series begins with two polynomials obtained by dividing &lt;math&gt;P(\imath \mu)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\imath ^k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\imath&lt;/math&gt; represents the imaginary unit equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and separate real and imaginary parts:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p_0(\mu) &amp; := \Re \left(\frac{P(\imath \mu)}{\imath^k}\right ) = a_0 \mu^k - a_2 \mu^{k-2} + a_4 \mu^{k-4} \pm \cdots \\
p_1(\mu) &amp; := -\Im \left( \frac{P(\imath \mu)}{\imath^k}\right)= a_1 \mu^{k-1} - a_3 \mu^{k-3} + a_5 \mu^{k-5} \pm \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining terms are defined with the above relation. Due to the special structure of these polynomials, they can be written in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;
p_i(\mu)= c_{i,0} \mu^{k-i} + c_{i,1} \mu^{k-i-2} + c_{i,2} \mu^{k-i-4}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
In these notations, the quotient &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;(c_{i-1,0}/c_{i,0})\mu&lt;/math&gt; which provides the condition &lt;math&gt;c_{i,0}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; replaced in the above relation gives the following recursive formulas for computation of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
c_{i+1,j}= c_{i,j+1} \frac{c_{i-1,0}}{c_{i,0}}-c_{i-1,j+1} = \frac{1}{c_{i,0}} 
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{i-1,0} &amp; c_{i-1,j+1} \\
c_{i,0} &amp; c_{i,j+1}
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;c_{i,0}=0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is a higher degree polynomial and the sequence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; stops at &lt;math&gt;p_h&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h&lt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6361">"'''The Complexity of Songs'''" is a journal article published by [[computer scientist]] [[Donald Knuth]] in 1977,&lt;ref name=knu /&gt; as an [[in-joke]] about [[computational complexity theory]]. The article capitalizes on the tendency of popular [[song]]s to devolve from long and content-rich [[ballad]]s to highly repetitive texts with little or no meaningful content.&lt;ref name=redux&gt;Steven Krantz (2005) "Mathematical Apocrypha Redux", {{ISBN|0-88385-554-2}}, pp.2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The article notes how some songs can reach a complexity level, for a song of length ''N'' words, as formula: {{nowrap|[[Big O notation|O]]([[logarithm|log]] ''N'')}}. The gist of the article is repeated below, maintaining the wit of the key concepts.

== Article summary ==
Knuth writes that "our ancient ancestors invented the concept of [[refrain]]" to reduce the [[space complexity]] of songs, which becomes crucial when a large number of songs is to be committed to one's [[memory]]. Knuth's [[Lemma (mathematics)|Lemma]] 1 states that if ''N'' is the length of a song, then the refrain decreases the song complexity to ''cN'', where the factor&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="knu"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=SIGACT News | date=Summer 1977 | pages=17–24}}
Reprinted in: {{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | year=1984 | volume=27 | issue=4 | pages=344–346 | doi=10.1145/358027.358042 | mr=784131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth further demonstrates a way of producing songs with [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\sqrt N&lt;/math&gt;) complexity, an approach "further improved by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] farmer named [[Old McDonald Had a Farm|O. MacDonald]]".&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

More ingenious approaches yield songs of complexity [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\log N&lt;/math&gt;), a class known as "[[99_Bottles_of_Beer#References_in_computer_science|''m'' bottles of beer on the wall]]".

Finally, the progress during the 20th century—stimulated by the fact that "the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less memory"—leads to the ultimate improvement: Arbitrarily long songs with space complexity [[Big O notation|O]](1), e.g. for a song to be defined by the [[recurrence relation]]&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_0=\epsilon, S_k = V_kS_{k-1},\, k\ge 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_k =&lt;/math&gt; '[[That's the Way (I Like It)|That's the way]],' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; 'I like it,' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; k \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U=&lt;/math&gt; 'uh huh,' 'uh huh'

== Further developments ==
Prof. Kurt Eisemann of [[San Diego State University]] in his letter to the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''&lt;ref name=kurt /&gt; further improves the latter seemingly unbeatable estimate. He begins with an observation that for practical applications the value of the "hidden constant" ''c'' in the [[Big Oh]] notation may be crucial in making the difference between the feasibility and unfeasibility: for example a constant  value of 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; would exceed the capacity of any known device. He further notices that a technique has already been known in [[Mediaeval Europe]] whereby textual content of an arbitrary tune can be recorded basing on the recurrence relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_2S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_2 = 'la'&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the value of the big-Oh constant ''c'' equal to 2. However it turns out that another culture achieved the absolute lower bound of O(0). As Prof. Eisemann puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the ''Mayflower'' voyagers first descended on these shores, the native Americans proud of their achievement in the theory of information storage and retrieval, at first welcomed the strangers with the complete silence. This was meant to convey their peak achievement in the complexity of songs, namely the demonstration that a limit as low as ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is indeed obtainable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the Europeans were unprepared to grasp this notion, and the [[Indian chief|chiefs]], in order to establish a common ground to convey their achievements later proceeded to demonstrate an approach described by the recurrent relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_1S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = 'i'&lt;/math&gt;, with a suboptimal complexity given by ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=redux /&gt;&lt;ref name=kurt&gt;Kurt Eisemann, "Further Results on the Complexity of Songs", ''Communications of the ACM'', vol 28 (1985), no. 3, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The O(1) space complexity result was also implemented by [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], perhaps challenged by Knuth's article.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Neumann, "A further view of the first quarter century" ,''Communications of the ACM'', Volume 27, Issue 4, April 1984, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Steele's  ''[[TELNET]] Song'' used a completely different algorithm based on exponential recursion, a parody on some implementations of TELNET.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], "The Telnet Song", ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', April 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00222.html Text of the TELNET Song] (retrieved January 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~nickz/dec/telnet-song.mid Telnet song in MIDI format]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the complexity analysis of human songs can be a useful pedagogic device for teaching students complexity theory.&lt;ref name=Chavey1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavey|first=Darrah|title=Songs and the analysis of algorithms|journal=SIGCSE '96|year=1996|pages=4–8|doi=10.1145/236452.236475|url=http://dl2.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=236475&amp;CFID=248220371&amp;CFTOKEN=72224448|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "On Superpolylogarithmic [[subexponential time|Subexponential]] Functions" by Prof. [[Alan Sherman]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sherman, "On Superpolylogarithmic Subexponential Functions:, ''ACM SIGACT News'', vol. 22, no. 1, 1991, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Knuth's article was seminal for analysis of a special class of functions.

'''''The Hundred-Year Christmas''''' is a [[fantasy novel]] by [[David Morrell]], who is best known for being the creator of [[John Rambo]] in his earlier novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]''.&lt;ref name="thrillerwriters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thrillerwriters.org/2009/11/the-hundred-year-christmas-and-the-spy-w.html |title=The Hundred-Year Christmas, and The Spy Who Came for Christmas by David Morrell |author=Dionne, Karen |work= |publisher=International Thriller Writers |accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hundred-Year Christmas'' was first published in [[1983 in literature|1983]] by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc.|Donald M. Grant]] in an edition of 700 copies, which were signed and numbered.

==Origin==
The novel was originally written as a Christmas present for Morrell's two children,&lt;ref name="thrillerwriters"/&gt; and the children in the novel are named after Morell's son and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmorrell.net/books/dsp.book.cfm?bid=27 |title=The Hundred-Year Christmas  (1983) |author= |work= |publisher=The David Morell Network |accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel concerns the friendship between [[Father Christmas]], who lives for 100 years, and [[Father Time]], who lives for only one. Each year Santa Claus watches a new version of his friend grow old and die, before being replaced; however, Santa's hundred years is up and it is now his turn to find a replacement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6012">'''Thematic interpretation''' is an approach to [[heritage interpretation]] originally advocated by Professor William J. Lewis (University of Vermont)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=William|title=Interpreting for park visitors|year=1980|publisher=Eastern National|location=Fort Washington, PA|isbn=0-89062-079-2|url=http://www.eparks.com/store/product/4956/Interpreting-For-Park-Visitors/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently developed by Professor Sam H. Ham (University of Idaho). In the thematic approach, an interpreter relies on a central theme (i.e., a major point or message) to guide development of a communication activity or device.  In presenting the activity or device, the thematic interpreter develops the theme in such a way that it will be highly relevant to an audience.  According to studies{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, presenting a strongly relevant theme greatly increases the likelihood an interpreter will succeed in provoking an audience to think about theme-related issues.

Beginning in the early 2000s, the thematic approach has been adopted widely in persuasive communication campaigns aimed at impacting [[environmental behavior]]s, especially those related to energy and water consumption, and in [[occupational safety]] and [[risk communication]] programs. In the broader fields of [[sustainable development]] and risk communication, the term ''[[thematic communication]]'' (rather than thematic "interpretation") is often used. The two approaches, however, are identical, and both are linked largely to Ham's (1992) book, ''Environmental Interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Sam|title=Environmental interpretation--A practical guide for people with big ideas and small budgets|year=1992|publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|location=Golden, CO|isbn=1-55591-902-2|url=http://www.fulcrum-books.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=5332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The thematic approach to interpretation was popularized in the book Environmental Interpretation (1992) by Dr. Sam H. Ham (University of Idaho) which has become standard reading for many students of interpretation and interpretive tour guiding. Prior to Dr. Ham's book, two additional contributors to the field of Interpretation are its founder, Freeman Tilden and his book, ''Interpreting Our Heritage'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tilden|first=Freeman|title=Interpreting our heritage|year=1957|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=0-8078-4016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Grant W. Sharpe (University of Washington) and his work, ''Interpreting the Environment''.

Ham formally presented the thematic approach for the first time in his 1992 book, wherein he outlined the "EROT" (Enjoyable, Relevant, Organized, Thematic) framework.  Drawing heavily on persuasive communication research, Ham refined the EROT framework in the early 2000s and renamed it the TORE model of thematic interpretation. The most detailed presentation of the TORE model is in ''Interpretation-- Making a difference on purpose'' which Ham published in 2013.

There are obvious parallels between Ham's view of thematic interpretation and those of [[Freeman Tilden]] who is widely considered the founder of the field of interpretation. The most important parallel is that both see interpretation  as a process aimed at provoking audiences to do their own thinking and thereby develop their own subjective understanding of the world.  This is in contrast to the view that interpretation instructs audiences to know or accept the interpreter's understanding of things.

Both Tilden and Ham appear to be strongly influenced by the views of constructivist learning theorists--with Tilden influenced by [[John Dewey]], and Ham influenced by cognitive constructivist [[Jean Piaget]] and social constructivist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. In the spirit of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning theory]], Dewey, Piaget, and Vygotsky saw learning as the result of knowledge that is created inside a learner's own head, rather than being "put" there by an educator.  Both Tilden, and later, Ham, advocated a very similar view in the field of interpretation.  According to both of them, when interpretation is strongly relevant to its audience, it is likely to provoke thinking and elaboration.

== Practice ==

In everyday reality, the practice of thematic interpretation involves theme-based communication by interpretive naturalists, zoo and museum educators, guides, docents, park rangers, and other communicators in natural and cultural settings.  Typically interpreters are required to present complex and potentially dry subject matter to non-technical voluntary audiences (often consisting of tourists) in an interesting and engaging way. The thematic approach can involve any method that increases the relevance of an interpreter's theme to an audience, for example, comparisons, analogies and stories that link unfamiliar things to the things an audience already cares about.

== Alternate uses ==

Thematic interpretation also refers to an event in some high school competitive speech leagues such as the [[California High School Speech Association]] and the [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]].  "TIers" present multiple "cuttings" from published works on a common theme; they can be of humorous and/or dramatic intent.  The entire speech including an introduction and transitions should not exceed ten minutes.  Contestants are judged based on the appropriateness of their selections and their portrayal of the characters.  Another defining characteristic of Thematic Interpretation is the use of a single binder, containing the literature, as a prop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47084">[[Tirukkural]], also known as the Kural, an [[Ancient India|ancient Indian]] treatise on the [[Secular ethics|ethics and morality of the commoner]], is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most widely translated non-religious works]] in the world. Authored by the ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet-philosopher [[Thiruvalluvar]] and dated around the 1st century [[BCE]], it has been translated into at least 42 world languages, with about 57 different renderings in the [[English language]] alone.

[[File:Beschi Tamil literature.jpg|right|130px|thumb|Beschi, the earliest known translator of the Kural text]]
In 1730, [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] rendered the Kural text into [[Latin]], introducing the work to the Europeans for the first time. However, only the first two books of the Kural text, namely, virtue and wealth, were translated by Beschi, who considered translating the book on love inappropriate for a Christian missionary. Around 1767, an unknown author made the first [[French language|French]] translation, which went unnoticed.&lt;ref name="OnTranslatingTirukkural"/&gt; The Danish Missionary [[August Friedrich Caemmerer]] translated it into [[German language|German]] in 1803.&lt;ref name="PudhiyaPanuvalPDF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Here again, only parts of the work was translated.&lt;ref name="OnTranslatingTirukkural"/&gt; In 1856, [[Karl Graul]] translated the Kural into [[German language|German]], claiming that Kural is closer to the Christian preaching and offers a model of Tamil [[worldview]].&lt;ref name="PudhiyaPanuvalPDF"/&gt; The German version was published both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]]. In 1865, his Latin translation of the Kural text, along with commentaries in Simple Tamil, was posthumously published.&lt;ref name=BDCM&gt;Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[English language|English]] translation was attempted by [[Nathaniel Edward Kindersley|N. E. Kindersley]] in 1794 when he translated a select couplets of the Kural. This was followed by another incomplete attempt by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] 1812, who translated only 120 couplets—69 in verse and 51 in prose.&lt;ref&gt;A stone inscription found on the walls of a well at the Periya palayathamman temple at [[Royapettah|Royapettai]] indicates Ellis' regard for Thiruvalluvar. It is one of the 27 wells dug on the orders of Ellis in 1818, when Madras suffered a severe drinking water shortage. In the long inscription Ellis praises Thiruvalluvar and uses a couplet from Thirukkural to explain his actions during the drought. When he was in charge of the Madras treasury and mint, he also issued a gold coin bearing Thiruvalluvar's image. The Tamil inscription on his grave makes note of his commentary of Thirukkural.{{cite web|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|authorlink=Iravatham Mahadevan|url=http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=539|work=Varalaaru.com|accessdate=25 June 2010|language=Tamil|title=The Golden coin depicting Thiruvalluvar -2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original inscription in Tamil written in the ''Asiriyapa'' meter and first person perspective: (The Kural he quotes is in Italics) &lt;br/&gt; சயங்கொண்ட தொண்டிய சாணுறு நாடெனும் | ஆழியில் இழைத்த வழகுறு மாமணி | குணகடன் முதலாக குட கடலளவு | நெடுநிலம் தாழ நிமிர்ந்திடு சென்னப் | பட்டணத்து எல்லீசன் என்பவன் யானே | பண்டாரகாரிய பாரம் சுமக்கையில் | புலவர்கள் பெருமான் மயிலையம் பதியான் | தெய்வப் புலமைத் திருவள்ளுவனார் | திருக்குறள் தன்னில் திருவுளம் பற்றிய் | ''இருபுனலும் வாய்த்த மலையும் வருபுனலும்'' | ''வல்லரணும் நாட்டிற் குறுப்பு'' | என்பதின் பொருளை என்னுள் ஆய்ந்து | ஸ்வஸ்திஸ்ரீ சாலிவாகன சகாப்த வரு | ..றாச் செல்லா நின்ற | இங்கிலிசு வரு 1818ம் ஆண்டில் | பிரபவாதி வருக்கு மேற் செல்லா நின்ற | பஹுதான்ய வரு த்தில் வார திதி | நக்ஷத்திர யோக கரணம் பார்த்து | சுப திநத்தி லிதனோ டிருபத்தேழு | துரவு கண்டு புண்ணியாஹவாசநம் | பண்ணுவித்தேன்.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blackburn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Stuart|title=Print, folklore, and nationalism in colonial South India |year=2006|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-7824-149-4|pages=92–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-BxrNKdwPMC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=francis+whyte+ellis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LGUkTOuWHpCErAeT3_n7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20whyte%20ellis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zvelebil|first=Kamil|authorlink=Kamil Zvelebil|title=Companion studies to the history of Tamil literature|year=1992|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-09365-2|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAPtq49DZfoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=francis+whyte+ellis+thirukkural&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CXMkTNjgJtOyrAewmrnIBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Henry Drew (Christian missionary)|William Henry Drew]] translated the first two parts in prose in 1840 and 1852, respectively. Along with Drew’s English prose translation, it contained the original Tamil text, the Tamil commentary by [[Parimelalhagar]] and [[Ramanuja Kavirayar]]'s amplification of the commentary. Drew, however, translated only 630 couplets. The remaining portions were translated by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary, thus providing the first complete English translation. In 1886, [[George Uglow Pope]] published the first complete English translation by a single author, which brought the Kural text to a wide audience of the [[western world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

By the turn of the twenty-first century, the Kural had already been translated to more than 37 world languages,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oocities.org/nvkashraf/kur-trans/languages.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 24 complete translations in English language alone, by both native and non-native scholars. By 2014, the Kural had been translated to more than 42 languages, with 57 versions available in English.

==Criticisms on translations==
The couplets of the Kural are inherently complex by virtue of their dense meaning within their terse structure. Thus, no translation can perfectly reflect the true nature of any given couplet of the Kural unless read and understood in its original Tamil form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = "... It is almost impossible to truly appreciate the maxims of the Kural through a translation. Tirukkural must be read and re-read in Tamil."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this inherent difficulty is the attempt by some scholars to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations noticed by modern scholars. According to V. Ramasamy, "Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders பிறவாழி as ‘the sea of miserable life’ and the phrase பிறவிப்பெருங்கடல் as ‘sea of this birth’ which has been translated by others as ‘the sea of many births’. Beschi means thus ‘those who swim the vast sea of miseries’. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief".&lt;ref name="OnTranslatingTirukkural"/&gt;

The '''Tucano people''' (sometimes spelt Tukano) are a group of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] South Americans in the northwestern Amazon, along the [[Vaupés River]] and the surrounding area. They are mostly in [[Colombia]], but some are in [[Brazil]]. They are usually described as being made up of many separate [[tribe]]s, but that oversimplifies the social and linguistic structure of the region.

== Culture ==
[[File:Necklace, jaguar teeth on palm fiber cord, Tucano people - South American objects in the American Museum of Natural History - DSC06069.JPG|thumb|Tucano jaguar tooth and palm cordage necklace, collection of AMNH]]
The Tucano are multilingual because men must marry outside their language group: no man may have a wife who speaks his language, which would be viewed as a kind of [[incest]]. Men choose women from various neighboring tribes who speak other languages. Furthermore, on marriage, women move into the men's households or longhouses. Consequently, in any village several languages are used: the language of the men; the various languages spoken by women who originate from different neighboring tribes; and a widespread regional 'trade' language. Children are born into the multilingual environment: the child's father speaks one language (considered the [[Tucano language]]), the child's mother another, other women with whom the child has daily contact, and perhaps still others. However, everyone in the community is interested in language-learning so most people can speak most of the languages. 
Multilingualism is taken for granted, and moving from one language to another in the course of a single conversation is very common. In fact, multilingualism is so usual that the Tucano are hardly conscious that they do speak different languages as they shift easily from one to another. They cannot readily tell an outsider how many languages they speak, and they must be suitably prompted to enumerate the languages that they speak and to describe how well they speak each one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8668-1|pages=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JELvevZ1q5UC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=%22the+tukano+are+a+multilingual+people%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7_ZCVYItpN&amp;sig=dXe3u8BAXWNmDb5MJuyFvyOkYNI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=88SFTr39H-WNmQWjh5Ql&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20tukano%20are%20a%20multilingual%20people%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
[[File:Tukano Languages.png|thumb|Distribution of the Tucan, who fall into groups of East, Central, and West [[Tucano language]]-speakers]]
As mentioned above, the Tucano practice linguistic [[exogamy]]. Members of a linguistic descent group marry outside their own linguistic descent group. As a result, it is normal for Tucano people to speak two, three, or more Tucanoan languages, and any Tucano household ([[longhouse]]) is likely to be host to numerous languages. The descent groups (sometimes referred to as ''tribes'') all have their accompanying language; some of the most well known are listed below:

*[[Bara Tukano]]
*[[Barasana]]
*[[Cubeo]] (the Cubeo do not practice exogamy)
*[[Desana people|Desana]]
*[[Macuna]]
*[[Wanano]]
*Tucano (or [[Tucano Proper]])

==Subsistence==
The Tucano are [[swidden]] [[horticulturalist]]s and grow [[manioc]] and other staples in forest clearings. They also hunt, trap, fish, and forage wild plants and animals.

[[Image:Zatoka Pucka - Bay of Puck (15).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Baltic Sea near the [[Bay of Puck]], a likely setting for Keyserling's ''Wellen'']]
'''''Wellen''''' (lit. ''Waves''), published in English in 1929 as '''''Tides''''', is a novel by [[Eduard von Keyserling]] that was first published in German in 1911. Set during a long hot summer in a small fishing village somewhere on the [[Baltic Sea]], most likely on the [[Curonian Spit]], it depicts a group of aristocratic city-dwellers spending their holidays in that remote part of the [[German Empire]]. However, rather than painting a rural [[idyll]], Keyserling focuses on the follies of a doomed ''[[fin de siècle]]'' society whose self-imposed repressions eventually lead to catastrophe.

==Plot summary==

Doralice, Countess of Köhne-Jasky, has walked out on her much older husband and run off with Hans Grill, a young artist who had been commissioned by the Count to paint his wife's picture. Now, a year later, Hans and Doralice have come to the Baltic coast to spend a solitary summer's holiday in a fisherman's hut. They are said to have got married in [[London]] so their relationship is outwardly considered "correct" although their marriage is generally seen as a [[misalliance]], especially by the society Doralice has left behind. While she herself is rather unsure about her future, Hans Grill is an optimistic free spirit, though not quite a [[libertine]], who is full of plans in which Doralice figures prominently. He dreams of setting himself up as a successful painter in [[Munich]] — thus being eventually able to stop living off his wife's money – and of living with her in a small suburban house.

Rather than shunning the unlikely couple, the other tourists at the small fishing village feel morally obliged to associate with them, at least perfunctorily. They are the extended Buttlär family: Baron von Buttlär; his wife Bella; their three children Lolo, Nini, und Wedig; and Baron von Buttlär's mother-in-law, the Generalin von Palikow. They are soon to be joined by Hilmar Baron von dem Hamm, Lolo's dashing fiancé, who is an officer in the German army. Also present is the [[Geheimrat]] von Knospelius, a high-ranking civil servant. Burdened with a physical handicap, and never having married, Knospelius is used to leading a vicarious life through the people he surrounds himself with, and as soon as they have arrived he introduces himself to both the Buttlärs and the Grills.

The presence of a scandalous couple does not go unnoticed by the Buttlär children. Rather, it is one of their games to sneak out of the house at night together with Ernestine, one of the young [[domestic worker|servants]], to catch a glimpse of Doralice through the open window of the Grimms' rented hut. One day, while swimming in the sea, Lolo meets Doralice on a [[sandbank]] and is deeply impressed by her cheerful manner, her wit, and her beauty, so much so that she decides to send her a huge bunch of red roses, while instinctively choosing her as her [[role model]].

Others who are also impressed by Doralice's beauty include Baron von Buttlär, a known womaniser, who is now jealously guarded by his wife, and Hilmar von dem Hamm, who openly starts courting Doralice despite her husband's and his own fiancée's presence. His endeavours to win Doralice's heart culminate in a boating trip that he undertakes with her while the others stay behind. Doralice feels flattered by the attentions of a member of the very social class that has ostracised her. At the same time, she realizes her indebtedness to, and possibly love for, Hans and stops all further advances on Hilmar's part. Lolo on the other hand, aware of her fiancé's infatuation, but due to an over-protective upbringing unprepared for life's harsh realities, decides to sacrifice herself by committing suicide. At night she secretly leaves the house wearing only her bathing costume under her coat, walks down to the beach and starts swimming out into the ocean, far beyond the sandbank where she met Doralice. She is rescued by local fishermen who drag her half-conscious body into their boat and return her to her family.

Although Lolo makes a quick and full recovery, [[etiquette]] demands of the Buttlärs that they depart immediately. Those who stay behind into the autumn are Hans and Doralice Grimm and Geheimrat Knospelius – the latter because, unbeknown to everyone, he has handed in his resignation and now has all the time in the world, and the Grimms because they actually have no other place to go. In the course of the summer, Hans has become more and more monosyllabic, and Doralice longs for some serious talk concerning their future together: She realizes that she desperately needs Hans's reassurance of his love for her. Hans, however, keeps postponing that talk to the following day and indulges in his growing fascination with the sea. Not only does he paint it; he now accompanies the fishermen on their nightly routine on a more or less regular basis and then sleeps during most of the day.

One night he goes out fishing with Steege, a notorious drunkard whose vice has prevented him from buying a new fishing boat. The old dilapidated one cannot defy the [[thunderstorm]] of which they have been warned, and the sea claims two more lives: After long days of waiting, Doralice and Mrs Steege finally accept the fact that their husbands are not coming back. At this point Knospelius makes Doralice the unexpected offer to be his companion for the foreseeable future and to spend the winter with him touring the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]].

==Rediscovery==

Literary critic [[Jens Malte Fischer]] called Keyserling "possibly the most unknown of the great German story-tellers of the century." ''Wellen'' was selected as one of 100 great novels of the 20th century by the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and reprinted in a special edition in 2004.

==Film adaptation==

In 2005 [[Vivian Naefe]] adapted Keyserling's novel for television. Based on a screenplay by [[Günter Schütter]], the film starred [[Sunnyi Melles]], [[Matthias Habich]] and [[Marie Bäumer]].

Various changes to the plot of the novel were made. For example, in the film, the action is set on the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]] in order to stress the imminence of death of an aristocratic society and its antiquated social mores and conventions. Also, for whatever reason, Knospelius was renamed ''Froselius'', while the artist's name is given as ''Til Knop''. Hilmar von dem Hamm becomes ''Carl von Gonthard''.

In 2007, the show was nominated for [[British Academy Children's Award]] by the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] in the ''International'' category, but lost to [[Stephen Hillenburg]]'s ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/previous-nominations-and-winners,53,BA.html BAFTA (2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208000000/http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/previous-nominations-and-winners,53,BA.html |date=February 8, 2011 }} &gt; Children's Award Winners (September 24, 2007) &gt; Children's &gt; Awards. Retrieved 2012-10-29&lt;/ref&gt; From its launch in June 1, 2011 to late 2012, [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD Canada]] aired re-runs of the series.

==Plot==
The show is about two rabbit twins named Yin ([[Stephanie Morgenstern]]) and Yang ([[Scott McCord]]) that train under Master Yo, a grumpy old panda who is eventually revealed to be their biological father. They learn the sacred art of Woo Foo, a special type of martial arts that involves both [[Hand to hand combat|might]] and [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]]. They must work together to save the world from evil villains and forces that want to destroy, corrupt, or take it over. However, through all these adventures, Yin and Yang still portray stereotypical siblings; belligerently antagonistic but still ultimately caring about each other and working together when needed.

During the first season, the primary goal was to defeat the Night Master, a powerful enemy. During the second season, there are three primary storylines. The first one sees Yin and Yang trying to prevent other villains from being crowned the new Night Master. The second is Yang's own quest to find powerful mystic artifacts by some later-revealed-to-be villains: four evil heads who he thinks are the masters of Woo Foo. The third sees Yin and Yang against the original and reborn Night Master, Eradicus — ultimately trying to build a Woo Foo army to fight against his army.

==Setting==
The setting is in a town where its buildings have an Asian style. The residents are [[monster]]s, [[humanoid]]s, [[robot]]s and [[animal]]s with [[anthropomorphism|human-like qualities]] and [[Allegory|behaviors]]. The residents keep unusual pets like puppygriffs, creatures that are half [[puppy]] and half [[griffin]], as well as real animals like [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[opossum]]s or [[armadillo]]s. [[Magic (fantasy)|Magic]] and [[martial arts]] still exist since ancient times when the Night Masters were around. It is revealed in Yin Yang You!, that the series takes place in another dimension.

==Characters==
[[Image:Yin-Yang-&amp;-Yo.png|thumb|255px|The series main characters from left to right: Yin, Yang, and Master Yo.]]

===Main===
*{{anchor|Yang}}Yang (voiced by [[Scott McCord]]) – Master Yo's student and the older twin brother of Yin. He mostly uses the Martial Arts side of Woo Foo, but is able to use the Mystic side of Woo Foo as well. Yang is a cuckoo, lucky, courageous yet negligent and hasty character, and has a liking for clowns, fights, video games and often seeks attention as a hero. Despite not showing emotions towards his sister, he really cares about his sister and Master Yo's well-being, and it is shown in the episode "My Stupid Sword" that Yang pushed Yin out of the way so Yin would not get in trouble by Master Yo when Yang's negligence caused looting of Woo Foo Armory by Chung Pow Kitties. Yang owns a [[bamboo]]-based sword which can temporally transform into various objects, using Woo Foo. He has a crush on Yin's friend Lina and frequently tries to impress her. He also unintentionally helped Eradicus to return from eternal slumber, using magical and spiritual items collected by Yang on a quest added by Eradicus minions posing as Woo Foo elders' spirits. However, Yin, Yang and Yo were able to defeat him. In the episode "A Toy's Story" it is revealed that he is 11-year-old. Before he and his sister Yin were adopted by Master Yo they were [[street urchins]] or [[waif]]s.
*{{anchor|Yin}}Yin (voiced by [[Stephanie Morgenstern]]) – Master Yo's student and the younger twin sister of Yang. Yin is a pink rabbit. Yin is pictured as intelligent, cute, feminine, and sassy. She mostly uses the Mystic side of Woo Foo, but she is also able to use the Martial Arts side of Woo Foo. She is often quite stubborn, and shows that she loves a tidy house and clean environment. Yin generally has a good sense of right and wrong, and usually does the right thing. It has been shown, mostly in season two, that she favors "[[Bad boy (archetype)|bad boys]]", but she has said it was just a phase. Yin's favorite color is pink, and her favorite animal is a two-ni-corn (a unicorn with two horns instead of one). Yin loves to sing, and is apparently very good at it. She is also a shopaholic. Unlike Yang, she always makes sure to let her twin and master Yo know that she cares for them a lot. In the episode "Night Fall," upon discovering Coop was working for the Night Master, gained an attraction to him. It was because of this personality trait that she temporarily became evil through Coop's influence in "Gone-A-Fowl", and went on a rampage across town with him to prove that she was evil enough to be the Night Mistress (with him as the Night Master). Before she and her brother Yang were adopted by Master Yo they were [[street urchins]] or [[waif]]s.
*{{anchor|Master Yo}}Master Yo (voiced by Martin Roach) – A bachelor giant panda with a hundred years of age but with zero parenting skills and the skillful master of ancient martial arts known as Woo Foo. He was talked into training Yin and Yang, as he is the last Woo Foo warrior (and perhaps the last panda) in the world.&lt;ref name=Foo/&gt; He is often portrayed as arrogant, stubborn, indifferent yet bears great sage wisdom and is often quick with a saying from sacred scrolls. He's able to use both might and magic and has moves that Yin and Yang are unaware of. He once was able to defeat the Night Master. He is shown to be on a quest for a younger spouse of sorts as he is often seen trying to pick up women, especially single mothers,&lt;ref name=Foo&gt;"Deja Foo.

His alter-ego returns in "The Secret Life of Possum Panda", however due to having forgotten he is Possum Panda, he starts [[sleepwalking|fighting crime in his sleep]] as Possum Panda.

===Antagonists===
*{{anchor|Night Master}}The Night Master (voiced by [[David Hemblen]]) – Billed as a "Dark Overlord in an Evil Class All By Himself", the Night Master is a very powerful and dangerous foe who was responsible for the near extinction of Woo Foo by eliminating all of the Woo Foo knights except for Master Yo. The Sensei managed to turn Night Master's army to stone and sent him into hiding for a hundred years until he tricked Yin and Yang into using Woo Foo in order to free his army. The Night Master appears to be a demonic sorcerer [[bat]] (as such, he hates light) of some description and has a liking for "gothically" ostentatious outfits. The Night Master is very intelligent, though his plans typically fail because of the stupidity of his minions. He is considered to be the actual main villain throughout the series, even though Carl appeared in most of the episodes, while Carl was the main villain since the first season. As revealed in "The Pecking Order", he is one of an eternal line of Night Masters alongside Eradicus and an unnamed cobra-like woman. His real name (since "Night Master" is a title) has not yet been revealed. Ever since his defeat, the other villains have been developing their evil in an attempt to become the new Night Master. Night Master's appearance is similar to Aku of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' fame and [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] from ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''.
**Grizzleflavin (voiced by [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]]) – The gargoyle head that is located at the entrance of Night Masters' lair. He allows anyone that is evil to enter the Night Master's Lair.
**Dank &amp; Dire (voiced by Damon Papadopoulos) – Two dark creatures that are the Night Master's minions.
*{{anchor|Carl the Evil Cockroach Wizard}}Carl the Evil Cockroach Wizard (voiced by Jamie Watson) – A flamboyant [[cockroach]] [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], who frequently seeks an approval of his overbearing dragon-like mother who heavily berates him. He continuously schemes to defeat Yin, Yang, Master Yo and the power of the Woo Foo with his insecure genius. Carl is always trying to find a way to impress his mother and out-do his [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]], selfish brother Herman. Even though Carl and Herman dislike one another, they have worked together on occasion, making a deadly force against Yin and Yang. His dream was to become so enormous that he would blot out the sun, an idea that Herman and the Night Master stole. Carl is an anti-thesis to Yin's magical ability and Yang's goofiness. Carl is stronger than Yin and Yang in power, but if someone criticizes him, he's easily distracted. It is revealed in "Yin Yang Carl" that he could defeat Herman in a fight, if only he used his magic powers.&lt;ref&gt;"Yin Yang Carl. Director: Ted Collyer; Writer: Danielle Koenig, Bart Jennett." '''''Yin Yang Yo!'''''. episode 12. season 2. 2008-04-20. [[Jetix]].&lt;/ref&gt; He has an entry on a [[Online dating service|dating site]]. In the episode "Creeping with the Enemy", Carl is the only villain not recruited into Eradicus' company/secret army Eradicorp because, as according to his mother, cockroach working in a coffee shop would not do well for the business.&lt;ref&gt;"Creeping with the Enemy. Director: Chad Hicks; Writer: Rich Fogel, Bart Jennett." '''''Yin Yang Yo!'''''. episode 28. season 2. 2008-10-27. [[Jetix]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{anchor|Eradicus}}Eradicus (voiced by [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]]) – A mighty [[griffin|Gryphon]] who is bent on destroying Woo Foo. As revealed in "Welcome To The Dark Tomorrow," he is in fact the first and original Night Master. After his demise (of unknown cause), other beings of darkness took on the mantle of evil he left behind including an unknown snake lady and the bat-creature Yin and Yang faced in season 1. His deceased minions posed as the ghosts of the Woo Foo Elders to manipulate Yang into collecting the items of power needed to revive him. Tricking Yang into throwing the items into the Night Master's fireplace at the stroke of midnight, Eradicus was instantly resurrected. Upon his revival, Eradicus revived his minions and started the Dark Tomorrow (turning everyone good evil and everyone evil good). With the combined abilities of Yin, Yang (empowered with the items given to him by the League of Evil), and Yo, Eradicus was defeated and the Dark Tomorrow was reversed. Despite the destruction of the Night Master's lair during the battle, Eradicus was revealed to still be alive in "The Howl Of The Weenie", where he still plans the destruction of the Woo Foo. In "Creeping With the Enemy," he has established Eradicorp, where most of the villain community is working. He appears as the final boss in the online game ''Dangerous Comic Book of Dread''.
** Ella Mental (voiced by [[Linda Ballantyne]]) – A female minion of Eradicus who is a [[Telepathy|mind reader]].
** Rubber Chucky (voiced by Peter Cugmo) – A tall minion of Eradicus has elastic, [[shapeshifting]] body.
** Indestructo-Bob (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) – A slow-witted minion of Eradicus who has indestructible armor.
** Mollecu-Lars (voiced by [[David Berni]] in a German accent) – A small octopus-like minion of Eradicus who can manipulate his molecules to shapeshift, levitate, and regenerate his limbs.
*{{anchor|Brother Herman}}Brother Herman (voiced by [[David Berni]]) - Carl's black hearted, sadistic, selfish and evil ant brother, Herman, is a tyrannical ant warlord who rules his kingdom with an iron fist, a diabolical mind, and impeccable table manners. He attempted to take over the world until Master Yo stopped him.
**Charles – Herman's second-in-command.
*{{anchor|Ultimoose}}Ultimoose (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) – An athletic daredevil moose-like creature with his very own branch of martial arts and originally the Night Master affiliate. He can be described as sexist, masculine, selfish and aggressive yet also obsessive, paranoid in the spirit of [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Denzel Crocker|Denzel Crocker]] from ''Fairly OddParents'' while being perceived by other characters as miserable buffoon. He tends to refer to himself in the third person. His outfit and hairstyle are similar to that of the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Wonder Man]]. He became the new Night Master in "Deja Foo", calling himself the Night Mooster. He became regular Ultimoose again after Yang reversed time, found the Night Master's Amnesulet first, and was aided by the other villains to defeat him. He also collects Yang's hair as revealed in "Yin Yang Who?".
*{{anchor|Smoke}}Smoke (voiced by [[Linda Ballantyne]]) – A hyper-active female with more distinctively anime-like eyes who was, supposedly, Yang's girlfriend until it was revealed to be an elaborate plot for the completion of her quest. Yin and Yang eventually capture the two into Smoke's Prison Prism (spoof of Poké-balls from ''[[Pokémon]]''). She reappears in "League of Evil" as a member of the league alongside Carl, Pondscüm, and The Puffin. She shows an interest in bathroom tidiness and also activities such as serenity trances and East Asian-based meditation in general. Her weapon of choice is a gigantic sword that highly resembles the buster sword used by Cloud Strife in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. Her style and choice of clothing parodies ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (of whom her voice actress voiced in the American dubs of the anime). She also seems to talk really fast and out of sync with her lip movements, further spoofing Japanese animation's [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actors]].
*{{anchor|Mirrors}}Mirrors (voiced by [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]]) – Smoke's rivaled brother. When Smoke uses Yang in the battle tournament, Mirrors obtains Yin to fight her. Yin and Yang managed to use one of the Forever Friend Prisms to imprison Smoke and Mirrors. Mirrors' hairstyle resembles the hairstyle of [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Goku]] from ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and his interest in roses (exploding roses, to be exact) parodies [[James (Pokémon)|James]] from the ''Pokémon'' series. He appears to speak in a way mocking most Japanese voice actors, by stopping and starting at odd intervals. He and his sister's names are a play on words of the metaphor [[smoke and mirrors]]. He and Smoke are shown to have formed a rapport in order to bring Yin and Yang down together, however it doesn't last long as they begin fighting again.
*{{anchor|Yuck}}Yuck (voiced by [[Scott McCord]]) – A turquoise-green slovenly rabbit, is an entity formed from Yin's obsession with control and Yang's aggression. As a repulsive, mutant rabbit, Yuck wants more than anything in the world to be the greatest, most powerful Woo Foo Knight of all time. After he lost his physical form, he was found by the Night Master who built him a robot suit with hands that absorb Woo Foo so he could become real. He dated Yin in disguise and eventually absorbed enough energy to regain his physical form, becoming his own individual being. Yuck has shown himself to be quite intelligent in his convoluted schemes to Yin and Yang. In terms of fighting ability he appears to be as formidable as Yin and Yang put together, being able to take on Yo himself. After a mission into Yo to get an ancient Woo Foo weapon, Yin and Yang break his shrink belt and he shrinks uncontrollably to the point where he is no longer visible. However, he returns a Level 2 Woo Foo Knight when the 2 copies of Yin and Yang copies misuse their "fooplication" charm. He is a Level 2 Woo Foo Knight due to Yin and Yang's title of Level 1 Woo Foo Knights, thus he can use the same moves as both Yin and Yang. Using the charm, Yuck created an army of Yin and Yang "fooplicates". When Yin destroys the charm to erase the "fooplicates", Yuck absorbs their power and becomes Master Yo's level if not more. Unfortunately for Yuck, he also develops a bad case of the hiccups which leaves him unable to control his new powers. He appears to have the power to possess creatures now as well, as he possessed the Headmaster of 'Camp Magic-Pants'. He later returned, cleaned up and trying to be good, saying that a mysterious monk reformed him. His actions were truly noble until the acts of Yin and Yang, who still didn't trust him, prompted Yuck to return to being evil, as he believed Yin and Yang to want all their worst qualities on display to make them look good.
*{{anchor|Zarnot}}Zarnot (voiced by Jamie Watson) – Once Yang's favorite toy, Zarnot is an evil action figure brought to life by the Lie Fairy and later recruited by the Night Master. Due to his common failure, Zarnot was forced into a hated toy box by the Night Master. With the Night Master defeated, Zarnot's status was unknown until "Deja Foo."
*{{anchor|Pondscüm}}Pondscüm (voiced by [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]]) – A street, Swedish, fish inside a robot suit. He is obsessed with "bling-bling", and will get it at all costs. However, he truly carries a Swedish accent. In "Fighting Fooberty," it is revealed that he is a pollywog.
**The Blixens – Pondscüm's female android henchmen. In "Fighting Fooberty," they leave Pondscüm when he turns out to not by a fish but a pollywog. They later returned to him where they have made a new terrarium-type robot suit for him.
*{{anchor|Fastidious}}Fastidious James Spiffington (voiced by [[Mark Bowen (actor)|Mark Bowen]] in a British accent) – A small hamster obsessed with cleanliness and world domination. He is nearly always seen inside a [[hamster ball]] that serves as the control center for his robots, mainly his Hamsterbot. He seems to be a certified attorney.
*{{anchor|Saranoia}}Saranoia (voiced by [[Linda Ballantyne]]) – A powerful sorceress and mistress of disguise. She had a difficult childhood with her father and her lazy brother Mark, which led her to establish strong women's empowerment and [[Feminism|feminist]] views and values. Due to the nature of her obsessive-compulsive behavior and delusional behavior, Saranoia's goal is to terminate Yang's masculine influence on Yin, and also terminate Yang's existence altogether, while heavily pursuing Yin into education. She also mistakes Master Yo as her boy-favoring wizard father, just as she mistakes Yang for Mark. She was condemned to an insane asylum from "The Truth Hurts" to "A Bad Case of the Buglies." Yin and Yang filed a restraining order on her. At this point, she's given up being an evil wizard, has had plastic surgery, and is the spokesperson for Repulsix. When Saranoia takes one of her wands, she takes on a set of characteristics and must abide by the rules of the wand, even if it is against her own will.
**"G.P." (voiced by Damon Papadopoulos impersonating [[Burt Reynolds]]) – A talking gnome-like assistant who is generally reasonable yet indifferent, bland and allows himself to comply in accordance to his boss needs. G.P.'s solo, dark, and aggressive side's debut is in "Party Favors" when he teams up with Flavior and Charles for his own personal gain of crashing Coop's "Welcome Back and Thanks For Saving Everyone From Evil By Banishing The Night Master All By Yourself" party to enter The Night Master's lair with Coop's spare key. He later changes his name to Fr-Ped which is short for "Frightenengly Really Powerful Enraged Doombringer" where he pronounces it as "Fred" with the P being silent.
*{{anchor|Chung Pow Kitties}}Chung Pow Kitties – They are little, furry and adorable kittens who closely resemble characters Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup from ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', but they are generally heartless, antagonistic ninjas and enemies of Yin and Yang. They usually wear dresses pink, purple and green.
*{{anchor|Kraggler}}Kraggler (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) – A gargoyle who is about a "bazillion" years old, Kraggler used to be a great and powerful warrior and Master Yo's arch enemy. Reduced to a feeble old man, after he broke the time traveling hour glass he got the power to drain the youth from anything, or give his age to anything.
*{{anchor|Roger the Skelewog}} – A vicious warrior who is a part-time villain of Yin and Yang. He is the father of Roger Skellwog Jr.
*{{anchor|The Puffin}}The Puffin: A gentleman-dressed puffin. When Yin and Yang start to mistake him for a penguin, Carl cuts him off by stating he's a puffin and that they "can't be sued for a puffin." Puffin is said to had a big advantage in the rain which hasn't been demonstrated. He is a parody of [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] from ''[[Batman]]''.
*{{anchor|Mastermind}}Mastermind (voiced by Peter Cugno) – An evil mittens-wearing wizard who was a big threat years ago. Now he's just a brain in a skull and mittens looking for a body to regain his reign of evil.
*{{anchor|Badfoot}}Badfoot (voiced by [[Orlando Brown (actor)|Orlando Brown]]) – A purple horse who was known as the enemy that Master Yo couldn't beat, appearing only in the episodes "Old Softie" and "The Big Payback". He is supported by his [[horn section]], he dresses like [[James Brown]], and used to carry with him a power item called the Lick-n-Stick. Once a year every year, he come into the city to drain Woo Foo out of Master Yo. When Yin and Yang "fought the funk (even though they had to use it their way)", they managed to aid Master Yo in defeating Badfoot at last, claiming the Lick-n-Stick in the process.
*{{anchor|Manotaur}}The Manotaur (voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]) – A masculine character with hairy hooves and macho aesthetics. He is a large man with a bald head who dresses like a city man. His plan was to kidnap all the Two-ni-corns and to shave off all their hair to make a large wig to cover up his really smooth, bald head to get a date with The Womanotaur. When Yin and Yang reach his lair, it is really his house in a cul-de-sac, Yang uses Man Smash, learned from his comic book hero, U-Dude, and frees the Two-ni-corns. It is revealed throughout the entire episode that he is the only character in the series with five-fingers (noted by his [[Little finger|pinky]] wearing a [[pinky ring]]) He later appears to challenge Yin and Yang to a lifesized board game to win the dojo, whom Master Yo wasn't able to pay the bills Yin and Yang threw away.
*{{anchor|Ranger Ron}}Ranger Ron: – A condescending illiterate&lt;ref name=Beary/&gt; park ranger with the physical appearance of pig, who only appears in the episode "Today You Are a Bear" (season 02, episode 24), where Yin and Yang come to Vincent von Growl's so-called [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bear mitzvah]]. He's openly expressing unreasonable hate and malice against bears, whom he wants to discredit and cause injury to due to various reasons like a bear being his supervisor, one bear "mauling" him while he was the movie theater, bears making go to a 12 item check out when he had 13 items in his cart.&lt;ref name=Beary&gt;"Today You Are a Bear. Director: Mark Ackland; Writer: Sib Ventress." '''''Yin Yang Yo!'''''. episode 24. season 2. 2008-08-18. [[Jetix]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ranger Ron then pranks Yin and Yang after their desire to become Bear mitzvah'd remains unfulfilled. With help from Master Yo and the bear ranger that was Ranger Ron's supervisor, Yin and Yang were able to defeat Ranger Ron.

===Allies===
*{{anchor|Coop}}Coop (voiced by [[Jonathan Wilson (actor)|Jonathan Wilson]]) – A nerdy, shy chicken with a huge crush on Yin. Due to his resentment and Yin's rejection, he joined the Night Master in exchange for the promise to have Yin when the world was taken over. He's presented as a minor villain later in the series where he had powers and abilities rivaling Yin and Yang's. As he turned his back on Night Master and helped Yin and Yang to defeat the Night Master, he completely disappeared from the show, later returning in "The Pecking Order". He was stripped of his Night Master energy that spread across the world, possessing all who ingest it until Coop absorbs a large amount of controlled evil, enough to make him a Night Master. Coop can also enter the Night Master's lair whenever he wants. He has the ability to create a glowing orange-yellow, bird shaped battle aura, which he dubs "Shadow Chicken." While using it, he is powerful enough to defeat even Master Yo. In "Gone-A-Fowl" he starts to lose control of his evil, causing him to become a buff, shades wearing, bad boy version of himself whenever he gets frustrated, reverting to his dorky self when made happy. In this form, he gains the ability to infect others with his evil, causing them to become powered up evil versions of themselves. Before the final battle with Eradicus took place, Coop decided to join the Yin and Yang's Woo Foo Army to fight Eradicus.
*{{anchor|Lina}}Lina (voiced by Novie Edwards) – An aqua-green female dog, Lina is Yang's not-quite-yet girlfriend and crush and Yin's best friend. She is a nice, carefree, confident yet short-tempered girl who lives on a farm with her father. She was first introduced in "Beetlemania", when Yang pretended to be a Woo Foo Warrior in order to impress her, but his plan backfired after he had to fight a giant steel beetle. In "The Yin of Yang", Lina showed some feelings for Yang after he tried to act like Yin in order to get more of her attention. In "Smoke and Mirrors", she actually tried to pursue him, though her attempts were frequently disrupted by Yin. In the episode "Yin Yang You!", it is finally revealed that her species is in fact a dog, though it was believed beforehand that she was a bear. In the episode "Gone-A-Fowl", she and Yang exchange their secret feelings for each other, and begin pursuing a relationship.
*{{anchor|Roger Skelewog Jr.}}Roger Skelewog Jr. (voiced by [[Dwayne Hill]]) – The son of Yin and Yang's part-time enemy, Roger the Skelewog. At first, Roger Jr. was a bully to Yin and Yang, having mock fights with Yang and teasing him and Yin, but, during "Woofoogeddon", it was revealed he longed to be Yang's best friend. Roger Jr., being a prehistory-esque monster, has displayed super strength, such as when he easily took out a whole group of the Night Master's soldiers just by running by them with his arms. He can also breathe fire and launch spikes from his arms. In Season 2, he ultimately becomes friends with Yin, Yang and Lina.
*{{anchor|Dave}}Dave (voiced by [[Dwayne Hill]]) – A magical talking tree stump, Dave is a low-life and is considered pathetic by his friends. Many times, Dave is often caught in the crossfire of battles or hurt in some way by friend and/or foe. He is also whiny, talks nonstop about his family of trees, and is never noticed. As discovered in "Stuck", Dave has the ability to communicate with and manipulate plants. This apparently surpasses that of the other characters.
*{{anchor|Boogeyman}}The Boogeyman – The Boogie Man is a disco-loving green monster, and a friend from Yin and Yang.
*{{anchor|Jobeaux}}Jobeaux (voiced by [[Bill Engvall]]) – A Redneckistanian practicing Woo Foo, while being disliked by his teachers, Yin and Yang, as a stupid, smelly hick. He has a pet armadillo named Fuzzy Thunder that hides in his mouth, giving him a hick accent.

===Minor===
*{{anchor|President Muffin}}President Muffin – He is a goat and the president of the town that Yin and Yang live in.
*{{anchor|Melodia}}Melodia (voiced by [[Megan Fahlenbock]]) – A yellow-green [[aardvark]] who is the princess of the Stink Aardvarks. She is in love with Yang for his filthy ways, and despises all things clean.
*{{anchor|RainbowMane}}RainbowMane (voiced by [[Hadley Kay]]) – RainbowMane is the majestic leader of the Two-ni-corns.
*{{anchor|Lesson}}The Lesson – (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]) The Lesson was once a great and lovable exaggeratedly righteous superhero who stopped the two Bad Habits, who cause people to be overwhelmed with gluttony and laziness. When the two Bad Habits got loose again, The Lesson came to stop them, but the two Bad Habits showed The Lesson. However, after verbal confrontation with the Bad Habits who complained to him, The Lesson realized people were being lazy on their own. The Lesson then tried to rid people of their bad habits, but when they ignored him he tried to pound the lesson into them, literally. His powers include flight and the ability to turn his hands into hammers. He returned where his latest lesson has Yin, Yang, Lina, Melodia, and Dave trapped in a superhero-themed TV show (most of the fake TV show had parodied [[DC Comics]] characters, the home base was a parody on the ''Teen Titans'' tower).

"'They asked if I wanted to work on Bob's show because it was their first [[comedy]]. It was just a match. I'm working with a friend and I'm working with a genre that I love, anime. I don't think anybody's ever done a flat-out tweak on it for comedy purposes. There have been some tongue-in-cheek moments, but nobody's ever said 'We're going to play with this and make it our own," you know? Do to anime what ''[[Seinfeld]]'' did to comedy. "

Although [[Bob Boyle (animator)|Bob Boyle II]] did not animate the series, the animation for the show is instead done by Elliott Animation, a [[Canada|Canadian]] animation studio previously working on the [[Teletoon]] original series ''[[6teen]]''. An extra group of animators come from the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney campus]] of Burbank in [[California]], United States &lt;ref name=Boyl/&gt;&lt;ref name=colds&gt;[http://coldhardflash.com/2006/06/yin-yang-yo-ready-to-go.html Cold Hard Flash: Yin Yang Yo!

Many episodes of ''Yin Yang Yo!'' were directed by Ted Collyer (also director of ''[[Clone High]]''), Chad Hicks (also director of ''[[Total Drama]]'') and John Fountain&lt;ref name=colds/&gt; (as an animator, participated on ''Fairly OddParents'', ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'', while the main established writing force was [[Steve Marmel]] (also executive producer) with the help of Aydrea ten Bosch (''[[ChalkZone]]''), Eric Trueheart (''[[Invader Zim]]''), Sib Ventress ([[Danny Phantom]]). [[Chris Romano]] and Eric Falconer, responsible for [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]'s ''[[Blue Mountain State]]'' and production of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' also participated on the writing of various episodes.

'''''Zuckerkandl!''''' is a comic book published in 1968.  It was written by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and animated by [[John Hubley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/zuckerkandl/oclc/2939 Zuckerkandl!] on WorldCat&lt;/ref&gt;  The book profiles the philosophy of the fictitious Austrian thinker Dr. Alexander Zuckerkandl and satirizes his philosophy of disentanglement. Resembling a fairy tale in form, ''Zuckerkandl!'' has been interpreted as a parody of [[Freud]].  As such, it blames Zuckerkandl and by extension Freud for the ills of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9506/June95Letters.html Letter in the University of Chicago magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic book also has [[Zuckerkandl (animation film)|an animated film version]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ007cIZ3Bc Zuckerkandl!] on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[John Hubley]].
