      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15693">There have been many attempts to ban [[football]], from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in [[England]] in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.&lt;ref name="Women Football and Europe"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9781841262253 | title = Women, Football and Europe: Histories, Equity and Experience | editor1-last = Magee | editor1-first= Jonathan | year = 2007 | publisher = Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport | editor2-last = Caudwell | editor2-first= Jayne | editor3-last = Liston | editor3-first= Kate | editor4-last = Scraton | editor4-first= Sheila  | series = International Football Institute Series | volume = 1  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the [[enclosure act]]. Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

==Mass football in Europe==
Mass or [[mob football]] was popular in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]]. It involved an unlimited number of players and very few rules; the game often caused damage to people and property and was seen as a distraction from more desirable work which led to many attempts at banning the game in Britain and France.

===England===
Complaints by London merchants led King [[Edward II of England]] to issue a proclamation banning football in London on 13 April 1314 because, "...there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."&lt;ref name="Orejan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics |last=Orejan |first=Jaime |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7864-4784-8 |page=18}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 August 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing football was seen as a distraction from practising [[archery]], which was a mandatory occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.416/www/militarytechnology/longbow.html |accessdate=18 August 2013 |title=Engineering the Medieval Achievement - The Longbow |author= Prof. Anne McCants |website=web.mit.edu |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for every Englishman for much of the Middle Ages because archers were so valuable in battle at that time. This led [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] of England to ban football in 1349 and 1477 respectively; the latter stated that, "No person shall practice...football and such games, but every strong and able bodied person shall practice with the bow for the reason that the national defence depends upon such bowmen." &lt;ref name="Orejan" /&gt; [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] also tried to outlaw the sport in 1389, as did  [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1401.

Despite ordering the first known pair of [[football boots]], [[Henry VIII of England]] attempted a ban in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

By 1608, the local authorities in [[Manchester]] were complaining that: "With the ffotebale...[there] hath beene greate disorder in our towne of Manchester we are told, and glasse windowes broken yearlye and spoyled by a companie of lewd and disordered persons ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper20.html International Olympic Academy (I.O.A.) (no date), “Minutes 7th International Post Graduate Seminar on Olympic Studies”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429135712/http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper20.html |date=April 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the word
"football" was used disapprovingly by [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare's play ''[[King Lear]]'' contains the line: "Nor tripped neither, you base football player" (Act I, Scene 4).
Shakespeare also mentions the game in ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'' (Act II, Scene 1):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

"Spurn" literally means ''to kick away'', thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.

King [[James I of England]]'s ''Book of Sports'' (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrejZJVc80C&amp;pg=RA3-PA412&amp;dq=football |title=John Lord Campbell, '&amp;#39;The Lives of the Lords Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England'&amp;#39;, vol. 2, 1851, p. 412 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's aim appears to be an attempt to offset the strictness of the [[Puritans]] regarding the keeping of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/books/hetherington/west_assembly/index.html?mainframe=/books/hetherington/west_assembly/chapter_1a.html#Book%20of%20Sports1618 |title=William Maxwell Hetherington, 1856, '&amp;#39;History of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, Ch.1 (Third Ed.) |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Puritan]]s had some success in suppressing "disorderly" sports including football after the [[English Civil War]]. Players were fined or sentenced to public humiliation in the [[stocks]]. The Mayor of [[York]] fined 11 players 20 [[Shilling (English coin)|shillings]] each when their game resulted in a smashed church window in the winter of 1659-60. The prosecution triggered a violent protest and resulted in over 100 armed men breaking into the Mayor's house; the ringleader was later fined 10 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] or 400 shillings, a very large sum of money at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086166/ |accessdate=18 August 2013 |date=17 December 2003 |title=Historian Reveals that Cromwellian Christmas Football Rebels Ran Riot |publisher=[[University of Warwick]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1468/1468-h/1468-h.htm |last=Macaulay |first=Thomas Babington |authorlink=Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay |title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second |volume=1 |year=1848 |quote=[In 1685] the wages of the common agricultural labourer, from March to September, were fixed at...four shillings a week without food.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Football became even more popular following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The annual [[Scoring the Hales|Shrove Tuesday game]] was first played in 1762 in the streets of [[Alnwick]], and similar games were popular in many towns and villages at the time. The games were typically played in the streets which caused damage to property. A law was passed in 1818 banning street football. This law was ignored in Alnwick until 1827 when the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] provided a field for the game to be played on legitimately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/local-news/it-s-all-kicking-off-at-shrovetide-1-3136609 |title=It’s all kicking off at Shrovetide |date=4 March 2011 |publisher=[[Northumberland Gazette]] |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
[[James I of Scotland]] decreed that ''Na man play at the fut ball,'' in the [[Football Act 1424|Football Act of 1424]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/opposition-to-the-game.html |accessdate=17 August 2013 |title=History of Football - Opposition to the Game |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; a further act of parliament was passed under the rule of [[James II of Scotland|James II]] in 1457 which banned both football and golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/banned/1457-act.html |accessdate=17 August 2013 |title=Acts of Parliament banning golf |publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The French game [[La soule]] is another mass participation ball game similar to the English and Scottish mob football. It was banned by [[Philip V of France|Phillippe V]] in 1319, and again by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1369.

In 1440 the [[bishop of Tréguier]] threatened players with excommunication and a fine of 100 [[French sol|sol]], saying that "these dangerous and pernicious games must be prohibited because of hatred, grudges and enmities which, under the veil of recreational fun, accumulate in many hearts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=576–7 |language=French |title=La soûle en Bretagne et les jeux similaires du Cornwall et du Pays de Galles |trans-title=La soule in Brittany and similar games in Cornwall and Wales |author=L.

==Enclosure Acts==
The [[Inclosure Acts|Enclosure Acts]] placed common land into individual ownership and removed the rights of local people to use the land as they had previously. Football was used as a means to protest this enclosure, and the supposed football game was often a pretext to organise a riot. One such event in Deeping Level, north of [[Peterborough]], led to the sherriff of Lincolnshire raising the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]] to quell the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Heather |last=Falvey |title=Custom, resistance and politics: Local experiences of improvement in early modern England |chapter=Rioting under the guise of football |year=2007 |page=356 |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1143/2/WRAP_THESIS_Falvay2_2007.pdf |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740, "a match of futtball was cried at Kettering, of 500 men a side, but the design was to, "Pull Down Lady Betey Jesmaine's Mill's." In 1764, {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of land was enclosed at [[West Haddon]], Northamptonshire. A game of football was advertised in a local newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northamptonshiretimeline.com/scene/1765-mercury-reports-enclosure-protest/#glossary-48 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |title=1765AD Northampton Mercury Reports Protest Against Enclosures |website=Northamptonshire Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the kick off the mob set about tearing down and burning the fences amounting to £1,500 worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArdle |first=David |title=Football, Society and the Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bdgnlZV-FgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2#v=onepage |accessdate=17 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Cavendish Publishing]] |isbn=1 85941 437 0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street football==
The British [[Highway Act 1835|Highway Act]] of 1835 banned the playing of [[football]] on public highways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm|title=Origins of Rugby|work=Rugby Football History|accessdate=14 April 2010|quote="football for the common man was being suppressed, notably by the 1835 highways act which forbade the playing of football on highways and public land - which is where most games took place"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave a maximum penalty of forty shillings to anyone who "shall play at Football or any other Game on any Part of the said Highways, to the Annoyance of any Passenger or Passengers."&lt;ref&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's football==
English [[Women's football (soccer)|women's football]] matches began in 1895 but following the first international match in 1920, women were banned from all affiliated FA grounds from 1921-71 on the grounds that, "the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23147072 |title=Women's Euros 2013: Women's football's forgotten heroines |accessdate=17 August 2013 |last=Croydon |first=Emily |date=7 July 2013 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Football Association]] did not formally recognise women's football until 1973 after pressure from [[UEFA]].&lt;ref name="Women Football and Europe" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

In 1931 the women's team from [[IF Fløya|Fløya]] in [[Tromsø]] wrote to the [[Norwegian Football Association]] seeking permission to stage a series of fundraising matches. They played the first match before receiving a response: "Ladies should not play football... the ladies could also get injuries that destroyed their reproductive organs. Fløya should therefore not allow or let ladies enter the football field." Further fundraising matches had to be abandoned. Women continued to play football in Norway despite the lack of official recognition, and were accepted into the Norwegian FA in 1976.&lt;ref name="Women Football and Europe" /&gt;{{rp|43–48}}

The [[Iran women's national football team|Iran women's football team]] forfeited an [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics - Women's tournament|Olympic]] qualifying match because the team's [[Islam in association football#Islamic dress code and football|dress code]] mandated wearing of the [[Hijab by country#Iran|maghnaeh]] to cover their heads. FIFA ruled that the kit broke one of their rules and did not let Iran participate, which meant [[Jordan women's national football team|Jordan]] were awarded a 3-0 result for the forfeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-06-06/sports/35234557_1_iranian-women-headscarves-press-tv |title=Olympics 2012: FIFA bans headscarves for Iranian women’s soccer team |accessdate=18 August 2013 |last=Erdbrink |first=Thomas |date=6 June 2011 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2013 Libya's women's football team was banned from playing in an international tournament in Berlin, despite initially being given permission to attend. The Libyan Football Association gave concerns about the need for fasting during Ramadan as the reason for this ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/libya-womens-football-team-banned-ramadan |title=Libya's women's football team banned from major tournament |accessdate=17 August 2013 |last=Stephen |first=Chris |date=19 July 2013 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2994">'''CRS Robotics''' Corporation (currently operating as [[Thermo CRS|Thermo CRS Limited]]) was a robotics company based out of [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. CRS Robotics designed, manufactured, distributed, and serviced human scale articulated robots [[Articulated robot]] and laboratory automation systems. Human scale robots have approximately the same reach, speed, the range of motion, the degree of articulation and lifting capacity as a human being and are designed specifically to perform tasks that are hazardous, highly repetitive or generally unsuited for humans. [[Laboratory Automation]] applications are used to speed the effort of drug discovery for pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers.

CRS Robotics was notable in the field of automated lab systems due to their developments in high throughput and ultra high throughput automated systems.  Among other things, these developments included their advanced scheduling software, called [[POLARA]], which was an open and extensible platform for the management and control of complex automated systems. As an example, a "good portion of the work" for "the preliminary map of the human genetic code was performed on CRS Automated Lab Systems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roboticsonline.com/public/articles/archivedetails.cfm?id=192 Canadian Company Plays Key Role in Human Genome Project - Robotics Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company commenced operations in 1982 as an engineering firm providing consulting services to Canadian machine tool manufacturers in the area of machine controls. The company sold its first robot, the M1 small robot system, in 1985. The company shipped its first [[laboratory automation]] system in 1997.

The company changed its name to CRS Robotics Corporation in 1994. In 1995, the company completed an initial public offering. The company was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In May 2002, the company was acquired 100% by the [[Thermo Electron|Thermo Electron Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/thermo-electron-acquiring-crs-robotics/article18286986/ Thermo Electron acquiring CRS Robotics]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]: [https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=TMO TMO]), and its name was subsequently changed to [[Thermo CRS]]. After the acquisition, the company still continues to develop laboratory automation systems.

[[File:Camera Eats First Examples.jpg|thumb|Photo examples of the "Camera Eats First"]]

'''‘Camera Eats First’''' is the behavior and global phenomenon of people taking photos of their meals with digital or smartphone cameras before they eat, mostly followed by uploading the photos to the [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinkslingerstulc.weebly.com/features/3-reasons-you-should-take-food-picture-before-eat|title=Take Food Picture Before Eating Becomes a Trend|last=Lee|first=Jie Yin|date=1 October 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to how people feed their cameras first by taking photos of their food before feeding themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skypost.hk/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E7%86%B1%E8%A9%B1/20150714/001/%E9%A3%AF%E8%81%9A%E7%9B%B8%E6%A9%9F%E9%A3%9F%E5%85%88%20%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E9%A4%93%E5%A3%9E%E7%84%A1%E7%99%AE/184195|title=飯聚相機食先 朋友餓壞無癮 心理學家:藉分享動態 獲取關注|last=|first=|date=14 July 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from professional [[food photography]] while the behavior of the ‘Camera Eats First’  is generally for personal use such as keeping photographic food diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of commercial purposes. It can also be referred as online food photography, [[food porn]] and photogenic food.[https://www.instagram.com/wingthefoodie/]

== Background ==
[[File:Camera eat first 1.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from Instagram]]
[[File:Camera eats first 2.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from instagram]]One reason for the rise of ‘Camera Eats First’ is the rise of digital convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcfever.com/column/read.php?id=3101|title=相機食先—簡易食物拍法|last=Chan|first=Ivan|date=1 May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global participation in social media is on continual surge with the advancement in technology and commonness of digital devices that serve as mediums for social media. The veteran food photographer of [[The New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Saveur]] magazine Dave Hagerman mentioned that [[Instagram]], contains the most examples of ‘Camera Eats First’ photos. This platform provides a way for people to share and indulge in their common obsession of food globally, thus encouraging taking pictures of food for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, keeping a photogenic food diary is being treated as a form of self representation, showing who they are from what they eat in accordance to the quote of “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” by the French philosopher and gourmand [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]], 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html?_r=1|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
[[File:Camera Eats First 3.jpg|thumb|A post about food using "#foodie" on Twitter]]
The 'Camera Eats First' phenomenon is becoming more common all over the world with the emergence of smartphone and social media. After taking photos of their food, people will usually share the photos on social media such as [https://www.instagram.com/wingthefoodie/ Instagram], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Facebook], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Twitter] and [https://www.pinterest.com/categories/food_drink/ Pinterest]. According to [https://web.stagram.com/?locale=en Webstagram], there are more than 180 million photos with the hashtag #food currently on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://websta.me/hot|title=TOP 100 TAGS|last=|first=|date=|website=WEBSTA|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hashtags such as [[Food porn|#foodporn]] and [[foodie|#foodie]] are often added to these photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/5-top-food-hashtags-and-why-they-work/|title=5 Top Food Hashtags and Why They Work.|last=|first=|date=9 July 2013|website=Hashtag.org|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 90 new photos hash-tagged #foodporn are uploaded to Instagram every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.menulog.com.au/blog/social-media-changing-eat/|title=How Social Media Is Changing The Way We Eat|last=|first=|date=3 September 2014|website=Menulog|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is especially more prevalent among the younger generation. According to a survey done by [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], “54 per cent of 18-24 year olds have taken a photo of their food while eating out, while 39 per cent have posted it somewhere online. This compares with only 5 per cent of over-50s who say they share food snaps on forums such as Facebook and Twitter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/aussies-share-the-food-love-by-posting-pictures-of-meals-on-social-media/story-fneuz8wn-1226637885462|title=Aussies share the food love by posting pictures of meals on social media|last=Wilkinson|first=Simon|date=9 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive Effects ==

=== Increased connection and satisfying psychological needs ===
Through sharing food photos on social media, users can form connections with other people and strengthen interpersonal bonds. Food is always a community event and a bonding experience which can bridge the gap between people and share joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sharing food photos also acts as a  "social glue"  to gather people together to participate in each other's eating experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatist.com/happiness/social-media-food-050813|title=How Social Media Changes The Way We Think About Food|last=Lebowitz|first=Shana|date=8 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the sharing, a private dining experience is turned into a communal bonding activity. People can communicate and share their emotions with others, for example, happiness in a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/news/lifestyles/food-cooking/austin360eats-how-instagram-social-media-food-phot/nc9xy/|title=How Instagram, social media food photography have changed how we eat|last=Broyles|first=Addie|date=6 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people can satisfy the psychological needs of “belongingness and love” and “esteem” according to the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://snipandsharemonkey.tumblr.com/post/129781442196/camera-eats-first|title=CAMERA EATS FIRST|last=Lai|first=Justin|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they can share their experiences and show off to the world what they are eating.

=== Business opportunities ===
Sharing food photos can facilitate people’s obsession with food, but it can also help promote restaurants. Sharing of food photo can be a visual pull that will subconsciously alert people to check out new restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmel Winery]], a restaurant in Israel, gained $400,000 from free promotion by food photos on social media and successfully boosted its sales by 13% owing to the help of “Camera Eats First”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theforkmanager.com/blog/add-instagram-to-your-restaurants-marketing-strategy-and-entice-your-customers/|title=Add Instagram to Your Restaurant’s Marketing Strategy And Entice Your Customers!|last=|first=|date=7 December 2015|website=Thefork Manager A Company Tripadvisor.|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some chefs in Hong Kong would take "food porn" photos and post them on social media because they thought that the "Camera Eats First" phenomenon served as a channel for them to collect feedback from customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-wine/article/1441916/taking-food-porn-photos-hong-kong-so-popular-even-chefs-are|title=Taking 'food porn' photos in Hong Kong is so popular even the chefs are doing it|first=Mischa|publisher=|last1=Moselle|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a vital information for them to make improvements to their dishes.

=== Making food taste better ===
According to a study mentioned on Bit of News,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bitofnews.com/instagramming-your-food-actually-makes-it-taste-better-study-says/|title=Instagramming your food actually makes it taste better, study says|last=Xiao|first=Xu|date=13 March 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking photos of pleasurable food, such as cakes, before eating it can increase the savoring — "the increased anticipation built up from taking photos of the food made it taste better." If people don't take a photo, they may even feel something is missing from the savoring experience.

== Negative Effects ==

=== Infringement of chefs' intellectual property ===
The 'Camera Eats First' behavior was banned in some French restaurants, as diners may infringe upon chefs' [[intellectual property]]. Some French chefs criticized that this behavior would ruin the surprise of future diners, as they might have seen the photos of dishes shared on the internet before coming to the restaurant. Diners posting the photos on social media may give rise to intellectual property disputes about other chefs copying the ideas and presentation of the plates, which are the creative elements contributed by the original chefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|first=Louise|publisher=|last1=Eccles|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impoliteness and worsening relationships ===
The "Camera Eats First" behavior may be considered as an impolite table manner. When diners photograph the food, they may place too much emphasis on the appearance of the food and try to capture the food at its best angle by rearranging tables. It may disrupt other people dining and spoil the enjoyment of their meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|last=Eccles|first=Louise|date=17 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also leave their partners in a state of hunger and impatience. 

On the other hand, while people are busy photographing their food and sharing it online, they will have less time to communicate with their friends and family. One of the functions of [[eating]]—enabling families and friends to gather together and enhance intimacy—is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Camera Eats First" behavior may result in worsening relationships and weakening connection with others in contrast with the positive effect mentioned.

'''The Center for Telehealth &amp; E-Health Law''' ('''CTeL'''), established in 1995 by a consortium including the [[Mayo Foundation]], [[Cleveland Clinic Foundation]], [[Texas Children's Hospital]], and the Mid-West Rural Telemedicine Consortium, is a non-profit organization committed to overcoming legal and regulatory barriers to the utilization of [[telehealth]] and related [[e-health]] services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telehealthlawcenter.org/content/?page=9 Center for Telehealth and e-Health Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218120146/http://www.telehealthlawcenter.org/content/?page=9 |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CTeL, based in Washington, D.C., specializes in compiling, analyzing and disseminating information on legal and regulatory issues information associated with telemedicine. It also handles underlying issues such as licensure and reimbursement. 
 
CTeL briefs public policymakers, writes reports, and provides testimony in support of telehealth.  In its materials, CTeL argues that expanding the use of telehealth can improve patient safety, reduce medical errors, and increase patient access to primary and specialty care in both rural and urban settings. CTeL offers a variety of services, including involvement in public policy.  CTeL activities include:
 
* "Telehealth Leadership Conference" – annual conference dedicated solely to telehealth issues and telehealth advocacy.
* Telehealth Policy Clerkship Program – offered for second and third year law students interested in public policy and legal issues as they apply to advancing communication technologies in the practice of medicine.
* Washington Live! Brown Bag Lunches in Washington, D.C. – monthly seminars on various topics of interest in telehealth and e-health.
* *The National Telehealth Resource Center (NTRC), one of several telehealth resource centers funded through a grant from the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth at the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) in the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrsa.gov/telehealth/granteedirectory/overview.htm HRSA - Telehealth Grantee Directory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104133905/http://www.hrsa.gov/telehealth/granteedirectory/overview.htm |date=January 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, CTeL worked with HRSA's Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) and the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]] to perform an analysis of the use of telehealth in skilled nursing facilities for a report to Congress. This report is titled "Multi-State Telehealth Practice" and summarizes the current state of physician and nurse licensure issues.
* Also in 2004, CTeL was recognized by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]: "[The] progress there has been in resolving such issues can be attributed to a very recent and concentrated effort by such stakeholders as... Center for Telemedicine Law, and the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)." – Innovation, Demand, &amp; Investment in Telehealth, US Commerce Department, Feb. 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52535">'''Clinical mental health counseling''' is a distinct profession with national standards for education, training, and clinical practice.  Clinical mental health counselors operate from a wellness perspective, which emphasizes moving toward optimal human functioning in mind, body, and spirit, and away from distress, dysfunction, and mental illness.  Counselors also view wellness and pathology as developmental in nature, and take into consideration all levels of a client's environment when conducting assessment and treatment. Counselors also frequently take a team approach, collaborating with other mental health professionals to provide the most comprehensive care possible for the client.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.7-8).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical perspectives==

===Early views of mental health and illness===
Early Greek philosophy provides some of the earliest views of mental health and illness.  Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, related behavioral tendencies and a person's temperament to the relative balance of their body fluids.  He believed that imbalances of these fluids led to aberrant behaviors.  Other Greek philosophers such as Plato theorized that aberrant behaviors stemmed from societal issues that required a community response.  Promoting happiness and wellness was also a major theme for the early Greeks and Romans.  The founder of hedonism, Epicurus, advocated for the hedonistic lifestyle, but he also warned that there was a risk of pain if the pleasures were withdrawn. Epictetus, on the other hand, believed that people were not disturbed by things, but by the view they took of those things, so he advocated for peace of mind to treat these disturbances.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"&gt;Gerig, M. S., &amp; Gerig, M. S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: An introduction to the profession (2nd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

There were both cruel and humane treatments developed in the Middle Ages for the mentally ill.  Most behaviors that could not be explained were attributed to supernatural causes and that humans innately had a battle between good and evil happening inside of them all the time.  People were tested to see if they were evil or with the devil using “water tests”.  In Baghdad and Damascus, however, in the ninth and tenth centuries, humane treatments were being developed in which centers of care for the mentally ill were based in love and kindness.  Humanity regressed again in the 16th century when hospitals known as asylums were developed to provide a place for people who were unable to care for themselves.  These institutions were terrible and people were often kept in restraints and left there in their own waste.  In the late 1700s, there were people who began to reform the system and developed something known as moral treatment at the time.  Moral treatment included organized schedules of productive behavior, socializing, entertainment, education, exercise, and nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

===The origins of counseling===
In the early 1900s, counseling had not yet developed into treatment of mental health issues and was more focused in education.  Frank Parsons, known as the father of guidance, developed a plan to educate counselors and began the Vocational Guidance Movement. He was concerned with the problems of youth as youth unemployment became a major concern for adolescents as urbanization occurred and sustainable work and family income generated on family farms was not as prevalent.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;  At this time, counselors were considered vocational counselors and this initiated the approach that began to form the more contemporary counseling process.  Around the same time, Clifford Beers, a former patient of mental health hospitals, wrote a book exposing the terrible conditions of mental health institutions and he advocated for reform.  Beers later founded the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which later became the National Mental Health Association.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;   Jessie B. Davis was the first individual to make guidance a regular part of the school curriculum.  He was a superintendent or administrator and advocated for what became school guidance and counseling.&lt;ref name="Locke, D. C. 2001"&gt;Locke, D. C., Myers, J. E., &amp; Herr, E. L. (2001). The handbook of counseling. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

During the great depression, counseling methods and strategies for employment grew as it was greatly needed at the time.  In 1932, Brewer wrote a book entitled “Education as Guidance”, which promoted the broadening of counseling beyond just occupation.  He suggested that every teacher share the implementation of counseling and that guidance needed to be in every school curriculum.&lt;ref name="Locke, D. C. 2001"/&gt;  In the 1940s, Carl Rogers began the development of counseling and psychotherapy.  He believed that the client knows best and that only they could explain what their needs are and what direction to go in counseling based on what problems were crucial and needed attention.  Rogers clearly indicated that he was not doing psychology and the courses he taught were based in the department of education.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

World War II brought to the forefront the importance of testing and placement as there was a strong need for selection and training of specialists for the military and industry.  Counselors and Psychologists had the necessary skills to fill this much needed role.  At the same time, thousands of soldiers were in need as a result of their combat experiences.  The veterans administration provided professional counseling services to soldiers after their discharge and in 1945, the VA granted stipends and internships for students in counseling and psychology, boosting the support and training available to counselors.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;  This time marked the beginning of government spending on counselor preparation as we know it today.  Clinical psychologists were trained to treat and diagnose individuals with chronic disorders, and counseling psychologists were trained to deal with issues presented by people with high levels of mental health.  This led to a new division or category of psychologists and the Division of Counseling and Guidance of the American Psychological Association changed the title to the Division of Counseling Psychology.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

===The professionalization of mental health counseling===
In the 1950s, flaws in the existing mental health system were being exposed and clinically effective pharmacological treatments were also being developed that could be provided in outpatient settings. This led to a need for community based clinics, but access to these services were very limited.  The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was very important in the development of the counseling profession.  After the government analyzed the problems with mental illness and effective treatments, President John F. Kennedy believed that high quality treatment centers located in the patients community could lead to the phasing out of state mental hospitals and drastically improve the mental health system in the United States.  The national network of community mental health centers created a demand for counselors and the profession began to expand and increase numbers of counselors.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

As the counseling helping profession grew, there became a need to regulate the quality of services being provided by professionals via state licensure.  In 1974, a special committee was appointed by the [[American Personnel and Guidance Association]] that focused on counselor licensure.  This began the steps towards the first counselor licensure law in Virginia in 1976.  In the 1980s mental health counseling had clearly established itself as a profession with a distinct set of regulations and methods to providing services.  According to Gerig &amp; Gerig (2014), distinct professional are characterized by “role statements, codes of ethics, accreditation guidelines, competency standards, licensure, certification, and other standards of excellence”.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M. S. 2014"/&gt;  The counseling profession as we know it today has established all of these facets of a distinct profession and is being recognized more and more as a valuable and much needed helping profession in our society.

== Education, licensure, and certification ==

===Licensure===

Counselor licensure is established by state law and is the most powerful type of credential.  Receiving a license in counseling indicates that one has met the minimum standards to practice counseling in that state.  State laws vary in the requirements that must be met to obtain a license.  Candidates must have at least received a master's degree, have had post-master's supervised practice, and have passed a national exam.  From state to state, the number of credit hours to be completed varies, as do the number of supervised hours that must be completed and the counselor titles used.  Some counselors may find that if they are licensed in one state, and then move to another state, they may have to take additional courses in order to receive licensure in that state.&lt;ref name="Remley 2010 pp. 29-36"&gt;Remley, Jr., T.P., &amp; Herlihy, B. (2010). Ethical, legal, and professional issues in counseling. (3rd ed.). (pp. 29-36). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Below, the standards for licensure in North Carolina are described.  In order to explore licensure requirement for other states, please refer to the [http://www.nbcc.org/directory National Board of Certified Counselor’s state licensure board directory] and locate the information for the licensure board in your particular state.

Retrieved from http://www.nbcc.org/directory&lt;/ref&gt; prior to completing licensure requirements, a graduate of a master's program is known as a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate (LPCA).  After being licensed by the state, the counselor is known as a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).

According to Remley and Herlihy,&lt;ref name="Remley 2010 pp. 29-36"/&gt; there are two national certification agencies for the counseling profession.  These are the [National Board for Certified Counselors] (NBCC) and the [Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC)].  The NBCC also offers specialty certifications.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 118-121"&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 118-121). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The information regarding the certifications provided by the NBCC is outlined below.

==Professional organizations==
Professional organizations exist to serve many different functions. They provide an assembly for professionals to gather to discuss issues and problems that exist within the profession. Organizations allow the members of a profession to address issues as a group rather than facing these issues independently. Professional organizations provide an outlet for legislative activity and leadership regarding particular issues that affect the profession at all levels. Continuing education is a critical requirement for members of a profession as it ensures that all professionals’ skills and expertise are continuously updated to reflect the most current research and recommendations; professional organizations provide this continuing education to its members. These organizations also assist in keeping professionals up-to-date by providing scholarly journals, books, and media resources to its members. Lastly, professional organizations publish and enforce a code of ethics for its members.&lt;ref&gt;Remley, Jr., T.P., &amp; Herlihy, B. (2010). Professional associations of counseling. Ethical, legal, and professional issues in counseling. (pp. 41-45). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following professional organizations are the primary ones available to those within the clinical mental health counseling profession.

===American Counseling Association (ACA)===
[[American Counseling Association]] is “a not-for-profit, professional and education organization that is dedicated to the growth and enhancement of the counseling profession”.&lt;ref&gt;About ACA.(n.d.). In American Counseling Association. Retrieved from http://counseling.org/about-us/about-aca&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in Alexandria, VA, with 56 chartered branches in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, it was founded in 1952 and is noted to be the world's largest association that exclusively represents professional counselors in a variety of practice settings. ACA is divided into 20 divisions that are tailored to specialized areas and/or principles of counseling. ACA has membership available for all stages of the counseling profession from student to retirees. In addition to the professional and advocacy benefits, ACA also offers its members discounts on malpractice liability, auto, home, and personal insurance products; prescription, lab, and imaging services, and discounts from industry leaders in hotel, travel, credit cards, as well many other consumer services. Members can choose to additionally join one or more of the 20 divisions, which offer their own unique professional benefits. One of these divisions, American Mental Health Counselors Association, is integral to the field of clinical mental health counseling.

====American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA)====
[[American Mental Health Counselors Association]] is made up of more than 7,000 clinical mental health counselors. Its mission is “to enhance the profession of clinical mental health counseling through licensing, advocacy, education, and professional development”.&lt;ref&gt;About AMHCA.(n.d.). In American Mental Health Counselors Association. Retrieved from http://www.amhca.org/about/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Like ACA, clinical mental health counselors at all stages of their professional journey, including students, are eligible to join AMHCA. Member benefits also include professional liability insurance plan discounts, continuing education opportunities, networking via AMHCA's annual conference, and a quarterly journal with the latest clinical mental health counseling research.

===National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC)===
[[National Board for Certified Counselors]] is a not-for-profit, independent certification organization that was established in 1982. Its primary purposes are “to establish and monitor a national certification system, to identify those counselors who have voluntarily sought and obtained certification, and to maintain a register of those counselors”.&lt;ref&gt;About NBCC.(n.d.). In National Board for Certified Counselors. Retrieved from http://www.nbcc.org/Footer/AboutNBCC&lt;/ref&gt; NBCC has four voluntary certifications, the National Certified Counselor (NCC), Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselor (CCMHC), National Certified School Counselor (NCSC), and Master Addictions Counselor (MAC). The NCC and MAC are both accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). Obtaining National Counselor Certification (NCC) through NBCC, though not required, has many professional benefits including showing the public and employers that you have voluntarily met high national standards for the practice of counseling. Additionally, NCCs receive a number of other benefits including access to low-cost liability insurance, the ability to market oneself using the certification, a free six-month listing in the Therapy Directory, continuing education credit, among others. The fees that are paid for certification go towards supporting NBCC's advocacy efforts for the counseling profession.

== Working environments ==

=== Community Mental Health Agency ===
This type of counseling setting generally provides a wide array of services, especially depending on particular populations served, as well as geographical setting. Services may include, but are not limited to: individual, family, and group outpatient talk therapy; twenty-four-hour crisis intervention, or mobile crisis management; rape, sexual abuse, and domestic violence services; testing and assessment for career interests, and broader mental health issues; community psychoeducation and outreach; day treatment (for mentally ill and/or developmentally disabled); intensive in-home treatment; jail diversion programs; and case management.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 176-177). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of insurance, some agencies are able to take both private (Blue Cross/Blue Shield, United Healthcare, etc.) and governmental (Medicaid, Tricare) policies. Regarding governmental insurance, this type of coverage is dependent on whether or not the specific agency is approved for federal and/or state funding. When it comes to serving Medicare-covered clients, counselors in the U.S. are still exempt from the list of acceptable providers, thus it is a current issue of great concern in our community. For private policies, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the agency must secure a placement on the insurance company's provider panel, again no small task. It is also common for community agencies to respect uninsured clients, or clients facing financial hardship, by operating on a sliding scale, or payment plan.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kirstner, personal communication, October 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private practice ===
Although private practices are common in the American mental health counseling community, a licensed counselor often enters this kind of setting after several formative, professional years have passed, following completion of a master's degree program. Before making the transition into the private setting, many therapists work for a larger community-based agency, hospital, or treatment facility. The advantages certainly include, but are not limited to: an independence in providing therapy; the ability to be more selective when it comes to the clientele and population(s) served; and incorporating unique skills and special training, such as play therapy, EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), etc.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 177-178"&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 177-178). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the act of operating a private practice is akin to running a small business. In order to prosper, it is crucial for the counselor to have proper business and public representation skills. In deciding to hang a shingle, one must be prepared to establish and maintain a respectable presence in his or her community, oftentimes promoting awareness (and thus one's business) on one's own time. Awareness activities include visiting places of worship, community centers, local businesses, etc. to perform psychoeducation workshops.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 177-178"/&gt;
As described in the previous section of Community Mental Health Agencies, the same standards of insurance coverage, as well as sliding scale payment, apply to private practice settings. A big difference, however, independent counselors are often responsible for processing their own billing, if they do not have an administrative assistant.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 177-178"/&gt;

=== Alcohol and substance abuse treatment programs (residential and outpatient) ===
In this mental health setting, there are many commonalities shared with the more overarching community agencies. Both environments encompass similar services, such as: individual, family, and group outpatient counseling; twenty-four hour crisis intervention; day treatment for mentally ill and/or developmentally disabled clients; and case management.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 178-179). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Although alcohol/substance abuse programs have an obvious focus on recovery and rehabilitation, counseling services also apply to assisting in comorbidity, or dual diagnoses (e.g. bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence). Recovery programs provide specialized group counseling sessions for clients dealing with comorbidity, for gender-specific clientele, and for clients receiving methadone treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adsyes.org/treatment-services/]&lt;/ref&gt;
Clients may enter treatment through self- or family-referral. More often than not, the majority are ordered to participate in a recovery program by a judge in Drug Court, on account of criminal charges pertaining to drunk driving, possession of illegal substances, etc. The majority of clients receive funding through Medicaid or the state, but private insurance can also be accepted. Both outpatient and residential services last an average of thirty to ninety days. Due to this seemingly brief span of time for treatment, counselors strongly encourage their clients struggling with addiction(s) to become regular attendees of local AA and/or NA meetings, and to obtain a sponsor as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daymarkrecovery.org/index.php/services]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University or college counseling center ===
This counseling setting is typically based within a school's wellness or health center, directly on campus. Ordinarily, there are an average of eight to ten free sessions allocated to every student for each academic year, with each session lasting roughly one hour. It is not uncommon for a client's appointments to occur once every two to three weeks, as the counseling staff serve hundreds to even thousands of students per semester. That being said, therapists in this type of employment setting can enjoy, but should be prepared for, an extreme variety of mental health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 179-181). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The clientele are principally both traditional young adult, and adult students. College and university counseling staff assist students within a broad scope of subject matter, “such as depression, anxiety, self-mutilation, eating disorders, posttraumatic disorders, and self-esteem issues”.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 179"&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp. 179). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The strictly designated number of sessions for each student is designed to make the therapy process temporary and brief. However, if a client reveals a more severe mental disorder, the staff are responsible for referring the individual to specialized services in the community.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 pp. 179"/&gt;

==Theoretical orientations to counseling==
Counseling theories are interrelated principles that describe, explain, predict, and guide the actions of the counselors within different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M. S. (2014). Foundations for Clinical Mental Health Counseling: An Introduction to the Profession, 2nd ed, p. 54. Boston: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt; The use of theory provides a tool for counselors to use in order to identify important aspects of and clearly organize a client's story or narrative. These integrated systems are evaluated by multiple criteria: precision and clarity, comprehensiveness, testability, utility, and heuristic value.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M. S. (2014). Foundations for Clinical Mental Health Counseling: An Introduction to the Profession, 2nd ed, pp. 55-6. Boston: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling theories can be classified into four distinct categories: analytic, humanistic-existential, action-based, and postmodern/multicultural approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytic approaches===
#Psychodynamic theory, or [[psychodynamics]], involves personality and how it can be analyzed in order to more fully understand the client's presenting problem and quality of life. Both psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches to counseling include analyzing or conceptualizing personality, developing and fostering insight on behalf of the client, and then using those insights to create interventions or take action.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 45. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jungian analytic theory is based on the idea of a collective unconscious, which is a storing of history, stories, fairy tales, and other experiences that make up the psyche which, in turn, can be used in therapy for psychological healing.&lt;ref name="Gehart, D. 2013 p. 69"&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 69. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of counselors who utilize this theory is to combine the conscious and unconscious aspects of the self in order to foster a connection with the universe that is whole and complete.&lt;ref name="Gehart, D. 2013 p. 69"/&gt; See also [[Analytical psychology]].
#Adlerian [[individual psychology]] is used by counselors who believe that each individual develops their own style of life, which helps to make sense of the world around them. Adlerian counselors direct their clients to choose a new lifestyle when the old is faulty or no longer serves its purpose for the client. This approach is brief and directive, with the aim of helping clients develop insight and self-understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 88. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanistic-existential approaches===
#Person centered is an extremely influential theory in counseling. The founder of this theory, Carl Rogers, stated that three conditions are necessary and sufficient for therapeutic change to occur: a) congruence or genuineness, b) accurate empathy, and c) unconditional positive regard.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 117. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; Now many counselors would consider therapeutic presence to be one of those necessary conditions as the goal of [[person centered therapy]] is to allow clients to become more fully themselves and experience this through the counseling relationship.
#Existential theory focuses on the meaning of life, identity crises, confronting aloneness, and other anxieties involving “big picture” ideas. Counselors who utilize [[existential therapy]] focus on existential roots and emphasize the idea that human beings are ultimately responsible for the choices they make and the actions they take.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 146. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Gestalt theory involves helping clients become aware of their true self. This includes present moment awareness with self and environment. [[Gestalt therapy]] techniques include active and experiential methods and the main goal of this approach to counseling is a reintegration of the self, including parts that have been metaphorically cutoff.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 161. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action-based approaches===
#Behavioral approaches to counseling include techniques such as classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning theory. [[Behavior therapy]] oriented counselors tend to conduct their interventions on behaviors that are both observable and measurable.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 171. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Cognitive-behavioral theory combines both cognitive and behavioral approaches to counseling. In addition to [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], there are numerous other forms of this approach including [[Multimodal therapy]], [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]], [[Reality therapy]], and [[Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 182. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;
#Systemic/family approaches to counseling focus on the importance of the larger relational system, such as the family of origin, family of procreation, and other societal groups and communities. Counselors who utilize this theory view client's presenting problems as related to the systems that they are involved in and view symptoms with a neutrality in order to help clients create new relational patterns within [[family therapy]] and systemic therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 220. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodern and multicultural approaches===
#Solution based counseling theory is related to systemic family counseling and involves encouraging clients to make small consistent changes in their lives. Solution based theory views the counselor and clients are collaborators in order to create goals and bring about measurable change.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 254. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory involves [[solution focused brief therapy]] and it utilized in schools, and managed care environments, among other time-limited environments.
#Feminist theory is often misinterpretation as being used by counselors who work only with female clients. However, this theory focuses on multiple aspects of identity, such as gender, culture, race, sexual orientation, to name a few. Feminist theory counselors hold the belief that human beings seek connections with others in order to establish growth. This theoretical orientation labels disconnection as the root of the client's presenting problems and the ultimate goal of [[feminist therapy]] is to create growth-fostering relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 320. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;
#Narrative theory involves the idea that each individual operates from a dominant discourse, which is the societal expectations by which human beings live. The purpose of [[narrative therapy]] is to focus on separating the person from the problem and guiding clients to choose alternative ways to act and interact with others throughout their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 284. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;
#Collaborative theory is an approach that involves counselor and clients working together to explore and create an understanding of the presenting problems. Counselors with this theoretical orientation use the [[collaborative therapy]] technique of mutual puzzling, which is shared inquiry of discovering how the problem occur and also how to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 298. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Reflecting teams are not so much a theory as they are a technique utilized by postmodern counselors. Guidelines for reflecting teams are as follows: client must give permission, client can choose to listen or not to listen to the teams’ conversation, conversation should focus on what is seen or heard, conversation should stem from a questioning, speculative perspective, the reflecting team should not address the client or clients directly, and the reflecting team should listen for what is appropriately unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Gehart, D. (2013). Theory and Treatment Planning in Counseling and Psychotherapy, p. 310. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics in counseling ==

A code of ethics contains standards of behavior or practice that are agreed upon as acceptable by professionals within a given field.  There are multiple ethical codes within the field of counseling that counselors are expected to abide by within their work and professional role.  These codes are then enforced by ethics committees and licensure boards.  A violation of code may lead to a number of consequences, dependent upon the severity of the violation, and varying in such: one might be placed on probation, suspended, or even have their license revoked.&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;Remley, Jr., T. P., &amp; Herlihy, B. (2010). ''Ethical, legal, and professional issues in counseling'' (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

While law clarifies a profession's scope of practice, ethics are important to each profession for a number of reasons.  Not only do codes of ethics provide standards to which members of the profession are held accountable, but they also aid in the improvement of provided services.  Ethical codes promote professionalism, and provide evidence of the intent of members within a profession to regulate and moderate their behavior.  They assist in identifying appropriate courses of action for situations that arise without clear and easy resolution.  Also, while ethical codes cannot be entirely preventative, they protect consumers from dangerous and/or inappropriate practice.  Different professional organizations within each field may have their own personal code of ethics as well, such as the American Counseling Association and the American Mental Health Counselors Association in the profession of counseling.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Gerig, M. S. (2014). ''Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: An introduction to the profession'' (2nd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been concluded that ethics encompasses five different features: possessing adequate knowledge, skills, and judgment to produce effective interventions; respecting the dignity, freedom, and rights of the client; using power inherent in the counselor's role judiciously and responsibly; conducting oneself in such a way that promotes the public's confidence in the profession; maintaining the client's welfare as the highest priority of the mental health professional,î.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;  Similarly, six different principle ethics are often considered as crucial to take into account when faced with an ethical decision: the principle of autonomy, which relates to the client's right to control their own life, decisions, future, etc.; nonmaleficence, which translates to doing no harm to the client; somewhat oppositely, beneficence, which means doing good for or promoting the welfare of your client; justice, referring to fairness and equality on the part of the professional; fidelity, which requires the professional to fulfill a responsibility of faithfulness and trust; and veracity, which means being truthful and honest with clients.&lt;ref name="RH" /&gt;

The newest 2014 edition of the American Counseling Association's Code of Ethics contains nine sections that each address a separate area of ethical conduct: the counseling relationship; confidentiality and privacy; professional responsibility; relationships with other professionals; evaluation, assessment, and interpretation; supervision, training, and teaching; research and publication; distance counseling, technology, and social media; and resolving ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;American Counseling Association (2014). ACA Code of Ethics. Alexandria, VA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief description of some of these predominant realms follows.

=== Confidentiality ===

Confidentiality refers to the respect of a client's privacy.  Any information that a client reveals during counseling is protected.  The client's consent is required for the reveal of information to a third party.  Laws of privileged communication within applicable states also further protect the privacy of clients.  Where privileged communication is present, confidential information does not need to be disclosed in court without the client's permission.  Confidentiality is crucial to create the safety, trust, and honesty required in an effective, beneficial counseling relationship.  Outside of privileged communication, there are generally four instances in which confidential information may be released to a third party: if the client allows the counselor to do so with a signed release of information, if the client discloses or is suspected to be an imminent threat of safety or danger to self or others, if current abuse or the intent of abuse of another is disclosed, or if a court order or subpoena requires the release of client records or testimony of the counselor.&lt;ref name="RH" /&gt;

=== Competence ===

This concept of competence requires proof of minimum competency for a professional, while also striving to practice in an ideal manner.  For each credential that a counselor earns, such as a degree and licensure, there are minimum prerequisites of performance that must be met.  A counselor may also be competent or incompetent in different types of counseling, working with different populations, or specializing in different theoretical orientations.  Competency also needs to be maintained over time and should be self-monitored.  Counselors should continue to access and review current research, and continuing education credits can be earned through workshops, seminars, webinars, etc.  When this ethical concept is not maintained, a counselor may be risking professional misconduct, and may even face trial for malpractice.&lt;ref name="RH" /&gt;

=== Informed consent ===
{{Main|Informed consent}}
Informed consent is typically addressed through a form at the beginning of a counseling relationship, and pertains to the client's right to be aware of the nature of that relationship and the counseling process itself.  Informed consent should be present throughout the entire period that a client is receiving services.  This information should be presented both in written form, and discussed verbally with the client.  A professional disclosure statement is typically provided to the client, which should include but is not limited to: counselor credentials, issues of confidentiality, the use of tests and inventories, diagnosis, reports, billing, and therapeutic process,î.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

=== Professional boundaries ===
{{Main|Professional boundaries}}
There are multiple boundaries that could be crossed between a client and a counselor, including physical, psychological, emotional, and social boundaries.  Some of these boundary lines may be blurry. For example, there are differing opinions on whether touch is ever appropriate between a counselor and their client.  Sexual intercourse, however, is generally uniformly disagreed upon.  Dual relationships, where a counselor holds two or more different roles within a client's life at the same time, are also typically avoided, as well as the acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

==Then and now==
Many Community mental health (CMH) specialists operate under the holistic philosophy that in order to reach optimal health and wellness [[Mental health professionals]] must look not only at the individual but also at the interacting communities and environment that surrounds that individual. The principal philosophy is no longer removing the disordered person from normal family, social and community settings into a sheltered institutionalized environment but rather to a community-based treatment center for support and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.259-270).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important dates and figures such as [[Dorothea Dix]] in 1843 and the [[National Mental Health Act]] of 1946 brought attention to the living situations of the mentally ill and the need for financial funding and more appropriate programs.  In 1963 the [[Community Mental Health Act]] provided federal funding for CMH services.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (pp.259-261).
Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the development of available economic resources, a supply of mental health professionals and multidisciplinary team approaches mental health has been deinstitutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.250-270).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMH is now in the era of post [[deinstitutionalization]].  The rates of psychiatric patients treated in inpatient facilities have declined and the shift has turned to more cost-effective alternatives.  New techniques and models are used to provide care for people that formerly would have been sent to in patient treatment.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.260"&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.260).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Least restrictive treatment environment===
The idea behind the least restrictive treatment environment is to match the treatment's intensity with the severity of the client's condition so that restrictions to client personal freedom are minimal. This has been achieved by decreasing the clients’ average lengths of stay in hospitals and emphasizing stabilization instead of intense therapy.  Once stabilized, clients are released to the care of community-based agencies and practitioners for outpatient treatment plans.  However, a phenomenon revolving door occurs when patients are admitted, stabilized, released and then readmitted many times over a short period.  Strong communication networks between mental health providers and the hospital must be utilized to help with the revolving–door phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.260"/&gt;

===Case management models===
Case management models help clients coordinate their schedule while integrating various community services. One of the most comprehensive case management model approaches is the [[Assertive community treatment]] approach.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.260"/&gt;

====Assertive community treatment====
In the ACT approach, a team of professional counselors, social workers, nurses, rehabilitators and psychiatrists provide comprehensive, community-based treatment and support to clients.  The team's caseload is small and the responsibility is shared among team members.  Services may include medication delivery, rehabilitation, and behavioral training in basic adaptive living skills, problems of nonattendance and transportation needs.  It also includes 24-hour emergency services, medication management, money management, and assistance with daily living .&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.267-271"&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.267-271).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The recovery and consumer movement===
This is the belief that mental health consumers should be able to develop control of treatment and end oppressive stigmas.  Results of this movement include consumer-developed systems of care, self-help groups, consumer advocacy organizations and the recovery perspective.&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.267-271"/&gt;

Support groups like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) have increased from around 50 in 1942 to well over 58,000 in 2012.  Parents without Partners (PWP) started in 1957 with one group of two women and is now the world's largest nonprofit membership organization.  Formed in 1976, the National Self-Help Clearinghouse now communicates information about the activities of more than 500,000 self-help groups that now exist in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, A. H. (1993).  Self-help in America: A social movement perspective.  New York, NY: Maxwell Macmillan International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, B.J., &amp; Madara, E.J. (2002).  The self-help group sourcebook: Your guide to community and online support groups (7th ed.).  Cedar Knolls, NJ: American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI) is a self-help support group and advocacy organization that consists of over 1,000 local affiliates and 50 state organizations.  NAMI advocates for increased funding for research, housing, jobs, rehabilitation, and suitable health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. (2005, February 16). About NAMI. About_NAMI/About_NAMI. htm Retrieved from http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Inform_Yourself/National Assessment of Adult Literacy.  (2003).  Key findings. Retrieved March 15, 2012, from http://nces.ed/gov/naal/kf_demographics.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the recovery perspective in community mental health is changing the underlying philosophy of what is means to be mentally ill.  The U.S. government's [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) defines recovery as “a journey of healing and transformation enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice with striving to achieve his or her full potential.”&lt;ref&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2006). (p.1) National consensus statement on mental health recovery.  Retrieved from http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA05-4129/SMA05-4129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ten fundamental components of recover philosophy are: 1) Self-Direction'',  2)'' Person-Centered'', 3) ''Empowerment'', 4) ''Holistic'', 5) ''Non-linear'', 6) ''Strength-based'', 7) ''Peer Support'', 8) ''Respect'', 
9) ''Responsibility'', and 10) ''Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2006). (pp.1-2) National consensus statement on mental health recovery.  Retrieved from http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA05-4129/SMA05-4129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the recovery consumers of mental health care are viewed as capable and responsible persons who can take charge and manage his or her condition. Wellness strategies are implemented in recovery work such as journaling, visiting friends, exercising, nutritious eating, praying, meditation, doing acts of kindness, and practicing gratitude.  Consumers in recovery that offer service to their peers in mental health treatment are called [[Peer support specialist]].  They often help connect consumers with mental help professionals and are usually trained to counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). Foundations for clinical mental health counseling: an introduction to the profession. (2nd ed.). (p.270-271).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence based treatment===
Many health professionals argue that counseling is as much art as it is science. Though some might find science-based outcome studies to be not particularly helpful evidence-based treatments are sometimes mandated.  This is because professional organizations, third party reimbursers and consumers want more attention given to quality control and accountability .&lt;ref name="Gerig, M.S. 2014 p.267-271"/&gt;

Evidence based treatment is typically a study in which a particular treatment produce change, which was evident in randomized controlled trials, in comparison with another approach or not treatment at all.  SAMHSA has developed the [http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices].  This database provides summaries, target populations, types of outcomes achieved, costs, and expert ratings. Other [[Evidence-based practice]] studies and research are used in community counseling to ensure treatment is effective.&lt;ref&gt;Gerig, M.S. (2014). (p. 271).

The '''Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa''' ('''DENOSA''') is a [[trade union]] in [[South Africa]] that describes itself as "a voluntary organisation for South African nurses and midwifery professionals".&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.denosa.org.za/Membership.php?id=357|website=Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa|publisher=DENOSA|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
DENOSA was established in its current form on 5 December 1996.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.denosa.org.za/About.php?id=339|website=Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa|publisher=DENOSA|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DENOSA is an affiliate of the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU) and became a full member of the [[International Council of Nurses]] on 15 June 1997. The union suspended its participation in the leadership structures of COSATU on 10 November 2014 as a result of the federations expulsion of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) on 7 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More unions quit Cosatu's exec body|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Labour/News/More-unions-quit-Cosatus-exec-body-20141110|website=fin24|publisher=24.com|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its 2010 congress, DENOSA passed a resolution that the DENOSA National Executive Committee should proceed with the merger with the [[South African Democratic Nurses' Union]] (SADNU).&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

DENOSA has set up numerous projects with the aim of improving healthcare in South Africa. These mainly consist of workshops to educate nurses on [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://www.denosa.org.za/Projects.php?id=341|website=Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa|publisher=DENOSA|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disseminated disease''' refers to a diffuse [[disease]]-process, generally either [[infectious disease|infectious]] or [[neoplastic]]. The term may sometimes also characterize [[connective tissue disease]].

A disseminated infection,for example, has extended beyond its origin or nidus and involved the bloodstream to "seed" other areas of the body. Similarly, one can view [[metastatic cancer]] as a disseminated infection in that it has extended into the [[bloodstream]] or into the [[lymphatic system]] and thus "seeded" distant sites (a process known as [[metastasis]]).

Disseminated disease is often contrasted with [[localized disease]].

In the early hours on the morning of June 8, 2017, employees at a [[Weis Markets]] [[supermarket]] in [[Eaton Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Eaton Township, Pennsylvania]], were stocking and closing the store for the night. Shortly before 1:00 a.m., 24-year-old Randy Stair barricaded the exits of the store and proceeded to shoot and kill three of his co-workers before shooting himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wnep.com/2017/06/08/victims-shooter-identified-in-weis-markets-murder-suicide/|title=Victims, Shooter Identified in Weis Markets Murder-Suicide|date=2017-06-08|website=WNEP.com|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shooting ==
Randy Stair, 24, arrived for his late-night shift at [[Weis Markets]] in [[Eaton Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Eaton Township, Pennsylvania]] (just south of [[Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania|Tunkhannock]]), on the evening of June 7, 2017, during closing time at approximately 11:00 p.m. Stair went to the back of the store to the crew area and blocked an [[emergency exit]] at the far back of the store. He then continued with his duties, stocking shelves and cleaning up from the previous day. At 12:10 a.m., he sent out links to multiple files and videos which detailed his plans via his [[Twitter]] account; these files were labeled "Journal", "Suicide Tapes", and "Digital set".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.syracuse.com/us-news/index.ssf/2017/06/weis_market_shooting_randy_stair_murder_suicide_pa.html|title=Weis Market shooting: 4 dead in murder-suicide at Pennsylvania supermarket|work=syracuse.com|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oberhaus|first1=Daniel|last2=Maiberg|first2=Emanuel|title=Why Isn't Twitter Deleting the Weis Market Shooter's 'Suicide Tapes'?|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-isnt-twitter-deleting-the-weis-market-shooters-suicide-tapes|accessdate=June 22, 2017|work=Motherboard|date=June 12, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Jessica|title=Randy Stair: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/06/randy-stair-weis-market-shooting-shooter-tunkhannock-pennsylvania-victims-photos-facebook/|accessdate=June 22, 2017|work=[[Heavy.com]]|date=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stair then went back to the crew area in the rear of the store, blocked the remaining exits, then locked the [[automatic door]]s at the main entrance to the store. He then pulled out two [[pistol grip]] [[pump-action shotgun]]s and walked around the store and killed three employees—Victoria Brong, Brian Hayes, and Terry Lee Sterling. He then approached another coworker, Kristan Newell, who had not heard the shooting due to her listening to music with headphones on while she was labeling items and stocking shelves near the rear of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/witness-describes-supermarket-shooting-in-wyoming-county-1.2204208|title=Witness describes supermarket shooting in Wyoming County|last=WRITER|first=BY JOSEPH KOHUT, STAFF|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stair was seen on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] surveillance camera footage standing behind Newell as she worked for about five seconds before she proceeded to the next aisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/dead-murder-suicide-weis-market-northeast-pa-article-1.3230758|title=Worker who posted violent online cartoons kills three, self|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Stair proceeded to fire at a glass and other merchandise in the store and shot multiple small portable [[propane tank]]s, which failed to explode. Around this time, Newell took off her headphones; hearing the gunshots, she hid in the crew room and called [[9-1-1]]. After a short time, Stair finished shooting items. Stair went to the [[Delicatessen|deli]] section of the store, placed the shotgun in his mouth, and committed suicide. A total of 59 shots were fired. All [[Shotgun shell|shotgun rounds]] came from only one of the shotguns. Randy stated in his fifth "Suicide Tape" that the second shotgun was only for backup in case the first one "breaks down on [him] or jams, and [he has] no way of fixing it". He said he needed at least one of the shotguns to be functional in order to commit suicide.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Randy Robert Stair (September 17, 1992 – June 8, 2017), who called himself Andrew Blaze, worked at [[Weis Markets]] for seven years prior to the shootings. He had kept detailed videos, recordings, and journals leading up to the shooting, most of which he uploaded to online forums and [[social media]] profiles just prior. In these writings and videos, he expressed his willingness to commit [[suicide]], addressed the personal tragedies and other misfortunes he experienced which led him to a state of depression, described coming to the conclusion that he was [[transgender]] after years of secretly [[cross-dressing]], and explained his plans on carrying out the shooting in detail. Stair also had a fascination with multiple [[mass shooting]]s, specifically [[school shooting]]s (particularly the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|its perpetrators]]). In his writings, Stair even called the Columbine shooters his heroes and wished he could have met them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania/articles/2017-06-08/the-latest-police-supermarket-employee-kills-3-co-workers|title=upermarket Killer Posted Video Describing Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=US News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fox56.com/news/local/weis-markets-shooter-leaves-behind-videos-of-plans|title=Weis Markets shooter leaves behind videos of plans|last=Innis|first=Jamie|work=WOLF|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Stair had a presence on YouTube with his channel Pioneers Productions, which featured short sketches and collaborations he did with other content creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Jessica|title=Randy Stair: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/06/randy-stair-weis-market-shooting-shooter-tunkhannock-pennsylvania-victims-photos-facebook/|accessdate=June 22, 2017|work=[[Heavy.com]]|date=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, however, he announced that he was going in a different direction with his content, citing numerous unfortunate events that had occurred in his life during the previous year; this led to the creation of "Ember's Ghost Squad" (EGS), an animated series focused on a fictional organization based on the character of [[Ember McLain]] from the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Danny Phantom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morse|first1=Brandon|title=Pennsylvania supermarket shooter made disturbing videos predicting his murder spree|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/12/pennsylvania-supermarket-shooter-made-disturbing-videos-predicting-his-murder-spree/|accessdate=June 21, 2017|work=TheBlaze|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening before the shooting, Stair uploaded a final video titled "The Westborough High Massacre". In it, he describes his hatred towards the people involved with the series through an angry prologue. It then featured a crudely animated sequence depicting him and one of the characters from EGS murdering students at a fictional high school, before ending with montages of previous videos explaining the motives behind the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morse|first1=Brandon|title=Pennsylvania supermarket shooter made disturbing videos predicting his murder spree|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/12/pennsylvania-supermarket-shooter-made-disturbing-videos-predicting-his-murder-spree/|accessdate=June 21, 2017|work=TheBlaze|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scolforo|first1=Mark|last2=De Groot|first2=Kristen|title=Supermarket massacre shooter left chilling online trail|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/dead-murder-suicide-pennsylvania-supermarket-47909262|accessdate=June 21, 2017|work=Associated Press|date=June 8, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also managed nine [[Twitter]] accounts based on his characters, where he left links to journals and videos he uploaded on [[MediaFire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singleton|first1=David|title=Gunman’s web posts suggest disconnect with the real world|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/gunman-s-web-posts-suggest-disconnect-with-the-real-world-1.2204548|accessdate=June 22, 2017|date=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was living in nearby [[Dallas, Pennsylvania]], with his parents and had lived in [[Pennsylvania]] all of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pahomepage.com/news/four-dead-in-weis-market-shooting/735099274|title=Four dead in Weis Market shooting|last=Becker|first=Dave|date=2017-06-09|work=PAHOMEPAGE|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and reactions==
The shooting did not receive much attention outside of local news outlets, but multiple Pennsylvania public leaders expressed their sadness and condemned the shooter's actions. Nevertheless, in reaction to the shooting, the Weis Markets store closed until July 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=C.J.|title=County: Weis expected to re-open July 13|url=http://wcexaminer.com/news/county-weis-expected-to-re-open-july-13-1.2212095|accessdate=June 29, 2017|date=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Weis Markets]] spokesperson said, "We are deeply saddened by the events of this morning. The safety of our associates, our customers, and the surrounding community is our top priority."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wkok.com/weis-markets-issues-statement-about-shooting/|title=Weis Markets issues statement about shooting {{!}}|website=wkok.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becki Hayes, the sister-in-law of victim Brian Hayes, set up a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to pay for immediate expenses. Hayes was also featured on [[Nancy Grace]]'s podcast "[[Crime Stories with Nancy Grace]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duke|first1=Alan|title=Weis Supermarket massacre victim's family needs your help!

===Store reopening and response===
On June 14, 2017, [[Weis Markets]] announced the store would be reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wnep.com/2017/06/27/weis-market-set-to-reopen-after-shooting/ | title = Weis Markets set to reopen after deadly shooting | work = WNEP.com | date = 6 June 2017 | accessdate = 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original store front stayed intact but the interior was gutted and remodeled with a new floor layout. On July 13, 2017, the store was reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mixed feelings on supermarket reopening after mass shooting|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mixed-feelings-supermarket-reopening-mass-shooting-48529813|accessdate=July 21, 2017|work=Associated Press|date=July 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people who lived in the area questioned why Weis decided to not relocate the store. In an interview with [[WNEP]], some even said they will not even enter the remodeled store due to what occurred there. However, some in the community accepted the supermarket chain's decision. One man said that it would have played into Stair's hands if the store had left. He explained, "The evil man who did this would have wanted them to move and would have wanted people to be scared and not want to go to the store after what he did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wnep.com/2017/06/28/community-reacts-to-news-that-weis-will-reopen-after-tragedy/ | title = Community reacts to Weis reopening after shooting | work = WNEP.com | date = 28 June 2017 | accessdate = 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kuva kakkuun7.jpg|thumb|A cake topped with a photograph of a tiger, printed on edible paper]]
'''Edible ink printing''' is the process of creating preprinted images with edible food colors onto various [[confectionery]] products such as [[cookies]], [[cakes]], or [[pastries]]. Designs made with edible ink can either be preprinted or created with an edible ink printer, a specialty device which transfers an image onto a thin, edible paper. Edible paper is made of starches and sugars and printed on with edible food colors. Some edible inks and paper materials have been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and carry its [[generally recognized as safe]] certification.

The first papers of this process used [[rice paper]], while modern versions use frosting sheets. The first U.S. patent for food printing, as it applied to edible ink printing, was filed by George J. Krubert of the [[Keebler Company]] and granted in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1981-04-07|others=George J. Krubert, Keebler Co|title=Printing of foods|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4578273A/en?q=edible&amp;q=ink&amp;oq=edible+ink&amp;sort=old&amp;page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such paper may be consumed without harmful effects. Most edible paper has no significant flavor and limited texture. Edible paper may be printed on by a standard printer and, upon application to a moist surface, dissolves while maintaining a high resolution. The end effect is that the image (usually a photograph) on the paper appears to be printed on the icing.

Edible printer inks have now become prevalent and are used in conjunction with special ink printers. Ink that is not specifically marketed as being edible may be harmful or fatal if swallowed. Edible toner for laser printers is not currently available. Any [[inkjet]] or [[bubblejet]] printer can be used to print, although [[Image resolution|resolution]] may be poor, and care should be taken to avoid contaminating the edible inks with previously used inks. Inkjet or bubblejet printers can be converted to print using edible ink, and cartridges of edible ink are commercially available.

Some edible inks are powdered, but if they are easily [[soluble]] in water they can also be used as any other edible ink without reducing quality. Edible paper is used on cakes, cookies, cupcakes and marshmallows.

'''Federico Andahazi''' (born June 6, 1963) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer and psychologist.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetadelibros.com.ar/federico-andahazi-autor-000004587.html|title=Author: Federico Andahazi|publisher=Planeta de Libros ©|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Federico Andahazi was born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, at Congreso, a very central neighborhood of the city. He is the son of Bela Andahazi, an aristoratic Hungarian poet and psychoanalyst, and Juana Merlín, of Russian-Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="cementheiress"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopkinson |first1=Amanda |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-cement-heiress-and-the-novelist-1196412.html |title=The cement heiress and the novelist|publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=5 September 1998 |accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He obtained a bachelor's degree in [[Psychology]] ([[University of Buenos Aires]]);&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; he practiced psychoanalysis a few years, while he was working on his short stories.

===The Fortabat Awards affair===
In 1996, while Andahazi was the finalist of the [[Premio planeta|Planeta Awards]], his novel ''The Anatomist'' won the First Prize of the ''[[Fundación Fortabat]]''. However, the [[mentor]] and financial supporter of the contest, [[María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat]], announced her "disagreement" with the decision of the jury,&lt;ref name="cementheiress"/&gt; through a [http://www.andahazi.com/solicitada.html request published] in most newspapers of [[Buenos Aires]], in which she stated that the novel "does not contribute to [the] exalt[ation of] the most high values of the human spirit".

The ''Fundación'' respected and implemented the decision of the jury, which included [[María Angélica Bosco]], [[Raúl Castagnino]], [[José María Castiñeira de Dios]], [[María Granata]] and [[Eduardo Gudiño Kieffer]], but the jury was subsequently dismissed by Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat and the literary competitions organized by the ''Fundación Fortabat'' have not been held again.&lt;ref name="anatomyofascandal"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Calvin|title=Sex and the Argentines: The Anatomy of a Scandal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/17/world/sex-and-the-argentines-the-anatomy-of-a-scandal.html|date=17 May 1997|accessdate=29 October 2017|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Anatomist'' was published by [[Editorial Planeta]] in 1997, translated into over thirty languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.

===Further works and activity===
His second novel, ''Las piadosas'' (The Merciful Women),&lt;ref name="mercifulreview"/&gt; a Gothic fantasy set in [[Geneva]], exploring the relationship between [[Lord Byron]], his secretary [[John William Polidori|Polidori]]&lt;ref name="cementheiress"/&gt; and [[Mary Shelley]], was published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Villena|first1=Miguel Ángel|title=Andahazi dedicates his new novel to Mary Shelley |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1999/03/05/cultura/920588411_850215.html|date=5 March 1999|accessdate=29 October 2017|publisher=[[El País]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the publishing house Temas published ''El árbol de las tentaciones'', a small volume containing short stories that obtained awards. The three short stories begin in the same way and are located in similar settings of nineteenth-century Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tematika.com/libros/ficcion_y_literatura--1/cuentos__relatos--4/el_arbol_de_las_tentaciones--79309.htm |title=El árbol de las tentaciones |publisher=Tematika.com |accessdate=11 November 2017}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he published ''El príncipe'' and in 2002 ''El secreto de los flamencos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-394-2002-09-25.html |title=Colors war |publisher=Página/12 : Radar |date=22 September 2002 |last=Olguín |first=Sergio}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Errante en la sombra'' was published in 2004; Andahazi wrote more than forty [[Argentine tango|tangos]] for this story, in which singer [[Carlos Gardel]] takes part.&lt;ref name="llevalamelancolia"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[El País]]|title=Andahazi brings tango melancholy to his novel|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2005/05/18/cultura/1116367204_850215.html|last1=Intxausti|first1=Aurora|date=18 May 2005|accessdate=29 October 2017}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''La ciudad de los herejes'' was published in 2005.&lt;ref name="manto"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The sacred cloth and literature|url=http://revistavolarcolombia.com/entretenimiento/cultura/el-manto-sagrado-y-la-literatura/|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=29 October 2017|publisher=Revista Volar|last1=Morales|first1=Alberto}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the summer of 2005, Andahazi and his readers collectively wrote a newspaper series called ''Mapas del fin del mundo'' (Maps from the End of the World) published by the newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]. The author wrote the beginning of a text, asking the readers to continue the story, create characters, propose plots, solve riddles, to be sent by e-mail. Therefore, in an unprecedented work, reading and answering thousands of e-mails per week, Andahazi built the story with the various inputs and points of view. Every Saturday a new chapter was added to the novel, increasing the participation and the expectation of readers turned co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/creacion-colectiva-taller-profesor-andahazi_0_HJufiNY1AYg.html|title=Collective creation in Andahazi's workshop |accessdate=29 October 2017|date=26 April 2005|publisher=Clarín}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Federico Andahazi was awarded the [[Premio Planeta|Planeta Prize]] for his novel ''El conquistador'' ("The Conqueror"). There he narrates the story of Quetza, the brilliant son of Tenochtitlan, who discovers the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/868610-federico-andahazi-creo-que-la-guerra-por-la-conquista-todavia-no-termino|title=I believe that the conquest war has not yet ended|last=Reinoso|first=Susana|date=18 December 2006|work=[[La Nación]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Andahazi published his first non-fiction book, ''Pecar como Dios manda'', a sexual history of Argentines.&lt;ref name="comodiosmanda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/edicion-impresa/federico-andahazi-la-historia-la-sexualidad-argentina-es-hipoacutecrita-n691136.html |title=The sexual history of Argentina is hypocritical|publisher=[[La Capital]]|accessdate=11 November 2017|date=28 June 2009}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in numerous anthologies, among others: ''Las palabras pueden: Los escritores y la infancia'' (2007, dedicated to [[UNICEF]] and [[World Food Program]], with authors like [[José Saramago]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Ernesto Sábato]], [[Juan Gelman]], [[Mario Benedetti]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]; ''Líneas aéreas'' (1999, published by Lengua de trapo, Spain) with writers such as [[Jorge Volpi]], [[Santiago Gamboa]] and [[Edmundo Paz Soldán]]; ''A Whistler in the Nightworld'', collection of short fiction from Latin America (2002, published by [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]], USA) with [[Laura Restrepo]] and [[Ángeles Mastretta]] among others; ''La Selección Argentina'' (2000, published by [[Tusquets]]); ''El libro de los nuevos pecados capitales'' (2001, [[Norma Publishing Group]]). He also took part in the book ''Homage to [[Diego Maradona]]'' (2001, SAF) together with [[Roberto Fontanarrosa]] and [[Pacho O'Donnell]].

His books have been translated to many languages. In the United States, he has been published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], in England by [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]], in France by [[Laffont]], in Italy by [[Frassinelli]], in China by [[China Times]], in Japan by [[Kadokawa Shoten|Kadokawa]], in Germany by Krüger.

He has delivered lectures in the Faculty of Journalism and Communication Sciences of the [[University of Moscow]], Russia, and the [[University of Santos Ossa]] of [[Antofagasta, Chile]]. He has also given talks in Stockholm, London, Paris, Istanbul and other cities of Europe, [[Latin America]], and The United States.

He has participated in literary congresses in France, Finland, and several cities in Spain among others. He has been invited to [[book fair]]s in [[Guadalajara]], [[Moscow]], [[Pula]], [[Istanbul]], [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], Buenos Aires and other cities of Argentina.

'''American food policy in occupied Germany''' refers to the food supply policies enacted by the U.S., and to some extent its dependent Allies, in the western [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones of Germany]] in the first two years of the ten-year occupation of Western Germany following [[World War II]].

==Background==

Shortly before the outbreak of World War II the German government instituted rationing which resulted in the restricted availability of food. Occasional shortages of food occurred during the war, and a black market developed. However, supplies were generally adequate, especially in comparison to the situation in some other European countries. In part, this was due to the ruthless exploitation of occupied countries by the German government.&lt;ref name="Enssle"&gt;Enssle (1987), p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; These policies included the "[[Hunger Plan]]", which resulted in the deaths of millions of people in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union when food supplies were redirected to Germany and the German military units operating in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Collingham (2012), pp. 216–218&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate food rations also formed part of [[The Holocaust]], resulting in tens of thousands of deaths in Warsaw alone,&lt;ref&gt;Collingham (2012), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and around two million Soviet [[prisoners of war]] were starved to death by German forces over the winter of 1941/42.&lt;ref&gt;Collingham (2012), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread food shortages first began to occur in Germany following the end of the war in May 1945.&lt;ref name="Collingham_467"&gt;Collingham (2012), p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; The production of food was disrupted by the effects of the war, including the destruction of farmland, livestock, and machinery. In addition, labour shortages developed when the slave labourers who had been forced to work on German farms returned to their homes. The situation was worsened by a period of poor weather.&lt;ref name="Buruma_63"&gt;Buruma (2013), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the output of German farms was sufficient to provide city residents with only 1,000 calories of nutrition per day.&lt;ref name=Collingham_467 /&gt; At this time, food supplies were limited across much of Europe, including the United Kingdom and France, resulting in continued rationing.&lt;ref name="Buruma_64"&gt;Buruma (2013), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning for the occupation of Germany==

During the planning for the occupation of Germany, the Allies were faced with the issue of whether food allocations for the country should be set at either the minimum needed to avoid disease and political disorder, or levels sufficient to fully meet the population's needs. A principle of ensuring that Germans had no better access to food than the worst-affected Allied country was adopted, but not applied in practice. The [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] initially set the ration scale for Germans at 2,600 calories per day, the same as levels in Belgium and France and at the top of the scale considered adequate by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].{{sfn|Grossmann|2011|p=122}}

Once the occupation of Germany commenced, it proved impossible to deliver the intended levels of food. The Allied planners underestimated the extent of the damage to German infrastructure, and overestimated the ability of Germans to grow their own food. As a result, once supplies which had been stockpiled by the German government during the war ran out, the ration scales were reduced to 1,000 to 1,250 calories per day.{{sfn|Grossmann|2011|p=122}} Most German civilians were able to supplement these rations, however. Displaced persons, including Holocaust survivors, were allocated more generous rations. These averaged only between 1,600 and 2,000 calories per day, and few of the displaced persons were able to access other sources of food.{{sfn|Grossmann|2011|p=131}}

==Captured German soldiers==
After the German surrender the U.S. chose to designate large numbers of German prisoners as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (DEF) instead of using the [[Prisoner of War]] status under which the captives would have been under the protection of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva convention]]&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-487-520&gt;S. P. MacKenzie The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II, The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 66, No. 3. (Sep., 1994), pp. 487–520.&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, would have been entitled to the same quantities of food as U.S. troops.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-487-520/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: S. P. MacKenzie ''...(ICRC) requested assurances from the belligerents that they intended to abide by the terms of the 1929 Geneva Convention. For these states to do so, however, would involve maintaining adequate standards regarding food, shelter, labor, and hygiene – all roughly equal to those granted rear-area troops.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions these prisoners had to endure were often harsh. A number of the camps in Western Germany, especially initially, were huge wired-in enclosures lacking sufficient shelter and other necessities.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-487-520/&gt; (see [[Rheinwiesenlager]]) Since there was no longer a danger of German retaliation against Allied POWs, "less effort was put into finding ways of procuring scarce food and shelter than would otherwise have been the case, and, consequently, tens of thousands of prisoners died from hunger and disease who might have been saved".&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-487-520/&gt;

The International Red Cross was never permitted to fully involve itself in the situation in DEF or SEP camps, and even though conditions in them gradually improved, even the most conservative estimates put the death toll in French camps alone at over 16,500 in 1945.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-487-520/&gt;

After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting the prisoner camps. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

On February 4, 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners also in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

== German civilian population ==
The [[German Red Cross]], which during the war had become thoroughly Nazified with its head [[Ernst-Robert Grawitz|Ernst Grawitz]] a major figure in medical experiments on Jews and "enemies of the state",&lt;ref&gt;The humanitarians: the International Committee of the Red Cross, page 45 David P. Forsythe, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; was dissolved, and the International Red Cross and the few other allowed international relief agencies were kept from helping Germans through strict controls on supplies and on travel.&lt;ref name = "Wiggers-p281"&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 281–82&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1945 it was estimated that the average German civilian in the U.S. and the United Kingdom occupation zones received 1,200 calories a day.&lt;ref name = "Wiggers-p280"&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, non-German [[Displaced Persons]] were receiving 2,300 calories through emergency food imports and Red Cross help.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing a Nazi uprising, U.S. occupation forces were under strict orders not to share their food with the German population, and this also applied to their wives when they arrived later in the occupation. The women were under orders not to allow their German maids to get hold of any leftovers; "the food was to be destroyed or made inedible", although in view of the starving German population facing them many housewives chose to disregard these official orders.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidson ''The Death and Life of Germany'' p.85 University of Missouri Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8262-1249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to a U.S. intelligence survey a German university professor reportedly said: "Your soldiers are good-natured, good ambassadors; but they create unnecessary ill will to pour twenty litres of left-over [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]] in the gutter when it is badly needed in our clinics. It makes it hard for me to defend American democracy amongst my countrymen."&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidson ''The Death and Life of Germany'' p.86 University of Missouri Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8262-1249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1946 U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] allowed foreign relief organizations to enter Germany in order to review the food situation. In mid-1946 non-German relief organizations were permitted to help starving German children.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The German food situation became worst during the very cold winter of 1946–47, when German calorie intake ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day, a situation made worse by severe lack of fuel for heating.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Average adult calorie intake in the U.S was 3,200–3,300, in the UK 2,900 and in the U.S. Army 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise effect of the food crisis on German health and mortality has been a matter of some contention. Speaking of the Anglo-American zones, Herbert Hoover reported that in the fall of 1946, starvation produced a 40 percent increase in mortality among Germans over 70.&lt;ref&gt;The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, No. 1, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating that the incidence of hunger oedema was low in 1946–1947.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Farquharson, The Western Allies and the Politics of Food, pg. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British Medical Journal, mortality in the British zone was above its pre-war level until June, 1946, when the death rate fell below that of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal, November 30, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, once it became clear there would be no rising, as threatened by the Nazis during the war, food controls were relaxed.

The historian [[Nicholas Balabkins]] notes that the Allied restrictions placed on German steel production, and their control over where the produced coal and steel was delivered, meant that offers by Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed German coal and machinery were rejected. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of [[lard]] a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. The Allies were however not willing to let the Germans trade.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, ''Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948'', Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consequence of the Allied policy of "Industrial Disarmament" (see [[The industrial plans for Germany]]) was that there was a drastic fall in [[fertilizer]] available for German agriculture, further decreasing the food production.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, ''Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948'', Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The German infant mortality rate was twice that of other nations in Western Europe until the close of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

The adequate feeding of the German population in occupied Germany was an Allied legal obligation&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, ''Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948'', Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; under Article 43 of The [[Hague Conventions (1907)|1907 Hague Rules of Land Warfare]].&lt;ref name=RW-279&gt;Richard Dominic Wiggers p. 279. "In postwar Germany and Japan, the U.S. Army financed the most urgent food imports by citing obligations under Article 43 of The Hague Rules of Land Warfare."&lt;/ref&gt;

== JCS 1067 ==
A Handbook for Military Government in Germany was ready in August 1944, it was an occupation document which advocated a quick restoration of normal life for the German people and reconstruction of Germany. The secretary of the U.S. Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], author of the [[Morgenthau Plan]] for partition and [[deindustrialization]] of postwar Germany, brought it to the attention of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] who after reading it rejected it with the words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Too many people here and in England hold the view that the German people as a whole are not responsible for what has taken place – that only a few Nazis are responsible. That unfortunately is not based on fact. The German people must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a lawless conspiracy against the decencies of modern civilization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A new document was drafted, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive 1067 ([[JCS 1067]]). Here the military government of occupation was ordered to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy" and it was also ordered that starvation, disease and civil unrest were to be kept below such levels where they would pose a danger to the troops of occupation.

On March 20, 1945, President Roosevelt was warned that the JCS 1067 was not workable: it would let the Germans "stew in their own juice". Roosevelt's response was "Let them have soup kitchens! Let their economy sink!" Asked if he wanted the German people to starve, he replied, "Why not?"&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Beschloss, ''The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941—1945'', pg. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1945 General Clay was becoming increasingly concerned about the humanitarian and political situation in the area under his responsibility. He stated "There is no choice between being a [[communist]] on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on 1000 calories".

Two years later, in July 1947, JCS 1067 was scrapped and replaced by [[JCS 1779]] which noted that "an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] Time Magazine, July 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Clay would later remark in his memoirs that "there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the [[Carthaginian peace]] which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation."&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3l7U7Mgmy80C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=there+was+no+doubt+that+JCS+1067+contemplated+the+Carthaginian+peace+which+dominated+our+operations+in+Germany+during+the+early+months+of+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0DA1V0w7WA&amp;sig=dSd7upp-P4OlW28bBQKnsKXbBxk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA129,M1 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

Nicholas Balabkins takes a favorable view of Allied policy, asserting that American food shipments saved the lives of "millions of Germans", although shortages persisted into 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, pp. 100–103&lt;/ref&gt; Balabkins also notes that the distributed food rations were of poor composition and "considerably below minimum nutrition standards"; without access to additional food from alternative sources recipients would eventually fall prey to starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, pp. 102,107,108&lt;/ref&gt; Balabkins also cites an authority who stated that the rations "represented a fairly rapid starvation level".&lt;ref&gt;Balabkins,Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note to the previous reference: Specified in footnote as the Testimony in the 1947 Hearings of the House Committee on Appropriations by [[Dennis A. FitzGerald]], Secretary General of the International Emergency Food Council&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of '''HIV/AIDS in Australia''' is distinctive, as Australian government bodies recognised and responded to the [[AIDS pandemic]] relatively swiftly, with the implementation of successful disease prevention and [[public health]] programs, such as [[Needle exchange programme|needle and syringe programs (NSPs)]]. As a result, despite significant numbers of at-risk group members contracting [[HIV|the disease]] in the early period following its discovery, the country achieved and has maintained a low rate of HIV infection in comparison to the rest of the world.

At the end of 2017, 27 545 people were estimated to be living with HIV in Australia. 20 922 infections were attributable to male‐to‐male sex exposure, 6 245 to heterosexual sex, 605 to injecting drug use, and 168 to ‘other’ exposures (vertical transmission to newborn, blood/tissue recipient, healthcare setting, haemophilia/coagulation disorder).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/kirby/report/supplHIV2018_content_20180920r.pdf|title=HIV in Australia: Annual surveillance short report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Kirby Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS is no longer considered an epidemic or a public health issue in Australia, due to the success of [[anti-retroviral]] drugs and extremely low HIV-to-AIDS progression rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIDS epidemic no longer a public health issue in Australia, scientists say|first=Stephanie|last=Dalzell|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-10/the-ends-of-aids-as-a-public-health-issue-in-australia/7580852|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=10 July 2016|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded case of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Australia was in Sydney in October 1982, and the first Australian death from AIDS occurred in Melbourne in July 1983.&lt;ref name="26 years of HIV/AIDS"&gt;{{cite web |work=World AIDS Day Australia |url=http://www.worldaidsday.org.au/internet/wad/publishing.nsf/Content/26-years |title=26 years of HIV/AIDS |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828211748/http://www.worldaidsday.org.au/internet/wad/publishing.nsf/Content/26-years |archivedate=28 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=15}}

Spurred to action both by the emergence of the disease amongst their social networks and by public hysteria and vilification, gay, lesbian and [[sex worker]] communities and organisations were instrumental in the rapid creation of AIDS councils (though their names varied), sex worker organisations, drug user organisations and positive people's groups. The AIDS councils were formed in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia in 1983, and in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory in 1985.&lt;ref name="26 years of HIV/AIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Queensland Association for Healthy Communities]] |url=http://www.qahc.org.au/vision |title=Vision &amp; History |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829203421/http://www.qahc.org.au/vision |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=AIDS Council of South Australia |url=http://www.acsa.org.au/History.html |title=ACSA History |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Western Australian AIDS Council |url=http://www.waaids.com/aboutus/history.html |title=History |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831102955/http://www.waaids.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=31 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tasmanian Council on AIDS, Hepatitis and Related Diseases |url=http://www.tascahrd.org.au/index2.htm |title=Welcome to TasCAHRD |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state and territory AIDS councils, along with the other national peak organisations representing at-risk groups Australian Injecting &amp; Illicit Drug Users League (AIVL), [[National Association of People with HIV Australia]] (NAPWHA), Anwernekenhe National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander HIV/AIDS Alliance (ANA), the [[Scarlet Alliance]], and the [[Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations]], all contribute to Australia's response to HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations |url=http://www.afao.org.au/view_articles.asp?pxa=ve&amp;pxs=83&amp;pxsc=120&amp;pxsgc=&amp;id=419 |title=List of members |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-governmental organisations formed swiftly and have remained prominent in addressing AIDS in Australia.

This approach to supporting care and independent living in the community is the basis of the Foundation's work, but is also an approach reflected in the activities and priorities of many HIV/AIDS organisations in Australia.

==Australian responses to HIV/AIDS==
[[File:Est HIV diag by year avert.org.png|thumb|Estimated HIV diagnoses by year from avert.org]]The Australian health policy response to HIV/AIDS has been characterised as emerging from the grassroots rather than top-down, and as involving a high degree of partnership between government and non-government stakeholders.{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=18, 21}} The capacity of these groups to respond early and effectively was instrumental in lowering infection rates before government-funded prevention programs were operational.{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plummer |first1=D |last2=Irwin |first2=L |title=Grassroots activities, national initiatives and HIV prevention: clues to explain Australia's dramatic early success in controlling the HIV epidemic |journal=International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS |volume=17 |number=12 |date=December 2006 |pages=787–793 |doi=10.1258/095646206779307612}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of both governments and NGOs was also based on recognition that social action would be central to controlling the disease epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Susan |last1=Kippax |first2=R.W |last2=Connell |first3=G.W |last3=Dowsett |first4=June |last4=Crawford |title=Sustaining safe sex: gay communities respond to AIDS |publisher=Routledge Falmer (Taylor &amp; Francis) |location=London |year=1993 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The willingness of the Australian government to use mainstream media to deliver a blunt message through advertising was credited as contributing to Australia's success in managing HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=ABC News |location=Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/04/05/1890228.htm |title=20 years after Grim Reaper ad, AIDS fight continues |accessdate=9 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the campaign also contributed to stigma for those living with the disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=AVERT |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsstigma.htm |title=HIV and AIDS discrimination and stigma |accessdate=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the gay community, an impact one of the advertising scheme's architects later regretted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=B &amp; T |date=1 October 2002 |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/a0/0c0113a0.asp |title=Grim Reaper's demonic impact on gay community |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120100226/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/a0/0c0113a0.asp |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Governments began in the mid-1980s to pilot or support programs involving [[needle-exchange programme|needle exchange]] for intravenous drug users. These remain occasionally controversial, but are reported to have been crucial in keeping the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the disease low, as well as being extremely cost-effective.{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Australian National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases |year=2000 |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/BF779AA5E45815C6CA25712400081717/$File/review.pdf |format=PDF |title=Needle &amp; Syringe Programs: a Review of the Evidence |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV/AIDS quickly became a more severe problem for several countries in the region around Australia, notably [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Thailand]], than it was within Australia itself. This led Australian governments and non-government organisations to place an increasing emphasis on international initiatives, particularly aimed at limiting the spread of the disease. In 2000, the Australian government introduced a $200&amp;nbsp;million HIV/AIDS prevention program that was targeted at south-east Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |work=Advancing the National Interest: Australia's Foreign and Trade Policy White Paper |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/ani/chapter_10.html |title=Projecting Australia and its Values |year=2003 |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830173557/http://www.dfat.gov.au/ani/chapter_10.html |archivedate=30 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, this was increased to $600&amp;nbsp;million over the six years to 2010 for the government's international HIV/AIDS response program, called ''Meeting the Challenge''.{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=10}} Australian non-government organisations such as the AIDS Trust are also involved in international efforts to combat the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The AIDS Trust |url=http://www.aidstrust.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=34 |title=Our Projects: Hope For Children – Cambodia |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607160440/http://www.aidstrust.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=34 |archivedate=7 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS and Australian law==

===Deliberate or reckless transmission===
In response to the risks of HIV transmission, some governments (e.g. Denmark) passed legislation designed specifically to criminalise intentional transmission of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS Europe and The Terrence Higgins Trust |url=http://www.gnpplus.net/criminalisation/index.shtml |title=Criminalisation of HIV transmission in Europe |year=2005 |accessdate=9 December 2017|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510034109/http://www.gnpplus.net/criminalisation/index.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has not enacted specific laws, there have been a small number of prosecutions under existing state laws, with four convictions recorded between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name="HIV on Trial"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sally |last=Cameron |url=http://www.afao.org.au/view_articles.asp?pxa=ve&amp;pxs=103&amp;pxsc=127&amp;pxsgc=139&amp;id=620 |title=HIV on Trial |journal=HIV Australia |volume=5 |number=4 |year=2007 |accessdate=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of Andre Chad Parenzee, convicted in 2006 and unsuccessfully appealed in 2007, secured widespread media attention as a result of expert testimony given by a Western Australian medical physicist [[AIDS denialism|that HIV did not lead to AIDS]].&lt;ref name="HIV on Trial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Roberts |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21151217-23289,00.html |title=HIV experts line up to refute denier |work=The Australian |date=1 February 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) |url=http://nhmrc.gov.au/news/media/rel07/hiv_aids.htm |title=NHMRC says link between HIV and AIDS "overwhelming" |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=11 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829235320/http://nhmrc.gov.au/news/media/rel07/hiv_aids.htm |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Hector Smith, aged 41, a [[male prostitute]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] who is HIV-positive, pleaded guilty in the ACT [[Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Magistrates Court]] to providing a commercial sexual service while knowing he was infected with a [[sexually-transmitted disease]] (STD) and failing to register as a [[sex worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23174950-421,00.html |title=An HIV-positive male prostitute has admitted to potentially spreading the deadly virus |first=Kate |last=Corbett |work=News.com.au |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under ACT law it is illegal to provide or receive commercial sexual services if the person knows, or could reasonably be expected to know, that he or she is infected with a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

In January 2009 Melbourne man Michael Neal was jailed for 18 years (with a minimum term of thirteen years, nine months) for deliberately infecting and trying to infect sexual partners with HIV without their knowledge, despite multiple warnings from the Victorian Department of Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/5265787/man-jailed-trying-spread-hiv/ |title=Man jailed for trying to spread HIV |work=Yahoo!

===Discrimination===
Australian governments have made it illegal to discriminate against a person on the grounds of their health status, including having HIV/AIDS;{{Sfn|Bowtell|2005|p=19}} for example, see {{Cite Legislation AU|Cwlth|act||Disability Discrimination Act, 1992 }}. However HIV positive individuals may still be denied immigration visas on the grounds that their treatment takes up limited resources and is a burden for taxpayers.&lt;ref name="swb"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/foi/sponsored-workers-bumping-up-hiv-bill/story-fn8r0e18-1226418332003 |title=Sponsored workers bumping up HIV bill |author=Sean Parnell |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=6 July 2012 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; To end HIV discrimination in Queensland and Australia in general, there is a plan to raise awareness and educate local people on HIV by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV foundation:Australian context |url=https://hivfoundation.org.au/about-hiv/ |date=May 2018 |publisher=HIVfoundation.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is supported by government, as well as by many educational and volunteer organizations. The main aim of the program is to educate people about HIV as it will help to prevent it and stop HIV discrimination in the area.

===Blood donations===
{{Main article|Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy}}
Australia was one of the first countries to screen all blood donors for HIV [[antibody|antibodies]],&lt;ref name="26 years of HIV/AIDS"/&gt; with screening in place for all [[blood transfusion|transfused blood]] since March 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Department of Human Services, [http://www.health.vic.gov.au/ideas/diseases/sti_hosaids Hospitals, AIDS &amp; you]&lt;/ref&gt; This was not before infection was spread through contaminated blood, resulting in legal cases in the 1980s around whether screening had been appropriately implemented. One issue highlighted in the course of those actions was the challenge of medical litigation under [[Statute of limitations|statutes of limitation]]. A medical condition such as HIV that can lie latent or undiagnosed for a long period of time may only emerge after the time period for litigation has elapsed, preventing examination of [[Medical malpractice|medical liability]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dwan v. Farquhar'', 1 Qd. R. 234, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the integrity of the blood supply resurfaced following a case of the contraction of HIV by transfusion in Victoria in 1999. This led to the introduction of new blood screening tests, which also improved screening in relation to [[Hepatitis C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Australian Health Ministers |url=http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr1999-mw-hmc1.htm |title=Health Ministers agree to new blood screening test |date=4 August 1999 |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay men have sought to donate blood to help increase Australia's blood supply stock, saying this volunteering would, in turn, help reduce discrimination towards LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rob|last=Stott|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/blood-donation-rules-continue-to-exclude-healthy-donors/story-fneuz9ev-1226922550697 |title=Blood donation rules continue to exclude healthy donors |work=[[News Corp Australia|News Ltd]]|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/faq#faq_294 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |work=[[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] have indicated their concern regarding the possible transmission of HIV and noting they are receptive to a reduction in the current deferral period from 12 to 6 months, but the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]], has rejected their submission on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/media-centre/news/national/fact-finder-our-response-to-newscomaus-gay-blood-donation-article |title=Fact Finder: Our response to news.com.au's gay blood donation article |work=[[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608103218/http://www.donateblood.com.au/media-centre/news/national/fact-finder-our-response-to-newscomaus-gay-blood-donation-article |archivedate=8 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS and Pregnant Australian Women==
By the end of 2017, there were estimated to be 3,349 women diagnosed with HIV comprising 13.8% of all infections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2013, the median age of diagnosis for women is at 30 years of age. The reasons for acquiring the HIV blood test is spread across three circumstances. Firstly, 30.2% of people become physically ill, 17.1% of peoples partner had tested positive therefore they accessed medical assistance and thirdly, 12.9% of people acquired testing due to exposure to a large risk episode.&lt;ref name="Beyond the data"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koelmeyer|first1=Rachel|last2=McDonald|first2=Karalyn|last3=Grierson|first3=Jeffery|title=BEYOND THE DATA: HIV-POSITIVE WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA|url=http://www.afao.org.au/library/hiv-australia/volume-9/number-4/beyond-the-data#.VT7qKiGqqkp|website=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contracting HIV/AIDS===
The most common form of transmissions of HIV is through blood, semen, pre-ejaculation, rectal mucus, vaginal fluids and breast milk. Therefore, women need to be extremely cautious when engaging in sexual activity as well as if and when falling pregnant.&lt;ref name="Better Health Channel"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and women having children|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcpdf.nsf/ByPDF/HIV_and_women_having_children/$File/HIV_and_women_having_children.pdf|website=Better Health Channel|publisher=State of Victoria|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, behaviours that lead to women contracting the HIV virus include engagement in sexual intercourse within a heterosexual relation with someone who already has HIV/AIDS, using drugs intravenously or receiving infected blood products.&lt;ref name="Beyond the data"/&gt;

Risks of passing on the HIV virus to an unborn child is extremely high for women whom have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. In Australia, it is a part of routine antenatal testing that mothers undergo a blood test to check for HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=BabyCenter&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in pregnancy|url=http://www.babycenter.com.au/a544487/hiv-and-aids-in-pregnancy|website=BabyCenter|publisher=BabyCenter Australia Medical Advisory Board|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV transmission to an unborn child is often called Perinatal HIV transmission, Vertical Transmission or Mother-To-Child-Transmission (MTCT).&lt;ref name="Neonatal ehandbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – perinatal|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/neonatalhandbook/infections/hiv-perinatal.htm|website=State Government Victoria|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main ways a mother can risk passing on the HIV virus to her child and that is during the pregnancy via crossing of the placenta, during birth if the baby comes in contact with the mothers bodily fluids and through the practice of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="BabyCenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neonatal ehandbook"/&gt;  
Therefore, when falling pregnant it is important for a mother to access additional Antenatal care. Visitation to an infectious disease physician, experienced obstetrician, paediatrician and midwife is recommended. As well as accessing additional psycho-social support such as a counselor and support worker.&lt;ref name="Neonatal ehandbook"/&gt;

To reduce the risks of MTCT the mother can start preparing prenatally with a series of anti-retroviral medications. Using other means of conception practices such as the method of 'sperm washing'. This is where the sperm cells are separated from the seminal fluid and used to fertilise a woman's eggs via the use of a catheter or in vitro fertilisation (IVF) methods.&lt;ref name="Better Health Channel"/&gt; Seeking additional medical checkups to observe clinical markers determining disease progression along with regular observations of baby's development can also help in monitoring the health of the baby.&lt;ref name="Beyond the data"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BabyCenter"/&gt;

[[File:Pregnant woman2.jpg|thumb|Pregnant woman]]

In addition, the postnatal care taken to reduce risks of MTCT include avoiding procedures where the baby's skin may be cut or electing to have a cesarean section to reduce the risk of contact with body fluids.&lt;ref name="Neonatal ehandbook"/&gt; Ensuring the baby's eyes and head are cleaned, the umbilical cord is clamped as soon as possible and placing an absorption pack (towel or sponge) over the umbilical cord when cut to prevent blood spurting will also reduce the risk of the baby coming in contact with any contaminated fluids.&lt;ref name="Neonatal ehandbook"/&gt; Bottle feeding the baby also removes any chance of coming in contact with infected body fluids.&lt;ref name="Better Health Channel"/&gt; Along with the mother taking anti-retroviral medication, giving the baby a course of this until it is 4–6 weeks of age also drastically reduces its risk of transmission.&lt;ref name="BabyCenter"/&gt; Medical practitioners also require the infant undergo regular blood tests at 1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months to test for any evidence of the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BabyCenter"/&gt;

===Stigma associated towards Women with HIV/AIDS===
[[File:Sadness 2.jpg|thumb|Isolation due to Stigma]]
Association with HIV/AIDS within Australia is largely absent from the mainstream population. Therefore, in 2009, 73.6% of women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS reported unwanted disclosure of their health status due to a lack of awareness and knowledge about the disease.&lt;ref name="Beyond the data"/&gt; This was due to the large amount of stigma associated with a HIV diagnosis. The emotional and psychological problems for pregnant mothers within Australia are extremely high. 42% of women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS are also diagnosed with a mental health condition due to the harsh effects of the arising stigma around such circumstances.&lt;ref name="HIV Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afao.org.au/about-hiv/the-hiv-epidemic/hiv-statistics-australia/hiv-statistics-women-in-australia#.VT7xViGqqkp|title=HIV STATISTICS IN AUSTRALIA: WOMEN|website=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma associated with HIV diagnosis in women often involves evoked assumptions that these women are considered a part of the sex trade industry, are homosexual or are intravenous drug users.&lt;ref name=Stigma&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Karalyn|title='You don't grow another head': The experience of stigma among HIV-positive women in Australia|journal=HIV Australia|volume=9|issue=4|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women are often viewed as contagious and are assumed to have devious traits and behaviours. In western society, socially specific roles expected of women, such as motherhood, create automatic discrimination when diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Beyond the data"/&gt; Those women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS who express the idea of wanting to become pregnant are often discriminated against as being selfish, inconsiderate, uncaring and immoral.&lt;ref name="Stigma"/&gt; Healthcare professionals and practitioners are often reported as having negative attitudes towards women who openly identify with having HIV/AIDS and being pregnant or wanting to become pregnant.&lt;ref name="Stigma"/&gt;

==Ongoing research and awareness-raising==
The [[Sydney Mardi Gras]], one of the largest street parades and gay and lesbian events in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Mardi Gras |url=http://www.mardigras.org.au/history |title=History |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has HIV/AIDS as a significant theme, and is one of a number of pathways through which the non-government sector in Australia continues to address the disease.{{Sfn|Altman|2001|p=83}}

Australian researchers have been active in HIV/AIDS research since the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.nchecr.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/Publications_1/$file/peerRev.pdf Publications List] of participants in the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research dating back to 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent research organisation is the [[Kirby Institute]] (formerly National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research), based at the [[University of New South Wales]], regarded as a leading research institution internationally, and a recipient of one of the first grants of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top class research fails to get local support|last=Lebihan|first=Rachel|date=16–17 April 2011|work=Weekend Australian Financial Review|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre focusses on epidemiology, clinical research and clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nchecr.unsw.edu.au/ |title=National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research |accessdate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also prepares the annual national surveillance reports on the disease. In 2006 the Centre received just under {{AUD}}4&amp;nbsp;million in Commonwealth government funding, as well as several million dollars of funding from both public and pharmaceutical industry sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research |url=http://notes.med.unsw.edu.au/nchecrweb.nsf/resources/AR_06/$file/06_annrep.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annual Report |year=2006 |accessdate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other research centres are also directly Commonwealth funded to investigate different facets of HIV/AIDS: the National Centre in HIV Social Research (NCHSR); the Australian Centre for HIV and Hepatitis Virology Research (ACH&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (formerly the National Centre for HIV Virology Research); and the [[Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society]] (ARCSHS).

==HIV/AIDS in Australia since 2000==
While the spread of the disease has been limited with some success, HIV/AIDS continues to present challenges in Australia. The [[Bobby Goldsmith]] Foundation reports that nearly a third of people with HIV/AIDS in [[New South Wales]] (the state with the largest infected population) are living below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Message from the President"/&gt; Living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant changes in employment and accommodation circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D |last1=Ezzy |first2=R |last2=De Visser |first3=I |last3=Grubb |first4=D |last4=McConachy |title=Employment, accommodation, finances and combination therapy: the social consequences of living with HIV/AIDS in Australia |journal=AIDS Care |volume=10 |number=2 |year=1998 |pages=189–199 |doi=10.1080/09540129850124299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D |last1=Ezzy |first2=R |last2=De Visser  |first3=M |last3=Bartos |title=Poverty, disease progression and employment among people living with HIV/AIDS in Australia |journal=AIDS Care |volume=11 |number=4 |year=1999 |pages=405–414 |doi=10.1080/09540129947785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survival time for people with HIV has improved over time, in part through the introduction of [[antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral drug treatments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yueming |last1=Li, |first2=Ann M |last2=McDonald |first3=Gregory J |last3=Dore |first4=John M |last4=Kaldor |title=Improving survival following AIDS in Australia, 1991–1996 |work=AIDS |volume=14 |number=15 |pages=2349–2354|year= 2000 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-200010200-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Post-exposure prophylaxis#Treatment|post-exposure prophylaxis treatments]] reducing the possibility of [[seroconversion]] and minimising the likelihood of HIV progression to AIDS.

After the initial success in limiting the spread of HIV, infection rates began to rise again in Australia, though they remained low by global standards. After dropping to 656 new reported cases in 2000, the rate rose to 930 in 2005.&lt;ref name="nchecr.unsw.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ann |last=McDonald |url=http://www.nchecr.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/SurvReports_4/$file/06_ansurvrp_rev.pdf |format=PDF |title=HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis &amp; Sexually Transmissible Infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report |publisher=National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research |year=2006 |accessdate=9 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903194520/http://www.nchecr.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/SurvReports_4/$file/06_ansurvrp_rev.pdf|archive-date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission continued to be predominantly through sexual contact between men, in contrast to many high-prevalence countries in which it was increasingly spread through heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="nchecr.unsw.edu.au"/&gt;{{Sfn|Altman|2001|p=78}} Indeed, the majority of new Australian cases of HIV/AIDS resulting from heterosexual contact have arisen through contact with a partner from a high-prevalence country (particularly from sub-Saharan Africa or parts of south-east Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ann |last=McDonald |url=http://www.afao.org.au/view_articles.asp?pxa=ve&amp;pxs=103&amp;pxsc=127&amp;pxsgc=138&amp;id=619 |title=HIV infection attributed to heterosexual contact in Australia, 1996 – 2005 |journal=HIV Australia |volume=5 |number=4 |year=2007 |accessdate=9 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829020019/http://www.afao.org.au/view_articles.asp?pxa=ve&amp;pxs=103&amp;pxsc=127&amp;pxsgc=138&amp;id=619|archive-date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that 21,171 Australians have HIV, with 1,050 new cases diagnosed in 2009. ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' also reported that 63% of Australians living with HIV were [[men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSM)]], and 3% were injecting drug users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/hiv-rate-rising-but-other-infections-less-common-20101018-16qxf.html |title=HIV rate rising but other infections less common |author=Benson, Kate |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the end of 2011, there had been 31,364 diagnosed HIV infections in Australia, and just around 24,731 people were living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ann |last=McDonald |url=http://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/hiv/resources/2012AnnualSurvReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report |publisher=The Kirby Institute |year=2012 |accessdate=9 December 2017|page=7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514075518/http://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/hiv/resources/2012AnnualSurvReport.pdf|archive-date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2012, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that up to 35,000 Australians have HIV, with 1,137 new cases diagnosed in 2011. The Kirby Institute data shows 85% of people infected from 2009–2013 were MSM, while heterosexual contact accounted for 9% and 1% from injecting drug use.&lt;ref name="Kirby HIV supplement 2014"/&gt;

In 2012, between 12,500 and 15,000 people were living with HIV in NSW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/publications/Publications/nsw-hiv-strategy-2012-15.pdf |title=NSW HIV Strategy 2012–2015 A New Era |work=The NSW Ministry of Health  |date=2012 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the estimated number of people living with HIV in Australia was 25,708.&lt;ref name="Wit"&gt;{{cite news|title=To curb rising HIV rates, we must target our human flaws|url=http://theconversation.com/to-curb-rising-hiv-rates-we-must-target-our-human-flaws-23430|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=20 February 2014|author=John de Wit}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 2013, the [[Ministry of Health (New South Wales)|NSW Ministry of Health]] reported that 409 new cases of HIV infection were recorded in NSW in 2012—this compares with 330 new cases in 2011.

According to an annual surveillance report, around 30,000 Australians knew they had the HIV virus in 2013, with the biggest HIV increase occurring within the 25 years-and-under age group. The director of the UNSW Centre for Social Research in Health, John de Wit, said in October 2013 that about 10% of gay men were HIV positive at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/hiv-rates-rise-among-gay-men/story-fneuz9ev-1226743520690 |title=HIV rates rise among gay men |work=[[News Ltd]]  |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, de Wit stated that there are "many human and economic reasons" to revitalise HIV prevention efforts in Australia.&lt;ref name="Wit" /&gt;

In 2013, around 10,500 people are living with diagnosed HIV in NSW. The NSW Ministry of Health reported that 357 new cases of HIV infection were recorded in NSW in 2013 (compared with 409 new cases in 2012, a 13% reduction). It is estimated that another 10–20% have undiagnosed HIV. At least 7,887 people living with HIV in NSW are on antiretroviral treatment. Of the 357 new HIV cases, most infections reported were in gay and homosexually active men (78%), with heterosexual contact accounting for 17%, injecting drug use 3% and aboriginal people 2% of notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NSW ministry of Health |url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/endinghiv/Documents/HIV-Snapshot-March2014.PDF |title=Snapshot of HIV Strategy, March 2014 |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 32% increase (from the same period in 2013) in HIV diagnosis in NSW for the first three months of 2014, with similar results in other states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/endinghiv/Documents/hiv-in-nsw-data-report-q1-2014.pdf |title=NSW HIV Strategy 2012 – 2015 Quarter 1 2014 Data Report |work=NSW Health|date=2014 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US ambassador to Australia, [[John Berry (administrator)|John Berry]] stressed people remain vigilant against HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/50th-birthday-news/fears-aids-plague-of-1983-may-return/story-fnmx97ei-1226947681232 |title=Fears AIDS plague of 1983 may return |author=Sean Parnell|work=The Australian  |date=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, in 2014 there was a 34% increase in HIV notifications over the previous-year same period with the majority of the notifications being amongst Australian-born MSM. The Queensland Aids Council expressed its concern, but said it could be the result of increased testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-27/dramatic-spike-in-hiv-notifications-in-queensland/5482076|title=HIV notifications up 34 per cent in Queensland, a rise described by doctors as alarming|author=Withey, Andree|date=28 May 2014|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victoria, HIV notifications have increased over the past three years. This rise is partially explained by the introduction of rapid HIV testing. While approximately 90% of people living with HIV in Victoria are MSM, 20% of the new diagnoses are outside that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napwha.org.au/news-information/positive-living-magazine/vic-records-rise-diagnoses|title=Vic records rise in diagnoses|date=3 July 2014|work=National Association of people with HIV Australia|accessdate=5 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221649/http://napwha.org.au/news-information/positive-living-magazine/vic-records-rise-diagnoses|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Kirby Institute reported for Australia 1,235 new HIV cases were diagnosed in 2013, with more than 26,000 people living with the virus, and one in seven with HIV not knowing they have the virus.&lt;ref name = ABC2014&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-17/hiv-rates-in-australia-remain-at-20-year-high/5602706|title=HIV rates at 20-year high, with unprotected sex between casual male partners seen as leading cause|first1=Sophie|last1=Scott|first2=Alison|last2=Branley|date=17 July 2014|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the prevalence of HIV in Australia has increased to a 20-year high largely attributable to gay men abandoning condom use.&lt;ref name = ABC2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hiv-on-rise-as-gay-men-abandon-condoms-20140918-10itsi.html | title=HIV on rise as gay men abandon condoms |author= Alexander, Harriet| date=20 September 2014|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 an Australia-wide study has shown that the rate of HIV infections has stabilised at about 1,000 new cases annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.9news.com.au/health/2015/09/14/06/50/aids-cases-stable-other-stis-on-the-rise|title=AIDS cases stable, other STIs on the rise|date=14 September 2015|work=AAP|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of gay men having [[Bareback (sex)|condomless casual anal sex]] is at an all-time high.&lt;ref name="PrEP1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/melbourne-posters-saying-gay-men-can-f-raw-on-prep-come-after-report-reveals-record-figures-of-unprotected-sex/140834|title=Melbourne posters saying gay men can "f*** raw" on PrEP follow report revealing record figures of condomless sex|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After peaking at 1,084 new diagnosed cases in 2014, the rate has dropped each year to reach 963 in 2017. While there has been a dramatic decrease in MSM with an 11% decline in the past five years, this has been partially offset by a 19% increase in case attributed to heterosexual sex during the same period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And what is needed, as the Global Commission on HIV and the Law pointed out, is a new inquiry at international level – inaugurated by the secretary-general of the United Nations – to investigate a reconciliation between the right to health and the right of authors to proper protection for their inventions. At the moment, all the eggs are in the basket of the authors, and it's not really a proportionate balance. And that's why the Global Commission suggested that there should be a high level of investigation.&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Branson, Global Drug Commissioner at the time of the conference, stressed the importance of decriminalising illicit injecting drug use to the prevention of HIV and, speaking in global terms, stated that "we're using too much money and far too many precious resources on incarceration".&lt;ref name="Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decriminalisation of drug use – key to ending HIV|url=http://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/Allowing-drug-use-is-a-key-goal-for-ending-HIV-20140722|website=Health24|publisher=Health24|accessdate=23 July 2014|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Society Foundation launched the "To Protect and Serve

The '''Hazards Campaign''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] national network established in 1988 to campaign for improved workplace health, safety and welfare, and a reduction in the incidence of work-related injury, ill-health and death. It brings together Hazards Centres, Occupational Health Projects, [[trade union]]s, health and safety groups, specific campaigns and individual health and safety activists. Specific campaign groups include the Construction Safety Campaign, the Centre for Corporate Accountability (CCA), the UK WorkStress Network, Families Against Corporate Killers (FACK), [[asbestos]] victims' support groups, and RSI Action. 

The campaign works by: sharing information and skills; campaigning on specific issues; acting as a national voice; issuing press releases; holding conferences; establishing national initiatives, including [[Workers Memorial Day]]; lobbying [[British parliament|MPs]], [[European Parliament|MEPs]] and statutory bodies like the Health &amp; Safety Commission and the Health &amp; Safety Executive, and organising demonstrations and protests. 

The Campaign is a worker-oriented organisation, and promotes trade union organisation in workplaces, increased worker involvement and participation in decision-making, and a radial perspective &lt;!-- what is a "radial perspective"? --&gt; on the issues.  It currently (2006) promotes and supports a number of emerging safety representative networks in different parts of the UK.  It meets about four or five times a year; these meetings are open to anyone sharing the aims of the campaign.  Its highest profile event is the annual Hazards Conference, the largest regular rank-and-file event in Europe, which attracts around 600 delegates every year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6368">The '''dimensions and shape of the [[vagina|human vagina]]''' are of great importance in [[medicine]] and [[surgery]];&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt; there appears to be no one way, however, to characterize the vagina's size and shape.&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt; In addition to variations in size and shape from individual to individual, a single woman's vagina can vary substantially in size and shape during [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name=Lawrence2011/&gt; [[Parity (biology)|Parity]] is associated with a significant increase in the length of the [[vaginal fornix]].&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt; The potential effect of parity may be via stretching and elongation of the [[birth canal]] at the time of [[Childbirth#Vaginal birth|vaginal birth]].&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt;

Although the dimensions of the human vagina have not been the subject of intensive research to the same extent as research into [[human penis size]],&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt; a number of research studies have been made of the dimensions of the human vagina.

== Dimensions in the baseline state ==
A 1996 study by Pendergrass et al., using [[vinyl polysiloxane]] castings taken from the vaginas of 39 [[White American|Caucasian]] women, found the following ranges of dimensions:&lt;ref name=Pendergrass1996&gt;{{Cite journal

| title = The shape and dimensions of the human vagina as seen in three-dimensional vinyl polysiloxane casts

| year = 1996 
| pmid = 8938470
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* lengths (measured  using rods): {{convert|6.9|to|15|cm|abbr=on}};  
* widths: {{convert|4.8|to|6.3|cm|abbr=on}};
* introital diameters: {{convert|2.4|to|6.5|cm|abbr=on}}

A second study by the same group showed significant variations in size and shape between the vaginas of women of different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Pendergrass2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pendergrass | first1 = P. B. | last2 = Reeves | first2 = C. A. | last3 = Belovicz | first3 = M. W. | last4 = Molter | first4 = D. J. | last5 = White | first5 = J.

Barnhart et al., however, weren't find any correlation amongst the race and the size of vagina. They were also unable to characterize the vaginal shape as a "heart, slug, pumpkin seed or parallel sides" as suggested by the previous studies.&lt;ref name="upenn2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesocial.ca/wellness/health/how-much-do-you-know-about-vaginas?app=CTVGO|title=The Social - How much do you know about vaginas?|website=TheSocial.ca|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2003 study by the group of Pendergrass et al. also using castings as a measurement method, measured vaginal surface areas ranging from {{convert|66|to|107|cm2|abbr=on}} with a mean of {{convert|87|cm2|abbr=on}} and a standard deviation of {{convert|7.8|cm2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;.{{Cite journal

| pmid = 12771458
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2006 by Barnhart et al., gave the following mean dimensions, based on [[MRI scan]]s of 28 women:&lt;ref name="upenn2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barnhart | first1 = K.

* Mean length from [[cervix]] to [[introitus]]: {{convert|6.3|cm|abbr=on}}.
* Mean width:
** at the proximal vagina: {{convert|3.3|cm|abbr=on}}; 
** at the [[pelvic diaphragm]]: {{convert|2.7|cm|abbr=on}}; 
** at the introitus: {{convert|2.6|cm|abbr=on}}

== Dimensions during sexual arousal ==
Lawrence, citing [[Masters and Johnson]]'s ''[[Human sexual response cycle|Human Sexual Response]]'' (1966), states that pages 73 and 74 of that book show that typical vaginal depth in Masters and Johnson's participants ranged from 7–8&amp;nbsp;cm (2.8–3.1&amp;nbsp;in) in an unstimulated state, to 11–12&amp;nbsp;cm (4.3–4.7&amp;nbsp;in) during [[sexual arousal]] with a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]] in place.&lt;ref name=Lawrence2011/&gt;

== Dimensions of medical devices used in the vagina ==
There does not appear to be large variation in the dimensions of the vagina within the same woman.&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt; Given the large range in the dimensions noted, it is most likely that one size for a [[pessary|vaginal device]] will not fit all vaginas.&lt;ref name=upenn2006/&gt;

== Dimensions in pregnancy and childbirth ==
{{empty section|date=July 2013}}

== Dimensions of surgically created neovaginas ==
The depth of the typical [[neovagina]] created by [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery]] is generally limited by the length of [[Denonvilliers' fascia]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and is reported to be between 11 and 12&amp;nbsp;cm (4.3-4.7&amp;nbsp;in), within the range of the natural female vagina.&lt;ref name=Lawrence2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annelawrence.com/genitaldimensions.html|title=Notes on Genital Dimensions|author=Anne A.

A '''hunting tournament''' is a live kill competition where individuals or teams try to kill the largest animal for [[hunting|sport]].  There are many types of hunting tournaments and they are all scored differently.  Some organizations that endorse hunting tournaments are the [[National Rifle Association]] and [[Safari Club International]].

The '''Infectious Disease Research Institute''' ('''IDRI''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Seattle]], in the United States, and which conducts [[global health]] research on [[infectious diseases]].

==History==
IDRI was founded in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria vaccine==
IDRI is collaborating with the [[United States Agency for International Development]] to develop a [[malaria vaccine]] with the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] using Walter Reed's CelTOS malaria antigen in conjunction with IDRI's GLA-SE [[adjuvant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/usaid-idri-form-malaria-vax-collaboration/2011-08-18 |title=USAID, IDRI form malaria vax collaboration |author=Erica Teichert  |work=fiercevaccines.com |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visceral leishmaniasis vaccine==
On February 2012, IDRI launched the world’s first [[clinical trial]] of the [[visceral leishmaniasis]] vaccine.  The vaccine is a recombinant form of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins with an [[adjuvant]].  Two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers are to be conducted.  The first one takes place in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and is followed by a trial in [[India]].  The trials are funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/worlds-first-kala-azar-vaccine-enters-clinic/2012-02-23|title=World’s first kala azar vaccine enters the clinic|author=Elvidge, Suzanne|publisher=FierceVaccines.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Survival and conflict */ removed misleading section that refers to "Hell." Gehonnim is the closest Jewish equivalent to the Christian idea of  hell, but within Judaism is a temporary state after death.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5334">'''Jewish views on suicide''' are mixed. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], suicide is forbidden by [[Jewish law]], and viewed as a [[sin]]. Non-Orthodox forms of Judaism may instead recognize the act as more akin to a death by a disease or disorder (except in cases of purposeful assisted suicide). Rabbinical scholars (certainly in the reformed movements) command compassion both for the deceased and the survivors.

== Assisted suicide ==
Assisting in suicide and requesting such assistance (thereby creating an accomplice to a sinful act) is also forbidden, a minimal violation of Leviticus 19:14, "Do not put a [[stumbling block]] before the blind", for the Rabbis interpreted that verse to prohibit any type of [[stumbling block]]: theological (e. g., persuading people to believe in false doctrine), economic (e. g., giving bad financial advice), or in this case moral stumbling blocks, as well as physical ones.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Bavli (B.) Pesah.im 22b; B. Mo'ed Katan 5a, 17a; B. Bava Mezia 75b.; and B. Nedarim 42b).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Talmudic Sources ==
The prohibition against suicide is mentioned in the Talmud in Tractate Bava Kama 91b. [[Semahot]] (Evel Rabbati) 2:1&amp;ndash;5 serves as the basis for most of later Jewish law on suicide, together with Genesis Rabbah 34:13, which bases the biblical prohibition on Genesis 9:5: "And surely your blood of your lives, will I require."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M.T. Laws of Murder 2:3; Babylonian Talmud tractate Laws of Courts (Sanhedrin) 18:6; S.A. Yoreh De'ah (Code of Jewish Law) 345:1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee on Jewish Law and Standard ==
The [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standard]]s, the body of scholars of [[halakha|Jewish law]] in [[Conservative Judaism]], has published a [[responsa]] on suicide and assisted suicide in the Summer 1998 issue of ''Conservative Judaism'', Vol. L, No. 4. It affirms the prohibition, then addresses the growing trend of Americans and Europeans to seek assistance with suicide. The Conservative ''teshuva'' notes that while many people get sick, often with terminal illnesses, most people do not try to kill themselves. The committee believes we are obliged to determine why some seek help with suicide and to ameliorate those circumstances.

The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] response states:

: "... those who commit suicide and those who aid others in doing so act out of a plethora of motives. Some of these reasons are less than noble, involving, for example, children's desires to see Mom or Dad die with dispatch so as not to squander their inheritance on 'futile' health care, or the desire of insurance companies to spend as little money as possible on the terminally ill."

The paper says the proper response to severe [[pain]] is not suicide, but better pain control and more pain [[medication]]. Many doctors, it asserts, are deliberately keeping such patients in pain by refusing to administer sufficient pain medications: some out of ignorance; others to avoid possible drug addiction; others from a misguided sense of [[stoicism]]. Conservative Judaism holds that such forms of reasoning are "bizarre" and cruel, that with today's medications there is no reason for people to be in perpetual torture.

== Collective suicides in Jewish history ==
Judaism has many teachings about peace and compromise that present physical violence as one of the last possible options. Although killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances, when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed [[suicide]] or [[mass suicide]] (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples). 

== Views on martyrdom ==
As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying "to sanctify God's Name". (See: ''[[martyrdom]]''). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities; some regard them as examples of heroic martyrdom, and others saying that while Jews should always be willing to face martyrdom if necessary, it was wrong for them to have taken their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm |title=Euthanasia and Judaism: Jewish Views of Euthanasia and Suicide |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/lifecycle/Death/Issues_in_Death/Suicide.htm My Jewish Learning: Suicide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017213307/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/lifecycle/Death/Issues_in_Death/Suicide.htm |date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival and conflict ==
Because Judaism focuses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic [[morality|moral]] [[dilemma]] of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analysed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.

The '''Job Accommodation Network''' (JAN) is a service provided by the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/odep US Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; JAN is one of several ODEP technical assistance centers. JAN facilitates the employment and retention of workers with disabilities by providing employers, employment providers, people with disabilities, their family members, and other interested parties with information on job accommodations, [[entrepreneurship]], and related subjects. JAN's efforts are in support of the employment, including self-employment and [[small business]] ownership, of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askjan.org/links/about.htm Job Accommodation Network About page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The network has been located on the campus of [[West Virginia University]] since its inception in 1983. It began with two consultants providing accommodation information over two telephone lines with no computers. At that time, JAN served only employers seeking accommodation information. Because of additional demand for its confidential, direct, and no-cost service, JAN quickly expanded beyond providing information to employers to include rehabilitation and educational professionals, individuals with disabilities, and anyone else interested in workplace accommodations.

Initially, JAN consulted primarily on [[Disability#Sensory disability|sensory disabilities]], those involving hearing, vision, touch, or speech impairments. Until the early 1990s, about 30 percent of JAN’s requests addressed these disability areas.  As computers, office machines, cell phones, wireless communication, and similar technology became common in workplaces, employees with all types of impairments needed to be able to use the technology. As caller questions became more technical, JAN consultants changed to a team approach, dividing into motor / mobility, sensory, and cognitive / neurological teams. A team approach allowed consultants to handle increasing case loads, yet stay current and knowledgeable about rapidly changing technology and products.

With the implementation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) in 1992, more individuals began calling JAN and more cases focused on accommodating individuals with motor / mobility impairments.  Prior to 1992, JAN averaged 630 accommodation inquiries per month. In 1992, cases soared to over 1,600 per month and continued to steadily rise throughout the 1990s, ending with an average of almost 3,000 per month.  JAN now averages 53,000+ inquiries and 5,000,000 Website customers annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/JANinformation#p/a/f/0/SBbfVNcNlAg JAN YouTube Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the JAN staff was evaluated by WESTAT, an employee-owned research corporation serving agencies of the U.S. Government, as well as businesses, foundations, and state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westat.com WESTAT]&lt;/ref&gt; JAN achieved recognition for achieving the highest score ever awarded by an outside evaluator.

==Services Provided==
JAN's consultants, each with at least a master's degree in a specialized field, provide information on accommodations for all types of impairments, including sensory, motor, cognitive, and psychiatric conditions. Information is also available about rights and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and related legislation. JAN continues to provide resources for veterans and returning wounded and injured military, including support for America's Heroes at Work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americasheroesatwork.org America's Heroes at Work]&lt;/ref&gt;

JAN also offers information about entrepreneurship for people with disabilities. JAN consultants handle each inquiry on a case-by-case basis offering self-employment and small business development expertise and referrals regarding business planning, financing strategies, marketing research, disability-specific programs, income supports and benefits planning, [[e-commerce]], independent contracting, home-based business options, and small business initiatives for disabled veterans. JAN customers can expect to receive a resource packet tailored to their specific entrepreneurial goals with consultants available throughout all stages of the process who can provide ongoing supports.

This technical assistance is provided in English and Spanish and is free of charge via telephone, email, chat, and postal mail. All communications are confidential and available to employers, medical, and rehabilitation professionals, people with disabilities as well as anyone else who is interested in workplace accommodations.

JAN consultants also provide information through other media. JAN produces monthly [[webcasts]] on various subjects on concerns related to disabilities or limitations in the workplace. Consultants frequently present at various conferences. Interested parties can also submit requests for local, distant, and remote training events.

==Partnerships and Collaborations==
JAN supports private employers by providing JAN’s customized Webcasts, Second Life training, online application systems and Website accessibility assessments, and other technical assistance materials designed specifically for their industries' workforce.

JAN has either a partnership or collaboration with the: 
*United States Business Leadership Network (USBLN) for its annual conference, Best Employer Practices Quarterly Webcasts, and monthly newsletter, among other projects. JAN provides a quarterly submission to USBLN newsletter. JAN also provides technical assistance to the Campaign for Disability Employment of which the USBLN is a collaborator. In addition, JAN provides considerable customized training for state BLN Chapters throughout the country.
*[[Assistive Technology Industry Association]] (ATIA) in the execution of its annual Employer’s Forum.
*EconSys and the Assistive Technology Collaboration as they develop a series of effective workplace practices for integrating assistive technology into the workplace for people with disabilities.
*Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program on projects such as the Perspectives on Employment of People with Disabilities Conference, JAN’s Federal Employer Winter Webcast Series, and CAPTEC Pentagon Innovation Days. JAN staff co-presents with CAP staff at Federal events and national conferences. In addition, JAN provided several hours of accommodation and ADAAA training for the EEOC/DoD Disability Program Manager Training and Certification Pilot Training Course.
*[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) on efforts such as the design of LEAD Program Schedule A materials, dissemination of ADA-related guidance materials, collaboration for JAN’s Federal Employer Winter Webcast Series, and presentations at the EEOC’s  Excel Conference. In addition, JAN provided several hours of accommodation and ADAAA training for the EEOC/DoD Disability Program Manager Training and Certification Pilot Training Course.
*Members of the  National Industry Liaison Group by providing assessments of  its online application system and general Websites for accessibility using the  ODEP funded Accessible Systems Racing League tool.
*USDA TARGET Center to provide an assistive technology (AT) room where employers and others can test AT. This occurred previously at the JAN Conferences and in 2009 at the USBLN Conference. JAN staff members visited the TARGET Center while in Washington, DC to review the latest assistive technologies, and JAN continues to explore future Web links to TARGET Center resources and from TARGET's Website to JAN resources. JAN has engaged the TARGET Center in the development of its  Federal Employer Winter Webcast Series to promote the hiring of people with disabilities in the Federal government.
*Gettinghired.com with a relatively new collaboration.  JAN is now on the Advisory Council and has developed reciprocal links from respective Websites.  In addition, JAN has a training scheduled for JAN staff to learn more about Gettinghired.com's resources for individuals with disabilities who are looking for work. This will streamline JAN's referrals to individuals who may contact JAN while looking for work.   Gettinghired.com’s job board also presents JAN with one more resource for recruiting new employees.
*ODEP’s America's Heroes At Work (AHAW) to develop JAN reference materials on the Website prior to the August 2008 launch.  JAN provided consultation on accommodation issues to AHAW staff, including ODEP’s subcontractor.  JAN developed a Veterans Blog on the JAN Website for use by AHAW and other veterans' programs.
*Regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs) through numerous Webcasts, podcasts, and other events. In addition, JAN presents on accommodations and the employment provisions of the ADA at the DBTAC national conference and both groups cross-refer when appropriate. Historically, JAN also involved the local regional DBTAC in the annual JAN Conference. JAN continues this tradition by working with the USBLN to include a DBTAC in its annual conference.
*American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) as JAN and AAPD reviewed each respective Website to insure the inclusion of links and information about each organization. In addition, JAN was a co-sponsor of this year’s AAPD Disability Mentoring Day in Duluth, MN.
*[[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] as JAN conducts several trainings per year that engage the employment support personnel of the National MS Society on a state and national level. JAN has involved the National MS Society in conferences and monthly Webcasts. In addition, JAN has reviewed documents targeting employers that relate to developing policies under the ADA.
*National Association of ADA Coordinators by hosting the NAADAC Website.
*National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) in collaboration with DOL partners, including ODEP’s America’s Heroes at Work project, JAN provided training at the DOL EEOC Forum as well as at the national NASWA Conference. JAN also gave a teleconference presentation on "ADA Update" for the Equal Opportunity Committee meeting of NASWA.
*Other employer groups such as the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the  Disability Management Employers Coalition, the [[American Bar Association]], and the  National Industry Liaison Group to provide training for members as well as disseminate information.
*Virtual-based [[Second Life]] groups such as Virtual Ability, Virtual Helping Hands (including Helen Keller Day in Second Life), [[TechSoup]], and the Second Life Bar Association to provide training, technical assistance, and virtual referrals.

==Bloody Bill==
{{Main|William T. Anderson}}
'''Bloody Bill''' (portrayed by Jeremy Bouvet) appeared in the 2004 movie ''[[Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill]]'' and is based on real life Confederate soldier William T. Anderson. Before the events of the movie, he was a notorious for slaying members of the Union and those of African descent. After his sister was killed by vigilantes, he made a pact with [[Satan]] that caused the village of Sunset Valley to stand still in a limbo where time stood still and became extremely hard to kill.

Up until the end of the movie, he accumulated one hundred five zombie-like minions that are possessed humans that died by Bloody Bill and his minions, each one having a resistance to pain that allows them to survive otherwise painful injuries like getting shot in the heart and can infect the living by biting them. Bloody Bill himself is strong enough to crush human skulls with his bare hands, is tough enough to withstand grenades at close range, and is equipped with his Confederate saber, the only weapon effective against him. Although not confirmed, his saber is most likely an 1858 Light Cavalry Saber.

==Martians==
{{Main|Martian (The War of the Worlds)}}
The '''Martians''' appear in the 2005 film ''[[H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (David Michael Latt film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a.k.a. ''Invasion''), an adaptation of the [[The War of the Worlds|novel]] by [[H. G. Wells]], and its 2008 sequel ''[[War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave]]''. They invaded Earth in massive walking war-machines called '''Squid Walkers''' to massacre and farm the human populace. They presumably migrated to Earth for the same reason as their novel counterparts - to escape the harsh environment of Mars which was leading them to extinction. After humanity failed to defeat them with conventional weapons, the aliens died due to lack of immunity to earthly bacteria. In the sequel, another race of Martians, a race of biomechanical [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|Tripods]], attempt another invasion only to be defeated by George Herbert.

In the first film, the aliens (not directly stated to be Martians) appear as insectoid creatures rather than the bulkish octopi of Wells' novel. They stand upon four legs, from which they can secrete a corrosive acid. Upon death they are seen to stand erect and paralyzed.

==Jolly Roger==
Roger Laforge is an [[undead]] pirate who appeared in the 2005 film ''[[Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove]]'' portrayed by Rhett Giles. Jolly was killed in 1719 when his disgusted crew rebelled after he murdered the priests and nuns aboard a ship during a raid. Jolly's head was then severed, stuck in a chest, and dumped in the sea. The mutinous crew subsequently used their former captain's treasure to give up their pirate ways and found the town of Cutter's Cove, which the chest containing Jolly's head washed up on the shore of after a hurricane in the modern day. His [[vengeful spirit]] released when the chest was opened, Jolly set about murdering the seventeen descendants of his crew, having made a deal with the Devil that will allow him to reclaim his stolen treasure once he acquires the heads of all the descendants.

A demonic being, Roger Laforge can teleport, produce flames from his fingers, possesses superhuman strength, and can sense who his targets are and their exact location. While he usually beheads his victims with a cutlass, Blackbeard also wields both a blunderbuss and spiked chains as weapons.

===Maxim Light Dragon===
The '''Maxim Light Dragon''' appeared in the 2009 movie ''[[Dragonquest (film)|Dragonquest]]''. It is a dragon designed to counter Kirill Flaming Dragon from the six Stones of Virtue after they are placed in Maxim's medallion. Although it has no fire-based powers, it has more physical strength.

==The Hillside Cannibals==
The '''Hillside [[Cannibalism|Cannibals]]''' appear in the 2006 film ''[[Hillside Cannibals]]''.

Apparently descendants of [[Sawney Bean]] (portrayed by [[Leigh Scott]]), the cannibals live in the caves of the [[Mojave desert]] and survive by eating and scavenging off of travelers where the Hillside Cannibals are aided by the local [[sheriff]] Lachlan (portrayed by Louis Graham) who is also a cannibal. The "Sawney Bean" name is given to the current chief of the cannibals.

The cannibals (whose weapons include axes, knives, hatchets, shears and machetes) have their own language (though they seem to understand English) and, presumably due to inbreeding, most of them are deformed. Their members include Callum (portrayed by Vaz Andreas), Magnus (portrayed by Frank Pachecho), Rhian (portrayed by Erica Kessler), Tog (portrayed by Marie Westbrook), Towart (portrayed by Thomas Downey), Tearlach (portrayed by Crystal Napoles), Balloch (portrayed by Brian J. Garland), and the unnamed first chief.

Over the course of the film, several of the cannibals (including the current Sawney Bean and his immediate predecessor) are killed by their latest prey and a man hunting them where he was convinced that they either killed or assimilated his daughters. Some of the Hillside Cannibals managed to survive and kill all their assailants with the sole survivor Linda being recaptured and returned to them by Sheriff Lachlan when she manages to escape. The final scene shows the current "Sawney Bean" wearing Linda's face and having sex with one of the female cannibals as Linda's corpse rots in the nearby corner.

==Chris Vale==
'''Christopher "Chris" Vale''' appears in the 2006 film ''[[Halloween Night]]'' where his monstrous adult form is played by Scot Nery and his child form is played by Sam Stone. On Halloween in 1982, Chris witnessed two masked men rape and murder his mother, having been hired to do so by his father, who hid his wife's body behind a wall and committed suicide afterward. Institutionalized after this tragedy, Chris, left nearly mute and resembling a charred [[zombie]] due to burns inflicted by a steam pipe ruptured during the attack on his mother, escapes exactly ten years after his parents' deaths via murdering two sadistic orderlies playing a Halloween prank and taking one's uniform and Halloween mask.

Acquiring a medieval executioner costume and weapon accessories, specifically an axe, sword and a dagger, by killing a man named Todd and his girlfriend at a gas station, Chris makes his way to his childhood home where a Halloween party is being held after stealing their car. Upon arriving at his former home, Chris murders a number of party guests before uncovering his mother's skeleton and escaping, putting the executioner costume on the party's host, who is mistakenly shot to death by his girlfriend. The next day, Chris is seen walking down a stretch highway, where an oblivious motorist picks him up.

==Z-Bots==
The '''Z-Bots''' appeared in the 2007 movie ''[[Transmorphers]]'' and its prequel ''[[Transmorphers: Fall of Man]]''. The Primates are [[robot]]s that originate from an extraterrestrial planet and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most z-bots are roughly human-sized while one was several hundred feet tall.

In the prequel, they produced an oxygen-rich wave that caused Earth's machinery to be turned into hominid-sized rogue agents.  The most notable was a truck that used its axles as machine guns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers. This particular zbot agent is affectionately referred to by fans as "'''Axlebot'''". The robots are known more commonly in the films as "The Machines".

==Nemo Mechanical Squids==
The '''Nemo Mechanical [[Squid]]s''' are pair of robotic squids in the 2007 movie ''[[30,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''. They are estimated to be around 75 feet long, can move extremely fast, are armed with clamps at the ends of their tentacles, and were designed by Captain Nemo to defend the Nautilus. One of them was destroyed by a sea wolf-type submarine while the other was repelled by the Aquanaut 3 emitting an interference signal.

==Viral Mutants==
The '''Viral [[Mutant (fictional)|Mutant]]s''' appeared in the 2007 movie ''[[I Am Omega]]''.

The Hunter tracked them down and slayed one, while the other escaped and began killing humans for food. It was killed when humans used the Hunter technology against it.

The Spideroid Aliens are noted for their deliberate resemblance to the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorphs]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]], though they are green rather than black. They can travel at great speeds on their spider legs. The creature was criticized for the poor CGI animation.

==Hunter==
The '''Hunter''' appeared in the 2007 movie ''AVH: Alien vs. Hunter''. This masked human is obsessed with hunting lower species, including human like Xenons and the bull Xenon. Despite being promoted to looking like a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] from the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator franchise]]'', the armor appears far similar to the titular monster from ''[[Zeiram]]''. Hunter is portrayed by Rob Filson.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database, AVH: Alien vs. Hunter, Cast and Crew, Retrieved March 8, 2011 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1094162/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

He was eventually teleported back to his own time where he was trapped in a cliff and died. Stock footage of Big Red is used in "Journey to the Center of the Earth." The creature is likely a [[Tyrannosaurus]]-like dinosaur due to the presence of Pteranodons and raptors.

===Dromaeosaur===

==Creatures from Journey to the Center of the Earth==
A list of prehistoric creatures that appeared in the 2008 Asylum film version of [[Jules Verne]]'s "[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 direct-to-video film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]."

===Tyrannosaurus===
The '''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''' is one of the largest land predators ever to exist on Earth. they seem to hunt alone. A Tyrannosaurus ambushes one of the soldiers in the beginning of the film.

===Giant Trapdoor Spider===
This '''Trapdoor Spider''' lives in a chamber which it makes in the desert . Like 
Trapdoor spiders, they feed parts of their kill to the spiderlings in the form of saliva. The spider uses the trip lines of its trapdoor to sense for any small-to-medium-sized creatures that disturb them, and pounces on its victim.

===Pteranodon===
Like ordinary '''[[Pteranodon]]s''' of the same name, these flying reptiles are no threat to the soldiers and probably catch fish in their jaws. Stock footage from 100 Million BC was used for the Pteranodon.

===Raptors===
These '''[[Velociraptor|Raptors]]''' move with surprising speed and seem to hunt alone. One of these vicious beasts tries to hunt the team of soldiers but is killed and cooked by them to be eaten.

===Lava Worms===

===Unspecified Theropod===
The '''Unspecified Theropod''' resembles an [[Allosaurus]]. It was spotted feeding on an unknown carcass by one of the soldiers on her binoculars. It has a small row of spines on its back and also has an unusual red pigmentation. Stock footage from "100 Million BC" was used for the creature.

==Creatures from AE: Apocalypse Earth==

==Megaliths==
The '''Megaliths''' are from the 2008 ''[[The Day the Earth Stopped]]''. They are extraterrestrial [[robot]]s, 666 in all, who land in every major capital in the world. In one shot one is standing next to the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, presumably making them roughly 1,060 feet tall. They do not start attacking, though. Instead, the benevolent, though hostile aliens controlling the robots present humanity with an ultimatum: Prove the value of human life before the end of the day, or they will destroy the world. The robots spend most of the film standing in the same spot, and lethal force on armed humans is only used twice. They are armed with a device in the right hand which reduces targets into dust. They are also invulnerable to nuclear weapons, as one which was hit by a nuclear rocket emerges seemingly untouched; this scene may be an homage to a similar scene in the 1953 film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''. They are armed with a laser in each palm, a pair of laser cannons in the "neck", and an electric beam in the head.

Due to the film's similarities to ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and its [[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|2008 remake]], it is assumed the Megalists are loosely based on the character [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]], a robot which similarly provokes humanity's fear.

==Mike Watson==
'''Mike Watson''' appeared in the 2008 movie ''[[100 Feet]]'' (not technically an Asylum film as it was distributed by the company). Before the events of the movie, Mike Watson was a violent [[police officer]] for the NYPD before he was killed by his wife Marine in self-defense.

Mike Watson has typical ghost powers such as invisibility, intangibility, and telekinesis as well as superhuman strength. At the end of the movie, Marine takes off her wedding ring and tells Mike to go away causing him to finally rest in peace.

He was portrayed by [[Michael Paré]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database, 100 Feet, Cast and Crew, Retrieved October 28, 2011 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0899128/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar size to Mega Shark, Giant Octopus has a similar history except it roamed the western half of the Pacific, primarily attacking Japan. It died in the final battle with the Mega Shark, presumably through loss of blood. It had notably less screen time than its co-star.

==="The Dinosaur"===
Also known as the "Monster of Whitechapel", the '''"Dinosaur"''' is a small [[Tyrannosaurus]] that is first seen terrorizing [[Whitechapel]] and then spends most of the film stealing materials from factories around Whitechapel for further inventions. The creature is revealed to be artificial when Sherlock Holmes discovers that its skin is made from rubber. It is roughly the size than an average man and is noted for its intelligence and speed. Its snout is more similar to that of a [[Baryonyx]] than a Tyrannosaurus.

==="Dragon"===
The '''"[[Dragon]]"''' appears in the climactic battle scene of the film. Thorpe Holmes/Spring-Heeled Jack created a huge mechanical dragon to set fire to [[London]] and frame [[Inspector Lestrade]] for committing his crimes. Unlike his other inventions, Jack pilots this monster from inside and it is armour-plated instead of featuring synthetic skin. The dragon is destroyed when Sherlock Holmes collides another flying machine directly into it, crashing to the gardens of [[Buckingham Palace]].

===Anesidora Ivory and Spring Heeled Jack===
Thorpe Holmes also created a mechanical female accomplice named '''Anesidora Ivory'''. She appears as an attractive middle-class Victorian human but has ice-cold skin and clockwork interiors, similar to the [[List of Doctor Who robots#C|Clockwork Robots]] of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' universe. She is programmed to pose as the niece of Thorpe's cover identity, and is given the job of destroying [[Buckingham Palace]]. Ivory is defeated by Watson, but is seen before the credits in 1940. A pheasant wandering outside Thorpe's hideout is later revealed to be robotic as well, as it malfunctions and deactivates briefly as Thorpe activates his dragon.

Thorpe himself, who is an original character, creates a bio-mechanical suit, vaguely resembling a [[Cyberman]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', with 19th-century [[steampunk]] touches. This copper suit allows him to overcome his paralysation (caused by being shot in the spine seven years earlier) and with this alter-ego he was affectionately named by the film's producers as '''Spring-Heeled Jack''' (named after the [[Spring-heeled Jack|mythical creature of the same name]]). After Holmes solves the case and defeats Thorpe, it is unknown what happens to his creatures. They are likely to have been hidden by [[Scotland Yard]] in an attempt to cover up the conspiracy. The mask of Thorpe's suit can be seen in the final shot that features Holmes and Watson together.

==Fish==
===Mega Piranha===
The '''Mega [[Piranha]]''' appeared in the 2010 movie ''[[Mega Piranha]]''. Genetically mutated killing machines, these fish double in size every 72 hours. They are extremely carnivorous, to the point of cannibalism. However, they have little intelligence as they often throw themselves onto dry land in attempts to eat smaller organisms. Once they reached the size of nuclear submarines they are inexplicably invulnerable to nuclear weapons. They are defeated when they are tricked into eating each other.

===Sharks===
====Mega Shark====
The '''Mega Shark''' appeared in the 2009 movie ''[[Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus]]'' and three sequels: ''[[Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus]]'', ''[[Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark]]'' and ''[[Mega Shark vs. Kolossus]]''. This 1500-foot [[megalodon]] was fighting with a Giant Octopus until they were flash-frozen in an iceberg. After being released from the ice the shark rampages across the Pacific. It fought the Giant Octopus and, in the sequels, the Crocosaurus, Mecha Shark, and Kolossus.

In the second movie, the Megalodon is revealed to be female and in ''[[Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark]]'', the Megalodon was male. She has a difficult time using her senses in low light areas, due to the tumor in her brain. The Megalodon is criticized for its rapid stress changes throughout the films, as well as the films' outlandish plots.

====2-Headed Great White Shark====
The '''2-Headed [[Great white shark|Great White Shark]]''' appeared in the 2012 movie ''[[2-Headed Shark Attack]]''. It is a naturally mutated great white shark with two heads that lived to its adult stage estimated around 40 feet in length. The 2-Headed Great White Shark feeds on the likes of [[giant squid]]s and [[megamouth shark|megamouths]]. It also possesses great strength as it used its body to sink an atoll on a coral reef and survived a dynamite sized explosion that took off its left head. This shark is noted to not only have twice the sensory power of a normal great white, but also can maneuver in waters as shallow as four feet deep and presumably has an extremely high metabolism as it consumed twenty-one humans within the course of several hours.

The design for the 2-Headed Great White Shark was created by [[Cleve Hall]] and his family as seen in the ''[[Monster Man (TV series)|Monster Man]]'' episode "Seeing Double." It was originally supposed to have the heads on top of each other, but Cleve Hall pushed to change the design.

====3-Headed Great White Shark====
The '''3-Headed Great White Shark''' is an advanced version of the above creature in the 2015 sequel ''[[3-Headed Shark Attack]]'' where it sports three heads.

====5-Headed Great White Shark====

The '''[[Colossal Squid]]''' is an enormous deep sea monster that is estimated to be over 45 feet long. Although seen at the beginning of the movie attacking an oil rig, it is later discovered to be just a curious animal. It serves as the portal's guardian.

===Giant Dungeness Crab===
The '''Giant Dungeness Crab''' is a large crab encountered by Sinbad. It steals Sinbad's briefcase filled with money after being irritated by the pistol shots fired by him.

===Wyverns===
The '''[[Wyvern]]s''' resemble giant versions of the [[Rhamphorhynchus]]. These animals capture Sinbad and his crew to feed to their young only for them to fight them off and flee into a cave.

===Cave Cyclops===
The '''Cave [[Cyclops]]''' is a twelve-foot cyclops armed with a club that lives in a cave. It encounters Sinbad's crew and tries to fight them off until it is stabbed in the eye with a torch and dies by impalement on a stalagmite.

===Winged Fire Demon===
The '''Winged Fire [[Demon]]''' is a winged pyrokinetic demon Sinbad encounters in an underground tunnel. Before it can do any real harm to Sinbad, it is destroyed when Sinbad blows up a mountain using C4.

==Crocosaurus==
The '''Crocosaurus''' is from ''[[Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus]]''. This giant monster's size is very inconsistent throughout the movie, ranging from 50 to 1500 feet long in various scenes. Originating in Africa, she is capable of producing hundreds of eggs at a time, can burrow underground, and has armor thick enough to withstand bites from Mega Shark with no visible damage. Along with Mega Shark, Crocosaurus and her offspring are killed by volcanic activity while battling off the coast of Hawaii.

According to game hunter Nigel Putman, her young are roughly 2–3 feet long when at birth, but 3 year old crocosaurs  can be from 13 feet upwards, indicating that some can grow to full adulthood within years in order to keep the species alive.

==Moby Dick==
{{Main|Moby-Dick}}
'''Moby Dick''' appeared in the 2010 movie ''[[Moby Dick (2010 film)|Moby Dick]]'', a very loose adaptation of the [[Moby-Dick|novel]] by [[Herman Melville]]. Roughly 57 feet long and swimming up to 36 kilometers an hour, this gigantic, white ''Leviathan melvillei'' primarily lived in polar waters and existed as far back as 1869. According to the photographs and Michelle's estimates, Moby Dick is around 57 feet in length and can swim at amazing speeds. Moby Dick also possesses the ability to breach quickly for a short period of time and in the beginning of the movie he was able to use echolocation to stun objects. This is later proved useless against echolocation-proof submarines. Although hunted by the USS Pequod, it was eventually able to take out the entire crew, sustaining little damage in the process.

==Mega Pythons==
'''Mega Pythons''' appeared in the 2011 movie ''[[Mega Python vs. Gatoroid]]''. These pythons actually resemble boa constrictors and grew to at least 20 feet in length, thanks to experimental pheromones. Eventually Mega Pythons are seen to be over 120 feet long with their offspring already the size of normal [[Burmese Python]]s.

==Giant Alligator==
The '''Giant [[Alligator]]''' appeared in the 2011 movie ''[[Mega Python vs. Gatoroid]]''. Unlike the gatoroids that were the result of being fed steroid-injected chickens, this giant [[American Alligator|American alligator]] was around long before the beginning of the story. It is estimated to be over 20 feet long. Hunters planned to shoot it, but it was attacked and killed by a Mega Python instead.

==Gatoroids==
'''Gatoroids''' appeared in the 2011 movie ''[[Mega Python vs. Gatoroid]]''. They are [[American alligator]]s mutated by illegally being fed steroid-injected [[chicken]]s so they can be used to hunt Mega Pythons. Although usually around 20 feet long, they can grow to over 150 feet and their offspring are the size of normal American alligators. Their attack on Miami used footage from the Miami, Panama Canal, and Hawaii attacks from ''Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus'' and their attack on Coloumbia used footage from the Yuccatan, Gulf of Mexico, and Hawaii attacks from ''Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus''.

==Sauceroid Aliens==
The '''Sauceroid Aliens''' appear in the 2011 movie ''[[Battle of Los Angeles (film)|Battle of Los Angeles]]''. They use a variety of technologies such as [[Flying saucer|saucers]], turrets, and even time travel to invade Earth.

===MJ12 Sentry===
The '''MJ12 Sentries''' are pair of [[cyborg]]s that heavily resemble humans. Powers include heavy armor that can withstand point blank machine gun fire, extendable arms that are ideal for impalement, sonic screams, and a floating [[gyroscope]] in the head that can cut through obstacles and enemies alike.

===Hibernation Chamber Guardian===
The '''Hibernation Chamber Guardian''' is 40 foot [[Mollusca|mollusk]]-like organism that guards the sauceroid aliens in their hibernation chamber and is armed with four tentacles. It is eventually destroyed when a grenade is tossed into its mouth.

==Muspelheim Inhabitants==
The '''Muspelheim Inhabitants''' are mystical entities from [[Muspelheim]] that are in the 2011 movie ''[[Almighty Thor]]''.

===Muspelheim Jackal===
The '''Muspelheim [[Jackal]]s''' are giant jackals commanded by [[Loki]]. Despite being very fast and have some armor plating they are easily taken out by close range weapons and have a rather bad sense of smell. They are estimated to be eight feet tall and eleven feet long.

===Muspelheim Land Worm===
Also commanded by Loki, the '''Muspelheim Land Worm''' is large [[lizard]]-like creatures with a head like a [[hammerhead shark]] and lacking legs while having arms to move around. Although stronger than the jackals, they too are taken out by close range weapons. They are estimated to be ten feet tall and twenty-five feet long.

==VM2 Zombies==
The '''VM2 [[Zombie]]s''' are various infected entities that appeared in the 2011 movie ''[[Zombie Apocalypse (film)|Zombie Apocalypse]]''. The VM2 viral strain originated in Europe and managed to become a global pandemic within the course of the month of its creation. The virus can be transmitted by physical contact and will infect within the course of a minute; during this time the veins and arteries will convulse and the eyes will change before the brain is fully infected.

===Standard VM2 Zombie===
The '''Standard VM2 Zombies''' are primary infected entities designed to carry the plague, although are easily distracted by loud noises. Loners are referred to as '''Stragglers''' used to scout for potential food. These zombies can survive minor brain damage such as arrow impalement as long as there is enough blood flowing into it.

===Julian's Dog===
'''Julian's [[Dog]]''' is a stray dog that followed the survivors because Julian tried to feed it and it became infected with the VM2 strain. Its only know capability is the ability to jump far.

===Runners===
The '''Runners''' are the faster and more predatory versions of the standard VM2 zombie.

===VM2 Tiger===
The '''VM2 [[Tiger]]s''' are two infected tigers that hunt the survivors at the end of the movie. They were able to withstand multiple arrows being struck into it, being assaulted by a [[katana]], and a sledge hammer to the face.

==Robo Hitler==
'''Robo Hitler''' appeared in the 2012 movie ''[[Nazis at the Center of the Earth]]''. After [[Adolf Hitler]]'s head was recovered by Dr. Josef Mengele, it was preserved deep under Antarctica until the year 2005 where his brain was reactivated by stem cells and a 12-foot-tall robotic suit of armor. With this suit, Robo Hitler commanded the [[Nazism|Nazi]] flying saucer to fire missiles armed with flesh eating bacteria until his saucer crashed by a suicide attempt by one of the doctors held hostage. Robo Hitler met his end when flesh-eating bacteria was inserted into his brain and upon falling into the Antarctic Ocean.

Robo Hitler is armed with a spear-like blade in each arm, a machine gun in the right arm, a fire extinguisher in his right index finger, and a torso laser designed to take down aircraft such as jets. This robotic suit could also easily jump around 30 feet in the air.

==Floater Bug Aliens==
The '''Floater Bug [[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]]''' appear in the 2012 movie ''[[American Warships]]''. They are [[cockroach]]-like aliens capable of hovering and are armed with a trigger-less flamethrower that launches radioactive fire balls. Using wreckage from sunken ships, they use a stealth ship with an LCD screen for camouflage armed with EMP missiles. The aliens thrive in radioactive environments and have a set of jaws on their abdomen that can chomp a human in half with little effort and have an exoskeleton strong enough to survive bazooka shells. They were eventually defeated by the crew of the USS ''Iowa''.

==Bigfoot==
'''[[Bigfoot]]''' appears in the 2012 movie ''[[Bigfoot (2012 film)|Bigfoot]]''. It is a 20 foot tall carnivorous [[ape]] that roamed the forests of [[South Dakota]]. As it tried to hibernate one winter, a combination of construction equipment and a rock festival prevented it from going to sleep. This caused Bigfoot to attack in order to correct its biological imbalance of sense of time. Bigfoot is noted to have a short resistance to pain as it almost withstood having half his face burned off and barely flinched. It was killed by a barrage of missiles while it was on top of [[Mount Rushmore]].

'''Louise Stevens Bryant''' (1885–1956) was an American [[public health]] specialist, writer, editor and publicist. She was especially involved in the fields of [[human sexuality]] and [[maternal health]], and was the executive secretary of [[Robert Latou Dickinson]]'s Committee on Maternal Health from 1927 to 1935.

==Career==
Bryant attended [[Smith College]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1908.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss219.html|title=Louise Stevens Bryant Papers, 1885–1963|publisher=[[Five College Archives and Manuscript Collections]]|accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then worked at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], where she worked in school reform, followed by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where she worked in [[Lightner Witmer]]'s [[clinical psychology]] clinic for children and simultaneously studied for a PhD in medical science which she received in 1914. After completing her PhD, she worked at the Philadelphia Municipal Court, first as chief of the criminal department's division for women, and then, during the war, as a statistician for the chief of staff.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=James|title=The Birth Control Movement and American Society: From Private Vice to Public Virtue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNn_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA443|date=July 14, 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5659-6|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1919 to 1923&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; she worked for the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] as the educational and publications secretary.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

In 1923, Bryant joined the public health field as an employee of the New York-based Committee on Dispensary Development. In 1927 she was hired by [[Robert Latou Dickinson]] as the executive secretary of the National Committee on Maternal Health (CMH). During Bryant's time as secretary, she edited numerous CMH publications, including ''Control of Conception'', a 1931 handbook of contraceptive techniques, and other academic studies on sexology, contraception, abortion and sterility. She left the CMH in 1935 after a disagreement with Dickinson.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

Bryant served as the American representative of the English sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]]&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; and helped him to negotiate the second American publication of his seven-volume work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.vqronline.org/essay/letters-american|journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]|volume=16|issue=2|year=1940|title=Letters to an American|first=Havelock|last=Ellis|accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a publicist for the [[American Association of University Women]] from 1938 to 1952.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Personal life==
Louise Stevens Bryant married Arthur Bryant in 1909; they divorced in 1912.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Her romantic partner for almost 35 years was [[Lura Beam]], a writer and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terry|first=Jennifer|title=An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6pGoWWLfhEC&amp;pg=PA439|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-79367-2|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met in the 1920s while both were working for the CMH. After Bryant's death in 1956, Beam published a biography about her titled ''Bequest From a Life; a Biography of Louise Stevens Bryant'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/msl/maine/writdisplay.shtml?id=94749|title= Beam, Lura (1887–1978)|publisher=Maine State Library|accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">'''Mae Brown''' (1935-1973) was the second [[deafblindness|deaf-blind]] woman and the first deaf-blind Canadian to earn a university degree. She graduated from the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]] in 1972.

Brown was born in Thunder Bay in 1935. Her sight and hearing deteriorated throughout her childhood; by high school her vision had deteriorated to the point where she could not read a blackboard, and she dropped out.&lt;ref name="sister"&gt;Sister breathes life into memories of Mae Brown; Determination beat back her darkness. Guelph Mercury (Ontario, Canada), Retrieved from www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic&lt;/ref&gt; An operation performed on Brown later in her teens to remove a brain tumor led to the complete loss of her hearing as well.&lt;ref name="introducing"&gt;WINBERG, M. (2002, Jun 9). INTRODUCING MISS BROWN. Toronto Sun, The (Ontario, Canada), p. S24.. Retrieved from http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14EA1A902EA4FAA0?p=AWNB&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown registered with the [[CNIB|Canadian National Institute for the Blind]], who provided her with training in communication methods such as [[Braille]], and employment.&lt;ref name="introducing" /&gt; CNIB also provided Brown with a tutor to help her complete her high school education. When Brown enrolled at the University of Toronto, the CNIB found an interpreter for her, Joan Mactavish, as well as a team of 35 volunteers who translated Brown's textbooks into Braille.&lt;ref name="sister" /&gt; Mactavish translated lectures and exams for Brown using finger-spelling into Brown's hand. Brown was able to give her responses orally. Some exams took multiple days to complete using this process, and Brown's degree in history and psychology ultimately took 5 years for her to earn.&lt;ref name="bravo brown"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=Megan|title=Bravo, Miss Brown!|journal=U of T Magazine|issue=Summer 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Brown returned to employment with CNIB, becoming their head of deaf-blind affairs and implementing networks and services for deaf-blind people in Canada.&lt;ref name="sister" /&gt; These included social groups, publications, and testing of technological devices.&lt;ref name="fox fame"&gt;Nicholas Keung Toronto, S. (n.d). Teacher, student made great strides Terry Fox Hall of Fame honours 5. Toronto Star (Canada). &lt;/ref&gt;

Brown died suddenly in 1973 of another brain tumor. An autopsy revealed that it and the numerous other tumors within her body were caused by [[neurofibromatosis]].&lt;ref name="sister" /&gt; Her college tutor, Joan Mactavish, continued to implement her ideas for deaf-blind interventions after Brown's death. Their joint work was recognized by their induction into the [[Terry Fox Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="fox fame" /&gt;

'''Maledictology''' (from Latin ''maledicere'', "to say [something] (''dicere'') bad (''male'')" and Greek ''logia'', "study of") is a branch of [[psychology]] that does research into cursing and swearing. It is influenced by American psychologist [[Timothy Jay]] (Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts) and the philologist and researcher in swearwords  [[Reinhold Aman]] (California). They assume that swearing is part of human life and can even act as a passive self-defense, since it prevents palpable argument.

'''[[Medical malpractice]]''' is [[professional negligence]] by act or omission by a [[health care provider]] in which the treatment provided falls below the accepted standard of practice in the medical community and causes [[injury]] or death to the [[patient]], with most cases involving [[medical error]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1921690|title = The Medical Liability Climate and Prospects for Reform|last = Mello|first = Michelle M.|date = November 26, 2014|journal = JAMA|accessdate = December 2, 2014|doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.10705|pmid = 25358122|volume = 312|issue = 20|pages = 2146–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of medical malpractice, when pursued in [[United States of America|US]] [[List of courts of the United States|courts]], are processed as [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil]] [[United States tort law|torts]]. Sometimes an act of medical malpractice will also constitute a criminal act, as in the case of the [[Conrad Murray#Michael Jackson.27s Death|death of Michael Jackson]].

Medical professionals may obtain [[professional liability insurance]]s to offset the costs of [[lawsuits]] based on medical malpractice. Further establishment of conditions of intention or malice may be applied where applicable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1618741|year=2006|author1=Thornton|first1=R.

== Frequency and cost of medical errors ==
Back in 1984, the extrapolated statistics from relatively few records in only several states of the United States estimated that between 44,000-98,000 people annually die in hospitals because of medical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/ecp/novdec00/sox.htm |title=How Many Deaths Are Due to Medical Error? Getting the Number Right |publisher=Effective Clinical Practice, November/December 2000. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518101434/http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/ecp/novdec00/sox.htm |archivedate=2014-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much work has been done since then, including work by the author of that study who moved on from those low estimates back in the 1990s. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that 75,000 patients die annually, in hospitals alone, from infections alone - just one cause of harm in just one kind of care setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/surveillance/index.html|title=HAI Data and Statistics - HAI - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From all causes there have been numerous other studies, including "A New, Evidence-based Estimate of Patient Harms Associated with Hospital Care" by John T. James, PhD&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx|title = A New, Evidence-based Estimate of Patient Harms Associated with Hospital Care|last = James|first = John T.|date = September 2013|journal = Journal of Patient Safety|accessdate = 13 August 2014|doi = 10.1097/PTS.0b013e3182948a69|pmid = |pages = 122–128|volume = 9|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that estimates 400,000 unnecessary deaths annually in hospitals alone. Using these numbers, medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the United States, only behind heart disease and cancer. Less than one quarter of care takes place in hospitals. Across all care settings the numbers are higher.

Another study notes that about 1.14 million patient-safety incidents occurred among the 37 million hospitalizations in the Medicare population over the years 2000-2002.  Hospital costs associated with such medical errors were estimated at $324 million in October 2008 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/16/us-medicare-errors-idUSTRE6AF5SM20101116 |title=Errors kill 15,000 aged patients a month: study |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 17,000 malpractice cases are filed in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bazemore|first1=Nichole|title=Does Your Doctor Have Malpractice Claims? How To Find Out|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amino/2016/04/19/does-your-doctor-have-malpractice-claims-how-to-find-out/#13eb7f8e55a6|accessdate=7 March 2018|publisher=Forbes.com|date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The medical malpractice claim==

===The parties===
The plaintiff is/ was the patient, or a legally designated party acting on behalf of the patient, or{{spaced ndash}}in the case of a [[wrongful death]] suit{{spaced ndash}}the executor or administrator of a deceased patient's estate.

The defendant is the health care provider.  Although a 'health care provider' usually refers to a physician, the term includes any medical care provider, including dentists, nurses, and therapists. As illustrated in ''Columbia Medical Center of Las Colinas v Bush'', 122 S.W. 3d 835 (Tex. 2003), "following orders" may not protect nurses and other non-physicians from liability when committing negligent acts. Relying on vicarious liability or direct corporate negligence, claims may also be brought against hospitals, clinics, managed care organizations or medical corporations for the mistakes of their employees and contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornton|first1=Russell G.|title=Responsibility for the acts of others|journal=Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings|date=Jul 2010|volume=23|issue=3|pages=313–315|pmc=2900989|accessdate=|pmid=21240324|doi=10.1080/08998280.2010.11928641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common claims===
In 2013, BMJ Open performed a study in which they found that "failure to diagnose" accounted for the largest portion of medical malpractice claims brought against health professionals. Furthermore, the study found that the most common result of this negligence was death of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=The epidemiology of malpractice claims in primary care: a systematic review |journal=BMJ Open |pmc=3693415 |pmid=23869100 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002929 |volume=3 |author=Wallace E, Lowry J, Smith SM, Fahey T |page=e002929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other most common categories of malpractice include negligent treatment and failure to warn.

Thus, when a patient claims injury as the result of a medical professional's care, a malpractice case will most often be based upon one of three theories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=S.Y.|title=Medical Malpractice: A Cardiovascular Perspective|journal=Cardiovascular Therapeutics|date=June 2012|volume=30|issue=3|pages=e140-e145|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00254.x/full|accessdate=27 July 2017|doi=10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00254.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Failure to diagnose: a medical professional is alleged to have failed to diagnose an existing medical condition, or to have provided an incorrect diagnoses for the patient's medical condition.
# Negligent treatment: a medical professional is alleged to have made a mistake that a reasonably competent professional in the same position would not have made.
# Failure to warn: a medical professional is alleged to have treated the patient without first warning the patient of known risks and obtaining the patient’s [[informed consent]] to that course of treatment.

===Elements of the case===
A plaintiff must establish all five elements of the tort of negligence for a successful medical malpractice claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1997 |url=http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/risk/malpractice/malpractice_2.html |title=The Four Elements of Medical Malpractice |publisher=Yale New Haven Medical Center: Issues in Risk Management }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A duty was owed: a legal duty exists whenever a hospital or health care provider undertakes care or treatment of a patient.
# A duty was breached: the provider failed to conform to the relevant standard care.
# The breach caused an injury: The breach of duty was a direct cause and the proximate cause of the injury.
# Deviation from the accepted standard: It must be shown that the practitioner was acting in a manner which was contrary to the generally accepted standard in his/her profession.
# Further establishment of conditions of intention or malice where applicable.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# Damage: Without damage (losses which may be pecuniary or emotional), there is no basis for a claim, regardless of whether the medical provider was negligent.  Likewise, damage can occur without negligence, for example, when someone dies from a fatal disease.

In cases involving suicide, physicians and particularly psychiatrists may be to a different standard than other defendants in a tort claim. In most tort cases, suicide is legally viewed as an act which terminates a chain of causality. Although the defendant may be held negligent for another's suicide, he or she is not responsible for damages which occur after the act. An exception is made for physicians who are found to have committed malpractice that results in a suicide, with damages assessed based on losses that are proved likely to accrue after the act of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, MC Giannini, AE Slaby. Suicide--The medical-legal implications. Psychiatric Forum. 14(2):6-10, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trial===

Like all other tort cases, the plaintiff or their attorney files a lawsuit in a court with appropriate jurisdiction. However, unlike other tort cases, many states require that a plaintiff take specific steps before a medical malpractice lawsuit can be filed, such as providing the defendant with advance notice of intent to sue, obtaining and filing with the court a ''certificate of merit'' from a qualified medical expert who attests to the validity of the plaintiff's cause of action, submitting the claim to a panel of legal and medical experts for evaluation, or participating in mediation in an attempt to resolve the claim without litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meschievitz|first1=Catherine S.|title=Mediation and Medical Malpractice: Problems With Definition and Implementation|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=1991|volume=54|issue=1|page=195|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4085&amp;context=lcp|accessdate=31 May 2017|doi=10.2307/1191859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the filing of suit and the trial, the parties are required to share information through [[Discovery (law)|discovery]].  Such information includes interrogatories, requests for documents and deposition.  If both parties agree, the case may be settled pre-trial on negotiated terms.  If the parties cannot agree, the case will proceed to trial.

The plaintiff has the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] to prove all the elements by a preponderance of evidence.  At trial, both parties will usually present experts to testify as to the standard of care required, and other technical issues.  The fact-finder (judge or jury) must then weigh all the evidence and determine which side is the most credible.

The fact-finder will render a verdict for the prevailing party.  If the plaintiff prevails, the fact-finder will assess damages within the parameters of the judge's instructions. The verdict is then reduced to the judgment of the court.  The losing party may move for a new trial. In a few jurisdictions, a plaintiff who is dissatisfied by a small judgment may move for [[additur]]. In most jurisdictions, a defendant who is dissatisfied with a large judgment may move for [[remittitur]].  Either side may take an [[appeal]] from the judgment.

===Expert testimony===

[[Expert witness]]es must be qualified by the Court, based on the prospective experts qualifications and the standards set from [[legal precedent]].  To be qualified as an expert in a medical malpractice case, a person must have a sufficient knowledge, education, training, or experience regarding the specific issue before the court to qualify the expert to give a reliable opinion on a relevant issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Expert%20witnesses|title=Expert witnesses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The qualifications of the expert are not the deciding factors as to whether the individual will be qualified, although they are certainly important considerations.  Expert testimony is not qualified "just because somebody with a diploma says it is so" (''United States v. Ingham'', 42 M.J. 218, 226 [A.C.M.R. 1995]). In addition to appropriate qualifications of the expert, the proposed testimony must meet certain criteria for reliability. In the United States, two models for evaluating the proposed testimony are used:

The more common (and some believe more reliable) approach used by all federal courts and most state courts is the 'gatekeeper' model, which is a test formulated from the US Supreme Court cases ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]'' (509 U.S. 579 [1993]), ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' (522 U.S. 136 [1997]), and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' (526 U.S. 137 [1999]). Before the trial, a [[Daubert]] hearing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reeg and Bebout |url=http://www.mobar.org/journal/1997/novdec/bebout.htm |title=What's It All About, Daubert? |publisher=Journal of the Missouri Bar |year=1993 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980123121236/http://www.mobar.org/journal/1997/novdec/bebout.htm |archivedate=1998-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; will take place before the judge (without the jury).  The trial court judge must consider evidence presented to determine whether an expert's "testimony rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand." (Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597).
The Daubert hearing considers 4 questions about the testimony the prospective expert proposes:
* Whether a "theory or technique . . . can be (and has been) tested"
* Whether it "has been subjected to peer review and publication".
* Whether, in respect to a particular technique, there is a high "known or potential rate of error"
* Whether there are "standards controlling the technique's operation".

Some state courts still use the Frye test that relies on scientific consensus to assess the admissibility of novel scientific evidence.  Daubert expressly rejected the earlier federal rule's incorporation of the Frye test. (Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-594)  Expert testimony that would have passed the Frye test is now excluded under the more stringent requirements of [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] as construed by Daubert.

In view of Daubert and Kuhmo, the pre trial preparation of expert witnesses is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Preparing Plaintiff's Expert in the Post Kuhmo Era, [[Anthony H. Gair]], [[New York State Bar Association]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with Daubert is that the presiding judge may admit testimony which derives from highly contested data. The judge may expand the limits contained in the "school of thought" precedent. Papers that are self-published may be admiited as the basis for expert testimony. Non-peer reviewed journals may also be admitted in similar fashion. The only criterion is the opinion of a single judge who, in all likelihood, has no relevant scientific or medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tancredi LR, Giannini AJ |title = The admissibility of scientific evidence in psychiatric malpractice: junk science and the Daubert case|journal = Journal of clinical forensic medicine|volume = 1|issue = 3|pages = 145–148|date = December 1994|pmid = 16371283|doi = 10.1016/1353-1131(94)90082-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states also require that a certificate of merit before a malpractice lawsuit be filed which requires a report from a medical physician that the physician accused of negligence breached the standard of care and caused injury to the patient.

===Damages===

The plaintiff's damages may include compensatory and, in some states and under qualifying circumstances, [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="statelaw"/&gt;

Compensatory damages are both economic and non-economic. 
* Economic damages include financial losses such as lost wages (sometimes called lost earning capacity), medical expenses and life care expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/nyregion/woman-wins-malpractice-suit-against-three-city-hospitals.html|title=Woman Wins Malpractice Suit Against Three City Hospitals|first=Matt|last=Flegenheimer|date=25 May 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These damages may be assessed for past and future losses.
* Non-economic damages are assessed for the injury itself: physical and psychological harm, such as loss of vision, loss of a limb or organ, the reduced enjoyment of life due to a disability or loss of a loved one, severe pain and emotional distress. Punitive damages are not available in all states and, when allowed, are usually only awarded in the event of wanton and reckless conduct.

==Statute of limitations==
{{main|Statute of Limitations}}
There is only a limited time during which a medical malpractice lawsuit can be filed. In the United States, these time limits are set by statute. In civil law systems, similar provisions are usually part of the civil code or criminal code and are often known collectively as "periods of prescription" or "prescriptive periods."  The length of the time period and when that period begins vary per jurisdiction and type of malpractice. Therefore, each state has different time limits set.&lt;ref name="statelaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Malpractice Law By State|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice_by_state/index.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, in Pennsylvania, there is a two-year statute of limitation,&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (2), {{cite web|title=42 Pa.C.S.A. Sec. 5525|url=https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/N45E3AB30B9E311E38D8E8F895E51E801?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)|website=Purdon's Pennsylvania Statutes and Consolidated Statutes|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in other states the limitations period may be longer. Most states have special provisions for minors that may potentially extend the statute of limitations for a minor who has been injured as the result of medical malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Liability/Malpractice Statutes of Limitation|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/medical-liability-malpractice-statutes-of-limitation.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of malpractice and compensation==
{{Further|Medical error}}
A 2011 study in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that 75% of physicians in "low-risk" specialties and virtually 100% of physicians in "high-risk" specialties could expect to face a malpractice claim during their careers. However, the authors also noted that the vast majority of malpractice claims did not lead to any indemnity payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jena AB, Seabury S, Lakdawalla D, Chandra A |title=Malpractice risk according to physician specialty |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=7 |pages=629&amp;ndash;36 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21848463 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1012370 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370 |pmc=3204310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most (73%) settled malpractice claims involve [[medical error]]. A 2006 study concluded that claims without evidence of error "are not uncommon, but most [72%] are denied compensation. The vast majority of expenditures [54%] go toward litigation over errors and payment of them. The overhead costs of malpractice litigation are exorbitant." Physicians examined the records of 1452 closed malpractice claims. Ninety-seven percent were associated with injury; of them, 73% got compensation. Three percent of the claims were not associated with injuries; of them, 16% got compensation. 63% were associated with errors; of them, 73% got compensation (average $521,560). Thirty-seven percent were not associated with errors; of them, 28% got compensation (average $313,205). Claims not associated with errors accounted for 13 to 16% percent of the total costs. For every dollar spent on compensation, 54 cents went to administrative expenses (including lawyers, experts, and courts). Claims involving errors accounted for 78 percent of administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/354/19/2024 Claims, Errors, and Compensation Payments in Medical Malpractice Litigation], [[New England Journal of Medicine]], May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1151658318847 Medical Malpractice Study, Disproving Frivolous Myth], Jeffrey B. Bloom, Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman &amp; Mackauf, [[The National Law Journal]], July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study of medical malpractice claims in the United States examining [[primary care]] malpractice found that though incidence of negligence in hospitals produced a greater proportion of severe outcomes, the total number of errors and deaths due to errors were greater for [[outpatient]] settings.  No single medical condition was associated with more than five percent of all negligence claims, and one-third of all claims were the result of misdiagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Phillips RL, Bartholomew LA, Dovey SM, Fryer GE, Miyoshi TJ, Green LA|title = Learning from malpractice claims about negligent, adverse events in primary care in the United States|journal = Qual Saf Health Care|volume = 13|issue = 2|pages = 121–126|date = April 2004|pmid = 15069219|pmc = 1743812|doi = 10.1136/qshc.2003.008029|url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15069219}}; [http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/press/aafpnewsreleases/april/malpractice.html lay-summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104531/http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/press/aafpnewsreleases/april/malpractice.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male doctors have nearly two and half times increased odds of having medico-legal action taken against them than female doctors, a result consistent across many years and found internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Unwin E, Woolf K, Wadlow C, Potts HW, Dacre J |title=Sex differences in medico-legal action against doctors: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMC Medicine |volume=13 |issue= |pages=172 |date=13 August 2015 |pmid= 26268807|doi=10.1186/s12916-015-0413-5 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/13/172 |pmc=4535538}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments about the medical liability system ==
{{Main|Tort reform}}
Doctors' groups, patients, and insurance companies have criticized medical malpractice litigation as expensive, adversarial, unpredictable, and inefficient. They claim that the cost of medical malpractice litigation in the United States has steadily increased at almost 12 percent annually since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/getwebcachedoc?webc=TILL/USA/2006/200603/2005_Tort.pdf#searc%20h=%22Tillinghast%20Towers%20Perrin%2C%20U.S.%20Tort%20Cos%0Ats%20and%20Cross-Border%20Perspectives%3A%202005%20Upda%0Ate%22] Towers Perrin, Tillinghast, U.S. Tort Costs and Cross-Border Perspectives: 2005 Update, (New York, NY: Towers Perrin, March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towerswatson.com/assets/pdf/3424/Towers-Watson-Tort-Report-1.pdf U.S. Tort Cost Trends 2010 Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128010535/http://www.towerswatson.com/assets/pdf/3424/Towers-Watson-Tort-Report-1.pdf |date=2012-01-28 }} Towers Watson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Jury Verdict Research, a database of plaintiff and defense verdicts, says awards in medical liability cases increased 43 percent in 1999, from $700,000 to $1,000,000. However, more recent research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that median medical malpractice awards in states range from $109,000 to $195,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=783 Medical Malpractice Insurance Claims in Seven States] U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics assert that these rate increases are causing doctors to go out of business or move to states with more favorable tort systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-journal.com/archives/20040611MedicalMalpracticeInsuranceRoundtableDoctorsPrescribeRemediesforCrisis.asp Medical Malpractice Insurance Roundtable: Doctors Prescribe Remedies for Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810042003/http://www.business-journal.com/archives/20040611MedicalMalpracticeInsuranceRoundtableDoctorsPrescribeRemediesforCrisis.asp |date=2006-08-10 }}. The Business Journal, Jun 11, 2004, accessed August 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone agrees, though, that medical malpractice lawsuits are solely causing these rate increases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Medical malpractice#Arguments about the medical liability system]]&lt;/ref&gt;   A 2003 report from the [[General Accounting Office]] found multiple reasons for these rate increases, with medical malpractice lawsuits being the primary driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03702.pdf GAO-03-702 Medical Malpractice Insurance: Multiple Factors Have Contributed to Increased Premium Rates] General Accounting Office, June 2003, accessed August 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite noting multiple reasons for rate increases, the report goes on to state that the "GAO found that losses on medical malpractice claims-which make up the largest part of insurers’ costs-appear to be the primary driver of rate increases in the long run." More recent data has indicated that medical malpractice rates are generally no longer rising. In 2011, data pooled from the industry by the publication Medical Liability Monitor indicated that medical malpractice insurance rates had declined for four straight years. The decrease was seen in both states that had enacted tort reform and in states that had not, leading actuaries familiar with the data to suggest that patient safety and risk management campaigns had had a more significant effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/751009 Rising Insurance Premiums?

# [[Tort Reform#Special medical malpractice courts|Special medical malpractice courts]]
# [[Tort Reform#Limits on noneconomic damages|Limits on noneconomic damages]]
# [[Tort Reform#Reduction in the statute of limitations of action|Reduction in the statute of limitations of action]]

The majority of the American public supports reforms to the malpractice system. However, surveys show that the majority of the American public also vastly underestimate the extent of medical errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/pomr111704pkg.cfm National Survey on Consumers' Experiences With Patient Safety and Quality Information] Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent research has shown that while both health consumers and health producers are concerned about some of the adverse consequences of healthcare litigation, health consumers perceive that increased healthcare litigation can reduce the incentives for negligence on the part of healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Corduneanu-Huci, Alexander Hamilton, and Issel Masses-Ferrer, [http://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/5821.html The political economy of healthcare litigation: model and empirical application to Uruguay]. World Bank Policy Research Working Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, studies of these claims have found&lt;ref&gt;Tom Baker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oscj-8zwYkgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=First,+we+know+from+the+California+study,+as+confirmed+by+more+recent,+better+publicized+studies,+that+the+real+problem+is+too+much+medical+malpractice,+not+too+much+litigation.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nb07r426zB&amp;sig=6f5Rik7lV228JiQxIF9HbWZY_p4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DEarSfzjGYKUsQPQ8YXlDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result8 The Medical Malpractice Myth]. University of Chicago Press, 2005. 222 pages. Page 3, "First, we know from the California study, as confirmed by more recent, better publicized studies, that the real problem is too much medical malpractice, not too much litigation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William M. Sage, M.D., Margaret Thompson, Cynthia Gorman, Melissa King. [ The Jury's Still Out: A Critical Look at Malpractice Reform], Center for American Progress, June 12, 2008. From the study, "There is no nationwide crisis [...] Malpractice is wrongly blamed for rising [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] in the United States...Experts have found little correlation between malpractice claim increases and malpractice premium increases. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealinstitute.org/cw/files/CI-MedMalpracticeReport-Oct2004_0.pdf Faulty Data and False Conclusions: The Myth of Skyrocketing Medical Malpractice Verdicts], Lewis L. Laska, J.D., Ph.D. and Katherine Forrest, M.D., M.P.H. [[Commonweal Institute]], October 6, 2004. From the report, "The premise that medical malpractice awards have been rising dramatically in the United States in recent years, driving up the cost of healthcare and forcing physicians out of practice, is not supported by relevant evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/05/13/most_mass_doctors_face_lower_cost_for_malpractice_coverage/ Most Mass. doctors face lower cost for malpractice coverage]. From the article describing the study, "Despite assertions that high malpractice rates are driving them out of the state, Massachusetts doctors are paying less than they were in 1990, after adjusting for inflation, according to a Suffolk University Law School study."&lt;/ref&gt; that there is no problem of increasing malpractice verdicts and insurance costs driving doctors out of business.

=== Nontraditional Approaches to Liability Reform ===
The traditional approach to liability reform is to limit the amount of damages that can be recovered by a plaintiff (as noted above). Several new approaches to addressing medical malpractice have been investigated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Communication and Resolution Programs: When a medical error is identified, the patient is approached by the physician and/or health care system and they mutually arrive at a settlement. Several laws have been passed to facilitate communication and resolution (Mandatory presuit notification laws, apology laws and State-facilitated dispute resolution laws).

Safe Harbors for Adherence to Practice Guidelines: This approach provides a defense for physicians if they follow pre approved clinical practice guidelines.

Judge-directed compensation: A group of judges with expertise in medical malpractice meet with each sides attorneys and negotiates a settlement between the parties.

Administrative Compensation:Sweden and New Zealand created health courts. Claims are sent to these courts that have the authority to settle a claim. Attorneys are not required and the claims are settled based the opinions of neutral experts. Compensation is awarded based on preset schedules and are based on the degree of injury.

===Limits on recovery===
Many jurisdictions placed [[non-economic damages caps]] that limit the amount that victims of medical malpractice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supreme Court on Drugs, Medical Laws And Medical Negligence|publisher=EBC|isbn=9789350288504|edition=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; can recover from negligent physicians, purportedly in an effort to decrease hospital and physician costs.

In California, for example, recovery for non-economic damages are limited to $250,000.  According to the Supreme Court of California, "noneconomic damages compensate the plaintiff for 'pain, suffering, inconvenience, [[physical impairment]], [[disfigurement]] and other nonpecuniary damage [as per Cal.Civ.Code section 3333.2, subdivision (a)].' Section 1431.2, subdivision (b)(2) similarly defines noneconomic damages as 'subjective, non-monetary losses including, but not limited to, pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation and humiliation.'”&lt;ref&gt;Rashidi v. Moser, 339 P.3d 334, n. 3 (Cal. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tort reform]] supporters argue that states have enacted such laws in order to keep health care costs low, in addition to helping curb medical malpractice litigation. However, according to the Supreme Court of California, the state's [[non-economic damages caps]] are "not a legislative attempt to estimate the true damages suffered by plaintiffs, but rather an attempt to control and reduce medical malpractice insurance costs by placing a predictable, uniform limit on the defendant's liability for noneconomic damages."&lt;ref&gt;Salgado v. County of Los Angeles, 967 P.2d 585, 591 (Cal. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas]] law creates the most difficult "hurdles" in the [[United States]] for a [[plaintiff]] to succeed in recovering damages for any medical malpractice, even for such [[reasonable man|objective]] cases such as an [[Iatrogenesis|emergency room exposure]] to the [[Ebola virus disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/06/us-health-ebola-usa-liability-idUSKCN0HV26220141006 |work=Reuters|title=Ebola lawsuits would face high hurdles in Texas|last=Dye|first=Jessica|date=October 6, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas law and effect===
Texas passed a "tort reform" law taking effect on September 1, 2003.&lt;ref name="APTexas"&gt;Associated Press [http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2013/09/03/303718.htm 10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts] (September 3, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The act limited non-economic damages (e.g., damages for pain and suffering) in most malpractice cases to $250,000 across all healthcare providers and $250,000 for healthcare facilities, with a limit of two facilities per claim.&lt;ref name="APTexas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacob"&gt;Steve Jacob, [http://healthcare.dmagazine.com/2012/08/28/studies-texas-tort-reform-had-no-effect-on-physician-supply-lowering-costs/ Studies: Texas Tort Reform Has Had No Effect on Physician Supply, Lowering Costs], ''Dallas/Fort Worth Healthcare Daily'' (August 28, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Texas was one of 31 states to cap non-economic damages.&lt;ref name="APTexas"/&gt;

Following 2003, medical malpractice insurance rates were reduced in Texas.&lt;ref name="APTexas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJD"&gt;[https://centerjd.org/content/fact-sheet-real-story-texas-insurance-rates Fact Sheet: The Real Story of Texas Insurance Rates], [[Center for Justice &amp; Democracy]] at [[New York Law School]] (accessed October 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Center for Justice &amp; Democracy]] at [[New York Law School]] reports that rate reductions are likely attributable not to tort laws, but because of broader trends, such as "political pressure, the size of prior rate hikes, and the impact of the industry's economic cycle, causing rates to drop everywhere in the country." States which do not impose caps on malpractice damages, such as Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have experienced reductions or stabilization in malpractice rates as well.&lt;ref name="CJD"/&gt;

Various studies have shown that the Texas tort-reform law has had no effect on healthcare costs or the number of physicians practicing in the state.&lt;ref name="Jacob"/&gt; A February 2014 study found "no evidence to support" the claim that "there had been a dramatic increase in physicians moving to Texas due to the improved liability climate."&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;David A. Hyman, Charles Silver, Bernard S. Black &amp; Myungho Paik, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2047433 Does Tort Reform Affect Physician Supply? Evidence from Texas], ''International Review of Law and Economics, Vol. 42, pp. 203-218 (February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that this is true "for all patient care physicians in Texas, high-malpractice-risk specialties, primary care physicians, and rural physicians.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt;

Plaintiffs' lawyers say that the Texas law prevents patients from getting compensation or damages even in cases where the patient clearly deserves it. In particular, the “willful and wanton” negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the harm is clearly negligent but not willful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/even-with-counsel-texas-amputee-is-hindered-by-state-tort-laws.html Despite Counsel, Victim Is Hindered by Tort Laws], By BECCA AARONSON, New York Times, JAN. 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial Impact===
An August 2003 [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] paper by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra found that (1) "increases in malpractice payments made on behalf of physicians do not seem to be the driving force behind increases in premiums"; (2) "increases in malpractice costs (both premiums overall and the subcomponent factors) do not seem to affect the overall size of the physician workforce, although they may deter marginal entry, increase marginal exit, and reduce the rural physician workforce"; and (3) "there is little evidence of increased use of many treatments in response to malpractice liability at the state level, although there may be some increase in screening procedures such as [[mammography]]."&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Baicker &amp; Amitabh Chandra, NBER Working Paper No. 10709, [https://www.nber.org/papers/w10709 The Effect of Malpractice Liability on the Delivery of Health Care] (August 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study by Daniel P. Kessler and Mark McClellan analyzing data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries treated for two serious cardiac diseases in 1984, 1987, and 1990 determined that "malpractice reforms that directly reduce provider liability pressure lead to reductions of 5 to 9 percent in medical expenditures without substantial effects on mortality or medical complications."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Kessler &amp; Mark McClellan, NBER Working Paper No. 5466, [https://www.nber.org/papers/w5466 Do Doctors Practice Defensive Medicine?], ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' (February 1996), pp. 353-390.&lt;/ref&gt;

A a 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) report using data from a private actuarial firm and the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) found that malpractice costs (excluding "defensive medicine") account for less than 2 percent of health care spending.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Budget Office, [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/49xx/doc4968/01-08-MedicalMalpractice.pdf Limiting tort liability for medical malpractice] (January 8, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] report for [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] (a health-insurer trade association) used the 2 percent figure and an extrapolation from the Kessler and McClellan report to estimate that the combined cost of insurance and defensive medicine accounts for 10 percent of total health care costs in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;PriceWaterhouseCoopers, [http://www.ahip.org/redirect/PwCCostOfHC2006.pdf The factors fueling rising healthcare costs 2006]. New York (January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the CBO "concluded that implementing a package of five malpractice reforms would reduce national health spending by about 0.5 percent."&lt;ref name="Mello"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mello Michelle M., Chandra Amitabh, Gawande Atul A., Studdert David M. | year = 2010| title = National Costs of the Medical Liability System | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/9/1569 | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 29 | issue = 9| pages = 1569–1577 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0807 | pmc = 3048809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41881?index=10872 Report: Responses to Questions on the Effects of Tort Reform], Congressional Budget Office (December 29, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Michelle M. Mello and others published in the journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' in 2010 estimated that the total annual cost of the medical liability system, including "defensive medicine," was about 2.4 percent of total U.S. health care spending.&lt;ref name="Mello"/&gt; The authors noted that "this is less than some imaginative estimates put forward in the health reform debate, and it represents a small fraction of total health care spending," although it was not "trivial" in absolute terms.&lt;ref name="Mello"/&gt;

A study by [[RAND Corporation|RAND Corp.]] researchers published in October 2014 in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' concluded that laws restricting medical-malpractice suits do not reduce the amount of "defensive medicine" or reduce health-care costs. The researchers, led by Daniel A. Waxman, examined 3.8 million Medicare patient records from hospital [[emergency department]]s from 1997 to 2011, comparing care in three states that enacted strict malpractice reform laws about a decade earlier ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Texas]] and [[South Carolina]]) to care in neighboring states that did not enact such laws. The study found that the laws had no effect on whether doctors ordered resource-intensive care (e.g., [[CT scan|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans and hospitalization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making It More Difficult to Sue Physicians for Malpractice May Not Reduce 'Defensive Medicine'|url=https://www.rand.org/news/press/2014/10/15.html|website=Rand Corporation|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/10/27/344797.htm Tougher State Malpractice Laws May Not Reduce Defensive Medicine], ''Insurance Journal'' (October 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Waxman Daniel A., Greenberg Michael D., Ridgely M.

The company was founded in 1972 as state enterprise "Olaines ķīmiski – farmaceitiskā rūpnīca" (Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant). The main goal of founding the company was to ensure pharmaceutical [[drug|substance]]s and semiproducts to several finished drug form manufacturing plants in the [[Soviet Union]]. As a result of privatization in 1997, the company was reorganized into a [[Joint-stock company|joint stock company]], and its shares were listed on [[stock exchange]].

Olainfarm produces over 60 final dosage forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olainfarm.

== History ==
'''On 4 December 1965''', the Council of Ministers of the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]] adopted a decision on construction of a chemical-pharmaceutical factory in the town of Olaine.

'''In 1968''', construction of the factory was commenced.

The first operation of furagin synthesis was carried out on '''10 October 1972'''. That day is considered as the day of commencement of the operation of the Company, which at that time was named Olaines ķīmiski-farmaceitiskā rūpnīca (Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant).

'''In 1976''', Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant became the leading manufacturer in Latvbiofarm association. The production capacity of the enterprise made it possible to supply all the existing factories-manufacturers in the territory of the [[Soviet Union]] with active chemical ingredients and semiproducts of corresponding groups.

'''In 1980''', synthesis of 15 products was developed. After a while, the management of the enterprise made a decision to produce also finished forms of medicaments.

'''In 1991''', historical changes occurred in the political and economic situation in all the former USSR countries, including [[Latvia]]. These changes affected also the operation of Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant; therefore, a decision was made to develop the strongest lines of synthesis ([[adamantine spar|adamantine]], quinuclidinone, and other derivatives) for selling products to Western countries.

State enterprise Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant was privatized '''in 1997'''. As a result of the privatization, the enterprise was reorganized into the [[joint stock company]] Olainfarm, and its [[Share (finance)|shares]] were listed on the secondary list of [[Riga Stock Exchange]].

'''In 2001''', after successful audits conducted by such well-known companies as [[Cilag]] ([[Switzerland]]), [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] ([[United States|USA]]) and [[Sanofi]] ([[France]]), the Company entered the global market as its actual participant in production of [[Active ingredient|active chemical ingredients]].

'''In 2002''', certificate was obtained according to the inspection requirements of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

'''From 2003 to 2004''' grandiose reconstruction of the manufacturing plant was finished in compliance with the requirements of [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] of the [[European Union]].

'''On 30 July 2004''', JSC Olainfarm obtained a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate of compliance. This certificate symbolized the start of a new period in the Company’s history.

'''In 2005''', [[Shareholder]]s of JSC Olainfarm decided on increasing the fixed capital of the Company by 3 million [[Latvian lats|Lats]], to 13.25 million [[Latvian lats|Lats]].

'''In 2006''', Considering the positive development dynamics of the Company and the quality of investor relations, shares of the Company were transferred to the most prestigious Main List of the Baltics. Popular anti-virus preparation Remantadīns® (Remantadine) was registered as the first of the Company’s manufactured medicaments in [[Poland]].

'''In 2007''', JSC Olainfarm received the Baltic Stock Exchange award for the best investor relations on the Internet in 2007.

'''In 2008''', JSC Olainfarm opened a representation office in [[Vietnam]] and started an ambitious sale promotion programme in important sales markets.

At the award ceremony of newspaper Dienas bizness for Top 500 most successful companies in Latvia, '''in 2009''' JSC Olainfarm received the special award from [[Riga Stock Exchange|NASDAQ OMX Riga]] as the company of the stock exchange with the highest share price increase from early 2009 to 1 November. The Company’s share price in 2009 increased by 160%.

'''In 2010''', The Company registered its representation offices in [[Serbia]] and [[Tajikistan]]. The first registered product in Serbia was anti-virus preparation Remavir®.

'''In 2011''', When the sales promotion programme, which started in 2008, showed significant results, the Company set even higher new records of profit and turnover. For the first time in its history, the Company’s shareholders decided to pay [[dividend]]s in the amount of 10% from the previous year profit. Olainfarm started building its own chain of pharmacies Latvijas aptieka.

'''In 2013''', Olainfarm acquired controlling stake in the leading Latvian food supplement company Silvanols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="OlainFarm" acquires controlling stake in "Silvanols"|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/06/05/552104/0/en/OlainFarm-acquires-controlling-stake-in-Silvanols.html|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In 2014''', Olainfarm won the Export Champion 2014 Award at the competition is organized by the [[Ministry of Economics (Latvia)|Latvian Economics Ministry]] and the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (LIAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Export and Innovation Award"|url=http://www.president.lv/pk/preview/?module=print_content&amp;module_name=content&amp;cat_id=6520&amp;lng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On 13 January 2015''', JSC Olainfarm opened the new finished drug manufacturing plant, which was created with investments of 9.6 million.

The '''Orphan Drug Act of 1983''' is a law passed in the United States to facilitate development of [[orphan drugs]] — drugs for [[rare diseases]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[myoclonus]], [[ALS]], [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[muscular dystrophy]] which affect small numbers of individuals residing in the United States.&lt;ref name="GPO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-96/pdf/STATUTE-96-Pg2049.pdf | title=Orphan Drug Act of 1983 | work=US Food and Drug Administration | date=4 January 1983 | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orphan drug designation does not indicate that the therapeutic is either safe and effective or legal to manufacture and market in the United States. That process is handled through other offices in the US [[Food and Drug Administration]].  Instead, the designation means only that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits from the federal government, such as reduced taxes.

In 1982 an informal coalition of supporters and families of patients with rare diseases who formed [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] (NORD) and others, called for change to legislation to support development of [[orphan drug]]s, or drugs for treating rare diseases.&lt;ref name="retirement_NORD" &gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.aismme.org/news07/Eurordisnewsletterjuly07.htm | title=Abbey Meyers, President of NORD, announces her retirement | publisher=European Organization for Rare Disorders | accessdate=14 February 2009 |date = July 2007| first=Jerome | last=Parisse-Brassens}}&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in getting the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) in early 1983.&lt;ref name="retirement_NORD" /&gt;&lt;ref name=millions&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20090213/DC7071513022009-1.html | title=Millions Around World to Observe Rare Disease Day | accessdate=14 February 2009 | date=13 February 2009 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=henkel&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only thirty-eight orphan drugs had been approved prior to the 1983 Act; by 2014 "468 indication designations covering 373 drugs have been approved."&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |format=PDF |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly as a result of the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act, Japan adopted it in 1993 as did the European Union in 2000.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

==Background==

===Emergence of orphan diseases===

In response to incidents such as difficulties with [[thalidomide]] the [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]] was passed in 1962 as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Kefauver-Harris required that all drugs approved for sale be proven safe and effective via rigorous scientific studies. While this legislation improved drug safety, it also dramatically increased the costs associated with developing new medicines. Pharmaceutical companies responded by focusing on developing treatments for common diseases in order to maximize the possibility of recouping research and development costs and generating significant profits. As a result, rare diseases were largely ignored due to poor economic potential and were thus said to be "orphaned." The gap between drugs for common versus rare diseases eventually widened to the point where few or no treatments were available for some rare conditions such as [[Crohn's disease]], [[Hansen's disease]], etc.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite journal

===Key issues===
{{main | Orphan drug}}

[[Orphan drugs]] generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on 
[[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], [[dosing]], stability, safety and efficacy.  However, some statistical burdens are lessened in an effort to maintain development momentum.  For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a phase III clinical trial, as fewer than that number may be afflicted with the disease in question.

Since the market for any drug with such a limited application scope would, by definition, be small and thus largely unprofitable, government intervention is often required to motivate a manufacturer to address the need for an orphan drug.

The intervention by government on behalf of orphan drug development can take a variety of forms:
*[[Tax]] incentives.
*Enhanced [[patent]] protection and marketing rights.
*Clinical research subsidies.
*Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development.

==Legislation==

The plight of  patients suffering from rare diseases became an important political issue in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The US government was subject to pressure from activist groups such as NORD&lt;ref name="retirement_NORD" /&gt; and many others.&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

The chief sponsor of the bill (H.R. 5238) was [[Henry Waxman]] (sometimes referred to as the author of the Act),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news
 |title=IN their words |date=Dec 2013 |work=[[Nat. Biotechnol.|Nature Biotechnology]] |volume = 31 |issue = 12 |page = 1062 |type=paper |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n6/full/nbt0611-466.html |department=News }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.  It passed the House of Representatives on 14 December 1982, and was similarly approved by voice vote in the Senate on 17 December.  On 4 January 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the ODA into law.  Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. In order to encourage the development of drugs for orphan diseases, the ODA included a number of incentives including seven-year market exclusivity for companies that developed orphan drug, tax credits equal to half of the development costs, later changed to  a fifteen-year carry-forward provision and a three-year carry-back that can be applied in profitable year, grants for drug development, fast-track approvals of drugs indicated for rare diseases,  and expanded access to the [[Investigational New Drug|Investigational New Drug Program]]. The law was also later amended to waive user fees charged under [[PDUFA]].&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

Market exclusivity is particularly appealing to pharmaceutical firms as an incentive to pursue orphan drug development. The seven-year market exclusivity period differs from traditional patent law in that it does not begin until the drug is granted FDA approval and is independent of the drug's current patent status. Furthermore, if a market competitor wishes to introduce a drug for the same indication, the onus is on the competitor to prove that their drug is therapeutically superior (e.g. increased efficacy, less toxicity, etc.) when compared to the present drug indicated for the rare disease of interest. This incentive creates an attractive monopolistic market for companies interested in developing a product for any given rare disease.&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

Television historian and [[Allmovie]] contributor [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] credits two episodes of the television series ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' for helping the ODA pass in the USA: "Seldom Silent, Never Heard" (1981) and "Give Me Your Weak" (1982).&lt;ref name="erickson_seldom"&gt;{{cite web

==Effectiveness==

Drug companies nearly universally believe the ODA to be a success.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt; Before Congress enacted the ODA in 1983 only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House Offers Incentives For Development of 'Orphan' Drugs |author=Rich Daly |newspaper=Congressional Quarterly Daily Monitor |date=5 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, a total of 1,129 different orphan drug designations have been granted  by the Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) and 249 orphan drugs have received marketing authorization. In contrast, the decade prior to 1983 saw fewer than ten such products come to market. From the passage of the ODA in 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to  2,116 compounds. As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.&lt;ref name="Executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pharma's Orphans |author=Armstrong, Walter |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Executive |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, drugmaker [[Pfizer]] established a division to focus specifically on the development of orphan drugs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grogan|first=Kevin|title=Bookmark and Share Pfizer creates orphan disease research division|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/10-06-15/Pfizer_creates_orphan_disease_research_division.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2011|newspaper=Pharma Times|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as other large pharmaceutical companies focused greater efforts on the orphan drug research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway|first=Benjamin|title=Big Pharma Reassesses Orphan Drug Sector|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/big-pharma-reassesses-orphan-drug-sector/3202/?page=1|accessdate=28 March 2011|newspaper=Wall Street BioBeat|date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase (claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders that were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation), and whether the ODA has really stimulated the production of truly non-profitable drugs; the act also received some criticism for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit off of drugs that have a small market but still sell for a high price. While orphan drug status is given to drugs with "no reasonable expectation" of profitability, some orphan drugs have gone on to net large profits and/or receive widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schulte|first=Fred|title=Drug earning millions despite 'orphan' label|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bal-te.orphan18dec18,0,7085040.story|accessdate=28 March 2011|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The topic of profit in the aftermath of the ODA was addressed in November 2013 in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' where the following quote appeared:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  {{Quote|text = The [pharmaceutical] industry has taken advantage of the incentives to charge excessive profits and to reap windfalls far in excess of their investments in the drug.|sign = [[Henry Waxman]], primary sponsor of the ODA}}

The list of designated orphan drugs includes such [[Pharmaceutical drug#Blockbuster drug|blockbuster drugs]] as [[Abilify]], [[Provigil]], [[Vioxx]], [[Botox]], and [[Cialis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wellman-Labadie|first=Olivier|author2=Zhou, Youwen|title=The US Orphan Drug Act: Rare disease research stimulator or commercial opportunity?|journal=Health Policy|date=1 May 2010|volume=95|issue=2–3|pages=216–228|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.12.001|pmid=20036435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory harmonization==
In an effort to reduce the burden on manufacturers applying for orphan drug status, the FDA and EMA agreed in late 2007 to utilize a common application process for both agencies.  However, the two agencies will continue to maintain separate approval processes.&lt;ref name="BWN112007"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16907">'''Orthokeratology''' (also referred to as '''Ortho-K''', '''Overnight Vision Correction''', '''Corneal Refractive Therapy''' and '''CRT'''), refers to the creation of gas permeable contact lenses that temporarily reshape the cornea to reduce refractive errors such as [[myopia]], [[hyperopia]] and [[astigmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurok.eu/content/faq European Academy of Orthokeratology FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used as an alternative to [[eyeglasses]], [[refractive surgery]], or for those who prefer not to wear contact lenses during the day. Orthokeratology is most often used for candidates with up to -6.00 [[diopters]] of myopia, though exceptions may be made if the prescription is only slightly lower (e.g. -6.25).

==History==
Doctors discovered the reshaping phenomena of glass lenses as early as the 1940s. This history of orthokeratology includes contributions made by multiple authors to the use of contact lenses for myopia reduction.&lt;ref&gt;J Am Optom Assoc. 1982 Mar;53(3):187&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Jessen]] created what was probably the first orthokeratology design in the 1960s made from [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] material, which he marketed as "Orthofocus". These early designs had generally unpredictable results, leading to the belief that applied orthokeratology was more art or luck than science. Many groups and individuals claim to have been the first to develop modern orthokeratology solutions. However, Dr. Richard Wlodyga, Dr. Philip B. Hanisch and Nick Stoyan, in particular, are generally credited&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Orthokeratology Principles and practice by John Mountford, David Ruston Trusit Dave&lt;/ref&gt; with developing the first reverse zone lens design in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, it was not until computerized [[corneal topography]] became available during the 1990s that it became possible to apply the theory to create designs with repeatable results through being able to accurately map the surface curvature of the [[cornea]] using a non-invasive, painless imaging procedure. Additionally, the development of new base materials for [[rigid gas permeable]] lenses which provided much higher levels of [[oxygen permeability]] opened up the possibility of orthokeratology becoming an overnight procedure rather than being used for daytime wear alone. Finally, the introduction of computer-controlled precision lathes meant that lens designs could be manufactured to sub-[[micrometer]] levels of accuracy thereby offering the prospect of high volume production becoming commercially viable.

Nightwear ortho-k solutions were available to consumers in many countries outside the US much earlier than within the US, due to international differences between regulatory controls and bodies. In 1994, the FDA granted the first ever daily wear approval for a lens indicated for Orthokeratology to a type of lens called the Contex OK-Lens.  In June 2002, the FDA granted approval for overnight wear of a type of corneal reshaping called "Corneal Refractive Therapy" (CRT), more than fifteen years after Europe.

=== Professional organizations ===
In the summer of 2000, at an educational meeting of optometrists in Toronto, the Orthokeratology Academy of America (OAA) was formed to support, promote and advance orthokeratology.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In parallel, the British Orthokeratology Society (BOKS) was established in the UK with similar objectives to promote orthokeratology as a new procedure to correct myopia.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The [http://www.osa.net.au/ OSO], formerly known as the OSA, is an Australian-based association of orthokeratology optometrists and researchers representing Australia and the South Pacific region.

=== Research into slowing of myopia ===
In 2006 and 2007, papers presented at the [[British Contact Lens Association]] and the Global Orthokeratology Symposium indicated the possibility of orthokeratology slowing or stopping myopic progression. This was found to be effective in children in Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120122684/PDFSTART Orthokeratology practice in children in a university clinic in Hong Kong] &amp;ndash; Clinical and Experimental Optometry. March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the subject of wider study to verify this data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ska.cosmosmagazine.com/news/eye-shaping-contacts-may-repair-vision/ Eye-shaping contacts may repair vision] &amp;ndash; Cosmos Magazine. December 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the first year results from the SMART Study (Stabilizing Myopia by Accelerated Reshaping Technique) &amp;ndash; a five-year longitudinal study currently underway in the Chicago area &amp;ndash; show a statistically significant difference for children in the treatment group wearing orthokeratology lenses who exhibited no overall prescription change against children in the control group wearing conventional soft contact lenses for whom there was a mean increase in myopia of 0.40 diopters.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation to Global Specialty Lens Symposium by Dr S Barry Eiden OD FAAO, Las Vegas, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the Research in Orthokeratology Group at the University of NSW conducts ongoing research into various aspects of orthokeratology including myopia control.

==Mechanism and use==
[[Tissue (biology)|Tissue]] growth and propagation studies indicate that [[epithelial cells]] adjust growth in response to presence of a foreign material. CRT lens proximity to the cells therefore is thought to stimulate cell growth where less proximity coincides with added growth and more proximity coincides with growth repression thereby creating a 'proximal pressure' on the epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;Allen biometrics, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthokeratology website ''ortho-k.net'' explains in lay-terms that the mechanism behind ortho-k is that around 60% of the eye's focusing power is provided by the [[cornea]], and this is extremely sensitive to very small changes: 6&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] flattening of corneal thickness (around 5% of the thickness of a [[human hair]]) results in 1 [[diopter]] of changed vision in myopia.&lt;ref name="ortho-k.net"&gt;http://www.ortho-k.net/&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore a specially shaped lens can be used to lightly press the cornea, causing it gradually to be reshaped to the correct shape for focused vision. The corrective effect lasts up to 72 hours once initially acclimatized, which is long enough to be a practical means of eyesight correction.&lt;ref name="eyestore"&gt;http://theeyestore.co.uk/orthokeratology-corneal-refractive-therapy ''[needs better academic paper as citation]''&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence (see [[#Research into slowing of myopia|above]]) that unlike other eyesight correction mechanisms, Ortho-K may also reduce future or ongoing eyesight changes or increased myopia, although this is still being researched.

Risks are comparable to or safer than ordinary contact lenses, since they are typically worn for much shorter periods (6–8 hours rather than daytime or 24/7) and while asleep rather than while active{{Citation needed|reason=Claim of safety with no evidence|date=September 2017}}. They also compare favorably to surgical correction since no surgery is involved, corrections to the eye's shape can be handled over time (surgery corrects vision at a single point in time, but post-operative ongoing changes to eyesight will continue to occur during the patient's lifetime), and it is considered generally safe for younger patients{{Citation needed|reason=Unsupported claim of consensus|date=September 2017}}. In addition, Ortho-K is broadly not 'new' from a safety viewpoint; contact lens safety generally speaking is considered to be well understood. However it is important, as with all contact lenses, to maintain good cleaning and hygiene discipline.

Rigid lenses are generally considered to be not as comfortable as soft lenses, but Ortho-K is claimed to avoid the feeling during waking hours of the eyelids moving over the lens edges while blinking.  When Ortho-K lenses are worn, the eyes are closed for sleep, although the same issues that accompany wearing contact lenses during sleep ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movements]] and lower tear production) remain.

=== Adaptation, success rates, and discontinuation ===
The cornea experiences a significant degree of adaptation within hours to days, although full adaptation often requiring 2 – 3 weeks. During this initial period vision may be affected for some people. Once adapted, FDA trials showed over 65% of patients achieved 20/20 eyesight and over 90% achieved 20/40 or better (the typical US requirement for driving without glasses).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blountvillefamilyeyecare.com/ortho-keratology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The corrective effect is stable but not permanent. Left to itself, the eye will slowly lose its adjusted shape, taking around something of the region of 3 days to return to its former vision.&lt;ref name="eyestore" /&gt; The Ortho-K lenses must therefore be worn regularly so the corrected corneal shape is preserved and maintained. Usually they are worn only for part of the day (typically only when asleep at night); some users may only need to use them one night out of every two or three nights.&lt;ref name="eyestore" /&gt;

==Health considerations ==

===Indications and counter-indications===
The US FDA overnight orthokeratology is approved up to -6.00 [[diopter]]s of [[myopia]] and a maximum of 1.75 diopters of [[astigmatism]].

In the United Kingdom, the procedure is offered primarily for myopic correction up to &amp;minus;5.00 diopters and up to &amp;minus;1.50 diopters of astigmatism. Fitting evidence for the leading lens designs indicates that procedures undertaken within these parameters have the highest probability of success.  Some patients with higher degrees of myopia are successfully treated by specialist practitioners with "[[Off-label use|off-label]]" uses of these same lenses.

In countries such as South Africa, Australia and Taiwan, practitioners using the GOV orthokeratology system have achieved successful fits as high as &amp;minus;10.00D of [[myopia]] and +5.00D of [[hyperopia]].  Not every patient within these parameters will be suitable for the procedure and conditions such as flat or steep [[cornea]]s may result in the procedure being less successful.

Counter-indications may include:&lt;ref name="ortho-k.net"/&gt;
* Inflammations or infection of the anterior segment of the eye or the cornea
* Disease, injury or abnormality affecting the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelid, or impacting contact lens wear
* Very dry eyes or low eye moisture
* Corneal hypoesthesia (low sensitivity)
* Eye related allergies, including allergies to contact lens solutions

===Adverse Effects===
During the first month of lens wear when the treatment zone on the surface of the cornea is in the process of becoming fully formed, some users may experience vision issues such as ghosting, double vision, contrast problems and/or starbursting, especially at night.  These issues are generally resolved by the end of the first month of lens wear. If these issues persist beyond this initial period, the cause may be due to lack of centration of the lens on the eye and/or overly large pupil size (in light or dark). Resolution may be possible through redesign, material changes, better eye moisture retention (night eye masks, duct blocking, etc.) or other techniques.

Orthokeratology showed few severe side-effects, according to a March 2004 report of a very small sample of cases in China where supply of lenses at that time was not subject to any regulatory regime covering safety and efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=6245 Orthokeratology contact lenses cause permanent vision loss in children] &amp;ndash; American Academy of Ophthalmology media release, 1 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/bulletin/carn-bcei_v16n2_e.html#4 Acanthamoeba keratitis and overnight orthokeratology] Case presentation: Canadian Adverse Reaction Newsletter Volume 16, Issue 2, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  More typically, complications can occur due to the patient's failure to follow appropriate hygiene recommendations when handling or cleaning the lenses. One common issue being the use of tap water to rinse (although some systems allow for or suggest the use of "clean" tap water) or store as this may cause unwanted buildup of minerals on the contact as well as other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eye Contact Lens. 2005 Sep;31(5):201&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinical and Experimental Optometry. 2007;90:3:182&amp;ndash;189&lt;/ref&gt; Complications may also be due to relative corneal [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (lack of oxygen) with prolonged or overnight contact lens wear in lenses made from the wrong material.&lt;ref&gt;Ophthalmology. 2001 Aug;108(8):1389&amp;ndash;99&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of high or hyper oxygen-permeable materials as approved by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] significantly reduces hypoxia, and these are the materials that are normally used in orthokeratology.

Safety advice applicable to most modes of contact lens wear, also applies to ortho-k night-time lenses. An article in the January 2005 issue of ''Eye &amp; Contact Lens: Science &amp; Clinical Practice'' discusses two case reports of children who developed [[corneal ulcer]]s when fit with Paragon CRT contact lenses, which were worn nightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macsai, M.D.|first=Marian S.|title=Corneal Ulcers in Two Children Wearing Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy Lenses|journal=Eye &amp; Contact Lens: Science &amp; Clinical Practice|date=January 2005|volume= 31|series=Issue 1|pages=9–11|url=http://journals.lww.com/claojournal/Abstract/2005/01000/Corneal_Ulcers_in_Two_Children_Wearing_Paragon.3.aspx|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each patient presented with a bacterial corneal ulcer after wearing CRT contact lenses for less than 6 months. In the first patient, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' was identified as the causative organism. In the second patient, ''[[Haemophilus influenza]]'' was cultured from the ulcer. Both patients were treated with antibiotics, resulting in a rapid resolution of the corneal ulcers and preservation of vision. The writers conclude that "Paragon CRT lenses have been approved for use in patients of all ages. When used in children, these lenses may present unique problems. The absolute incidence of bacterial corneal ulcers in patients with CRT lenses are unknown. Severe caution should be used before prescribing CRT lenses for children and informed consent should include potential sight-threatening corneal ulcers." Although sight threatening corneal ulcers are rare, informed consent should routinely be obtained for all new contact lens wearers, whether worn overnight or not.

''The Globe and Mail'' reported two cases in Canada in which [[Acanthamoeba]] infections during ortho-k treatment, possibly related to rinsing the lenses in tap water, led to temporary or permanent blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abraham |first=Carolyn |date=October 16, 2004 |title=Cornea-shaping contact lenses damage some eyes |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/cornea-shaping-contact-lenses-damage-some-eyes/article1005464/?page=all |newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |accessdate=July 31, 2014 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of lenses==
Orthokeratology lenses are made by a number of companies globally.  All use special gas permeable [[contact lens]]es to reshape the cornea. The lens material &amp;ndash; and especially its [[oxygen permeability]] measured by its 'Dk' rating (the higher the value, the greater the degree of oxygen permeability) &amp;ndash; is important for maintaining eye-health during the treatment.

Materials and methods vary globally, as does individual country approval.  Menicon Z Night is used overnight in other countries, but is FDA-approved for only 30-day wear, limited to regular GP schedule.  It uses fenestrations in the reverse curve to maximize fluid flow while maintaining centration with a high Dk material.

Some practitioners have also designed their own orthokeratology lenses typically by using various software packages which combine corneal topographical data with the practitioners' own knowledge and experience to determine the appropriate lens parameters for individual patient prescriptions.  These practitioners are obviously doing so "off-label" since their designs are not approved for safety by the FDA.  {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''Osteochondritis''' is a painful type of [[osteochondrosis]] where the [[cartilage]] or [[bone]] in a [[joint]] is [[inflamed]].&lt;ref name="dorlands"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000076384|Osteochondritis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It often refers to [[osteochondritis dissecans]] (sometimes spelt ''dessecans'', and abbreviated '''OCD'''). The term ''dissecans'' refers to the "creation of a flap of cartilage that further dissects away from its underlying subchondral attachments (dissecans)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/saortho/chapter_84/84mast.htm | title=CAL &amp;gt; Home | website=cal.vet.upenn.edu | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other recognized types of osteochondritis are [[osteochondritis deformans juvenilis]] (osteochondritis of the [[capitular head]] of the [[epiphysis]] of the [[femur]])&lt;ref name="dorlands" /&gt; and [[osteochondritis deformans juvenilis dorsi]] (osteochondrosis of the [[spinal vertebrae]], also known as [[Scheuermann's disease]]).&lt;ref name="dorlands" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Scheuermann's+disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteochondritis, and especially osteochondritis dissecans, can manifest in animals as a primary cause of [[elbow dysplasia]], a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition in some species and breeds.&lt;ref name="Pead and Guthrie"&gt;Quoted from: {{cite web|last=Matthew Pead and Sue Guthrie|title=Elbow Dysplasia in dogs – a new scheme explained|url=http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/chs_elbow.pdf|publisher=[[British Veterinary Association]] (BVA)|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002022122/http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/chs_elbow.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with his wife, [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], and [[Henri Becquerel]], "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel".&lt;ref name="Nobel1903"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1903|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/|website=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Paris on 15 May 1859, Pierre Curie was the son of Eugene Curie (28 August 1827 – 25 February 1910), a doctor of Alsatian Protestant origin, and Sophie-Claire Depouilly Curie (15 January 1832 – 27 September 1897). He was educated by his father and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry. When he was 16, he earned his math degree.{{clarify|date=November 2017}} By the age of 18, he had completed the equivalent of a higher degree, but did not proceed immediately to a doctorate due to lack of money. Instead he worked as a laboratory instructor.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Susan|title=Marie Curie : a life|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=978-0201887945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bteAVVwkeUIC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Pierre Curie was preparing for his [[bachelor of science]] degree, he worked in the laboratory of [[Jean-Gustave Bourbouze]] in the Faculty of Science.&lt;ref&gt;''Marie Curie et les conquérants de l'atome : 1896-2006'', par [[Jean-Pierre Poirier]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre Curie et Marie Sklodowska Curie 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pierre and [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], 1895]]

In 1880, Pierre and his older brother [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] (1856–1941) demonstrated that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed, i.e. [[piezoelectricity]].&lt;ref name="Brothers"&gt;{{cite journal|title=This Month in Physics History: March 1880: The Curie Brothers Discover Piezoelectricity|journal=ACS News|date=2014|volume=March|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201403/physicshistory.cfm|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide accurate measurements needed for their work, Pierre Curie created a highly sensitive instrument called the Curie scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kürti|first1=N.|last2=Simon|first2=F.|title=LXXIII. Remarks on the "Curie" scale of temperature|journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|date=1938|volume=26|issue=178|pages=849–854|doi=10.1080/14786443808562176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used weights, microscopic meter readers, and pneumatic dampeners to create the scale.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redniss|first1=Lauren|title=Radioactive|date=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, New York|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, to aid their work, they invented the piezoelectric quartz electrometer.&lt;ref name="Molinié"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molinié|first1=Philippe|last2=Boudia|first2=Soraya|title=Mastering picocoulombs in the 1890s: The Curies’ quartz–electrometer instrumentation, and how it shaped early radioactivity history|journal=Journal of Electrostatics|date=May 2009|volume=67|issue=2-3|pages=524–530|doi=10.1016/j.elstat.2009.01.031|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304388609000254|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, in 1881, they demonstrated the reverse effect: that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field.&lt;ref name="Brothers"/&gt; Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this  in the form of [[crystal oscillator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manbachi, A. and Cobbold R.S.C. |title=Development and Application of Piezoelectric Materials for Ultrasound Generation and Detection |journal=Ultrasound |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=187–196 |date=November 2011 |doi=10.1258/ult.2011.011027 |url=http://ult.rsmjournals.com/content/19/4/187.full |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722013951/http://ult.rsmjournals.com/content/19/4/187.full |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Curie was introduced to [[Marie Curie|Maria Skłodowska]] by their friend, physicist [[Józef Wierusz-Kowalski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redniss|first1=Lauren|title=Radioactive|date=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, New York|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curie took her into his laboratory as his student.

==Research==
[[File:Curie1895These.jpg|thumb|left|''Propriétés magnétiques des corps à diverses temperatures'' &lt;br&gt;(Curie's dissertation, 1895)]]
Prior to his famous doctoral studies on magnetism, he designed and perfected an extremely sensitive [[torsion balance]] for measuring magnetic coefficients. Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area. Pierre Curie studied [[ferromagnetism]], [[paramagnetism]], and [[diamagnetism]] for his doctoral thesis, and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as [[Curie's law]]. The material constant in Curie's law is known as the [[Curie constant]]. He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a [[critical temperature]] transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the [[Curie temperature]]. The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Pierre Curie formulated what is now known as the ''[[Curie Dissymmetry Principle]]'': a physical effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its efficient [[causality (physics)|cause]].&lt;ref name="Castellani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castellani|first1=Elena|last2=Ismael|first2=Jenann|title=Which Curie's Principle?|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=16 June 2016|doi=10.1086/687933|url=http://www.jenanni.com/papers/WhichCurie'sPrinciple.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berova"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berova|first1=Nina|title=Circular dichroism : principles and applications|date=2000|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=New York, NY|isbn=0471330035|pages=43–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaxYis4mtecC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no [[dissymmetry]] (it is [[isotropic]]). Introduce a [[gravitational field]], and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation.

Curie worked with [[Marie Curie|his wife]] in isolating [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. They were the first to use the term "[[radioactivity]]", and were pioneers in its study. Their work, including Marie Curie's celebrated doctoral work, made use of a sensitive piezoelectric [[electrometer]] constructed by Pierre and his brother Jacques Curie.&lt;ref name="Nobelprize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie and Pierre Curie and the Discovery of Polonium and Radium|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/curie/|website=Nobelprize.org|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Curie's 1898 publication with his wife Mme. Curie and also with M. G. Bémont&lt;ref name="Paper"&gt;P. Curie, Mme. P. Curie, and M. G. Bémont,  ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences'', Paris, 1898 (26 December), vol. 127, pp. 1215-1217.&lt;/ref&gt; for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award  from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the [[ESPCI ParisTech]] (officially the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris) in 2015.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite web|title= 2015 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2015_Awardees.php|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breakthrough"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Citations/2015-Curie%20&amp;%20Curie%20plaque.pdf|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curie and one of his students, Albert Laborde, made the first discovery of [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]], by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Steve|last2=Jensen|first2=Carsten|last3=Aaserud|first3=Finn|last4=Kragh|first4=Helge|last5=Rudinger|first5=Erik|last6=Stuewer|first6=Roger H.|title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|date=July 2000|volume=84|issue=500|pages=382|doi=10.2307/3621743|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TygBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curie also investigated the radiation emissions of radioactive substances, and through the use of magnetic fields was able to show that some of the emissions were positively charged, some were negative and some were neutral. These correspond to [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma radiation]].&lt;ref name="Lagowski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lagowski|first1=Joseph J.|title=Macmillan encyclopedia of chemistry|date=1997|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=New York|isbn=0028972252|page=1293|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[curie]] is a unit of radioactivity (3.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; decays per second or 37 [[becquerel|gigabecquerels]]) originally named in honor of Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910, after his death. Subsequently, there has been some controversy over whether the naming was in honor of Pierre, Marie, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul W. Frame | title = How the Curie Came to Be | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/thecurie.htm | accessdate =30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritualism===
In the late nineteenth century, Pierre Curie was investigating the mysteries of ordinary [[magnetism]] when he became aware of the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] experiments of other European scientists, such as [[Charles Richet]] and [[Camille Flammarion]]. Pierre Curie initially thought systematic investigation into the paranormal could help with some unanswered questions about magnetism.&lt;ref name=Hurwic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hurwic|first1=Anna|title=Pierre Curie, Translated by Lilananda Dasa and Joseph Cudnik|date=1995|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=9782082115629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}} He wrote to his fiancée [[Marie Curie|Marie]]:  "I must admit that those [[Spiritualism|spiritual]] phenomena intensely interest me. I think in them are questions that deal with physics."&lt;ref name=Hurwic/&gt;{{rp|66}} Pierre Curie's notebooks from this period show he read many books on spiritualism.&lt;ref name=Hurwic/&gt;{{rp|68}} He did not attend séances such as those of [[Eusapia Palladino]] in Paris in 1905–6&lt;ref name=Hurwic/&gt;{{rp|238}} as a mere spectator, and his goal certainly was not to communicate with spirits. He saw the séances as scientific experiments, tried to monitor different parameters, and took detailed notes of every observation.&lt;ref name=Hurwic/&gt;{{rp|247}} Despite studying spiritualism, Curie was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Allen Smith (2000).

==Family==
Pierre and Marie Curie's daughter, [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]], and their son-in-law, [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], were also physicists involved in the study of [[radioactivity]], and each received Nobel prizes for their work as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1935: Frédéric Joliot, Irène Joliot-Curie | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1935/press.html | publisher=Nobel Foundation | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curies' other daughter, [[Ève Curie|Ève]], wrote a noted biography of her mother.&lt;ref name="Eve"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curie|first1=Eve|title=Madame Curie|date=1937|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/madamecurie035051mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only member of the Curie family to not become a physicist.

==Death==
[[File:Panthéon Pierre et Marie Curie.JPG|thumb|right|Tombs of [[Marie Curie|Marie]] (''above'') and Pierre Curie at [[Paris]]' [[Panthéon]]]]
Pierre Curie died in a street accident in Paris on 19 April 1906. Crossing the busy [[Rue Dauphine]] in the rain at the Quai de Conti, he slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn cart. He died instantly when one of the wheels ran over his head, fracturing his skull.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1906/04/20/archives/prof-curie-killed-in-a-paris-street-the-discoverer-of-radium-run.html |title=Prof. Curie killed in a Paris street |format=PDF |date=20 April 1906 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made by his father and lab assistant imply that Curie's characteristic absent-minded preoccupation with his thoughts contributed to his death.&lt;ref name=preoc&gt;{{Citation |url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/curie/trag1.htm |title=Marie Curie - Tragedy and Adjustment (1906-1910) |date=2000 |work=Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Curies experienced radium burns, both accidentally and voluntarily,&lt;ref name="Mould"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mould|first1=R.F.|title=Pierre Curie, 1859–1906|journal=Current Oncology|date=2007|volume=14|issue=2|pages=74–82|pmc=1891197|pmid=17576470|doi=10.3747/co.2007.110}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research. They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died of [[aplastic anemia]] in 1934. Even now, all their papers from the 1890s, even her cookbooks, are too dangerous to touch. Their laboratory books are kept in special lead boxes and people who want to see them have to wear protective clothing.&lt;ref name="TASCH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tasch|first1=Barbara|title=These personal effects of 'the mother of modern physics' will be radioactive for another 1500 years|journal=Business Insider|date=August 31, 2015|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/marie-curie-radioactive-papers-2015-8|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had Pierre Curie not been killed as he was, it is likely that he would have eventually died of the effects of radiation, as did his wife, their daughter, Irène, and her husband, Frédéric Joliot.&lt;ref name="Redniss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redniss|first1=Lauren|title=Radioactive : Marie And Pierre Curie : a tale of love and fallout|date=2010|publisher=HarperEntertainment|location=New York|isbn=978-0061351327|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartusiak"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartusiak|first1=Marcia|title="Radioactive: Marie &amp; Pierre Curie — A Tale of Love and Fallout" by Lauren Redniss|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/radioactive-marie-and-pierre-curie--a-tale-of-love-and-fallout-by-lauren-redniss/2011/11/02/gIQANSMBDN_story.html|accessdate=9 July 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995, Pierre and Marie Curie were moved from their original resting place, a family cemetery, and enshrined in the [[crypt]] of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon in Paris]].  Marie Curie was the first woman to be honored in this way "for her own merits".&lt;ref name="Pantheon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marie Curie Enshrined in Pantheon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/21/world/marie-curie-enshrined-in-pantheon.html|accessdate=9 July 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">The term '''Quality use of medicines''' is used by the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] as part of their policies on effective and correct uses of [[medicine]] and access to appropriate medicines.

==Guiding Principles==
Quality Use of Medicines (abbreviated to QUM) is one of the four policy pillars in the [[Australian Government]]’s [[National Medicines Policy]] first developed in 2000, and involves the safe and judicious use of [[medicines]] by the general public.

In the documentation of the National Medicines Policy, the four tenets&lt;ref&gt;''Department of Health and Ageing – Quality Use of Medicines'' (2008). Available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/national-medicines-policydoc~national-medicines-policy-5 (accessed 6 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; of Quality Use of Medicines involve medicines being used:
*Judiciously, using medicines only after considering all other options
*Appropriately, choosing a medicine after appraisal of factors including risk-benefit analysis, treatment length and cost
*Safely, minimising misuse and abuse
*Efficaciously, having a quantifiable benefit to the patient’s health and/or quality of life
Quality Use of Medicines is primarily a patient-oriented movement, with the documentation stressing the importance of patient-professional communication along with patient knowledge and understanding their medicines.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/national-medicines-policydoc~national-medicines-policy-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has begun to enter consumer-oriented Australian media in both journalistic&lt;ref&gt;''CHF Quality Use of Medicines Engagement in Moree'' (2009). Available at http://www.chf.org.au/pdfs/rep/rep-353-qum-engagement-moree.pdf (accessed 6 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and corporate&lt;ref&gt;Pfizer Australia, ''Quality Use of Medicines.'' Available at http://www.pfizer.com.au/Facts/QualityUse.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; contexts, while the concepts are becoming increasingly central to general pharmaceutical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, ''PSA Position Statement on Community Pharmacy Agreements'' (2009). Available at http://www.psa.org.au/site.php?id=4209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In the 1997-1998 [[Australian federal budget]], the Government allocated funds towards creation of the [[National Prescribing Service]] (NPS MedicineWise), a body tasked with undertaking and promoting Quality Use of Medicines work. The organisation’s services such as the [http://nps.org.au/consumers/tools__and__tips/medicine_name_finder ''Medicine Name Finder''] and [http://nps.org.au/consumers/ask_an_expert/contact_a_pharmacist/medicines_line ''Medicines Line''] are the most apparent representations of governmental QUM policy at work. Medicines Line, for example, provides a hotline for patients to call with questions about their medicines, furthering the QUM goal of ensuring medicine safety through improved patient knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;National Prescribing Service, ''Medicines Line''. Available at http://nps.org.au/consumers/ask_an_expert/contact_a_pharmacist/medicines_line (accessed 6 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee]] (PBAC) provides advice and recommendations on whether or not to include medicines on Australia’s [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS). The PBAC takes a number of QUM-related factors into account, including those not traditionally looked at by doctors like cost-effectiveness, course length and alternative therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Australia (2002). ''The National Strategy for Quality Use of Medicines''. Page 34. Available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/CA777524C860DFF2CA256F1800468B61/$File/natstrateng.pdf (accessed 6 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The body has been praised for its improvements to the PBS system, most particularly in the area of cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Gertskis, Mark (2009). “PBAC lauded for cost-effectiveness”. ''Pharmacy News'', available at http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/article/pbac-lauded-for-cost-effectiveness/501162.aspx (accessed 6 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase which consists of a health centre and pharmacy opened on 3 February 2011. It take the form of sunken angular blocks and is clad in copper both on the facades and roof. The design is inspired by the ice floes that float in [[Godthåbsfjord]] and the image of [[Sermitsiaq (mountain)|Sermitsiaq]],  a 1210 meters high mountain and local landmark, symbol for Nuuk municipality before municipal mergers in 2009, however Sermitsiaq is not Greenland’s highest mountain, (Gunnbjørn Fjeldet, 3694 meter high in Eastgreenland is the highest in Greenland).&lt;ref name=Architecture/&gt;

Also planned are a psychiatric building, rural pharmacy and a new medical clinic for general practitioners as well a circular patient ‘hotel’ with additional beds.&lt;ref name=Architecture/&gt;

The '''Riddle scale''' (also known as ''Riddle homophobia scale'' or ''Riddle scale of homophobia'') was a [[psychometric]] [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]] that measured the degree to which a person is or is not [[homophobic]]. The scale was frequently used in tolerance education about [[anti-discriminatory]] attitudes regarding [[sexual orientation]]. It is named after its creator, psychologist [[Dorothy Riddle]].

==Overview==
The Riddle homophobia scale was developed by [[Dorothy Riddle]] in 1973–74 while she was overseeing research for the [[American Psychological Association]] Task Force on Gays and Lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silgbtcenter.org/ Staten Island LGBT history] Staten Island LGBT Community Center, Accessed Dec. 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was distributed at talks and workshops but was not formally published for a long time; it is cited in the literature either as an (unpublished) conference presentation from 1985&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D. I. (1985). Homophobia scale. ''Opening doors to understanding and acceptance: A facilitator’s guide for presenting workshops on lesbian and gay issues'', Workshop organized by Kathy Obear and Amy Reynolds, Boston. Unpublished essay.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an article from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D., (1994). The Riddle scale. ''Alone no more: Developing a school support system for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth.'' St Paul: Minnesota State Department.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was developed, Riddle's analysis was one of the first modern classifications of attitudes towards homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In that respect, the scale has served the purpose that Riddle originally had in mind: she devised the scale to explicate the continuum of attitudes toward gays and lesbians and to assess the current and desired institutional culture of an organization or a work place.&lt;ref&gt;Peterkin, A. Risdon, C., (2003). ''Caring for lesbian and gay people: A clinical guide.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Level of measurement==
The Riddle scale is an eight-term uni-[[dimension]]al [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type [[Level of measurement#Interval scale|interval scale]] with nominal labels and no explicit [[Origin (mathematics)|zero point]]. Each term is associated with a set of attributes and beliefs; individuals are assigned a position on the scale based on the attributes they exhibit and beliefs they hold.

The scale is frequently divided into two parts, the 'homophobic levels of attitude' (first four terms) and the 'positive levels of attitude' (last four terms).&lt;ref&gt;Clauss-Ehlers, C. S. (ed), (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scale==
*'''Repulsion''': Homosexuality is seen as a crime against nature. Gays/lesbians are considered sick, crazy, immoral, sinful, wicked, etc. Anything is justified to change them: [[incarceration]], [[hospital]]ization, [[Reparative therapy|behavior therapy]], [[electroconvulsive therapy]], etc.
*'''Pity''': Represents heterosexual [[chauvinism]]. Heterosexuality is considered more mature and certainly to be preferred. It is believed that any possibility of becoming straight should be reinforced, and those who seem to be born that way should be pitied as less fortunate ("the poor dears").
*'''Tolerance''': Homosexuality is viewed as a phase of adolescent development that many people go through and most people grow out of. Thus, lesbians/gays are less mature than straights and should be treated with the protectiveness and indulgence one uses with children who are still maturing. It is believed that lesbians/gays should not be given positions of authority because they are still working through their adolescent behavior.
*'''Acceptance''': Still implies that there is something to accept; the existing climate of discrimination is ignored. Characterized by such statements as "You're not lesbian to me, you're a person!" or "What you do in bed is your own business." or "That's fine with me as long as you don't flaunt it!"
*'''Support''': People at this level may be uncomfortable themselves, but they are aware of the homophobic climate and the irrational unfairness, and work to safeguard the rights of lesbians and gays.
*'''Admiration''': It is acknowledged that being lesbian/gay in our society takes strength.  People at this level are willing to truly examine their homophobic attitudes, values, and behaviors.
*'''Appreciation''': The diversity of people is considered valuable and lesbians/gays are seen as a valid part of that diversity. People on this level are willing to combat homophobia in themselves and others.
*'''Nurturance''': Assumes that gay/lesbian people are indispensable in our society. People on this level view lesbians/gays with genuine affection and delight, and are willing to be their allies and advocates.

==Discussion==
Riddle's analysis has been credited for pointing out that although 'tolerance' and 'acceptance' can be seen as positive attitudes, they should actually be treated as negative because they can mask underlying fear or hatred (somebody can tolerate a baby crying on an airplane while at the same time wishing that it would stop) or indicate that there is indeed something that we need to accept, and that we are the ones with the power to reject or to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld W. J. (2000). How homophobia hurts everyone. ''Readings for diversity and social justice''. New York: Routledge, 267–275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ollis, D., (2004). I’m just a home economics teacher. Does discipline background impact on teachers’ ability to affirm and include [[gender and sexual diversity]] in secondary school health education programs? ''AARE Conference'', Melbourne 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This observation generalizes to attitude evaluations in other areas besides sexual orientation and is one of the strengths of Riddle's study.

Although it deals mostly with adult attitudes towards difference, the model has been positioned in the cognitive developmental tradition of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg's]] [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirscheld, S., (2001). Moving beyond the safety zone: A staff development approach to anti-heterosexist education. ''Fordham Urban Law Journal'', 29, 611–641.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a psychometric scale, the Riddle scale has been considered to have acceptable [[face validity]] but its exact [[Psychometrics#Key concepts|psychometric properties]] are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, M. J., Storaasli, R. D., Bandele, A., and Schaefer, V., (2003). Diversity training in graduate school: An exploratory evaluation of the safe zone project. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 34, 555–561.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, E. W, and Potocky-Tripodi, M., (2006). Changing heterosexuals' attitudes toward homosexuals: A systematic review of the empirical literature. ''Research on Social Work Practice,'' 16 (2), 176–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Situ Gintung''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], ''Lake Gintung'') was an [[Reservoir|artificial lake]] near to the town of [[Cirendeu]] (pronounced {{IPA-su|tʃirəndɤ|}}) in [[Tangerang|Tangerang District]], [[Indonesia]].  It was formed by a dam up to {{convert|16|m|ft}} high which was built by [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial authorities]] in 1933.  The dam failed on 27 March 2009, draining the lake, with resulting floods killing at least 100 people.&lt;ref name="Negligence"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/justAdded/walhi-cites-6-officials-for-dam-negligence/272142 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104215048/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/justAdded/walhi-cites-6-officials-for-dam-negligence/272142 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2013 |title=Walhi Cites 6 Officials For Dam Negligence |work=[[Jakarta Globe]] |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The lake and dam are located in the suburb of Cirendeu, [[Ciputat]] in Tangerang District.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7970438.stm |title=Indonesia crews resume dam rescue|date=29 March 2009 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dam was originally built of earth by Dutch colonial authorities in 1933 and was up to {{convert|16|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="jakarta"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/justAdded/yet-another-tragedy-strikes-the-nation/270868 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204051358/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/justAdded/yet-another-tragedy-strikes-the-nation/270868 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 February 2013 |title=Yet Another Tragedy Strikes the Nation |date=27 March 2009 |work=[[Jakarta Globe]] |accessdate=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made from earth compacted into a wall {{convert|16|m|ft}} high and the reservoir held at least {{convert|2000000|m3|cuft}} of water.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-27"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7967205.stm |title=Indonesia dam burst kills dozens |date=27 March 2009 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the dam had been to retain water for irrigation of [[Paddy field|rice paddies]] which were then replaced by urban development.&lt;ref name="water power"/&gt; People living near the dam had made complaints about leaks in the past and the dam actually breached in November 2008 but no damage was done.&lt;ref name="jakarta"/&gt;  It is thought that little maintenance had been carried out since the dam was built.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-28"/&gt;

There will be new regulatory agency in India to regulate health education by enforcement of a new bill being tabled in the [[Parliament of India]] in the monsoon session of August 2010 for the formation of an agency called the "National Council for Human Resource in Health in India –NCHRH”. The [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] has approved the revised draft for the proposed NCHRH Bill which will be an overarching body for the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goodbye MCI?

Becoming a doctor in India will be more difficult once the said regulatory authority starts functioning, which is expected to be at any time from August 2010 onwards. The agency will also bring about overall transparency, eliminating the present, allegedly corrupt admission formalities in the field of medical education. From the next academic year, i.e. 2011, onwards there will be a common [[MBBS]] entrance test (single PMT)[[National Eligibility and Entrance Test]] -UG replacing the over 17 [[All India Pre Medical Test]](PMTs) conducted all over the country for over 35,000 undergraduate seats. But Tamil Nadu has moved the Supreme Court challenging this decision of single common test for all India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decision on medical CET put on hold|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article582658.ece|accessdate= 20 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date= 20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second major change will be the National Exit Examination [[National Eligibility and Entrance Test]] PG for students graduating from Indian medical colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Becoming a practising doctor may soon become tougher - India

|accessdate= 6 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date= 3 August 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new draft proposes a National Committee for Accreditation and a National Medical Education and Training Board that will register and accredit medical colleges and prepare curricula for all streams of education in the health sector. The powers of the existing councils, including the [[Medical Council of India]], will be substantially reduced and they will deal only with licensing, continuing education and ethics. These bodies, though under the general supervision of the NCHRH, will be entirely independent in their structure and functioning, and will consist of senior professional, selected or nominated through a rigorous process. The NCHRH will be a 15-member body. The original NCHRH Bill was re-drafted after several States raised objections on the ground that the body was highly centralized and would usurp the powers of the States. The re-constituted task force on NCHRH held several rounds of consultations in [[New Delhi]], [[Chennai]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]] before coming up with the revised version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revised NCHRH draft gets Health Ministry approval|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2010/07/10/stories/2010071060110300.htm|accessdate= 6 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date= 10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill on medical education regulator likely in monsoon session|url=http://www.indiaedunews.net/Medical/Bill_on_medical_education_regulator_likely_in_monsoon_session_11703/|accessdate= 6 August 2010|newspaper=India Edu News Net|date= 26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the NCHRH council bill:(0ld 0ne)
There shall be established seven administrative departments under the Council for
regulation of each category of health professionals:
# Department of Medicine;
# Department of Nursing;
# Department of Dentistry;
# Department of Pharmacy;
# Department of Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy;
# Department of Public Health and Hospital Management; and
# Department of Allied Health Sciences
The draft bill, which was finalized by the union health ministry, for the establishment of the NCHRH as an overarching regulatory body for health and allied sectors, has received the approval from the PMO. Now that it has received the PMO approval, it will be put up before the Union Cabinet and will finally be introduced in Parliament for its final nod, sources said.
 
The NCHRH is proposed to be established by the health ministry as an overarching regulatory authority in the country to reform the current regulatory framework in medical education and enhance the supply of skilled personnel to the healthcare sector in the country. Once in place, the NCHRH will be the overarching regulatory body for all the premier medical educational institutions and autonomous regulatory bodies like Medical Council of India (MCI), Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), Nursing Council of India (NCI), Dental Council of India (DCI) and the proposed Central Councils for Paramedical and Allied Medical Sciences Education.
 
It will prescribe standards with a view to have proper planning and co-coordinated development of medical and allied health education throughout the country and maintain national live electronic register of medical and allied health professionals.
 
The expert group of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the task force of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) broadly agreed to settle their turf war over the jurisdiction of medical education. The National Commission for Human Resources in Health (NCHRH) will get tolay down the minimum standards of medical education, while all health-related research will comeunder the purview of the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), promoted by the HRD Ministry. The NCHRH and the NCHER draft Bills — proposed as regulatory bodies — have been pending for the past several months as the two ministries were involved in a tussle over the jurisdiction of medical education
 
As per the draft bill, the administration of the Council will consist of a Secretariat headed by a Secretary-General who will be appointed by the Council for a fixed term of three years. Under this secretariat, seven departments, each for separate categories like Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Dentistry, Rehabilitation &amp; Physiotherapy, Public Health &amp; Hospital Management and Allied Health Sciences, will be established and headed by a director for regulatory purposes.
 
In every state, there will be separate bodies constituted by the Council for each administrative department which will be known as Registration and Ethics Board with name of the state in front and the department's name in the end. These bodies will replace the existing State Councils. These boards have to maintain a live electronic register of professionals in the state of the respective Department to be known as 'State Register of (name of the Department) and which will be linked to the National Register of Human Resources in Health maintained by the Council.
 
Each Board will comprise a president, a vice-president and not less than 10 members out of which three will be women candidates. There will be a nominee of the state government also.

In the new proposed bill Department of Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy; &amp; Department of Public Health and Hospital Management has been removed and a common para medical council has been suggested by committee.

which is totally unacceptable by 'Indian Association of Physiotherapist".They are in demand for their separate council from almost 40 years.But still, government has not formed a separate council for them.Still government job comes on diploma degree in Physiotherapy, but in this field education has reached up to PhD level.

According to WHO, it has been declared as separate profession apart from medical or paramedical.

Due to lack of effective council, this profession is unable to control above 65000 professional and quality of education &amp; patient care in on risk.Further social and educational importance are going down.

[[Image:HaluskyzoZiaru.JPG|right|320px|thumb|[[Bryndzové halušky]] (potato dumplings with sheep's-milk cheese) is a traditional food of [[shepherd]]s in [[Slovakia]].]]

'''Traditional foods''' are foods and [[Dish (food)|dishes]] that are passed through [[generation]]s&lt;ref name="Kristbergsson Oliveira 2016"/&gt; or which have been consumed many generations.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Traditional foods and dishes are [[tradition]]al in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a [[national dish]], [[regional cuisine]]&lt;ref name="Kristbergsson Oliveira 2016"/&gt; or local [[cuisine]]. Traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

Some traditional foods have [[geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union]] designations per European Union schemes of [[geographical indication]]s and traditional specialties: [[Protected designation of origin]] (PDO), [[Protected geographical indication]] (PGI) and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG)|Traditional specialities guaranteed]] (TSG). These standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/schemes/index_en.htm|title=Geographical indications and traditional specialities|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">[[Nostradamus]]'s '''''Traité des fardemens et confitures''''', variously entitled ''Moult utile opuscule...'' and ''Le vrai et parfaict embellissement de la face...'', was first published in 1555, even though it contained a ''Proem'', or prologue, dated 1552. Clearly the work of an [[apothecary]], it contained recipes for preparing [[cosmetics]] and [[fruit preserves|preserve]]s, the latter based largely on sugar, which was controlled at the time by the apothecaries' guilds.&lt;ref&gt;See history of sugar [http://maggierose.20megsfree.com/sugar.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the topics covered (which include removing spots from the face ''with mercury'') were:

A. THE COSMETICS MANUAL
* Chapter VI: ''To make a perfect nutmeg oil''
* Chapter VIII [the one giving Nostradamus’s famous plague remedy]: ''To make the basis of a perfectly good and excellent aromatic powder''
* Chapter X: ''To make a sweet smelling, long lasting paste''
* Chapter XI: ''Another method for making aromatic balls''
* Chapter XIII: ''Powder for cleaning and whitening the teeth''
* Chapter XIIII: ''Another more excellent method for cleaning the teeth, even rotten ones'' [by filing them down]
* Chapter XV: ''Perfumed water for impregnating the shapes or forms mentioned above''
* Chapter XVIII (1556): ''To truly make the lovers’ sexual potion which the ancients used for love-making''
* Chapter XXIIII: ''How to make the hair golden blond''
* Chapter XXVI [often erroneously described as for an aphrodisiac]: ''A supreme and very useful composition for the health of the human body''
* Chapter XXVII: ''There follows the way in which one should use the above mentioned composition''

B. THE COOKBOOK
* Chapter III: ''To make candied orange peel, using sugar or honey''
* Chapter VIII: ''How to make a jam or preserve with heart cherries''
* Chapter XV: ''To make a quince jelly of superb beauty, goodness, flavour and excellence fit to set before a King''
* Chapter XXIIII: ''To preserve pears''
* Chapter XXV: ''To make a very fine sugar candy''
* Chapter XXVII: ''To make marzipan''
* Chapter XXIX: ''To make a laxative rose syrup''

The book was translated into German in 1574, then the German was revised in 1994, and finally the ''German'' was translated into English under the title ''The Elixirs of Nostradamus'' (Moyer Bell, 1996). Needless to say, the fourth-hand results of this process were unreliable, if not downright dangerous: the term ''roses rouges incarnées'', for example, was routinely translated as 'black orchids', and ''urines'' (urine) came out as 'drinking wells'.
