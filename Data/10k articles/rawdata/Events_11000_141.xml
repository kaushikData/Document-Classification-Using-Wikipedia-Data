It took place on 24 September 1990, when a liquid petroleum gas tanker truck crashed on the expressway exit at New Phetchaburi Road, causing large explosions and fires that burned through 38 shophouses for over 24 hours. 90 people died, 121 were injured and 43 cars were destroyed, making it one of the deadliest man-made disasters in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=รถก๊าซระเบิด : ถนนเพชรบุรี|publisher=Relief and Community Health Bureau, Thai Red Cross Society| url=http://www.rtrc.in.th/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=303 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proposition 6''' was an [[initiative]] [[statute]] that appeared on the [[California state elections, 1998|November 3, 1998 California general election]] ballot.  It was passed with 4,670,524 ''Yes'' votes, for 59.4 percent of the total votes cast.  The proposition added sections 598c and 598d to the [[California Penal Code]], making it a [[felony]] for any person in the state to possess, transfer, receive, or hold a horse (defined to include [[pony|ponies]], [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s) with the intent to kill it, or have it killed, where the person knows, or should have known, that any part of the carcass will be used for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartvoter.org/1998nov/ca/state/prop/6/ League of Women Voters] "Proposition 6 Criminal Law: Prohibition on Slaughter of Horses and Sale of Horsemeat for Human Consumption," (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional provision makes it a [[misdemeanor]] to sell horseflesh within the state as [[meat]] intended for human consumption.  The law further allows for anyone previously convicted of selling horsemeat to be charged with a felony in any future prosecutions for the same offense.  Only about one percent of California horses were previously slaughtered for horsemeat, primarily for [[export]] to markets in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.lwv.org/lwvc.files/nov98/id/prop6.html League of Women Voters] "Proposition 6 CRIMINAL LAW. PROHIBITION ON SLAUGHTER OF HORSES AND SALE OF HORSEMEAT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION," (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;   Horsemeat is rarely eaten by people in the [[United States]].

The '''2011 Chile blackout''' was a major [[power outage]] that occurred on 24 September 2011, approximately between 20:30 and 21:45 local time (23:30 and 00:45 UTC respectively), although the time of reinstatement varied geographically.  It mainly affected the regions from [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]] to [[Maule Region|Maule]], where the blackout was total, but it also reportedly partially affected the [[Atacama Region|Atacama]] and [[Bío Bío Region|Bío Bío]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/09/680-394865-9-corte-de-luz-afecta-desde-la-tercera-a-la-octava-region.shtml |title=Corte de luz afecta desde la Tercera a la Octava Región |accessdate=25 September 2011 |author=[[La Tercera]] |date=24 September 2011 |publisher=[[COPESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The blackout affected approximately nine million Chileans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdec-sic.cl/imagenes/contenidos/File/noticias/2011/sep11/Comunicado%20CDEC-SIC.pdf |title=Comunicado del CDEC SIC "Apagón del SIC" |accessdate=24 September 2011 |author=Ricke Muñoz, Eduardo |date=24 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113053223/https://www.cdec-sic.cl/imagenes/contenidos/File/noticias/2011/sep11/Comunicado%20CDEC-SIC.pdf |archive-date=13 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post, 2011-09-24"&gt;{{cite news |title=Widespread power blackout darkens much of Chile; subway riders evacuated in capital |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/widespread-power-blackout-darkens-much-of-chile-subway-riders-evacuated-in-capital/2011/09/24/gIQAtl7fuK_story.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the blackout, which started at 20:30 local time ([[UTC−03:00]]), was later determined to be equipment failure at an electrical substation. [[Rodrigo Álvarez Zenteno]], Minister of Energy, noted a computer system malfunction and "oscillation problems" affecting two [[power lines]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post, 2011-09-24"/&gt;  The blackout interrupted mobile phone service&lt;ref name="AFP, 2011-09-24"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackout plunges Chile's capital into darkness |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCDMNM_EExYAd8tIZ12P03d_IiSQ?docId=CNG.eaf6a73b00e0dd770920ce19ffdb5931.231 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124142407/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCDMNM_EExYAd8tIZ12P03d_IiSQ?docId=CNG.eaf6a73b00e0dd770920ce19ffdb5931.231|dead-url=yes |archivedate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forced the evacuation of thousands of rail and [[rapid transit]] passengers in [[Santiago]], the capital city.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, 2011-09-24"/&gt;  It also delayed a concert by [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Ricky Martin]]&lt;ref name="AFP, 2011-09-24"/&gt;  A supermarket in [[Quilicura]] was looted, and a youth was wounded during a confrontation between the looters and police.&lt;ref name="AFP, 2011-09-24"/&gt;

The outage affected operations at a number of [[copper]] mines, of which Chile is the world's top producer.&lt;ref name="Avila and Gardner, 2011-09-24"&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE 4-Power blackout hits Chile, halts copper mines |first=Moises |last=Avila |first2=Simon |last2=Gardner |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/chile-blackout-idUSS1E78N0CX20110925 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Los Bronces mine]], operated by [[Anglo American PLC|Anglo American]], halted production temporarily and later, with power from generators, resumed at one-third capacity.&lt;ref name="Avila and Gardner, 2011-09-24"/&gt;  [[CODELCO]], Chile's state-owned copper mining company, reported that its Andina division and the [[El Teniente]] mine had lost power but continued operations using generators until power was restored.&lt;ref name="Avila and Gardner, 2011-09-24"/&gt;

==Investigation==
On 6 December 2011, the Chile regulatory authority Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels  (SEC) determined that the cause of the blackout was an electrical [[short circuit]] in a 220 Kilovolt capacitor bank at the Ancoa [[electrical substation]] which is located in [[Linares, Chile]], and the subsequent malfunction of the associated [[protective relay]] equipment that should have prevented the [[cascading failure]]. SEC also determined that the time needed to restore power was prolonged by both procedural and equipment issues.

As a result of the investigation, SEC has assessed charges against the following four power companies; Transelec, [[Endesa (Chile)]], [[Colbún S.A.]], and Chilectra.

The Superintendent of the SEC, Luis Avila Bravo, said "we are making charges for not maintaining the equipment in good condition, which ultimately represents a threat to the power system security as well as for problems in applying the procedures used to restore the supply of power ".

Avila added that companies now have 15 days to respond to the charges, after which the SEC may determine sanctions, and possible fines of up to 10,000 AWU (approx. $9M US) although the final amount will depend on the merits of each investigation.&lt;ref name="SEC charges against TRANSELEC, ENDESA, Colbún CHILECTRA the blackout of the 24S, 2011-12-06"&gt;{{cite news |title=SEC formula cargos contra TRANSELEC, ENDESA, COLBÚN y CHILECTRA por el blackout del "24S" |url=http://www.sec.cl/portal/page?_pageid=33,4559637&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |date=6 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adequacy.org''' was a [[satire|satirical]] web site. It featured articles on [[politics]], [[religion]], [[technology]], [[history]], and [[sociology]], as well as the "Linux Zealot" cartoon series. The site shut down on September 11, 2002, but has since made its archives available.

Adequacy.org's slogan was "News for grown-ups," a play on the slogan of the popular [[Slashdot]] technology news site, "News for nerds. Stuff that matters," as an Adequacy's founding editor claimed to have been a regular [[Internet troll|troll]] on Slashdot. [http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.7.25.7321.26410.html]

==Background==
The Adequacy authors began as trolls on [[Slashdot]] and [[Kuro5hin]], other technology-oriented discussion sites. They devised and posted many comments designed to provoke outraged responses; common styles included slighting a revered [[operating system]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] leader, or posting messages with simple but deliberate technical errors, which would incite hundreds of corrections.

After several years of such behavior, the Adequacy authors decided to open their own site consisting entirely of such articles intended to incite the reader, where users "in the know" would post comments agreeing with the articles.

Behind the scenes, the targets of the articles would be enticed to come to Adequacy and read the article. Adequacy members would post to weblogs, and other discussion forums, often pretending to be outraged by the article themselves. As an example, the article Not Just Harmless Fun [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.11.20.94827.169.html], which argues that all [[anime]] is [[hentai]] and is designed to destroy [[Christianity|Christian]] [[moral]]s, was promoted on [[Usenet]] as such: "the author is some kind of Christian lunatic who believes that anime is all about paedophilia!"[https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=45e4b219.0111290908.6900acc4%40posting.google.com]. The person behind this Usenet posting was James "spiralx" Skinner, also known as "Jon Erikson", the author of the article in question. He later stated, "I wrote the article to wind up anime-loving geeks."[http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2003/7/18/205013/523?pid=158#165]

==Adequacy style==
A popular device used in Adequacy articles was to [[hyperlink]] almost every word or phrase to another article on the [[Internet]], related to the specific word or phrase linked, often [[humour|humorously]], but meaningless in the context of the article. Confined perspectives concerning subjects such as the British Empire were [http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.7.13.133240.148.html openly] mocked; or the sentence "we survived a hardy winter" might have the word "hardy" linked to an article on [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Adequacy would also occasionally hyperlink to itself using words like "controversy" or phrases such as "the world's most controversial web site".

Adequacy would often deliberately misspell the targets of its satire. For example, Linux was always written as "Lunix", which has connotations of "lunatics" (although this spelling was already widely used in humorous contexts elsewhere, notably by Jeff K). [[Linus Torvalds]] was written as either "Linux Torvalds",  "Lunix Torvaldez" or "Linyos Torovoltos", and claimed to be a native of various countries, most often Russia. There were also technological in-jokes such as the idea of "IP Tokens" which could be stolen by hackers and used for nefarious purposes if you didn't have the correct protection mechanisms.

Many respondents to Adequacy used the point by point rebuttal format for raising their objections. For a brief period, Adequacy responded to such comments by removing them from public view and replacing them with a "Deletion Notice", which contained only their consequently incoherent responses, together with a copyright violation notice, chastising the poster for reproducing the entirety of the contested article without the author's permission.[http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2002.4.16.17245.2964.html#35] [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2002.4.16.84844.1816.html#119] [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2002.4.30.73310.8177.html#4] This was termed a "War on Copyright Violation"[http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2002.4.28.12297.7631.html], perhaps as a satirical reference to the [[War on Drugs]] or [[War on Terrorism]].

==Notable stories==
As was the case for many humor-oriented Web sites, the mood on Adequacy was considerably more somber in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, DC]]. Consequently, Adequacy published many "straight" stories related to the attacks. One of the earliest satires of the global terrorism phenomenon to appear on the Internet, John Montoya's "Why The Bombings Mean That We Must Support My Politics", actually ridiculed the politicians and pundits who used the attacks as a platform to advance their particular views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Raymond]], who had opined on the evening following the attacks that armed civilians on the airliners could have averted the attacks and that the "lawmakers who disarmed all the non-terrorists on those four airplanes" were in part responsible for them.&lt;ref name="Raymond2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond, Eric S. |url=http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/09/11/2048256&amp;mode=thread |title=Decentralism against terrorism -- first lessons from the 9/11 attack |accessdate=2006-11-21 |date=2001-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020227131542/http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01%2F09%2F11%2F2048256&amp;mode=thread |archivedate=2002-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond's comments, published mere hours after the attacks had taken place, generated widespread outrage, even among those who otherwise supported his role as an open source spokesman.&lt;ref name="Guillaume2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Guillaume|url=http://www.advogato.org/article/340.html|title=ESR Doesn't Speak For Me|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=2001-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Adequacy'' story, which was initially published on September 12, was its most popular post-9/11 story and was eventually syndicated by ''[[AlterNet]]'' on October 2, 2001, causing it to be mentioned by a number of online news and discussion sites.&lt;ref name="Montoya2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Montoya, John Saul|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11623/|title=Why The Bombings Mean That We Must Support My Politics|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=2001-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was also mentioned in [[The Industry Standard]], wherein commentator Keith Dawson referred to it as "a brilliant height of satire".&lt;ref name="Dawson2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson, Keith |url=http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,28983,00.html |title=Exploiting It |accessdate=2006-11-27 |date=2001-09-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110072846/http://www.thestandard.com/article/0%2C1902%2C28983%2C00.html |archivedate=10 November 2006 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a return to more traditional fare, ''Adequacy'' used the October [[2001 anthrax attacks]] against U.S. politicians and media figures as an occasion to petition the thrash metal band [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] to change their name. [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.10.12.14247.119.html] (The suggested replacement chosen by readers was "Basket Full Of Puppies".) The posted story implied that the band was engaged in "tasteless, juvenile antics" and that their name had been recently chosen in order to capitalize on the media coverage of the attacks. This prompted an angry response from [[Scott Ian]], the band's rhythm guitarist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some asshole from something called the ''Adequacy Org''. e-mailed us demanding that we change our name. The guy is clueless. He talks about our new album called  Spreading The Disease, calls us Grind Core, Death Metal and Speed Metal. He thinks we named the band last week to 'take advantage of this horrific situation.' Last week.....twenty years ago....... No big difference there. What a jackass.&lt;ref name="Ian2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ian, Scott |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&amp;Date=10/19/2001 |title=A Message from Scott Ian to Fans of Anthrax |accessdate=2006-11-21 |date=2001-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304062417/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&amp;Date=10%2F19%2F2001 |archivedate=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adequacy first gained widespread Internet notoriety after the December 2, 2001 publication of a story entitled "Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?" [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html] The story was engineered to raise the hackles of as wide a swath of the Internet [[geek]] community as possible; it lampooned such topics as the [[Linux]] operating system, processors from [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[online game|online gaming]], and [[rave culture]]. Furor over the story spread quickly through technology / gaming blogs and [[Usenet]] newsgroups [https://groups.google.com/groups?lnk=hpsg&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22is+your+son+a+computer+hacker%3F%22], and visitors came to the site in droves to express their opinions. The story received an official count of 5,913 individual comments, not including several thousand more that were hidden by the ''Adequacy'' editors. This figure even exceeds the record of the much more heavily visited ''Slashdot'', which (as of November 21, 2006) stands at 5,687 replies to the story "Kerry Concedes Election to Bush".&lt;ref name="slashdot2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=slashdot.org|url=http://slashdot.org/hof.shtml|title=Slashdot Hall of Fame|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publicity of the hacker story reached its highest point on January 7, 2002, when ''Adequacy'' was featured as the "Site of the Night" on the ''[[TechTV]]'' television program [[The Screen Savers]].&lt;ref name="G4TV2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=G4TV (formerly TechTV)|url=http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/36015/Site_of_the_Nite_Is_Your_Child_a_Hacker.html?detectflash=false&amp;|title=Site of the Nite: Is Your Child a Hacker?|accessdate=2006-11-22|date=2002-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosts [[Leo Laporte]] and [[Martin Sargent]] discussed the "warning signs" enumerated in the article individually, and while Laporte seemed inclined to believe that the article was a joke, neither was ultimately sure of what to make of it. "Is this a joke?" asked Laporte incredulously, to which Sargent replied "Do you think? I don't know. I can't tell."

On October 23, 2001, ''Adequacy'' published an interview [http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.9.26.215455.365.html] with actor [[Wil Wheaton]] which consisted mostly of questions poking fun of his stint as [[Wesley Crusher]] on the television program ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Wheaton, being familiar with the nature of the site, was willing to "play along" and provide the outrageous questions with equally outrageous answers.&lt;ref name="Wheaton2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheaton, Wil|url=http://www.wilwheaton.net/2001/10/scooping_adequacy_1.php|title=Scooping Adequacy|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=2001-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the readers of his own blog were not familiar with ''Adequacy'' and were dismayed over the answers that he had provided; Wheaton later expressed regret for doing the interview.&lt;ref name="Wheaton2001a"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheaton, Wil|url=http://www.wilwheaton.net/2001/10/slow_emotion_replay.php|title=Slow Emotion Replay|accessdate=2006-11-21|date=2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, ex-stripper and ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Koleen Brooks]] made national news when the voters of the town of [[Georgetown, Colorado]] voted to recall her from her position as the town's mayor, citing conduct "unbecoming an elected official".&lt;ref name="Sevcik2002"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sevcik, Kimberly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women/story/0,3604,707447,00.html|title=Too Wild For the West|accessdate=2006-11-22|date=2002-04-30|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks granted an interview with ''Adequacy'' wherein she discussed her performance as mayor and the circumstances surrounding her recall.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Anthrax''' is an infection caused by the bacterium ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Bas&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Information What is anthrax?|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517175036/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/index.html|archivedate=17 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur in four forms: skin, lungs, intestinal, and injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=21 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091519/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/index.html|archivedate=11 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms begin between one day and two months after the infection is contracted.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless [[skin ulcer|ulcer]] with a black center.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The intestinal form presents with diarrhea which may contain blood, abdominal pains, and nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The injection form presents with fever and an [[abscess]] at the site of [[intravenous drug use|drug injection]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=Symptoms|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/symptoms.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511071331/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/symptoms.html|archivedate=11 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium's [[endospore|spore]]s, which often appear in infectious animal products.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tran/&gt; Contact is by breathing, eating, or through an area of broken skin.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tran/&gt; It does not typically spread directly between people.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tran&gt;{{cite web|title=How People Are Infected|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/how-people-are-infected.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203338/https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/how-people-are-infected.html|archivedate=26 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products, travelers, postal workers, and military personnel.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Risk/&gt; Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by [[microbial culture|culture]] of a sample from the infected site.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Diag&gt;{{cite web |title=Diagnosis |url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/diagnosis.html |website=CDC |accessdate=14 May 2016 |date=1 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091531/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/diagnosis.html |archivedate=11 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skin ===
[[Image:Skin reaction to anthrax.jpg|thumb|Skin lesion from anthrax]]
[[File:Cutaneous anthrax lesion on the neck. PHIL 1934 lores.jpg|thumb|Skin anthrax lesion on the neck]]
Cutaneous anthrax, also known as Hide porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common form (&gt;90% of anthrax cases). It is also the least dangerous form of anthrax (low mortality with treatment, 20% mortality without).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutaneous Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/cutaneous.html|website=CDC|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en-us|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutaneous anthrax presents as a [[boil]]-like [[skin lesion]] that eventually forms an [[ulcer]] with a black center ([[eschar]]). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, [[necrotic]] ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike [[bruise]]s or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.&lt;ref name="CDC-Anthrax"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthrax Q &amp; A: Signs and Symptoms |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2003 |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |accessdate=19 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150014/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |archivedate=5 April 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when ''B. anthracis'' spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.

Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated,&lt;ref name="bravata" /&gt; because the infection area is limited to the skin, preventing the [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], [[edema]] factor, and protective [[antigen]] from entering and destroying a [[vital organ]].

Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and presents as two stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhalation Anthrax|url=https://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/inhalation-anthrax/overview.html|accessdate=14 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807075026/http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/inhalation-anthrax/overview.html|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic [[mediastinitis]], causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, therefore causing shortness of breath. The first stage causes cold and flu-like symptoms. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, and chills. This can last hours to days. Often, many fatalities from inhalational anthrax are when the first stage is mistaken for the cold or flu and the victim does not seek treatment until the second stage, which is 90% fatal. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly after hours or days of the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases. Historical mortality rates were over 85%,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|title = USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|last = [[USAMRIID]]|date = 2011|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |isbn = 9780160900150|edition = 7th|publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]]|quote = For the attacks of 2001, CFR was only 45%, while before this time CFRs for IA were &gt;85% (Page 37)|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209044622/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|archivedate = 9 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when treated early (seen in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]), observed case fatality rate dropped to 45%.&lt;ref name="bravata"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bravata |first=DM |last2=Holty |first2=JE |last3=Liu |first3=H |last4=McDonald |first4=KM |last5=Olshen |first5=RA |last6=Owens |first6=DK |title=Systematic review: a century of inhalational anthrax cases from 1900 to 2005 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=270–80 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16490913 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-4-200602210-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Distinguishing pulmonary anthrax from more common causes of respiratory illness is essential to avoiding delays in diagnosis and thereby improving outcomes.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
[[Human gastrointestinal tract|Gastrointestinal]] (GI) infection is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by diarrhea, potentially with blood, abdominal pains, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | title=Gastrointestinal Anthrax | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=23 August 2013 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211034003/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | archivedate=11 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional [[hematemesis|vomiting of blood]] can occur.  Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat. After the bacterium invades the gastrointestinal system, it spreads to the bloodstream and throughout the body, while continuing to make toxins. GI infections can be treated, but usually result in fatality rates of 25% to 60%, depending upon how soon treatment commences. This form of anthrax is the rarest form.

=== Bacteria ===
[[Image:Bacillus anthracis Gram.jpg|thumb|[[Photomicrograph]] of a [[Gram stain]] of the bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis'', the cause of the anthrax disease]]
{{Main|Bacillus anthracis}}
''Bacillus anthracis'' is a rod-shaped, [[Gram-positive]], aerobic bacterium about 1 by 9&amp;nbsp;μm in size.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Bas /&gt; It was shown to cause disease by [[Robert Koch]] in 1876 when he took a blood sample from an infected cow, isolated the bacteria, and put them into a mouse.&lt;ref name="pages 277-310"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=R |title=Untersuchungen über Bakterien: V.

The etiology of anthrax, based on the ontogenesis of ''Bacillus anthracis''], Cohns&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected whilst grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues, though this has not been proven. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.

The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence, and by the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours ''post mortem''. However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jb.asm.org/content/186/1/164.full.pdf |title=Formation and Composition of the ''Bacillus anthracis'' Endospore |author1=Hongbin Liu |author2=Nicholas H.

The triggers for spore formation are not yet known, though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.

The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as follows: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.&lt;ref name=Pimental04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimental |first=RA |last2=Christensen |first2=KA |last3=Krantz |first3=BA |last4=Collier |first4=RJ |title=Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=258–62 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15313199 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-291X(04)01621-3 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction, bleeding, and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late, even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria, some hosts still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their system at lethal dose levels.

Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin, wool, and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans. Workers who are exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk, especially in countries where anthrax is more common. Anthrax in [[livestock]] grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the United States and elsewhere. Many workers who deal with wool and animal hides are routinely exposed to low levels of anthrax spores, but most exposure levels are not sufficient to develop anthrax infections. A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10,000–20,000 spores, though this dose varies among host species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&amp;page=2 |title=Anthrax, Then and Now |publisher=MedicineNet.com |accessdate=13 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520040609/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&amp;page=2 |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little documented evidence is available to verify the exact or average number of spores needed for infection.

Historically, inhalational anthrax was called woolsorters' disease because it was an occupational hazard for [[wool classing|people who sorted wool]]. Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in advanced nations, as almost no infected animals remain.

=== Mode of infection ===
[[File:Anthrax - inhalational.jpg|thumb|Inhalational anthrax, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] widening]]
Anthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (ingestion), lungs (inhalation), or skin (cutaneous) and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry. In general, an infected human will be quarantined. However, anthrax does not usually spread from an infected human to a noninfected human.&lt;ref name=NCZVED&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/anthrax/technical.html |title=Anthrax |date=26 August 2009 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203133/https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/anthrax/technical.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, if the disease is fatal to the person's body, its mass of anthrax bacilli becomes a potential source of infection to others and special precautions should be used to prevent further contamination. Inhalational anthrax, if left untreated until obvious symptoms occur, is usually fatal.&lt;ref name=NCZVED /&gt;

Anthrax can be contracted in laboratory accidents or by handling infected animals, their wool or their hides.&lt;ref name=CDChowinfected&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/how-people-are-infected.html |title=How People Are Infected |date=1 September 2015 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203338/https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/how-people-are-infected.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in [[biological warfare]] agents and by terrorists to intentionally infect as exemplified by the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/93170200/timeline-how-the-anthrax-terror-unfolded |title=Timeline: How the Anthrax Terror Unfolded |date=15 February 2011 |newspaper=National Public Radio |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203612/http://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/93170200/timeline-how-the-anthrax-terror-unfolded |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: the [[polyglutamic acid|poly-D-glutamic acid capsule]], which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils, and the tripartite protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]]. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three [[proteins|protein]] components: protective [[antigen]] (PA), [[edema]] factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).&lt;ref name=toxin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |title=Molecular Basis for Anthrax Intoxication |author=Mu Gao |date=27 April 2006 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226202812/http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling ([[edema]]), respectively.

To enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by ''B. anthracis'' called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt;. PA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; then oligomerizes with six other PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex.&lt;ref name="Pimental04"/&gt; Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chvyrkova |first=I |last2=Zhang |first2=XC |last3=Terzyan |first3=S |title=Lethal Factor of Anthrax Toxin Binds Monomeric Form of Protective Antigen |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=360 |issue=3 |pages=690–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17617379 |pmc=1986636 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-291X(07)01388-5 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.

Edema factor is a [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[adenylate cyclase]]. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.&lt;ref name="Pimental04"/&gt; To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1, beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1, beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Various techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;μm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=W. |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&amp;nbsp;°C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a "[[Medusa|medusa head]]" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=B. A. |title=Bailey &amp; Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology |year=2002 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the [[Alberto Ascoli|Ascoli]] test.

If a person is suspected as having died from anthrax, precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact with the potentially contaminated body and fluids exuded through natural body openings. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample should then be collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. Then, the body should be incinerated. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others. Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as [[rubber glove]]s, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations should be used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Disposable personal protective equipment and filters should be autoclaved, and/or burned and buried.  Anyone working with anthrax in a suspected or confirmed person should wear respiratory equipment capable of filtering particles of their size or smaller. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] – and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]-approved high-efficiency respirator, such as a half-face disposable respirator with a high-efficiency particulate air filter, is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731101026/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html |date=31 July 2017 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 30 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; All possibly contaminated bedding or clothing should be isolated in double plastic bags and treated as possible biohazard waste. The body of an infected person should be sealed in an airtight body bag. Dead people who are opened and not burned provide an ideal source of anthrax spores. Cremating people is the preferred way of handling body disposal. No embalming or autopsy should be attempted without a fully equipped biohazard laboratory and trained, knowledgeable personnel.

=== Antibiotics ===
Preventative antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed.&lt;ref name=Hend2014/&gt; Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001, the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.

[[File:Anthrax and Antibiotics - Anthrax is Deadly, Antibiotics Could Save Your Life.webm|thumb|Anthrax and antibiotics]]
Anthrax cannot be spread directly from person to person, but a person's clothing and body may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Effective decontamination of people can be accomplished by a thorough wash-down with [[antimicrobial]] soap and water. Waste water should be treated with bleach or another antimicrobial agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |title=How should I decontaminate during response actions? |publisher=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226204204/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective decontamination of articles can be accomplished by boiling them in water for 30 minutes or longer. Chlorine bleach is ineffective in destroying spores and vegetative cells on surfaces, though [[formaldehyde]] is effective. Burning clothing is very effective in destroying spores. After decontamination, there is no need to immunize, treat, or isolate contacts of persons ill with anthrax unless they were also exposed to the same source of infection.

=== Antibiotics ===
Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential; delay significantly lessens chances for survival.

Treatment for anthrax infection and other bacterial infections includes large doses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, such as [[fluoroquinolone]]s ([[ciprofloxacin]]), [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], [[vancomycin]], or [[penicillin]]. FDA-approved agents include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and penicillin.&lt;ref name="urlCDC Anthrax Q &amp; A: Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|title=CDC Anthrax Q &amp; A: Treatment|accessdate=4 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505191339/http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|archivedate=5 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In possible cases of pulmonary anthrax, early [[prophylaxis|antibiotic prophylaxis]] treatment is crucial to prevent possible death.

In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop new drugs against anthrax, but existing drugs are effective if treatment is started soon enough.

=== Monoclonal antibodies ===
In May 2009, [[Human Genome Sciences]] submitted a [[biologic license application]] (BLA, permission to market) for its new drug, [[raxibacumab]] (brand name ABthrax) intended for emergency treatment of inhaled anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HGSI asks for FDA approval of anthrax drug ABthrax |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=Forbes |date=21 May 2009 |url=http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2009/05/hgsi-asks-fda-approval-anthrax-drug-abthrax |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018235213/http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2009/05/hgsi-asks-fda-approval-anthrax-drug-abthrax |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax.

== Epidemiology ==
Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year.&lt;ref name=Glob2016/&gt;

=== United States ===
The last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976, when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan. To minimize the chance of spreading the disease, the deceased was transported to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in a sealed plastic body bag within a sealed metal container for autopsy.&lt;ref name="Suffin1978"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Suffin |first=S.

Gastrointestinal anthrax is exceedingly rare in the United States, with two cases on record, the first was reported in 1942, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sarah Schweitzer |date=4 January 2010 |title=Drummer's anthrax case spurs a public health hunt |newspaper=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/01/04/nh_anthrax_case_linked_to_animal_skinned_drums/ |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214142749/http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/01/04/nh_anthrax_case_linked_to_animal_skinned_drums/ |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During December 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an adult female. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] investigated the source and the possibility that it was contracted from an African drum recently used by the woman taking part in a [[drum circle]].&lt;ref name="promedmail.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:747000751311471::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,80634 |title=PROMED: Anthrax, Human – USA: (New Hampshire) 26 December 2009 |publisher=Promedmail.org |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141758/http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400%3A1001%3A747000751311471%3A%3ANO%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID%3A1000%2C80634 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman apparently inhaled anthrax [in spore form] from the hide of the drum. She became critically ill, but with gastrointestinal anthrax rather than inhaled anthrax, which made her unique in American medical history. The building where the infection took place was cleaned and reopened to the public and the woman recovered. Jodie Dionne-Odom, New Hampshire state epidemiologist, stated, "It is a mystery. We really don't know why it happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:130058575417351::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,82333 |title=PROMED: Anthrax, Human – USA: (New Hampshire) 18 April 2010 |publisher=Promedmail.org |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927142617/http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400%3A1001%3A130058575417351%3A%3ANO%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID%3A1000%2C82333 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|List of anthrax outbreaks}}

=== Etymology ===
The English name comes from ''anthrax'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθραξ}}), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrac|ἄνθραξ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anthrax}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly having [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] etymology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|title=Wool Economy in the Ancient Near East|first1=Catherine|last1=Breniquet|first2=Cécile|last2=Michel|date=31 July 2014|publisher=Oxbow Books|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827170707/https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the characteristic black skin [[lesion]]s developed by victims with a cutaneous anthrax infection. The central, black [[eschar]], surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word "anthrax" in English is in a 1398 translation of [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]]' work ''{{lang|la|De proprietatibus rerum}}'' (''On the Properties of Things'', 1240).&lt;ref name="de Trevisa 1398"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Trevisa|first1=John|title=Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum|date=1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrax has been known by a wide variety of names, indicating its symptoms, location and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. These include Siberian plague, [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland disease]], charbon, splenic fever, malignant edema, woolsorter's disease, and even ''{{lang|fr|[[Bradford|la maladie de Bradford]]}}''.&lt;ref name="Stark 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=The Making of Modern Anthrax, 1875-1920: Uniting Local, National and Global Histories of Disease|date=2013|publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===
[[Robert Koch]], a German physician and scientist, first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in [[Wolsztyn]] (now part of Poland).&lt;ref name="pages 277-310"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Madigan |editor-first=M. |editor-last2=Martinko |editor-first2=J. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=0-13-144329-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that diseases could be caused by microbes. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax, but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over [[spontaneous generation#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] versus [[cell theory]]. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.

Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to our understanding of anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, [[worsted]], [[hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries, it was viewed with fear. [[John Henry Bell]], a doctor based in [[Bradford]], first made the link between the mysterious and deadly "woolsorter's disease" and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M|first1=J|title=John Henry Bell, M.D., M.R.C.S|journal=British Medical Journal|date=22 September 1906|pages=735–6|pmc=2382239|volume=2|issue=2386|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2386.735}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, [[Friederich Wilhelm Eurich]], the [[Germans|German]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a [[Home Office]] Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Industrial Infection by Anthrax|journal=British Medical Journal|date=15 November 1913|page=1338|pmc=2346352|volume=2|issue=2759}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector [[G. Elmhirst Duckering]], led directly to the [[Anthrax Prevention Act]] (1919).

=== First vaccination ===
{{Further|Anthrax vaccines}}
[[File:Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax. Wellcome L0003758.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax]]

Anthrax posed a major economic challenge in [[France]] and elsewhere during the nineteenth century. Horses, cattle and sheep were particularly vulnerable, and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a [[vaccine]]. The noted French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] was charged with the production of a vaccine, following his successful work in developing methods which helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.&lt;ref name="Jones 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Susan|title=Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1881, [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] – in collaboration with his assistants [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint]], [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]] and others – performed a public experiment at [[Pouilly-le-Fort]] to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 [[sheep]], one [[goat]], and several [[cow]]s. The animals of one group were injected with an anthrax [[vaccine]] prepared by Pasteur twice, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Decker |first=Janet |title=Deadly Diseases and Epidemics, Anthrax |publisher=Chelesa House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=0-7910-7302-5 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this apparent triumph, which was widely reported in the local, national and international press, [[Pasteur]] made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia, and his nephew, [[Adrien Loir]], travelled to [[Australia]] in 1888 to try and introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Geison 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geison|first1=Gerald|title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural [[Australia]], and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers [[John Gunn (researcher)|John Gunn]] and [[John McGarvie Smith]].&lt;ref name="Stark 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Anthrax and Australia in a Global Context: The International Exchange of Theories and Practices with Britain and France, c.1850–1920|journal=Health and History|date=2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–25 |doi=10.5401/healthhist.14.2.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anthrax vaccine adsorbed|human vaccine for anthrax]] became available in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine used for veterinary purposes. An improved cell-free vaccine became available in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/anthrax/downloads/ed-vpd2006-anthrax.ppt Anthrax and Anthrax Vaccine – Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824060412/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/anthrax/downloads/ed-vpd2006-anthrax.ppt |date=24 August 2012}}", National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 2006.

=== Engineered strains ===
{{expand list|date=April 2018}}
*The ''Sterne strain'' of anthrax, named after the [[Trieste]]-born immunologist [[Max Sterne]], is an attenuated strain used as a vaccine, which contains only the [[anthrax toxin]] virulence plasmid and not the polyglutamic acid capsule expressing plasmid.
*''[[Strain 836]]'', created by the Soviet bio-weapons program in the 1980s, was later hailed by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as "the most virulent and vicious strain of anthrax known to man".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Willman|Willman, David]] (2007), [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/01/nation/na-alibek1 "Selling the Threat of Bioterrorism"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Annie Jacobsen|Jacobsen, Annie]] (2015), ''The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top Secret Military Research Agency''; New York: [[Little, Brown and Company]], pg 293.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The virulent ''[[Ames strain]]'', which was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States has received the most news coverage of any anthrax outbreak. The Ames strain contains two virulence [[plasmids]], which separately encode for a three-protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]], and a polyglutamic acid [[bacterial capsule|capsule]].
*Nonetheless, the ''[[Vollum strain]]'', developed but never used as a [[biological weapon]] during the [[Second World War]], is much more dangerous. The Vollum (also incorrectly referred to as Vellum) strain was isolated in 1935 from a cow in [[Oxfordshire]]. This same strain was used during the [[Gruinard Island|Gruinard]] bioweapons trials. A variation of Vollum, known as "Vollum 1B", was used during the 1960s in the US and UK bioweapon programs.

To speed the process, trace amounts of a nontoxic [[catalyst]] composed of iron and tetroamido macrocyclic [[ligand]]s are combined with [[sodium carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] and converted into a spray.

Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated areas on ranches and in the wild is much more problematic. Carcasses may be burned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/01/us/anthrax-expert-faces-fine-for-burning-infected-carcasses.html |title=Anthrax Expert Faces Fine for Burning Infected Carcasses |author=William J.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill  spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.

The experimental site at [[Gruinard Island]] is said to have been decontaminated with a mixture of formaldehyde and seawater by the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |title=Britain's 'Anthrax Island' |date=25 July 2001 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226205629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether similar treatments had been applied to US test sites.

=== Biological warfare ===
[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Powell]] giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]], holding a model vial of anthrax]]
Anthrax spores have been used as a [[biological warfare]] weapon. Its first modern incidence occurred when Nordic rebels, supplied by the German General Staff, used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Bisher, Jamie, "During World War I, Terrorists Schemed to Use Anthrax in the Cause of Finnish Independence", ''Military History'', August 2003, pp. 17–22. [http://www.geocities.com/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm Anthrax Sabotage in Finland]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5knILODnE?url=http://www.geocities.com/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm Archived] 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax was first tested as a biological warfare agent by [[Unit 731]] of the Japanese Kwantung Army in [[Manchuria]] during the 1930s; some of this testing involved intentional infection of prisoners of war, thousands of whom died. Anthrax, designated at the time as Agent N, was also investigated by the Allies in the 1940s.

A long history of practical [[bioweapons]] research exists in this area. For example, in 1942, British bioweapons trials severely contaminated [[Gruinard Island]] in Scotland with anthrax spores of the [[vollum strain|Vollum-14578 strain]], making it a no-go area until it was decontaminated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=Clouds of Secrecy: The Army's Germ Warfare Tests Over Populated Areas|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=0-8226-3001-X|url=http://leonardcole.com/otherworks.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122010352/http://www.leonardcole.com/otherworks.htm|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam's germ war plot is traced back to one Oxford cow |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |first=David |last=Robertson |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225102048/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |archivedate=25 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gruinard trials involved testing the effectiveness of a [[submunition]] of an "N-bomb"{{snd}} a biological weapon containing dried anthrax spores. Additionally, five million "cattle cakes" (animal feed pellets impregnated with anthrax spores) were prepared and stored at [[Porton Down]] for "[[Operation Vegetarian]]"{{snd}} antilivestock attacks against Germany to be made by the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UK planned to wipe out Germany with anthrax|work=Sunday Herald|location=Glasgow|date=14 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for anthrax-based biological weapons to be dropped on Germany in 1944. However, the edible cattle cakes and the bomb were not used; the cattle cakes were incinerated in late 1945.

Weaponized anthrax was part of the US stockpile prior to 1972, when the United States signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Eric |last1=Croddy |first2=James J. |last2=Wirtz |title=Weapons of mass destruction: an encyclopedia of worldwide policy, technology, and history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-490-5 |page=21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222225432/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA21 |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] ordered the dismantling of US biowarfare programs in 1969 and the destruction of all existing stockpiles of bioweapons. In 1978–79, the [[Rhodesia]]n government used anthrax against cattle and humans during its campaign against rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Traditional Medical Practitioners Seek International Recognition |date=16 November 2001 |author=David Martin |work=Southern African News Features |url=http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sanf/2001/iss21/specialreport.html |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511004056/http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sanf/2001/iss21/specialreport.html |archivedate=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union created and stored 100 to 200 tons of anthrax spores at [[Kantubek]] on [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]]. They were abandoned in 1992 and destroyed in 2002.

==== Sverdlovsk incident (2 April 1979) ====
{{Main|Sverdlovsk anthrax leak}}
Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production, the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of weapons-grade anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979, some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called [[Ekaterinburg, Russia]]), about {{convert|850|mi|km}} east of Moscow, were exposed to an [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|accidental release of anthrax]] from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died. One victim died four days after the release, 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths, and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup, vaccinations, and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims.&lt;ref name=Guillemin_1999_275&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillemin |first=Jeanne |title=ANTHRAX, the investigation of a Deadly Outbreak |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-520-22917-7|pp=275–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the [[KGB]] continued from 1979 until Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted this anthrax accident in 1992.

Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected, and most died. Since most were men, some [[NATO]] governments suspected the Soviet Union had developed a sex-specific weapon.&lt;ref name="Alibek"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alibek |first=K. |title=Biohazard |location=New York |publisher=Delta Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=0-385-33496-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government blamed the outbreak on the consumption of anthrax-tainted meat, and ordered the confiscation of all uninspected meat that entered the city. They also ordered all [[stray dog]]s to be shot and people not have contact with sick animals. Also, a voluntary evacuation and anthrax vaccination program was established for people from 18–55.&lt;ref name="Meselson"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Meselson |first1=M. |year=1994 |title=The Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak of 1979 |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5188 |pages=1202–1208 |doi=10.1126/science.7973702 |pmid=7973702 |first2=J. |last2=Guillemin |last3=Hugh-Jones |first3=M. |last4=Langmuir |first4=A. |last5=Popova |first5=I. |last6=Shelokov |first6=A. |last7=Yampolskaya |first7=O. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support the [[cover-up]] story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB.&lt;ref name="Meselson" /&gt; In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused, it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites. In 1986, the US government was allowed to investigate the incident, and concluded the exposure was from aerosol anthrax from a military weapons facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sternbach |first=G. |year=2002 |title=The History of Anthrax |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=463–467 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(03)00079-9 |pmid=12745053}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, President Yeltsin admitted he was "absolutely certain" that "rumors" about the Soviet Union violating the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty were true. The Soviet Union, like the US and UK, had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs, but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.&lt;ref name="Alibek" /&gt;

The '''Beagle conflict''' was a border dispute between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] over the possession of [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands and the scope of the maritime jurisdiction associated with those islands that brought the countries to the brink of war in 1978.

The islands are strategically located off the south edge of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and at the east end of the [[Beagle Channel]]. The Beagle Channel, the [[Straits of Magellan]] and the [[Drake Passage]] are the only three waterways between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean in the [[southern hemisphere]].

After refusing to abide by a binding international award giving the islands to Chile, the Argentine junta advanced the nation to war in 1978 in order to produce a boundary consistent with Argentine claims.&lt;ref name="rice.edu"&gt;{{Citation

:''Chile no ignora que la historia suele pegar brincos insólitos. Argentina – por caso – podía salir airosa del conflicto. Ya por una negociación exitosa para sus intereses, ya por derrotar a los británicos. Si esto sucedía, ¿qué le impediría a Leopoldo Galtieri y compañía apoderarse de las islas del Beagle? ¿O qué los condicionaría a tomar iniciativas de esa naturaleza sobre espacios que, en aquel entonces, eran materia de disputa entre Argentina y Chile?''
:(Translation:''"Chile knows that the history can do a sudden turn. Argentina – hypothetically – could win the war. Throughout a military victory or throughout negotiations. In this case, who would prevent Galtieri &amp; Co. to take over the islands on the Beagle? what would impede them to take such initiatives over disputed regions?"'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict began in 1904 with the first official Argentine claims over the islands that had always been under Chilean control.&lt;ref name="RADOTCOA"&gt;[http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and Decision of the Court of Arbitration], retrieved on 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§164}} The conflict passed through several phases: since 1881 they were claimed Chilean islands, beginning in 1904 they were disputed islands, followed later by direct negotiations, submission to a binding international tribunal, further direct negotiations, brinkmanship and settlement.

The conflict was resolved through papal mediation and since 1984 Argentina recognizes the islands as Chilean territory. The 1984 treaty also resolves several collateral issues of great importance, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the Fuegian Archipelago, delimitation of the Straits of Magellan, and maritime boundaries south to Cape Horn and beyond.

== Background ==
{{See also|Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|Beagle Channel cartography since 1881}}

For a long time after its first [[exploration]] by Europeans, the region of [[Patagonia]] and the Tierra del Fuego archipelago remained free from colonial settlements because of its inhospitable climate, harsh conditions and sparse local vegetation. After the disaster of [[Puerto del Hambre]] (1584) during the regency of [[Philip II of Spain]] no other attempts of settlements were made in the zone.

In 1843 the Chilean government sent an expedition with the appointed task of establishing a permanent settlement on the shores of the Strait of Magellan. The founding act of the settlement of [[Fuerte Bulnes]] took place on 21 September 1843. A few years later (1848) the settlement moved to [[Punta Arenas]].

Argentine [[Ushuaia]] was founded by English born [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]] in 1869.

In 1881, Chile and Argentina attempted to definitively resolve their territorial disputes through a comprehensive agreement known as the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]. This agreement provided that the border between the two countries would follow:
* (Article I, from north to parallel 52°S) the highest peaks and [[Drainage divide]],
* (Article II, from 52°S to the Straits of Magellan) mainly the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] 52°S and
* (Article III, south of Straits of Magellan) mainly the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] 68°34 W and the Beagle channel.

[[File:Resume.arg.cart.en.png|thumb|right|200px|Different Argentine Interpretations of the Boundary treaty of 1881. The red line of "La Ilustración Argentina", chronological the first one and the Chilean one, is currently valid. See maps in [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881]]]]

Until 1887 there was no doubt in Argentina and Chile that the islands Picton, Nueva and Lennox belonged to Chile:
{{quote|There can be no doubt that in the immediate post-Treaty period, that is to say from 1881 to at least 1887/88, Argentine cartography in general showed the PNL [Picton, Nueva and Lennox] group as Chilean;&lt;ref name="RADOTCOA"/&gt;{{rp|§148}}}}

In 1904 the Argentine government solicited Chile to define jointly which was the deepest arm of the Beagle channel in the zone in order to find the demarcation of the border. On the basis of the international cartography of the zone, the descriptions of the discoverer of the channel, and the discourse of the signatories of the 1881 Treaty, Chile initially did not attach importance to the note.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Gutiérrez Olivos, ''"Comentarios sobre el tratado de paz y amistad con Argentina"'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief of the Argentine exploring commission of the southern territories, [[Francisco Moreno|Francisco P. Moreno]] in a memorandum to the British Ambassador in [[Buenos Aires]], 1918, saw the Argentine claim as baseless:
{{quote|No atino a explicarme por qué el Gobierno argentino pretende hoy soberanía sobre las islas Picton, Nueva, Lennox, etc., fundándose en los tratados vigentes, es decir, en el de 1881 y en el protocolo de 1893, cuando el primero de ellos lo invalida para tal pretensión y el segundo nada tiene que ver con la demarcación en el canal de Beagle. Insisto: la mención en el Tratado de 1881, con excepción de la isla de los Estados, le hará perder un pleito tan malamente planteado … También repetiré que la excepción que hace el Tratado de 1881 con la isla de los Estados, que reconoce como argentina, no permite poner en duda la propiedad chilena de las tierras situadas tanto al sur de la isla de la Tierra del Fuego como al sur del canal de Beagle.&lt;ref&gt;Fabio Vio Valdivieso,''La mediación de su S.S. el Papa Juan Pablo II'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|(Transl.: ''I can't understand why the Argentine Government claims sovereignty over the islands Picton, Nueva, Lennox, etc., basing its arguments on the 1881 Treaty and the 1893 Protocol, when the first one invalidates its claim and the second one has nothing to do with the demarcation of the Beagle channel. I insist: the phrasing in the 1881 Treaty, ["]except the Isla de los Estados["], will put paid to any such badly planned lawsuit… I repeat that the exception the 1881 Treaty makes for the Isla de los Estados, that stated as Argentine, does not permit any doubt over the Chilean property of territories located south of the Tierra del Fuego and south of the Beagle channel'')}}

The unresolved conflict continued to simmer. During the [[Snipe incident]], Argentine forces destroyed a Chilean lighthouse on the Snipe islet at the entry of the Beagle Channel installed on 1 May 1958, put up their own and landed marines on the islet, provoking a dangerous buildup. Later both countries agreed to pull back military forces and dismantle the lighthouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Interests of the parties ==

Over the years, the growing importance of the Antarctic and issues of [[navigation route]]s between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, the possibility of [[oil field]]s in the zone, and [[Fishing industry|fishing rights]] led both countries to harden their positions, and the conflict was extended to other issues regarding the zone.

[[File:Ostmund.two.en.png|thumb|200px|right|Two visions of the maritime boundaries at the eastern entrance to the Strait of Magellan]]

There was a controversy about the east end of the Straits of Magellan. Both countries agreed about the boundary line, but not about the end of the Straits. The Chilean view was that the Straits ended at the boundary line and eastward continued the Atlantic Ocean and therefore Chile had a "beach" at (and its projection over) the Atlantic Ocean and it enjoyed sole control of the Straits themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael A. |last=Morrs |title=The Strait of Magallan |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=Dordrecht |year=1989 |isbn=0-7923-0181-1 |page=84 |quote=[in September 1980] Chile objected to an off-shore oil rig authorized by Argentina in an area near the strait, since it allegedlly obstructed navigation and encroached on Chilean souvereignty. Chile first coveyed a warning via warship and then by military helicopter that landed in the heliport of the platform. A somewhat similar incident occurred when Argentine militar aircraft warned and then buzzed a Chilean warship proceeding toward the Strait of Magellan from the Falklands islands, because of the lack of prior notification and refusal of the vessel to identify itself once discovered. Chile, for its part, maintained that no advance notification was required, since his warship was navigating within Chile's {{convert|200|nmi|km}} zone fronting the strait }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine view was that the Straits continued eastward of the border and that the east end of the Straits of Magellan belonged to Argentina. Under this view, it was coproprietor with the right to co-regulate the navigation through the Straits and Chile had no border with the Atlantic Ocean.

[[File:Twotales.gif|left|thumb|200px|Two visions of the west mouth of the Straits of Magellan. The black line is the Chilean view, the yellow line represented the Argentine view]]

The west end of the Straits of Magellan was also a cause of conflict. Argentina considered the [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[bay]]s part of the straits and demanded free navigation through all waters as stipulated in the Boundary Treaty of 1881 for the Straits.

[[File:Antarctica research station.png|right|thumb|200px|The map shows the overlapping projection of the countries over the Antarctic]]

On 14 June 1977, the Chilean Government issued the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/CHL_1977_416.pdf decree n°416] over the [[Territorial waters#Baseline|baselines]] (See Chilean [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Baselines_chile.png Baselines] Map). The decree had two main implications for the controversy. First, it extended the range from which Chile might attempt to project its 12-[[Nautical mile|miles]] [[territorial sea]] and 200-mile [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] along a continued line from Picton, Nueva, and Lennox Islands as far south as Cape Horn, thus greatly increasing its potential maritime jurisdiction to the east and southeast. Second, it effectively converted all waters enclosed by the baselines into Chilean [[internal waters]] where navigational rights for Argentina would exist only through explicit agreements with Chile. The Argentine port of [[Ushuaia]], located on the north shore of the east Beagle Channel, had no direct free way to the Pacific Ocean through Argentine waters. Argentina has so far considered its unfettered use of the waters surrounding the Fuegian Archipelago to be a matter of critical importance for its commercial and military navigation.

The two countries have always linked their Antarctic claims to their continental possessions because the nearness and the projection of the countries over the Antarctic can substantiate a claim over territories.

== History of the conflict ==
Attempts to clear up the dispute were unsuccessful from 1904 until 1971.

=== Incidents ===
{{see also|Snipe incident|List of incidents during the Beagle conflict}}

The increasing significance of the region led to various incidents and confrontations between Chile and Argentina around transit and fishing rights, which potentially could lead to full-scale war.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Struthers, [http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2011/September/11Sep_Upp.pdf ''The Beagle Channel Dispute Between Argentina and Chile: An historical Analysis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425065410/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2011/September/11Sep_Upp.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence, May 1985, pp. 63 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Snipe incident]] was the most serious incident occurred in the zone.

=== Beagle Channel Arbitration 1971–1977 ===
{{Main article|Beagle Channel Arbitration}}

In 1971 Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding arbitration under auspices of the UK's [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The court that was to decide the controversy was composed of five judges selected by Chile and Argentina from the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The court of arbitration's final decision would be submitted to the British Crown, which was then to recommend acceptance or rejection of the award of the court but not to modify it. On 2 May 1977 the court ruled that the islands and all adjacent formations belonged to Chile. See the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration]. In their only meeting in 1974 [[Juan Perón]] expressed his wishes to settle the conflict to [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref name=Ortega2014&gt;{{cite journal|first=José|last=Ortega|url=http://www.encrucijadaamericana.cl/articulos/a6_n2/4_peron_y_chile.pdf|title=Perón y Chile|journal=Encucijada Americana|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 1978 Argentina rejected the ruling, and attempted via military force to challenge the Chilean commitment to defend the territory, and to coerce Chile into negotiating a division of the islands that would produce a boundary consistent with Argentine claims.&lt;ref name="rice.edu"/&gt;

=== Direct negotiations 1977–1978 ===
{{Main article|Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–78}}

Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina began after the announcement of the binding arbitration ruling, on 2 May 1977, and ended with the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo], [[Uruguay]], on 9 January 1979, where both countries accepted papal mediation after Argentina aborted [[Operation Soberanía]].

In the interim, both countries deployed military forces, moving to the brink of open warfare in tandem with a frenzy of diplomatic activity. This was the most dangerous phase of the Beagle conflict; open warfare seemed a real possibility&lt;ref name="ALC"&gt;Alejandro Luis Corbacho: [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 ''Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts''], Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, retrieved 23 September 2008: ''«…There was a real possibility of open warfare…»''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Operation Soberanía 1978 ===
{{Main article|Operation Soberanía}}
On 22 December 1978 Argentina initiated Operation Soberanía, an attempt via military force to occupy the islands around Cape Horn, intending to judge from Chile's response whether to advance further. However, the operation was aborted within a few hours. Instead of renewing the operation at the next window of opportunity, the junta in Buenos Aires decided to allow the Pope to mediate the dispute through the offices of Cardinal [[Antonio Samoré]], his special envoy.

=== Papal mediation 1979–1984 ===

{{Main article|Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict}}

On 9 January 1979, the Act of Montevideo was signed pledging both sides to a peaceful solution and a return to the military situation of early 1977.

The Pope proposed in 1980 a solution that was accepted by Chile and rejected by Argentina.

The detention of alleged spies on both sides of the border, the following border closure by Argentina on 28 April 1981, and the Argentine repudiation of the ''General Treaty on the Judicial Settlement of Disputes'' in January 1982 maintained the danger of war. Six weeks before the Falklands War, Argentina provoked the ARA ''Gurruchaga'' incident with Chile at [[Cape Horn|Deceit Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper "Convicción", Buenos Aires, 24 February 1982, pp. 12–13.

The voting was close only in the territory of [[Tierra del Fuego]], which included the Argentine sector of the disputed Beagle Channel and many military personnel. Even there the vote was narrowly in favour of the treaty. On 29 November 1984 Argentina and Chile signed a protocol of agreement to a treaty at [[Vatican City]] giving the islands to Chile but maritime rights to Argentina.

=== Books ===
Several books have been written about the conflict, the Operation Soberanía and the comparison of the outcome of the Falklands and the Beagle conflict (see [[Beagle conflict#Literature|Literature]]).

Given that the military critical phase of both conflicts occurred within almost 3 years (December 1978 – April 1982), the conflicts have been analysed as a case for the [[prospect theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G.

=== Geography ===
The mountain pass of Puyehue was renamed [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] for [[Antonio Samoré]], one of the mediators from the Vatican state in the conflict.

[[Leon Gieco]] created the song "Sólo le pido a Dios"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|04XLZAKqxJQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("I only Ask of God") in 1978 as a response to the warmongering in Argentina. Three years later, during the [[Falklands War]], the Argentine junta used the song against the Falklands War after the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2005 the Chilean movie ''[[Mi Mejor Enemigo]]'' ({{lang-en|My Best Enemy}}) was released. The film recreates the story of a simple recruit in late 1978 when both countries were on the brink of war.

Three TV productions about the conflict (in Spanish) focus on Operation Soberanía:
* Chilean Telecast of [[TVN (Chile)|Televisión Nacional de Chile]] "Informe Especial", Theme: «El año que vivimos en peligro» ("The year when we lived in danger")
* Chilean Telecast of [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Corporación de Televisión de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]] "annonimos", Theme: «Beagle: La guerra que no fue» ("Beagle: The war that wasn't")
* Argentine Telecast of [[History (Argentine TV channel)|History Channel]]: «Operativo Soberanía»

The arms race at both sides of the border after the Argentine refusal of the decision of the Court of Arbitration caused huge costs for the economy of the countries, until after the Falklands War:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caei.com.ar/ebooks/ebook5.pdf Distribución de capacidades en el Cono Sur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://www.caei.com.ar/ebooks/ebook5.pdf |date=29 May 2008 }}, Sabrina Melidoni, Buenos Aires, 2006 (p. 45), retrieved on 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

{{See also|Argentina-Chile relations}}

The Beagle conflict was argued in legal and juridical terms, although it was eventually resolved as a political compromise.

During the 1990s, under the presidency of [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina and [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] in Chile, they resolved almost all of their disputes and both countries began to work together both economically and militarily.

A number of prominent public officials in Chile still point to past Argentine treaty repudiations when referring to relations between the two neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Notes of the Chilean Foreign Minister [[Jose Miguel Insulza]], in [http://www.quepas.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,3255_5664_9525990,00.html La Tercera]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} de Santiago de Chile vom 13.

==Background==

=== William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn===
Ayers was part of the five-member central committee heading the Weathermen starting at its creation in the summer of 1969.&lt;ref name="plm102581"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, Dohrn had joined them. [[Larry Grathwohl]], an FBI informant who was with the Weatherman from autumn 1969 through spring 1970, considered Ayers and Dohrn the two top leaders of the organization.&lt;ref name=lgbda12&gt;Grathwohl, Larry and Frank, Reagan, ''Bringing Down America: An FBI Informant in with the Weathermen,'' Arlington House, 1977, page 110: "Ayers, along with Dohrn, probably had the most authority within the Weathermen."&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1970, the group had begun a series of bombings, primarily of government buildings,&lt;ref name="DBOA"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=1-904859-41-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would continue into 1975. The group intentionally chose its targets to avoid human injury,&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground"&gt;''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'', produced by Carrie Lozano, directed by Bill Siegel and Sam Green, New Video Group, 2003, DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; however, a bomb previously being designed in March, 1970, for use at an NCO dance at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]]  had claimed the lives of three members of the Weathermen who died during an [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion|accidental explosion]] while assembling it.&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground"/&gt; After the accidental explosion, the remaining members moved and took false identities.

During their time "underground", Ayers and Dohrn formed a relationship that bore them two sons, born in 1977 and 1980. In a late-1970s split of the group, the couple joined the faction that favored surrendering to authorities. In 1980, they took this step themselves. They were both spared federal prosecution due to government misconduct while investigating the two. Dohrn received three years' [[probation]] and was fined $1,500 for the Illinois state charges, but later served seven months in jail for refusal to testify to a [[grand jury]] about their former colleagues in the Weathermen.&lt;ref name=NoRegrets&gt;{{cite news

Ayers and Dohrn are described as fixtures of their [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] neighborhood, "embraced, by and large, in the liberal circles dominating politics" there, according to Ben Smith, a writer for ''[[The Politico]]'',&lt;ref name="bsp222"/&gt; and their political and activist colleagues believe their achievements of the recent decades overshadow their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]-era radical activities.&lt;ref name="pswp418"/&gt; Ayers has been described as "very respected and prominent in Chicago [with] a national reputation as an educator."&lt;ref name="bddm418"/&gt;

In conjunction with the approaching September 10, 2001, publication of a personal memoir, Ayers gave an interview to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in July, which they published on September 11.&lt;ref name=NoRegrets/&gt; Ayers then wrote a letter to the editor stating the interview misquoted him and mischaracterized his views, particularly about their reporter's claim that Ayers wished he had set more bombs. "This is not a question of being misunderstood or 'taken out of context,' but of deliberate distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ayers [http://billayers.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/clarifying-the-facts-a-letter-to-the-new-york-times-9-15-2001 Clarifying the facts—a letter to the ''New York Times,'' 9-15-2001] ''Bill Ayers blog'', April 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the Obama campaign's attorney Robert Bauer wrote TV stations running the American Issues Project ad, saying, "Your station is committed to operating in the public interest, an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity," and wrote Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[John C.

In 2008 and 2009 some conservative commentators advanced claims that Obama's [[autobiography]], ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' was written or [[ghost-writer|ghost-written]] by Ayers.  In a series of articles in [[American Thinker]] and [[WorldNetDaily]], author [[Jack Cashill]] claimed that his own analysis of the book showed Ayers' writing style.  In late October, [[United States Congress|US Congressman]] [[Chris Cannon]] and his brother-in-law attempted to hire an [[Oxford University]] professor, [[Peter Millican]], to prove Ayers' authorship using computer analysis.

===Ayers response===
Ayers himself kept a low profile during the controversy.  After the election, he wrote an [[op-ed]] piece in which he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the mainstream news media and the blogosphere caught in the pre-election excitement, I saw no viable path to a rational discussion. Rather than step clumsily into the sound-bite culture, I turned away whenever the microphones were thrust into my face. I sat it out.&lt;ref name="real"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His post-election piece argued that the attacks on Obama had been a "profoundly dishonest drama," including a false depiction of Ayers as a terrorist ("I never killed or injured anyone") and an exaggeration of his connection to Obama ("We didn't pal around, and I had nothing to do with his positions").&lt;ref name="real"/&gt;

In a 2013 interview with the [[Daily Beast]], Ayers said the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;David Axelrod said we were friendly, that was true; we served on a couple of boards together, that was true; he held a fundraiser in our living room, that was true; Michelle [Obama] and Bernardine were at the law firm together, that was true. Hyde Park in Chicago is a tiny neighborhood, so when he said I was "a guy around the neighborhood," that was true. Today, I wish I knew him better and he was listening to me. Obama’s not a radical. I wish he were, but he’s not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/03/exclusive-bill-ayers-on-the-weathermen-obama-s-crap-job-more.html|title=Exclusive: Bill Ayers On the Weathermen, Obama’s Crap Job &amp; More}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Bloody Poetry''''' is a 1984 play by [[Howard Brenton]] centring on the lives of [[Percy Shelley]] and his circle.

The play had its roots in Brenton's involvement with the small touring company [[Foco Novo]] and was the third, and final, show he wrote for them. The initial idea was that Brenton should write a piece based on the life of Shelley, though Brenton was more interested in looking, not at the individual, but at the quartet of Percy, [[Mary Shelley]], [[Lord Byron]] and Byron's mistress [[Claire Clairmont]], tying it in with [[Utopian]] themes appropriate to the revolutionary spirit of the protagonists.  In his introduction to the play Brenton disclaims any interest in moralising over the actions of his characters, as he had in a [[programme (booklet)|programme]] to his earlier play ''[[Weapons of Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Plays: 2'' by Howard Brenton, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], p. xiv 1996 reprint {{ISBN|978-0-413-61490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/1647/productions/weapons-of-happiness.html "National Theatre"] Retrieved on 11 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The play takes as its epigraph a comment of [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]]'s, “Shelley's life seems more a haunting than a history.”

==Stage history==

''Bloody Poetry'' was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre Leicester on 1 October 1984 in a production that later played at the [[Hampstead Theatre]].  The director was [[Roland Rees]] and the cast was:

[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] – [[Valentine Pelka]]&lt;br&gt;[[Mary Shelley]] – [[Fiona Shaw]]&lt;br&gt;[[Claire Clairmont]] – [[Jane Gurnett]]&lt;br&gt;[[George Byron]] – [[James Aubrey (actor)|James Aubrey]]&lt;br&gt;[[John William Polidori|Dr William Polidori]] – [[William Gaminara]]&lt;br&gt;[[Percy Bysshe Shelley#Marriage|Harriet Westbrook]] – [[Sue Burton]]

The play played at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] in 1987 in a production directed by [[Lynne Meadow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9B0DE6DD1731F934A35752C0A961948260 Review] Retrieved on 11 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in 1988 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and in 2007 at the [[Chapter Arts Centre]], [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/bloodypoetryMovBeing-rev.htm Review] Retrieved on 11 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was staged by emerging company Invulnerable Nothings at [[The Brooklyn Art Library]] in 2016.

'''Breakin’ Convention''' is an international [[hip-hop theater|hip-hop theatre]] festival based in [[London]], [[England]] that was founded in 2004 and is produced annually by [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]]. It has been under the artistic direction of playwright and dancer [[Jonzi D]] since its inception. Since May 2008 Breakin’ Convention has expanded its activity beyond the three-day festival to include tours across the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developing new theatre work with local hip-hop artists, and to produce year-round professional development courses for UK-based hip-hop choreographers, artists, and dance/theatre companies.

==Festival origin==
Early in 2003 Jonzi D and recently appointed chief executive of Sadler's Wells, [[Alistair Spalding]], proposed the idea of a hip hop festival that took over the entire venue celebrating [[hip hop culture]] with an emphasis on dance. Appointing Jonzi D as an associate at the theatre and founding Still Brock Productions (later: Jonzi D Productions) to focus on education and professional development of [[hip hop dance]] in the UK, the festival brought over early pioneers of the culture including The Electric Boogaloos, Tommy The Clown and Vagabond Crew, and introducing future award-winning companies such as ZooNation and Boy Blue Entertainment.

Breakin' Convention is supported by [[Arts Council England]].

BuyTigers.com was designed by Aldo Tripiciano, an Italian webmaster and [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) professional.  On March 5, 2006, the first version of the BuyTigers.com site was published by Tripiciano on a private web server. Promoted by Tripiciano, the site grew in popularity and attracted controversy from concerned animal rights activists.

From 2003 to 2014, Manny Kyriakidis of The Pushworth Group,&lt;ref name="The Courier Mail"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/seafood-fest-goes-upmarket/story-e6freq7f-1225705318570 |title=Caxton Street seafood and wine festival goes upmarket |date=1 May 2009 |work=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane, Australia |publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]] |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced the event's music programs and 2009-2014, Nichola Burton of Australian Festival Management&lt;ref name="The Courier Mail 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quest-news.whereilive.com.au/lifestyle/story/get-hooked-on-festival-fever/ |title=Get hooked on festival fever - Westside News - Lifestyle - Quest News |work=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane, Australia |publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]] |date=28 Apr 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231003946/http://quest-news.whereilive.com.au/lifestyle/story/get-hooked-on-festival-fever/ |archivedate=31 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has managed the annual festival and Sam Kyriakidis of Pressing Issues has been the Publicist.&lt;ref name="Brisbane Media Map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanemediamap.com.au/public/sub_category/37/client/1101 |title=Caxton Street Seafood and Wine Festival |first=Nur Azerinna |last=Zulkifli |work=Brisbane Media Map |publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]] |location=Brisbane, Australia |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821202015/http://www.brisbanemediamap.com.au/public/sub_category/37/client/1101 |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to illness, the Pushworth team took a break for 2015 and 2016.

In 2011, inspired by the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods]], Queensland Artist, Donna Hawkins, produced a vibrant artwork representation of [[Caxton Street, Brisbane]] specifically for the festival.&lt;ref name="The Courier Mail 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westside-news.whereilive.com.au/lifestyle/story/caxton-st-spirit/ |title=Caxton St spirit - Events - Lifestyle - Westside News |work=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane, Australia |publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]] |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809062625/http://westside-news.whereilive.com.au/lifestyle/story/caxton-st-spirit/ |archivedate=9 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisbane’s iconic Caxton Street was left high and dry during Queensland’s devastating floods that have again affected many parts of this great State. Having raised substantial funds for the Premiers Disaster Relief Appeal in 2011, Caxton Street donated part proceeds from all tickets sold to the Queensland Floods Appeal 2013. While Queenslanders have endured the worst, this natural disaster provides people the opportunity to show their best, and the Caxton Street Seafood &amp; Wine Festival hopes to support those in the face of yet another challenge.

The Caxton Street Seafood &amp; Wine Festival continues its long standing relationship with the Wesley Hospital’s Prostate Cancer Care program each year as charity partner.

The '''Chicago Architecture Biennial''' is an international exhibition of [[architectural]] ideas, projects and displays. It seeks "to provide[] a platform for groundbreaking architectural projects and spatial experiments that demonstrate how creativity and innovation can radically transform our lived experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org/about/|title=About|work=chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Julie V.|last1=Iovine|title=Chicago Architecture Biennial Review|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/chicago-architecture-biennial-review-1445291634|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date =October 19, 2015|issn=0099-9660|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2014, the biennial is managed by a charitable corporation under the auspices of the city's Cultural Affairs department, and sponsored by public and private organizations and individuals.

'''Chung Ling Soo''' was the stage name of the [[United States|American]] [[stage magician|magician]] '''William Ellsworth Robinson''' (April 2, 1861 – March 24, 1918), who is mostly remembered today for his death after a [[bullet catch]] trick went wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Randi|1992|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Robinson was born in [[Westchester County, New York]], the first of three children born to James Campbell and Sarah Robinson (''née'' Titus). Both of his parents were of Scottish descent. The family settled in [[Manhattan]] while James Robinson toured in [[Charles "Charlie" White]]'s [[minstrel show]]s. James Robinson variously performed under the names "James Campbell", "H.J. Campbell" and "Professor Campbell", and his specialties included impersonations, "dialect singing", hypnotism, ventriloquism and magic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=26, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later taught his son how to perform magic tricks.

==Career==
Robinson performed his first magic show at the age of 14 and began performing professionally on the [[vaudeville]] circuit shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="cullen224"&gt;{{harv|Cullen, Hackman, McNeilly|2006|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially performed under the name "Robinson, the Man of Mystery".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Randi|1992|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson earned a decent living performing his act but was eager to become a headliner on vaudeville. In 1887, he began performing "[[Glossary of magic (illusion)#B|black art illusions]]" under the name "Achmed Ben Ali". The act and Robinson's new stage closely resembled that of German magician [[Max Auzinger]], who performed under the name "Ben Ali Bey". (As Auzinger never toured the United States, the resemblance went largely unnoticed at the time).&lt;ref name="cullen224"/&gt;

By 1896, Robinson had performed his acts in shows for [[Harry Kellar]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]]. After Herrmann's death in 1896, Robinson decided to strike out on his own. Around this time, Robinson learned of a challenge issued by Chinese stage magician [[Ching Ling Foo]]. In a gimmick that was standard for magicians of that era, Foo offered a prize of $1,000 to any person who could successfully duplicate his illusions. Robinson, who had watched Foo's act when he toured the United States and figured out how his illusions worked, accepted the challenge. However, Foo refused to meet with him as Robinson had accepted a previous challenge issued by Foo and lost. The snub left Robinson upset.&lt;ref name="cullen224"/&gt; In 1898, he authored the book ''Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena''. The book exposed the tricks of slate writing and a number of devices that fraudulent [[Mediumship|mediums]] would use to pretend to contact the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kalush, Sloman|2006|pp=203–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Robinson learned that an agent was looking for a Chinese magician to perform at the [[Folies Bergère]] in [[Paris]]. He accepted the job and quickly created a new act based on Ching Ling Foo's act. Robinson then began dressing in traditional Chinese attire, shaved his facial hair and began wearing his hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]].&lt;ref name="cullen225"&gt;{{harv|Cullen, Hackman, McNeilly|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; To darken his complexion, he painted his face with [[Foundation (cosmetics)|greasepaint]]. To complete his new act, Robinson chose the stage name "Hop Sing Soo". Robinson's new act was a hit, and by the time he began performing in [[London]], he had perfected his act and changed his name to "Chung Ling Soo" (a variation of Ching Ling Foo's name).&lt;ref name="cullen225"/&gt; Robinson then set about creating a fanciful back story for himself. As "Chung Ling Soo", Robinson claimed he was the American-born son of a Scottish missionary who married a [[Cantonese]] woman. He claimed his father was a descendant of the [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]] and Robinson Clans and both his parents died before he was 13 years old. As an orphan, Soo said he was taken in by a Chinese magician named "Arr Hee", who trained him to perform ancient Chinese magic tricks mixed with more modern European magic. When Hee died, Soo began performing the magic his mentor had taught him.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/mystery-of-the-magician-who-spent-his-life-dodging-bullets-1-719550|title=Mystery of the magician who spent his life dodging bullets|date=July 11, 2005|publisher=scotsman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson maintained his role as a Chinese man scrupulously. He never spoke onstage, claiming that he spoke no English (though he did occasionally say phrases in [[broken English]]) and always used an interpreter when he spoke to journalists.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Christopher|1962|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soo's Chinese wife, "Suee Seen", acted as his assistant. "Suee Seen" was also Robinson's invention; in reality, she was Olive "Dot" Path, an American woman who Robinson claimed was his wife. In fact, the two never married, as Robinson had never divorced his first wife, Bessie Smith.&lt;ref name="steinmeyer425"&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chung Ling Soo, Robinson quickly became a popular stage magician in Europe and eventually became one of the highest-paid performers on the [[vaudeville]] circuit.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;

===Feud with Ching Ling Foo===
[[File:William Ellsworth Robinson.jpg|left|250px|thumb|''The Cosmopolitan,'' pub. 1903.]]

In January 1905, Soo was in [[London]] for an engagement at the [[Hippodrome, London|Hippodrome]]. His rival, magician Ching Ling Foo, was performing at the nearby [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]]. By this time, Foo was aware that Chung Ling Soo was actually William Robinson and that he had copied virtually his entire act. He publicly called Chung Ling Soo an imposter and became  intent on publicly exposing him as such. In order to garner publicity, Foo's promoter publicly announced that he would duplicate at least half of Chung Ling Soo's illusions to prove that he was the real "Original Chinese Conjurer".&lt;ref name="cullen225"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Randi|1992|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soo accepted the challenge and agreed to meet Foo at the offices of ''[[Sunday Dispatch|The Weekly Dispatch]]'' for a press conference. When Ching Ling Foo realized that the press was not interested in Chung Ling Soo's real identity, he refused to attend the press conference and backed out of the challenge. The episode was a public embarrassment for Ching Ling Foo, who played at the Empire Theatre for only four weeks (Chung Ling Soo's engagement at the Hippodrome lasted three months).&lt;ref name="cullen225"/&gt;

Soo's most famous illusion, partly because of his death while performing it, was called "Condemned to Death by the Boxers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimsteinmeyer.com/newsletter/glorious_deception/ Jim Steinmeyer - Newsletter - Spring 2005 - Excerpt from Glorious Deception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827185131/http://www.jimsteinmeyer.com/newsletter/glorious_deception/ |date=2008-08-27 }}, "Chung Ling Soo had included Condemned to Death by the Boxers in his shows" ... "The Mystic Bottle was the illusion in which little bottles became the giant bottle, The Living Target was the rope and arrow trick—they found no mention of the gun illusion." Accessed April 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In this trick, Soo's assistants, sometimes dressed as [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]], took two guns on to the stage. Several members of the audience were called up to the stage to mark a bullet that, under Soo's examination, appeared to be loaded into one of the guns. Attendants fired the gun at Soo, and he seemed to catch the bullets from the air and drop them on a plate he held up in front of him. In some variations, he pretended to be hit and then spat the bullet onto the plate. Actually, Soo palmed the bullets, hiding them in his hand during their examination and marking. The muzzle-loaded guns were rigged such that the gunpowder charge fired in a chamber below the barrel so that the bullet never left the gun.

==Personal life==
Robinson married his assistant Bessie Smith on February 23, 1883. Shortly after the couple married, in December 1883, a woman with whom Robinson had been having an affair (possibly a young servant girl who worked for Robinson's parents) gave birth to his child, a girl named Annie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's parents took the child in and raised her. Robinson and Smith would later have a son, Elmore (born February 1885).&lt;ref name="steinmeyer425"/&gt; After the birth of their son, Smith could no longer rehearse long hours and travel with Robinson as his assistant. He soon lost interest in his wife after meeting Olive "Dot" Path (born Augusta Pfaff), who would also become his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As divorce was considered socially unacceptable at the time and Robinson was a [[Roman Catholic]], he and Smith never formally divorced and simply decided to "cancel" their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson and Path presented themselves as husband and wife for the next twenty years. They eventually married in a civil ceremony in March 1906. The marriage was not legally recognized as Robinson was still married to Bessie Smith. Shortly after Robinson married Path, he met Janet Louise Mary "Lou" Blatchford, an English woman from [[Plymouth]]. They began a sexual relationship and Blatchford became pregnant in May 1907. Path was angry to learn that Robinson had been unfaithful but the two decided to continue to present themselves as husband and wife for the sake of the act. While "Chung Ling Soo" and "Suee Seen" continued to tour Europe, Blatchford lived in [[Barnes, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between engagements, Robinson would visit the home and the couple's children, of which there were eventually three: Ellsworth James (born February 1908), Hector (born December 1909) and Mary (born March 1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=319, 325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known film record of "Chung Ling Soo" that exists today shows him greeting [[World War I]] veterans at a 1915 benefit performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=fKAfAKSByVQ|title=Chung Ling Soo on film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:William Ellsworth Robinson2.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Chung Ling Soo in ''The Old and New Magic'' (1906)]]

On March 23, 1918, Chung Ling Soo was performing at the [[Wood Green]] Empire in London. He performed his act without incident until he got to his famous "Condemned to Death by the Boxers" illusion. That night, as one of his assistants fired the modified gun at him, some of the gunpowder exploded in the gun's chamber, accidentally firing the bullet, loaded for show by the assistant, into Soo's lung. Soo fell to the ground and said in perfect English, "Oh my God. Something's happened. Lower the curtain."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|The New Yorker|2008|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first and last time since adopting his persona that William "Chung Ling Soo" Robinson had spoken English in public. Soo was taken to Passmore Edwards Cottage Hospital, but died the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steinmeyer|2006|pp=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[East Sheen Cemetery]] in [[East Sheen]], a suburb of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/people_of_historial_note_buried_in_the_borough_m_to_z|title=People of historical note buried in the borough M to Z|publisher=richmond.gov.uk|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant who fired the gun, Jack Grossman, appeared on the UK TV show [[The Paul Daniels Magic Show]], broadcast on November 6, 1982, where he assisted magician [[Paul Daniels]] to successfully recreate the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2ca39163530449e1b88e9868561e10fd|title=BBC Genome - Radio Times archive 1923-2009|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[inquest]], Olive "Dot" Path explained the nature of the Chung Ling Soo's trick. The [[musket]]s Soo used in his act were [[Brazing|brazed]] with extra steel barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Christopher|1991|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each performance, to avoid expending powder and bullets, Soo never unloaded his guns properly. Rather than firing them off or drawing the bullets with a screw-rod, as was normal practice, he removed the bullet and powder by dismantling the breeches of the guns. Over time, a residue of unburned gunpowder was able to form in the channel he had made to allow the flash to bypass the barrel and ignite a blank charge in the [[ramrod|ramrod tube]]. Thus, when Soo performed the trick that night, ignition of the residue in the channel allowed the flash from the [[flash pan|pan]] to also ignite the charge behind the bullet not intended to be fired that was loaded into the barrel of the gun being used. Consequently, the bullet fired in the normal way, hitting Soo in the chest. The circumstances of the accident were verified by the gun expert Robert Churchill. Soo's death was ruled "accidental"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gresham|1953|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a final verdict of "misadventure".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Christopher, Brooks-Christopher|1973|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Chung Ling Soo's death, the public was shocked to learn that he was not Chinese. Soo's true identity was largely known among professional magicians. A year before Soo's death, English magician [[Will Goldston]] commented in an interview with ''Magician Monthly'' that the public did not question Soo's identity because "...&amp;nbsp;he has always presented to the public that which they like and not which he might prefer".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hass, Coppa, Peck|2008|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41846">The '''Cleveland sports curse''' was a [[Sports-related curses|sports superstition]] involving the city of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and its [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league professional sports teams]], centered on the failure to win a [[championship]] in any major league sport for a period of 52 years, from 1964 to 2016. Three major league teams based in Cleveland contributed to belief in the curse: the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL); the [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA); and the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Combined with the short-lived [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Barons]] franchise of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), Cleveland teams endured an unprecedented 147-season championship [[drought (sports)|drought]], having not won a title since the Browns defeated the [[Baltimore Colts]] in the [[1964 NFL Championship Game]] two seasons prior to the first [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name="MostCursedSportsCities"&gt;{{cite news|author=The Upshot Staff|title=The Most Cursed Sports Cities in America|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/04/upshot/The-Most-Cursed-Sports-Cities-in-America.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 4, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland's 52-year championship drought finally ended when the Cavaliers beat the [[Golden State Warriors]] in Game 7 of the [[2016 NBA Finals]], an event widely interpreted as having broken the curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCauley|first=Janie|title=James and Cavaliers win thrilling NBA Finals Game 7, 93-89|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20160619/CLEGSW/gameinfo.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|date=June 19, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Avianne|title=This Cavs Season Ticket Holder Waited 45 Years for a Championship|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/meet-69-year-cleveland-cavaliers-fan-bought-season/story?id=40014126|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|date=June 21, 2016|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken 4"/&gt;

Much of the discussion of the "curse" is centered on the NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], who have not won a [[History of the National Football League championship|championship]] since 1964 and have suffered a series of questionable coaching decisions, disappointing losses and draft busts.

Prior to [[Art Modell]] becoming majority owner of the team, the Browns had dominated the NFL and the earlier [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), winning seven championships in 17 years. After three non-playoff seasons, the [[1964 Cleveland Browns season|1964 Browns' team]] finished 10–3–1 and appeared in the [[1964 NFL season|1964 NFL Championship Game]] against a heavily favored [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] team coached by [[Don Shula]] with [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] as its signal caller. The Browns beat the Colts 27–0 at [[Cleveland Stadium]]. This particular Browns team consisted of many players initially drafted and acquired by [[Paul Brown]], the Browns' former long-time head coach and architect of the team's earlier successes, who had been fired by Modell early in 1963. During the next 30 years in Cleveland, not a single Modell team won the league or conference title, although they did appear in a total of seven NFL/[[American Football Conference]] (AFC) championship title games during the period.

In 1981, trailing by two points to the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and in field goal range with less than one minute remaining in the [[1980–81 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Oakland Raiders 34, San Diego Chargers 27|AFC divisional playoff game]], the Browns executed a passing play that was intercepted in the end zone. The play, called by Browns head coach [[Sam Rutigliano]], has become known as "[[Red Right 88]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tioseco|first=Raymond J.|url=http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Greatest-Moments-1980-AFC-Divisional-Playoff/d85d64d5-6ffb-4f04-9321-bf85b95dacb5|title=Greatest Moments: 1980 AFC Divisional Playoff|publisher=Oakland Raiders|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1986–87 NFL playoffs]], the Browns were one game away from playing in what would have been the franchise's first Super Bowl when they fell short in one of the most memorable games in NFL history. The Browns were leading the [[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 20–13 in the fourth quarter when Broncos quarterback [[John Elway]] led a 98-yard game-tying drive in just over 5 minutes. The game went to overtime, and the Broncos kicked a field goal to seal the victory. Elway's fourth quarter march and the game itself became known as "[[The Drive]]", a title that both signifies Elway's brilliance in the clutch and the Browns' inability to close out important games.

The Browns and Broncos both returned to the AFC Championship Game the next year. With the Browns down 38–31 late in the fourth quarter, Browns' running back [[Earnest Byner]] was handed the ball near the goal line. Byner, who was in the midst of a great performance, was stripped of the ball and the Broncos recovered on their 2-yard line. The Broncos surrendered an intentional safety and went on to win 38–33, while Byner's blunder became known as "[[The Fumble]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Bill|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/100129&amp;sportCat=nfl|title=Consider these teams officially tortured|publisher=''ESPN''|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns returned to the AFC Championship game in the 1989–90 season, again [[1989–90 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 37, Cleveland Browns 21|losing to the Broncos]]. As of the [[2017 NFL season]], the Browns have not returned to the AFC Championship Game since and remain one of four teams to never play in a Super Bowl, along with the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Houston Texans]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].

The Browns were at the center of a [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocation controversy]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Bob|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ss1kgr1u-EC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22the%20move%22%20%22the%20shot%22%20cleveland%20browns&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Top 20 Moments in Cleveland Sports History: Tremendous Tales of Heroes and Heartbreaks|publisher=Gray &amp; Company|pages=277–291|isbn=9781598510300|year=2007|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision by then-Browns owner [[Art Modell]] to move the Browns, which had been an 11–5 team the [[1994 Cleveland Browns season|previous season]], to [[Baltimore]] infuriated and confused Browns fans.&lt;ref name=brcurse&gt;{{cite web|last=Folsom|first=Jim|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/392399-the-ultimate-sports-curse-the-city-of-cleveland|title=The Ultimate Sports Curse: The City of Cleveland|publisher=''[[Bleacher Report]]''|date=May 15, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations with the NFL and the city of Cleveland, Modell was allowed to move the team's personnel to Baltimore, where it became a new franchise known as the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Ravens won a [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] in only their fifth year of existence, doing so with former Browns tight end [[Ozzie Newsome]] as their general manager. In addition to Newsome's success, coach [[Bill Belichick]], who was fired as Browns' head coach soon after the 1995 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19960215&amp;id=2xEmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yf0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6697,1482003&amp;hl=en | title=Modell fires Bill Belichick | work=[[The Gettysburg Times]] | location=[[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] | date=February 15, 1996 | accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; became head coach of the [[New England Patriots]] five years later. With the Patriots, Belichick has coached only one losing season and won eight AFC Championships and five Super Bowls. The struggles of the Browns since rejoining the NFL, as well as the success of both Newsome and Belichick, were chronicled in the NFL Films feature ''[[A Football Life]]'': 1995 Cleveland Browns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Story of 1995 Cleveland Browns Detailed on NFL Network’s ‘Cleveland ’95: A Football Life’|url=https://nfllabor.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/story-of-1995-cleveland-browns-detailed-on-nfl-networks-cleveland-95-a-football-life/|publisher=NFL Communications|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, after a three-year period of deactivation. In the [[1999 NFL Draft]], the Browns selected [[Tim Couch]], hoping he would be a franchise quarterback. [[Ty Detmer]] was brought in to usher in the planned "Couch era", but after a string of dismal performances, Couch was rushed into the starting position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wassink|first=Zac|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-browns-had-19-starting-quarterbacks-since-1999-220000982--nfl.html|title=The Cleveland Browns Have Had 19 Starting Quarterbacks Since 1999|publisher=''Yahoo! Sports''|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couch struggled to perform without a talented roster around him, which led to his eventual departure from the Browns after the 2003 season. Although only winning 22 games in 59 starts, Couch led the Browns to their only playoff berth since their return, in 2002.

By the end of the 2017 season, the Browns had started 28 different quarterbacks since their 1999 return to the NFL, a league-high in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Matt|url=http://returnofcleveland.com/2014/01/14/ranking-the-20-cleveland-browns-starting-quarterbacks-since-1999/|title=Ranking The 20 Cleveland Browns Starting Quarterbacks Since 1999|publisher=''Return of Cleveland''|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sprow | first=Chris | url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2014/story/_/id/10496424/cleveland-browns-succeed-2014-rookie-quarterback-nfl | title=Browns can win with a rookie QB | work=ESPN | date=February 23, 2014 | accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns have not won a playoff game since [[1994–95 NFL playoffs#AFC: Cleveland Browns 20, New England Patriots 13|beating the New England Patriots on January 1, 1995]], and have lost nine or more games each season since 2008.

On November 30, 2015, the Browns played the Baltimore Ravens in their first ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game in six years. After trailing 17–3 in the second quarter, the Browns rallied behind quarterbacks [[Josh McCown]] and [[Austin Davis]] to tie the game at 27 with 1:47 left.

The [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] are a professional basketball team who have played in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) since [[1970–71 Cleveland Cavaliers season|1970]].

Over the franchise's first 16 years, the team produced just three winning seasons, the highlight being the [[1975–76 Cleveland Cavaliers season|1975–76]] "Miracle at Richfield" team, whose improbable playoff run was doomed by an injury to [[Jim Chones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2012/11/cleveland_cavaliers_have_seen.html|title=Cleveland Cavaliers have seen their share of season-crippling injuries: NBA Insider|last=Schmitt Boyer|first=Mary|date=24 November 2012|publisher=The Plain Dealer|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early-mid 1980s saw the franchise ruined by owner [[Ted Stepien]]'s decision to trade away every first-round pick the Cavaliers held for inferior talent, while those picks turned into players such as [[James Worthy]] and [[Derek Harper]]. Despite this, the Cavaliers gained respectability towards the end of the decade and the early 1990s, making the playoffs with players such as [[Mark Price]], [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Hot Rod Williams]] and Craig Ehlo on their roster.

In 1989, the Cavaliers faced the [[1988–89 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the [[1989 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. In the decisive fifth game, [[Craig Ehlo]] had given the Cavs the lead with three seconds to play. However, the Bulls' [[Michael Jordan]] jumped over Ehlo to make the game-winning shot, and the Bulls won the game, 101–100, to clinch the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan Hits "The Shot"|url=http://www.nba.com/history/jordancav_moments.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hyduk | first=John | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/sports/cleveland-sports-disappointing-fans-since-1964.html?_r=0 | title=Cleveland: Disappointing Fans Since '64 | work=The New York Times | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite six trips to the playoffs between 1988 and 1994, including a [[1992 NBA Playoffs|1992 Eastern Conference Finals]] appearance, the Cavaliers never made it to the NBA Finals, as Jordan's Bulls defeated them in the playoffs five times during the [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Daugherty]]–[[Larry Nance|Nance]]–[[Mark Price|Price]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Swartz | first=Greg | title=Cleveland Cavaliers Can Learn from Franchise's Only Other Big Three | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2200748-cleveland-cavaliers-can-learn-from-franchises-only-other-big-three | work=Bleacher Report | date=September 17, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ohio native [[LeBron James]] led the Cavaliers to their first [[2007 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. However, they were swept by the [[2006–07 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].  Two years later, the Cavs, despite posting a conference-best 66–16 record, lost the [[2009 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (3) Orlando Magic|2009 Eastern Conference Finals]] to the [[2008–09 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]], 4–2.&lt;ref name=brcurse/&gt;  In the following season's playoffs, though his team always possessed home-court advantage, the reigning two-time MVP James and the [[2009–10 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2009–10 Cavaliers]] (61–21) were defeated by the visiting [[2009–10 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in Game 5 of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs#(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (4) Boston Celtics|Eastern Conference Semifinals]], 120–88.

During the 2010 NBA free agency period, James was featured in a television special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]''. Having notified the Cavaliers just moments prior to the television event, James announced "In this fall — this is very tough — in this fall I'm gonna take my talents to South Beach and join the [[Miami Heat]]."

The team struggled to win games, setting an NBA record for most consecutive losses with 26 in the [[2010&amp;ndash;11 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2010&amp;ndash;11 season]].

After the 2013–14 season, James opted out of his contract with Miami and returned to the Cavaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Broussard | first=Chris | url=http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/11127329/lebron-james-opt-contract-miami-heat | title=Agent to Heat: LeBron opting out | publisher=ESPN | date=June 25, 2014 | accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing James, the Cavaliers traded their two most recent number-one draft picks, Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett, for Minnesota Timberwolves star [[Kevin Love]] to form their own "Big 3," which was rounded out by Irving.

The next season, despite a 30–11 start, the team fired coach [[David Blatt]] and replaced him with assistant [[Tyronn Lue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMenamin|first=Dave|title=Cavs GM: 'Not fair' to say team taking directives from LeBron James|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14629410/cleveland-cavaliers-gm-david-griffin-says-lebron-james-run-organization|publisher=ESPN|date=January 23, 2016|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that Blatt had a turbulent relationship with James as well as several other players. The Cavaliers lost to the [[Chicago Bulls]] 96–83 at home in Lue's debut as Cavaliers' head coach.

The Cavs finished the season 57–25, earning the top seed in the Eastern Conference. They advanced to the NBA Finals, losing only two games on the way.

However, the Cavaliers won the next three games to win their first NBA championship in franchise history, becoming the first team in NBA Finals history to overcome a 3–1 deficit, and the first team since 1978 to win a Finals Game 7 on the road. A particularly memorable moment in Game 7 was when James successfully pursued and blocked [[Andre Iguodala]] on a fast break late in the fourth quarter, a defensive play known among Cavs fans as [[The Block (basketball)|The Block]]. Following would be a three-point shot by [[Kyrie Irving]], to put the Cavaliers ahead for good at 92–89 with 53 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Following that, Cavaliers' forward Kevin Love was switched and forced to play one-on-one defense against [[Stephen Curry]].

The [[Cleveland Indians]], like the Browns and Cavaliers, also experienced the curse. The Indians' failure to win a [[World Series]] since {{wsy|1948}} has led the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'' to dub the team's shortcomings '''The Curse of Chief Wahoo'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pattakos|first=Peter|url=http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|title=The Curse of Chief Wahoo |publisher=''The Cleveland Scene''|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062629/http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|archivedate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Wahoo]] is a Native American caricature which serves as the Indians' cap insignia.

In 2002, the Indians introduced a script "I" alternate logo and cap insignia.  In 2011, the alternate logo was changed to the block "C".

In [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|1954]], the Indians had one of the greatest seasons in baseball history, winning 111 games in what was the only time from 1949–1958 in which the [[New York Yankees]] did not win the American League pennant. Heavily favored against the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] in the World Series, the Indians seemed poised to break the game open in the top of the eighth inning, when Indians first baseman [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep fly ball to center field. However, since the game was held at the [[Polo Grounds]] (which was 483 feet from home plate to center field), the ball was not a home run, although the ball would have been a home run in any other ballpark. As such, Giants center fielder [[Willie Mays]] made an improbable, over-the-shoulder, no-look catch on the run to rob Wertz of an extra-base hit, leaving the game tied at two in what became known as [[The Catch (baseball)|The Catch]]. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Giants batter [[Dusty Rhodes (outfielder)|Dusty Rhodes]] hit a walk-off home run to give the Giants the win. The Giants went on to sweep the Indians in the World Series in what became one of the biggest upsets in World Series history. In 1969, the when Major League Baseball expanded its postseason and introduced divisional play, the Indians were placed in the [[American League East]]. Despite the introductions of divisions and expanded playoffs, the Indians found themselves unable to win the AL East division, as they finished above .500 on just four occasions during their time in the AL East from 1969–1993. The Indians did not return to the postseason until the postseason was expanded further in 1995.

The historic [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|1995]] season saw the Indians win 100 games and make it to the [[1995 World Series|World Series]] for the first time in 41 years. However, they lost in six games to the [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], led by the Braves' [[Big Three (Atlanta Braves)|Big Three]] of [[Greg Maddux]], [[John Smoltz]], and World Series MVP [[Tom Glavine]]. The Braves' victory was their only World Series win in their fifteen consecutive trips to the playoffs between 1991 and 2005. In [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|1996]], the Indians won 99 games, which was the most in the American League. However, they lost the [[1996 American League Division Series|ALDS]] in four games to the [[1996 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]]. The Indians returned to the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] in 1997 and were leading 2–1 heading into the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, only for [[José Mesa]] to blow the save to [[Craig Counsell]]'s sacrifice fly, allowing the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Marlins]] to tie the game in the ninth and win in the eleventh on a walk-off single by [[Edgar Renteria]] that deflected off the glove of Indians pitcher [[Charles Nagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miles|first=Scott|title=Open Mic: 11 Years Later, Indians' World Series Loss to Marlins Still Hurts|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/28986-open-mic-11-years-later-indians-world-series-loss-to-marlins-still-hurts|publisher=''Bleacher Report''|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blocks|first=Starting|url=http://www.cleveland.com/ohio-sports-blog/index.ssf/2011/10/cleveland_indians_world_series.html|title=Cleveland Indians World Series teams: Won it in 1920 and 1948; lost it in 1954, 1995 and 1997|publisher=''Cleveland''|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians failed to return to the World Series in [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|1998]], losing the [[1998 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in six games. In [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|1999]], the Indians went up 2–0 against the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], only to lose the next three games of the series by a combined score of 44–18.

After winning division titles six times in seven seasons from 1995 to 2001, the Indians only appeared in the postseason twice in 14 years under the often frugal Dolan family ownership ([[Larry Dolan]] bought the team in 2000). In the [[2007 American League Championship Series]], the Indians were up 3–1 and one win away from advancing to the World Series, but they lost the last three games to the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] by a combined score of 30–5, denying the team a World Series berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/sports/baseball/22alcs.html | title=Red Sox' Comeback Lands Them in World Series | last=Curry | first=Jack | date=October 22, 2007 | work=The New York Times | accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Indians won their final ten games of the season to make the playoffs again, but lost [[2013 American League Wild Card Game|the play-in Wild Card game]] at home to the [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] by a score of 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kepner | first=Tyler | title=Still Playing on Road, the Rays Send Another Team Home for Good | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/sports/baseball/rays-beat-indians-to-win-national-league-wild-card.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | date=October 2, 2013 | accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Cavaliers 2016 NBA title, the Indians continued to come up short in the playoffs.  Later that same year, The Indians advanced to the [[2016 World Series|World Series]], giving Cleveland a chance to become the first city since [[Los Angeles]] in 1988 to have both NBA and MLB championships in the same year. The Indians held a 3–1 lead against the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], but Chicago rallied to win the last three games and break [[Curse of the Billy Goat|their own curse]]; as a result, the Indians currently hold the longest active championship drought in baseball.  In 2017, the Indians returned to the playoffs as a heavy favorite to return to the World Series.  They won 102 games, highlighted by an American League record 22-game winning streak.  However, the Indians lost the [[2017 American League Division Series|Division Series]] to the [[New York Yankees]], 3–2.  The Indians returned to the postseason in [[2018 Cleveland Indians season|2018]], but were swept in the [[2018 American League Division Series|Division Series]] by the [[2018 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]].

The Indians and Cavaliers Twitter accounts congratulated him shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalland|first=Robby|title=Cleveland finally wins a title: Stipe Miocic takes UFC heavyweight title|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/news/cleveland-finally-has-a-world-champion-stipe-miocic-wins-ufc-heavyweight-title/|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They and the Browns had earlier wished him luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Damon|title=Cleveland sports teams throw support behind Stipe Miocic at UFC 198|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-stipe-miocic-cleveland-cavs-browns-indians-throw-support-ufc-198-051416|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=May 14, 2016|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tweeted encouragement to the Cavaliers, who hoped to keep the winning streak alive in the [[2016 NBA Playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Damon|title=Stipe Miocic sends message to Cleveland Cavs following championship win|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-198-stipe-miocic-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-sends-message-following-championship-win-051516|publisher=Fox Sports|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets characterized Miocic's title as having ended Cleveland's 52-year championship drought, as well as Miocic himself in the post-fight interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyte|first=E.

The '''''Creole'' case''' was the result of an American slave revolt in November 1841 on board the ''Creole'', a ship involved in the [[United States]] [[coastwise slave trade]]. As 128 slaves gained freedom after the Africans ordered the ship sailed to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], it has been termed the "most successful [[slave revolt]] in US history".&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two persons died as a result of the revolt, a black slave and a white slave trader.

The United Kingdom had abolished the slave trade for British vessels in 1807, and slavery in its colonies effective 1834; its officials in the Bahamas ruled that most of the slaves on the ''Creole'' were freed after arrival there, if they chose to stay. Officials detained the 19 men who rebelled on ship until the Admiralty Court of Nassau held a special session in April 1842 to consider charges of piracy against them. The Court ruled that the men had been illegally held in slavery and had the right to use force to gain freedom; they were not seeking private gain. The 17 survivors (two had died in the interim), were released to freedom.

When the ''Creole'' reached New Orleans in December 1841 with three women and two child slaves aboard (who had made the mistake of remaining in hiding), Southerners were outraged about the loss of property. Relations between the United States and Britain were strained for a time. The incident occurred during negotiations for the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 but was not directly addressed. The parties settled on seven crimes qualifying for extradition in the treaty; they did not include slave revolts.

Eventually claims for losses of slaves from ''Creole'' and two other US ships were covered, along with other claims dating to 1814, in a treaty of 1853 between the US and Britain, for which an arbitration commission awarded settlements in 1855 against each nation.

==The revolt==
In the fall of 1841, the [[brig]] ''Creole,'' owned by Johnson and Eperson of [[Richmond, Virginia]], was transporting 135 slaves for sale in [[New Orleans]], the South's major market. It had left Richmond with 103 slaves and picked up another 32 at [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; Most were owned by Johnson and Eperson, and 26 were owned by Thomas McCargo, a slave trader who was one of the passengers on board.&lt;ref name="jervey"/&gt; While the United States had prohibited the international slave trade effective in 1808, it permitted the domestic slave trade among those states that authorized slavery; many slave traders transported captives by the [[coastwise slave trade]] along the East Coast. The brig also carried tobacco, a crew of 10, the captain's wife, daughter and niece; four passengers, including slave traders; and eight black slave servants, for a total of 160 on board.&lt;ref name="jervey"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2717095?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56236344963 Jervey, Edward D. and Huber, C. Harold. "The ''Creole'' Affair"], ''The Journal of Negro History'', Vol. 65, No. 3 (Summer 1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;196–211, accessed 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madison Washington]], a refugee slave who had been recaptured after returning from Canada to Virginia for his wife, was among those being shipped for sale in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;R. Edward Lee, "Madison Washington, Slave Mutineer," ''Blacfax,'' Winter/Spring 1998, Vol. 8 Issue 36, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves were kept in the forward hold, and he gained the deck after one of the crew had lifted the grate.&lt;ref name="jervey"/&gt; On November 7, 1841, Washington and eighteen other male slaves rebelled; they overwhelmed the crew and killed John R. Hewell, one of the [[slave trader]]s, with a knife. The crew and passengers had only one gun among them, which they never used.&lt;ref name="jervey"/&gt;  The captain, who was wounded, and two mates had gone up into the rigging to escape the fighting. One of the slaves was badly wounded and later died. Some others of the crew were wounded but all survived.

The slaves took overseer William Merritt at his word that he would navigate for them. They first demanded that the ship be taken to [[Liberia]], which the US had established as a free colony in West Africa. Merritt said that voyage was impossible as they did not have enough food or water. Another slave leader, Ben Blacksmith, said they should be taken to the British West Indies, as he knew the slaves from the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'' had gained freedom there the previous year.&lt;ref name="jervey"/&gt;

==British actions in Nassau==
On November 9, 1841, the ''Creole'' reached [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], where it was first boarded by the [[Maritime pilot|harbor pilot]] and his crew, all local black Bahamians.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;''The Times'', January 21, 1842, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; They told the American slaves that, under Bahamian colonial law, they were free. The crew advised them to go ashore at once.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; The Quarantine Officer came aboard. As the captain Robert Ensor was badly wounded, the officer took First Mate Zephaniah Gifford to inform the American Consul of the events.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; At the Consul's request, the [[Francis Cockburn|governor]] of the Bahamas ordered a guard to board the ''Creole'' to prevent the escape of the men implicated in Hewell's death. The 24 black soldiers were led by a white officer. This action prevented the slaves from dispersing into the city.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Fearing the British would apply their ban on slavery to the American slaves, the American consul tried to organize American sailors on the island to take back control of the ship. He intended to have them sail the ship out of British jurisdiction with the slaves still aboard. An American group of sailors approached the ship on November 12, intending to sail it away, but were foiled by a Bahamian who shouted a warning to the officer of the guard aboard the ''Creole.'' He threatened to fire into the Americans in their boat, and they withdrew.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

After an investigation by magistrates, on Friday, 13 November 1841, the Bahamian Attorney-General went aboard. He told the nineteen rebels that they would be detained. He informed the remainder: "You are free, and at liberty to go onshore, and wherever you please."&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; A fleet of small boats manned by locals, who until then had surrounded the brig at a distance, immediately came forward. The Attorney-General warned the people against boarding the ''Creole,'' but said they could provide passage to those slaves who wished to go to shore. Most did so, although three women, a girl, and a boy stayed in hiding on board. They eventually sailed with the ship to New Orleans and back to slavery.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

The New Providence government arranged for a ship bound for [[Jamaica]], also under British control, to take passengers to that island for free, and announced it in the newspaper. Numerous American blacks from the ''Creole'' left for Jamaica aboard it.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

After the Bahamian government arrested the conspirators, the United States government dropped its claims for all the slaves to be returned to its custody. {{citation needed|date=August 2011}} There was no extradition treaty at the time between Britain and the United States governing such circumstances.

The British authorities determined that the slaves had not committed any breach of British or maritime law. As under British law they were free men, they were considered to have the right to use force to escape the detention of illegal slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', February 16, 1842, p. 13: Quote: "In answer to an inquiry of Lord BROUGHAM, Lord ABERDEEN stated that orders had been sent out to the Governor of the Bahamas to liberate the 19 slaves now under constraint at Nassau for the mutiny and murder on board that vessel, unless (which is not to be apprehended) there were any local laws which justified or demanded a contrary course."&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty Court in Nassau held a special session in April to consider a charge of [[piracy]] against the men implicated in the mutiny. Ruling that their action was not piracy, the Court ordered the surviving 17 mutineers to be released on April 16, 1842.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', May 18, 1842, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; As a total of 128 slaves gained their freedom, this has been described as the "most successful slave revolt in US history".&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

The ''Creole'' had departed months before for the United States, reaching its original destination of New Orleans on December 2, 1841. Five slaves were still aboard, outraging planters and politicians who learned that the remaining slaves had been freed by British authorities.

The case attracted national attention in the United States and provoked diplomatic controversy. In Boston in 1842, abolitionist [[William E. Channing]] published a pamphlet, "The Duty of the Free States or Remarks Suggested by the Case of the 'Creole'," to refute claims by Southern politicians that the human property of U.S. slave owners should be protected in foreign ports.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aaohtml/exhibit/aopart1b.html "Slaves Commandeer the Creole", Slavery: Flights to Freedom], ''African-American Odyssey'': February 5 through May 2, 1998; Library of Congress, accessed &lt;14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was also under discussion due to negotiations over the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which was ratified with the United Kingdom that year.

Less than a year later, the ''Creole'' was wrecked in a violent storm while in harbour at [[Funchal]], [[Madeira]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', November 22, 1842, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political consequences==
The ''Creole'' case generated diplomatic tension between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], and political rumblings within the United States. Southerners were outraged to have lost property in another instance of British colonists freeing slaves from American ships that had gone into their ports in the Caribbean. The [[John Tyler]] administration supported Southerners in seeking the return of the slaves.

Although known as an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Daniel Webster]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] served John Tyler; he stated the US position to the United Kingdom that the slaves were legal property of US citizens and demanded their return.

The United Kingdom had abolished slavery effective August 1834, and it rejected the U.S. claim. It had advised all nations that under its law, ships that went into its colonial ports would forfeit any slaves on board. It said that Nassau was a British territory where British law must be applied. Under it, the 'slaves' aboard the ''Creole'' were to be considered free passengers. Accordingly, unless they could be proved to have broken local or maritime law, it would be false imprisonment to detain them against their will.

The abolitionist [[Charles Sumner]] argued that the slaves "became free men when taken, by the voluntary action of their owners, beyond the jurisdiction of the slave states." In March 1842 US Representative [[Joshua Reed Giddings]] of [[Ohio]] introduced a series of nine resolutions on this topic, arguing against the federal government acting on behalf of the slaveholders. He argued that Virginia state law did not apply to slaves who were outside Virginian waters, the federal government had no part in it, and the [[coastwise slave trade]] was unconstitutional, as slaves were beyond state law on the high seas, and thus free. Southerners in the House of Representatives disagreed with his position. The members censured Giddings by a large margin for violating an informal [[gag rule]] that had been in effect since 1836, barring discussion of slavery in the House. He promptly resigned. When the Ohio legislature held a special election in May 1842 for his seat, the voters of Ohio overwhelmingly reelected Giddings,&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74305.html Andrew Glass, "Ohio Whig Joshua Giddings resigns, March 22, 1842"], Politico.com, 22 March 2012, accessed 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; by 7,469 to 383.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&amp;dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the outcome of the ''Creole'' revolt, abolitionists renewed their political attacks on slavery and the coastwise trade. In the newspaper article, "The Hero Mutineers," Madison Washington was named the '[[romantic hero]].'&lt;ref name="hero"&gt;"The Hero Mutineers," ''The New York Evangelist'', 1842&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was said to have shown sympathy toward the white crew members on the ''Creole'' by preventing his fellow slave mates from murdering all of them when they made a last effort to regain control.&lt;ref name="jervey"/&gt; He was said to have personally dressed sailors' wounds after the revolt.&lt;ref name="hero"/&gt;

The case roused strong feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, as the events occurred during the negotiations related to the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 between the two nations, primarily to settle the borders between the US and Canada, a British colony. According to the ''New York Courier and Inquirer'', Daniel Webster, as Secretary of State, wrote to [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Lord Ashburton]], then in Washington, DC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Creole case is presented in strong terms by Mr Webster in a letter (which, when published, will bring all the anti-slavery people about his ears)..."  To this Lord Ashburton replied that as the case had effectively arisen after his departure from England he was 'not empowered to treat upon the subject'. He reaffirmed the position that as slavery was no longer recognized under British law, any foreign slave arriving in British possessions was automatically considered as free — as was also the case in those American states that did not recognize slavery. He did however promise that British officials in the West Indies would be given 'directions'...'to do nothing in this respect when it can be properly avoided' in the interests of 'good neighbourhood'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 September 1842, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;The correspondence between Webster and Ashburton was published in ''The Works of Daniel Webster'' (1853), vol. VI: [https://archive.org/stream/worksdanweb06websrich#page/272/mode/2up/search/ashburton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among other declarations, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty called for a final end to the slave trade on the high seas, to be enforced by both signatories.

Seven lawsuits were lodged against insurance companies in Louisiana by slave owners who had suffered financial losses due to the revolt, as the insurance companies initially refused to compensate them.&lt;ref name="commcourt"&gt;[http://nutrias.org/~nopl/inv/creole.htm  "Louisiana. Commercial Court (Orleans Parish). Suits relating to the slave mutiny aboard the brig Creole, 1841 [Docket Nos. 4408, 4409, 4410, 4411, 4413, 4414, 4419"]], New Orleans Public Library: City Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these insurance cases were consolidated and eventually heard by the Louisiana State Supreme Court.&lt;sup&gt;Result?&lt;/sup&gt;

==Earlier cases==
The ''Comet'' in 1830 and the ''Encomium'' in 1833 were American ships in the [[coastwise slave trade]] that were forced by weather into British Caribbean ports while carrying numerous slaves bound for the domestic market in New Orleans. The British treated the slaves on board as aliens, and freed both groups. Britain eventually paid compensation for these seizures, as it had not yet abolished slavery in its territories.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jwQ4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=ships+Comet+and+Encomium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Syf0iHEFjY&amp;sig=GWIXztuBAA3xY2EfBrBuMPbX8Ac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8khjUfeKCMuMyAHytoHQCA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ships%20Comet%20and%20Encomium&amp;f=false Lord McNair, "5: Slavery and the Slave Trade", ''International Law Opinions''], Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

When Parliament abolished slavery in its territories in 1833, Britain advised other countries that slave ships that put into its ports would forfeit the slaves without compensation. After British abolition of slavery in its colonies, effective in 1834, its officials freed slaves from the ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprise]]'' (1835), and the ''Hermosa'' (1840), without compensation.&lt;ref name="hermosa"/&gt;

In 1840, the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'', a US schooner in the coastwise slave trade carrying 38 slaves from Richmond to New Orleans for sale, went aground on one of the Abacos islands in the Bahamas. After wreckers took the ship to port, the captain refused to let the slaves off and with the US [[consul (representative)|consul]], tried to arrange for another ship to take and deliver his slave cargo to the United States. British magistrates backed with armed force went onto the ''Hermosa'', taking the slaves off and freeing them when they reached the port. The Americans protested.&lt;ref name="hermosa"/&gt;  The ''Enterprise'' and ''Hermosa'' cases were submitted for arbitration under an 1853 claims treaty and, together with claims for the ''Creole'' and a variety of other unrelated claims dating to 1814, Britain paid a settlement in 1855 to the United States for these three cases. A total of nearly 450 American slaves achieved freedom due to British colonies' actions in these five cases.

==Compensation==
After years of discussion, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a February 1853 Treaty of Claims which articles included the claims of slave-owners who had suffered financially&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GrERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg ''Niles Weekly Register''], 10 June 1837, p. 226: Note: Slave trader Oliver Simpson, of the District of Columbia, brought suit against the Charleston Fire and Marine Insurance company in the Court of Common Pleas for the Charleston District, South Carolina, for the loss of 28 slaves valued at $20,000 due to their emancipation from the ''Enterprise'' in Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; through the British emancipation of slaves in the ''Enterprise'' (1835), ''Hermosa'' (1840) and ''Creole'' incidents.&lt;ref name="hermosa"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=%22comet%22+slave+ship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5MQ7o4YOA1&amp;sig=Le8D6jhftpteXZ8GrcyBK94raRo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VQhgUarCGNGb0AXAvYG4Bg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22comet%22%20slave%20ship&amp;f=false "Hermosa Case (1840)"], ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A-K, Vol. II, L-Z, ed.

==Related incidents==
British officials may have been warned off liberating slaves from US ships, but citizens sometimes acted independently. In 1855 the ''New York Times'' reported that an American slave had been removed by Jamaicans from the brig ''Young America'' at [[Savanna-la-Mar]] and "set at large". Although the action was taken by private individuals and not officials, the paper noted the potential for future conflict between the nations, and called for a lasting solution to be found by "the two governments interested".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 20 July 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In 1852 the noted abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]] published a novella called ''[[The Heroic Slave]]'', inspired by the ''Creole'' revolt featuring Washington. He stressed the personal aspects of the slaves' rebellion, placing it firmly within American revolutionary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, Maggie.

==Giddings Resolutions==
Joshua Giddings introduced these resolutions in Congress in 1842 and was censured for opening debate on slavery in defiance of a ruling against it. He resigned and returned to his home state of Ohio, where he was quickly re-elected by his constituents in a special election. He soon returned to Congress.

# Resolved, That, prior to the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, each of the several States composing this Union exercised full and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of slavery within its own territory, and possessed full power to continue or abolish it at pleasure. 
# Resolved, That, by adopting the Constitution, no part of the aforesaid powers were delegated to the Federal Government, but were reserved by and still pertain to each of the several States. 
# Resolved, That, by the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitution, each of the several States surrendered to the Federal Government all jurisdiction over the subjects of commerce and navigation upon the high seas. 
# Resolved. That slavery, being an abridgment of the natural rights of man, can exist only by force of positive ''municipal law,'' and is necessarily confined to the territorial jurisdiction of the power creating it. 
# Resolved, That when a ship belonging to the citizens of any State of the Union leaves the waters and territory of such State, and enters upon the high seas, the persons on board cease to be subject to the slave laws of such State, and therefore are governed in their relations to each other by, and are amenable to, the laws of the United States. 
# Resolved, That when the brig ''Creole'', on her late passage for New Orleans, left the territorial jurisdiction of Virginia, the slave laws of that State ceased to have jurisdiction over the persons on board such brig, and such persons became amenable only to the laws of the United States. 
# Resolved, That the persons on board the said ship, in resuming their natural rights of personal liberty, violated no law of the United States, incurred no legal responsibility, and are justly liable to no punishment. 
# Resolved, That all attempts to regain possession of or to re-enslave said persons are unauthorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and are incompatible with our national honor. 
# Resolved, That all attempts to exert our national influence in favor of the ''[[coastwise slave trade]]'', or to place this nation in the attitude of maintaining a "commerce in human beings", are subversive to the rights and injurious to the feelings of the free States, are unauthorized by the Constitution, and prejudicial to our national character.

The '''Drop Dead Festival''' is the largest [[DIY]] festival for "art-damaged" music.&lt;!-- What does that mean?? --&gt; It has as many as 65 bands per event, and has been known to attract attendees from over 30 countries. Drop Dead is an [[electro music|electro]], [[post-punk]], [[electropunk]], and [[experimental music|experimental]] multiple-day festival, previously held in [[New York, NY]] and [[Europe]] with additional smaller events having formerly been held in [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], and [[New Jersey]]. The festival is also notable for its elaborate stage designs, bazaar of vendors of scene paraphernalia, movie screenings, and a dancefloor featuring underground DJs from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dropdeadfestival.com Drop Dead Festival]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202072052/http://www.dropdeadfestival.com/ |date=February 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: USA 2003-2005==
[[File:Dropdeadcrowd.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Crowd]]
The first Drop Dead Festival was held in August 2003, after the success of a series of smaller events put on by NY Decay Productions at the Pyramid in [[New York City]]. The festival was originally held at the famous [[CBGB]] [[punk rock]] club, but subsequent Drop Dead Festivals moved to the much larger [[Knitting Factory]], also in lower [[Manhattan]]. Although the main event moved to larger locations, CBGB traditionally held pre-parties and after-parties for the festival until the club closed. In 2005, the Drop Dead Festival grew to four days, during [[Halloween]] week. Over 5,000 people attended this event, featuring headliner [[Nina Hagen]].

In 2006 the Drop Dead Festival was held at the Knitting Factory on [[Labor Day]] weekend, September 1–3. This was the last regular Drop Dead Festival in the US.

== 2007-2012 ==

Since 2007, Drop Dead has been held in Europe as a traveling festival, including Prague (2007), Portugal (2008), Lithuania (2010), and Berlin (2011, 2012).

"'''Ebeneezer Goode'''" is a [[song]] by British electronic music group [[The Shamen]], which, after being heavily remixed by [[The Beatmasters]], became their biggest hit when released as a single in August 1992. The band's original version also featured on the vinyl edition of their album ''[[Boss Drum]]''. "Ebeneezer Goode" was one of the most controversial [[List of number-one singles from the 1990s (UK)|UK number-one hits]] of the 1990s, due to its perceived oblique endorsement of [[recreational drug use]]. The song was initially banned by the [[BBC]]. It has been claimed that the single was eventually withdrawn after the band were hounded by the [[British tabloid press]],&lt;ref name="Top 5 Drug Songs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/features/top5/drug_songs.shtml |title=Top of the Pops 2 - Top 5 Drug Songs |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though according to The Shamen themselves, it was deleted while at Number 1 due to its long chart run 'messing up our release schedule'.&lt;ref name="grauniad"&gt;{{cite web|author=Interviews by Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/05/ebeneezer-goode-shamen |title=How we made ... Ebeneezer Goode by the Shamen |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyrics ==
The song is best known for its chorus, "'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode / He's Ebeneezer Goode", the first part of which is audibly identical to, "Es are good" – 'E' being common slang for the drug [[MDMA|ecstasy]].&lt;ref name="Top 5 Drug Songs"/&gt; However, 'E' is also sung many other times during the song, ostensibly as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;e'' (i.e. ''he''), such as in "E's sublime, E makes you feel fine".&lt;ref name="grauniad" /&gt; The lyrics allude to the advantages of the drug, though with an admonition against excessive use:
{{cquote|A gentleman of leisure, he's there for your pleasure&lt;br&gt;But go easy on old 'Eezer, he's a love you could lose&lt;br&gt;Extraordinary fella, like [[Punch and Judy|Mister Punchinella]]&lt;br&gt;He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused.}}

The song also contains references to [[Roll-your-own cigarette|hand-rolled cigarettes]] with the lines "Has anybody got any Veras?" ("[[Vera Lynn]]s" being [[rhyming slang]] for "skins" or [[rolling paper]]s) and "Got any salmon?" ("salmon and trout" being rhyming slang for "snout" or [[tobacco]]).
 
The "A great philosopher once wrote.." sample at the start of the song is [[Malcolm McDowell]] from Lindsay Anderson's 1973 film ''[[O Lucky Man!]]''

==Music video==
The video consisted of club scenes intermixed with a caped man (ostensibly Ebeneezer Goode himself, played by [[Jerry Sadowitz]]) running round a wasteland. Due to the use of flashing images in the video, some music channels include epilepsy warnings over the video. Some channels, including [[VH1 (UK and Ireland)|VH1]], edit the video to reduce the frame rate of these scenes which deletes each bright frame.

The music video was played in episode 5 and 6, season 3 of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', "Kidnapped".

==Performance on ''Top of the Pops''==
When the Shamen appeared on BBC One's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', it was expected that [[Mr C]] should tone down the song due to its being broadcast. The group replaced the final lyric "Got any salmon?" with "Has anyone got any [[underlay]]?" He was later asked about this in a radio interview, to which he replied that it was not a drug reference but a ''rug'' reference.&lt;ref name="grauniad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bussmann, Jane: ''Once In A Lifetime: The Crazy Days of Acid House'' ({{ISBN|0-7535-0260-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chart performance==
The song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number six in September 1992, before climbing to number one two weeks later (during the BBC's drug awareness week), staying there for four weeks.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Mulard duck being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for foie gras production.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gavage]] feeding]]
[[File:Action anti-foie gras au Meurice, Paris (19).jpg|250px|thumbnail|Anti-foie gras protestors at the [[Hôtel Meurice]], [[Paris]]]]
The production of [[foie gras]] (the [[liver]] of a [[duck]] or a [[Toulouse Geese|goose]] that has been specially fattened) involves the controversial force-feeding of birds with more food than they would eat in the wild, and more than they would voluntarily eat domestically. The feed, usually corn boiled with fat (to facilitate ingestion), deposits large amounts of [[fat]] in the liver, thereby producing the fatty consistency sought by some [[gastronome]]s.

==Animal rights and welfare groups==
Animal rights and welfare activist groups such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/farm/camp/ffa/foie_gras.html Foie Gras&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622145557/http://www.hsus.org/farm/camp/ffa/foie_gras.html |date=2007-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]]&lt;ref name="org2.democracyinaction"&gt;[http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5154/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8072 Speak Out Against Foie Gras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114132849/http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5154/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8072 |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; contend that foie gras production methods, and force feeding in particular, consist of cruel and inhumane treatment of animals. Specific complaints include livers swollen to many times their normal size, impaired liver function, expansion of the abdomen making it difficult for birds to walk, death if the force feeding is continued, and scarring of the [[esophagus]].

In modern gavage-based foie gras production, force feeding takes place 12–18 days before slaughter.

In 2001, the Director of the New York State Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy Dept. for the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], which is one of America's leading environmental activist groups, wrote a letter to then NYS Attorney General, [[Eliot Spitzer]], asking that the state's foie gras producers be prosecuted for violating [[animal cruelty]] statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Wolf |first= Stacy |title= Letter to New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer |date= 2001-08-30 |publisher= [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)]] |url= http://www.banfoiegras.com/aspca.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061104160943/http://www.banfoiegras.com/aspca.pdf |archive-date= 2006-11-04 |deadurl= yes |accessdate= 2016-08-02 |quote= The ASPCA respectfully urges the Attorney General's office to invoke our cruelty law to stop this practice within our borders. |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/governor-spitzer-is-seeking-to-block-ban-on-foie/46918/ |title=Governor Spitzer Is Seeking To Block Ban on Foie Gras | work=The New York Sun |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnwatch.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?flavor=archive;list=dw2003300newyork;id=20070118105857 |title=DawnWatch.com |publisher=DawnWatch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Foie_gras_controversy |title=Study Guides, Reference Materials for Science, Literature, History &amp; more |publisher=eNotes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2003, the French group Stopgavage ("Citizens' Initiative for the banning of force-feeding") published the Proclamation for the Abolition of Force Feeding, which asks [[Justice (official)|justice]]s to find foie gras production practices a violation of existing animal welfare laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopgavage.com/en/manifesto.php Stopgavage manifesto page]; [http://www.quid.fr/zoom/index.php/2006/12/11/63-gastronomie-le-foie-gras-un-produit-francais foie gras page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207140249/http://www.quid.fr/zoom/index.php/2006/12/11/63-gastronomie-le-foie-gras-un-produit-francais |date=2007-02-07 }} on the site of [http://www.quid.fr/ ''Le Quid''].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231234004/http://stopgavage.com/en/manifesto.php |date=December 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this manifesto Stopgavage claims the support of over eighty French animal rights and welfare associations, over a hundred such associations from 25 other countries, and over 20 thousand individual signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopgavage.com/en/signatures.php List of signatories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509174202/http://www.stopgavage.com/en/signatures.php |date=2007-05-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopgavage, through its president Antoine Comiti, has criticized the [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]] (a French public research institute) for allowing its researchers to receive grants from the foie gras industry for conducting research aimed at contradicting the EU report conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Comiti, ''L'INRA au secours du foie gras – Enquête sur une expertise publique sous contrôle de l'industrie'', éd. Sentience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Dantzer, a retired INRA researcher, calls the INRA studies "pseudoscience" and "convenience research".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3228,36-850337@51-850420,0.html "L'INRA accusé de connivence avec la filière du foie gras"], ''Le Monde'' 29 Dec. 2006: "''‘Il s'agit de pseudo-science et de recherches d'opportunité, conduites par des chercheurs élevés dans le moule de la production animale’, tranche Robert Dantzer, tout juste retraité de l'INRA, où il était précisément spécialiste de ces hormones de stress.''".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the organisations [[Animal Protection and Rescue League|APRL]], [[In Defense of Animals|IDA]] and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] released a video narrated by Sir [[Roger Moore]] showing footage the groups took inside the three U.S. foie gras farms and several in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banfoiegras.org/page.php?module=news_media&amp;article_id=23|title=Stop Force Feeding – Ban Foie Gras&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA wants this practice, which they say is cruel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/fauxfoiegraschallenge/|title=Faux Foie Gras Challenge Winning Recipe - PETA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=97 PETA Media Center – Factsheets – The Pain Behind Foie Gras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429005401/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=97 |date=2009-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stopped. Various American celebrities have lent their voices to this public campaign. Most recently in April 2009 PETA released a letter written by television and stage actor [[Bea Arthur]] to TV chef [[Curtis Stone]] deploring the practice of foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25390632-5006002,00.html Bea Arthur writes to Curtis Stone over use of foie gras] April 27, 2009 ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Compassion in World Farming]] partners with other organizations such as the German ''Albert-Schweitzer Foundation''&lt;ref&gt;Albert-Schweitzer Foundation,[https://albert-schweitzer-stiftung.de/helfen/petitionen/stoppt-das-stopfen Gänsestopfleber]&lt;/ref&gt; and the French organization ''L214''&lt;ref&gt;L214, [http://www.l214.com/gavage-des-canards-la-commission-europeenne-ferme-les-yeux Gavage des canards : la Commission européenne ferme les yeux]&lt;/ref&gt; to pressure the EU Commission and EU Agriculture Council to take action against the production of foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;Compassion in World Farming, [http://action.ciwf.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=119&amp;ea.campaign.id=27641&amp;ea.tracking.id=05bb9ddb Foi gras]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Welfare==
The report of the [[European Union]]'s Scientific [https://web.archive.org/web/20070507175956/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out17_en.pdf Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese], adopted on December 16, 1998, is an 89-page review of studies from several producing countries. It examines several indicators of animal welfare, including physiological indicators, liver pathology, and mortality rate. It strongly concludes that "force feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds."

Members of the committee describe how geese and ducks show "avoidance behaviour indicating aversion for the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure".  Although the committee reported that there is no "conclusive" scientific evidence on the aversive nature of force feeding, and that evidence of injury is "small", in their overall recommendations, the committee stated that "the management and housing of the birds used for producing foie gras have a negative impact on their welfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out17_en.pdf |title= Report of the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070507175956/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out17_en.pdf |archivedate= 2007-05-07 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;KB)}} p.38: ''Whilst studies of the anatomy of ducks and geese kept for foie gras production have been carried out, the amount of evidence in the scientific literature concerning the effects of force feeding and liver hypertrophy on injury level, on the functioning of the various biological systems is small.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out17_en.pdf |title= EU Report |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070507175956/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out17_en.pdf |archivedate= 2007-05-07 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;KB)}} p.62-63: ''Members of the Committee observed that, prior to force feeding the ducks and geese show avoidance behaviour indicating aversion for the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure. After a short period, birds which are able to do so move away from the person who force fed them. However there is no conclusive scientific evidence as to the aversive nature of the force feeding process.''&lt;/ref&gt;

On physiology, the report finds that based on studies available, "no definite conclusions can be drawn concerning the physiological activity of birds in response to force feeding" because although "force feeding induced [[Fatty liver|hepatic steatosis]] in the duck or goose", "hepatic steatosis in the waterfowl is a normal metabolic response" and there was a low incidence of disease indicating lesions. If gavage is stopped the "return to normal took approximately four weeks". As an economic indicator the report states "it is strongly in the interest of the farmer" to avoid disease as the "resulting fat liver is of no commercial value". It summarizes that "some pathologists consider this level of steatosis to be pathological but others do not" and recommends that research "should be carried out into methods of producing fat liver which do not require the use of force feeding".

The EU report notes that continued force feeding leads to early death of the animal, and the birds are typically slaughtered just at the point that mortality would drastically increase from the force feeding. In the studies it examined, "the mortality rate in force fed birds varies from 2% to 4% in the two week force feeding period compared with around 0.2% in comparable ducks".

On the force feeding process, the EU committee examined several experiments carried out by INRA ([[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique]]) to detect pain or distress by looking at blood hormones, and found that no definite conclusions can be drawn from these studies. Other studies looked at behavioral aversion to the feeding process and found that force fed ducks avoided the feeding pen when given a choice, whereas a majority of the control group not being force fed would enter the feeding pen voluntarily. Daily hand-feeding of ducks and geese is normally associated with a positive response by the animals towards the person feeding them. In contrast, the working group observed that ducks and geese in a pen kept away from their force feeder when he entered the room. In an unpublished pilot experiment by INRA, ducks in cages reportedly displayed less avoidance behaviour to the force feeder’s visit than to the visit of a neutral person coming along the cages later. However, in the working group's own observations, "Ducks in cages had little opportunity to show avoidance but sometimes moved their heads away from the person who was about to force feed them."

The report also recommends collection of additional data regarding the health of the animals, feeding methods, animal housing, and socio-economic factors.

==American Veterinary Medical Association==
In 2004 and 2005, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] House of Delegates, the US accrediting body of veterinary medicine, was forwarded resolutions from its Animal Welfare Committee to oppose the production methods for foie gras. After hearing testimony from 13 delegates, the HOD declined to take a position and left a simple statement: "Limited peer-reviewed, scientific information is available dealing with the animal welfare concerns associated with foie gras production, but the observations and practical experience shared by HOD members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved."

The HOD sent delegates to visit foie gras farms. One delegate, Robert P Gordon of New Jersey, indicated his personal position changed drastically after the visit. He also testified tube feeding is less distressing than taking the [[Temperature examination|rectal temperature]] of a cat and urged the AVMA to take a position based on science, not emotion, while cautioning against [[anthropomorphism]].  The New York delegation offered their opinion that opponents of foie gras were intending to create a [[wedge issue]]; that the arguments used against foie gras would be modified to be used against other livestock production.  The testimony of the delegate from the Association of Avian Veterinarians was that medicating and feeding sick birds via tube was a normal practice that birds accepted without stress.  Another delegate who toured the farms stated that the birds appeared to be well cared for and better off than other poultry raised in [[factory farming]].  The overall position of the House of Delegates was that "observations and practical experience shared by HOD members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/sep05/050901q.asp Farm visits influence foie gras vote – September 1, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407013221/http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/sep05/050901q.asp |date=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The closing comments in the HOD were that the AVMA should be taking positions on facts and science, make broad policy positions on general animal welfare, and support positions that created oversight of controversial practices for fear that [[prohibition]] would cause production to move to countries without animal welfare regulation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Critics of the AVMA have stated that the organization tends to defend the economic interests of agribusiness over animal welfare, and that it has also declined to take a position against other controversial practices such as [[forced molting]] and [[gestation crates]].&lt;ref&gt;Chorush, B.

==Third-party opinions on U.S.-produced foie gras==
In June 2005, ''New York Times'' editor [[Lawrence Downes]] was invited to a visit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/10/05/ruhlman_bourdain_foie/index1.html I want my foie gras! | Salon Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020042407/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/10/05/ruhlman_bourdain_foie/index1.html |date=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same farm, including specifically the gavage process,&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/opinion/26sun2.html?ex=1277438400&amp;en=e817693c8425ccf4&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | author = Downes, Lawrence | date = 2005-06-26 | title = Editorial Observer; Face to Face With the Foie Gras Problem | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he "saw no pain or panic...The birds submitted matter-of-factly to a 15-inch tube inserted down the throat for about three seconds, delivering about a cup of corn pellets. The practice...seemed neither particularly gentle nor particularly rough."&lt;ref name=Downes/&gt;

Dr. Ward Stone, wildlife pathologist with the [[NYSDEC]] and Adjunct Professor at [[State University of New York|SUNY]] has on several occasions conducted [[post-mortem]]s on ducks that died from force feeding, including from the same farm a few months after Mr. Downes' visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banfoiegras.com/drstone.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081407/http://www.banfoiegras.com/drstone.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2005, he writes: "the short tortured lives of ducks raised for foie gras is well outside the norm of farm practice.  Having seen the pathology that occurs from foie gras production, I strongly recommend that this practice be outlawed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banfoiegras.com/Ward_stone.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081414/http://www.banfoiegras.com/Ward_stone.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the delegates from New Jersey and Vermont of the American Veterinary Medical Association gave testimony to the organization after touring tube-feeding farms.  Dr. Robert Gordon had visited a farm in New York on July 5. He noted, "After being on the premises, my position changed dramatically. I did not see animals I would consider distressed, and I didn't see pain and suffering." As written at AVMA news, Dr. Thomas Munschauer visited a New York farm at the request of "both sides." "I didn't see exploding esophaguses ... and it didn't seem like the birds were distressed. For the most part, they appear to be well-cared-for. That's what I saw."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/050901q.aspx &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of [[Better Business Bureau]] recommended that New Jersey-based foie gras producer D'Artagnan cease advertising claims that their product is made from "enlarged" rather than "diseased" livers, and that the animals were "hand-raised with tender care".  D'Artagnan voluntarily modified their advertising to remove the claims which the agency said had not been "adequately substantiated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/2009/01/foie-gras.html|title=The Food Section - Food News, Recipes, and More|website=www.thefoodsection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foie gras producers and industry groups==
Most foie gras producers do not consider their methods cruel, insisting that it is a natural process exploiting the animals' natural features. Producers argue that wild ducks and geese naturally ingest large amounts of whole food and gain weight before migration. They claim that geese and ducks do not have a gag reflex in their throats the same way that humans do, and therefore do not appear to find force feeding uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW).|title=Welfare aspects of the production of foie gras in ducks and geese (December 16, 1998, p. 35).|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Ginor, owner of Hudson Valley Foie Gras, author of ''Foie Gras... A Passion,'' claims his birds come to him to be fed and says this is important because "a stressed or hurt bird won't eat and digest well or produce a foie gras."

Mirepoix USA, a top provider of goose and duck foie gras, alleges that the animal rights activists attack is a form of prohibition against a cuisine item.  Mirepoix claims that the use of the term "diseased" to refer to fatted liver is inaccurate and that geese and ducks naturally store dead fish in their esophagi for long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoyfoiegras.com/info/facts_history_animalrights.html|title=Enjoy Foie Gras – Buy White Truffle Pate de Foie Gras Caviar Truffles|website=www.enjoyfoiegras.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ducks used in foie gras production, however, are a hybrid of [[American Pekin Duck|Pekin]] (a type of [[Mallard]]) and [[Muscovy]] ducks, both of which are [[dabbling ducks]] and as such, subsist mainly on a diet of underwater vegetation, larvae, and various insects.

==Chefs==
Chef [[Anthony Bourdain]] and chef/writer [[Michael Ruhlman]] have both supported foie gras production from humanely treated, properly raised ducks, and stated that the footage seen in the videos of critics is cruel but that no reputable chef would buy such product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Thomas |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/10/05/ruhlman_bourdain_foie/ |title=I want my foie gras! – Chicago |publisher=Salon.com |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However other celebrity chefs such as [[Wolfgang Puck]],  and [[Albert Roux]]  are against the use of foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/dining/22puck.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Celebrity Chef Announces Strict Animal-Welfare Policy | first=Kim | last=Severson | date=March 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roux has argued that foie gras should come with a warning so that "people know what's being done to the animals." He states that "More humane methods should be used that allow the animal to gorge themselves naturally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster |first=Kate |url=http://living.scotsman.com/health/Top-French--chef-calls.4791570.jp |title=Top French chef seeks end to 'cruel' foie gras – Scotsman.com Living |publisher=Living.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago chef [[Charlie Trotter]] maintained that the production of foie gras is "too cruel to be served."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0504070058apr07,0,3549007.story |title=Trotter won't turn down heat in foie gras flap |publisher=chicagotribune.com |date=2005-04-07 |accessdate=2010-05-14 | first=Mark | last=Caro}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trotter refused to be associated with animal rights groups stating "These people are idiots.

==Litigation==
The controversy over foie gras has been the subject of several lawsuits.  The 1985 case Lovenheim v. Iroquois Brands was a shareholder suit regarding ethical concerns about a company selling foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;Lovenheim v. Iroquois Brands, Ltd., 618 F. Supp. 554 (D.D.C. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Animal Protection and Rescue League]] and In Defense of Animals filed suit against Sonoma Foie Gras in California under the state's unfair business practices law, alleging animal cruelty.  The farm also sued the two groups and four activists who documented conditions at the farm for trespass.&lt;ref&gt;Foie Gras Farmer Sued by Animal Rights Groups, San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 23, 2003 [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/10/23/BAG9T2H4LV14.DTL]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Legislature then intervened with a law allowing the farm to continue force feeding until the year 2012, after which point both the sale and production of foie gras has been illegal in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aprl.org/latimes7-7-04.php|title=Duck Farm is on Capitol Agenda, Los Angeles Times, July 7, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Sonoma Foie Gras sued [[Whole Foods Market]] for intentional interference with contract for influencing Grimaud Farms to stop supplying ducklings and marketing for Sonoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C15F63A5B0C708CDDAC0894DE404482|title=Organizing for an Indelicate Fight, New York Times, May 3, 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit is still pending as of February 2007.

Also pending is a 2006 lawsuit filed by the Humane Society of the United States against the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets, alleging that foie gras qualifies as an adulterated food that should not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/hsus_suit_foie_gras_new_york.html HSUS Sues to Block Foie Gras Production in New York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105195532/http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/hsus_suit_foie_gras_new_york.html |date=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] filed a legal petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), urging that foie gras bear a consumer warning label stating "NOTICE: Foie gras products are derived from diseased birds." ALDF argues that because the USDA is responsible for ensuring that poultry products are wholesome and for approving only products from healthy animals, stamping foie gras products with the USDA seal without disclosing that those products are derived from diseased birds misleads consumers, contravening the Poultry Products Inspection Act.&lt;ref name="org2.democracyinaction" /&gt;  Regularly eating foie gras can harm   the health of predisposed people.  Patients with [[Alzheimer's]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[type 2 diabetes]] and other [[amyloid]]-related diseases should not eat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/foie-gras-low-carb-fatty-liver-poses-deadly-health-risks-duck-dish-banned-parts-us-247047|title=Foie Gras: Low-Carb Fatty Liver Poses Deadly Health Risks; Duck Dish Banned In Parts Of The US|date=21 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] sued Hudson Valley Foie Gras over its advertising as "the humane choice" for foie gras. Hudson Valley settled the case and dropped this advertising campaign after a federal judge in California indicated that he would allow the parties to present evidence and decide whether Hudson Valley could prove that its "humane" claims were truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/In+FDCO+20130415575/ANIMAL+LEGAL+DEFENSE+FUND+v.+HVFG+LLC#|title=ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND - 939 F.Supp.2d 992 (2013) - 20130415575 - Leagle.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] filed an appeal in a lawsuit against the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets for allowing the ongoing sale of foie gras. The original lawsuit, which was dismissed in February for lack of standing, alleges that the Department violates its own Agriculture and Markets Law by allowing the sale of foie gras. New York's state law requires the Department to declare "the product of a diseased animal" an adulterated product. In the appeal, the Animal Legal Defense Fund will defend its legal standing to bring the case, noting it has diverted substantial resources to warn the public of the dangerous health risks posed by foie gras and, will assert that the Department's failure to regulate has resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of diseased birds whose organs are distributed into the human food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/article.php?id=2349|title=Animal Legal Defense Fund Files Appeal against New York State for Allowing Sale of Diseased Foie Gras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] referred to the ban as "the silliest law" the City Council has ever passed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  As a result of the ban, Chicago restaurants Spiaggia and Tru developed dishes designed to simulate the foie gras experience. ''Chicago Tribune'' restaurant critic Phil Vettel found Tru's "Faux Gras" "close to the real thing", and Spiaggia's "[[Terrine (food)|terrina]] de fagato grasso vegetariano" "undeniably rich and indulgent", but "[lacking] the characteristic foie-gras intensity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banfoiegras.com/fauxfoiegras.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081420/http://www.banfoiegras.com/fauxfoiegras.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Franklin Prophecy"''', sometimes called "The Franklin Forgery", is an [[antisemitic]] speech falsely attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], warning of the supposed dangers of admitting [[Jews]] to the nascent [[United States]].  The speech was purportedly transcribed by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, but was unknown before its appearance in 1934 in the pages of [[William Dudley Pelley|William Dudley Pelley's]] [[Silver Legion]] pro-[[Nazi]] weekly magazine ''Liberation''.  No evidence exists for the document's authenticity, and some of the author's claims have actively been disproven.

==The speech==
The setting for the speech is a dinner table discussion purportedly recorded by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the convention of the [[Continental Congress]].  Primarily, it is a polemic arguing against admitting Jewish immigration into the newly formed United States. The text is as follows:&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

{{quote|There is a great danger for the United State of America. This great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen, in every land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have remained apart and unassimilated; oppressed, they attempt to strangle the nation financially, as in the case of Portugal and Spain.

For more than seventeen hundred years they have lamented their sorrowful fate — namely, that they have been driven out of their mother land; but, gentlemen, if the civilized world today should give them back Palestine and their property, they would immediately find pressing reason for not returning there. Why? Because they are vampires and vampires cannot live on other vampires --they cannot live among themselves. They must live among Christians and others who do not belong to their race.

If they are not expelled from the United States by the Constitution within less than one hundred years, they will stream into this country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and change our form of Government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed our life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded within two hundred years, our children will be working in the field to feed Jews while they remain in the counting houses, gleefully rubbing their hands.

I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews forever, your children and your children’s children will curse you in their graves. Their ideas are not those of Americans, even when they lived among us for ten generations. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil our institutions. They should be excluded by the Constitution.}}

==Authenticity==
According to Pelley, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney wrote that he had kept a journal of the Convention, but it has never been found; no evidence exists for Pelley's claim that it was printed privately.  The Franklin Institute has rejected Pelley's claims that it owns a manuscript copy of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/306346 Benjamin Franklin vindicated: an exposure of the Franklin "prophecy"] by [[American Jewish Congress]], 1938, p. 9-10 via [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] report ''Anti-Semitism in Europe: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations'' (2004) states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Franklin "Prophecy" is a classic anti-Semitic canard that falsely claims that American statesman Benjamin Franklin made anti-Jewish statements during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It has found widening acceptance in Muslim and Arab media, where it has been used to criticize Israel and Jews...&lt;ref&gt;''Anti-Semitism in Europe: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations''. United States Congress. Senate. Committee on Foreign Relations. Subcommittee on European Affairs. 2004. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin was a friend to the Jews of 18th-century America,&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp "The Franklin "Prophecy": Modern Anti-Semitic Myth Making"], ''Facts''. Anti-Defamation League. April–May 1954. Retrieved January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed toward the building of Philadelphia's first permanent synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikvehisrael.org/e2_cms_display.php?p=past_our_history "Our History"]. Mikveh Israel. Retrieved January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] noted that the reference to a return to Palestine was an [[anachronism]], since the modern [[Zionist]] movement did not arise until nearly a century after Franklin's death.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

Similar antisemitic quotations have been attributed to [[George Washington]] and have been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/quotes/washington/enemies.asp "To Bigotry, No Sanction"]. Snopes. March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, in a marked sign of religious tolerance, Washington sent a letter to the [[Jew]]ish community in [[Rhode Island]], writing "May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid."&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirschfeld|first=Fritz|title=George Washington and the Jews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-250L02b4EMC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=January 31, 2006|year=2005|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-927-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Despite having been repeatedly discredited since its first appearance, the "prophecy" has proved a remarkably durable [[antisemitic canard]]. It has appeared most recently as a popular [[Hoax|Internet hoax]] promulgated on [[Usenet]] groups and antisemitic websites, where it is presented as authentic. On February 18, 1998, a member of the [[Central Committee of Fatah|Fatah Central Committee]] revived this myth and mistakenly referred to Franklin as a former [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/arab/anti_sem_myth.asp "The Franklin 'Prophecy': American Anti-Semitic Myth Finds Acceptance in Arab World"], Anti-Defamation League. March 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama Bin Laden]] used this canard briefly in his October 2002 "[[Letter to the American People]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,,845725,00.html "Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'"], ''The Guardian''. November 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hanoi Opera House''', or the '''Grand Opera House''' ({{lang-vi|Nhà hát lớn Hà Nội}}, {{lang-fr|Opéra de Hanoï}}) is an [[opera house]] in central [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]]. It was erected by the French colonial administration between 1901 and 1911. 

==Building==
{{double image|1=right|2=Hanoi Theatre.JPG|3=250|4=Palais Garnier.jpg|5=200|6=Hanoi Opera House, taken in the early 20th century, from rue [[Paul Bert]] (now [[Trang Tien]] street)|7=[[Palais Garnier|Opéra Garnier de Paris]], the model for the Hanoi Opera House|8=Hanoi Opera House|9=Opéra Garnier de Paris}}

It was modeled on the [[Palais Garnier]], the older of [[Paris]]'s two opera houses, and is considered to be one of the architectural landmarks of Hanoi. After the departure of the French the opera house became the scene for several political events.&lt;ref&gt;War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History: Volume 1 - Page 403 Robert B. Asprey - 2002 "In early September, Viet Minh leaders (accompanied by OSS officers) stood on the balcony of the Hanoi opera house to proclaim the new Democratic Republic of Vietnam (the DRV)."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the scene of street fighting during the fight for Hanoi.

The Hanoi Opera House provides the names for the neighboring [[Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel]] which opened in 1999, as well as for the MGallery Hotel de l'Opera Hanoi, which opened in 2011.  For historical reasons associated with the [[Vietnam war]], the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel was not named the [[Hanoi Hilton]].

The opera house is described in the memoirs of [[Blanche Arral]] who performed in the new Hanoi Opera House in 1902 while waiting for the 1902 [[Hanoi exhibition|Exposition of Hanoi]] to open.&lt;ref&gt;Arral, pp.??:  "Like so many theaters in remote places, it was a small-scale model of the Paris Opera, new and with all the latest equipment for theatrical productions. It was our plan to give performances in Haiphong until such time as the International Exposition at Hanoi opened, and then to alternate between the two cities."&lt;/ref&gt; The opera had depended on touring artists performing French and Italian repertoire during the colonial period for a mainly French audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoioperahouse.org.vn/E_FontEnd/E_Lichsu.aspx History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vietnam National Opera and Ballet (VNOB)===
After the departure of the French the building was used for Vietnamese plays and musicals. The return of Western opera, and the first major non-French or Italian opera, was a performance of [[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin'']] organised under Vietnam-Soviet cultural auspices in 1960, where the Russian vocal coach selected an untrained singer [[Quý Dương]] as a fit for the [[baritone]] title role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baomoi.com/Nghe-sy-Quy-Duong-Tinh-ca-dai-theo-dat-nuoc/71/6546611.epi Nghệ sỹ Quý Dương: Tình ca dài theo đất nước]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the orchestra of the opera overlaps with the [[Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra]], and calls on the [[Hanoi Philharmonic Orchestra]] of the [[Hanoi Conservatory]]. Famous singers of the company include the [[Tchaikovsky Conservatory]]-trained soprano [[Lê Dung]], the youngest ever person to be awarded [[People's Artist]] of Vietnam in 1993.

The Opera has seen many premieres of operas and musicals by Vietnamese composers. The operas of [[Đỗ Nhuận]] - ''[[Cô Sao]]'' ('Miss Sao') 1965, ''Người tạc tượng'' ('The Sculptor') 1971 and ''Nguyễn Trãi'' 1980, the works of [[Lưu Hữu Phước]] and the choral works of film composer [[Đặng Hữu Phúc]]. As well as works by returning emigre composers such as [[Nguyen-Thien Dao|Nguyễn Thiên Đạo]], a pupil of [[Messiaen]] in Paris.

The National Ballet is also part of the Opera House company - and stages Western classics such as [[Swan Lake]] as well as traditional and modern Vietnamese dance productions.

"'''Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)'''" is a song by [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. It was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their sixth album, ''[[Eat Me, Drink Me]]'' released on June 5, 2007.

==Inspiration==
{{cquote|When I wrote the song that's the single "Heart-Shaped Glasses" it was one of the songs that I really expected an immediate response from the record label from, in the way like 'of course that's a single' and it was almost embarrassing in the way that I thought it was so obvious. The song was written in a simple way, I was reading the book [[Lolita]] and it was something inspired by my current girlfriend [[Evan Rachel Wood]] who's obviously much younger than me, but having the sarcasm to make the point of that and showing up to visit me once wearing heart-shaped glasses which is the same as the [[Kubrick]] movie poster for the film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' and me saying what I say in the chorus of the song. I said that to her and I suddenly realized I should really write a song about that and it never occurred to me in my entire career, my entire life that, that's how you should write songs.
It should be the part of your personality that you might feel guarded or too secret to put out the rest of the world.''|author=Marilyn Manson|source=BBC Radio One}}

== Release ==
Initially, "Putting Holes In Happiness" was set as the first single from the album, but this was changed, similar to the case of "[[Get Your Gunn]]". The digital single was released on [[iTunes]] on April 24 and also added to the player on Manson's [[MySpace]] page on the same date. The CD single was released in Germany on May 25, and in the United Kingdom on May 28. A thirty-one second preview clip was released on French radio website ''[[Radio France]]'' on April 9, 2007. The single was played again in full on April 11 (after being debuted on the same radio station days before), 2007 at 20:05 GMT on the French radio station [[Le Mouv']]. The whole track was leaked onto the web as was apparent on several [[YouTube]] videos, which were revoked by the [[Universal Music Group]].

On April 27, 2007, a 34-second clip of the video for "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)" was released on YouTube, featuring Manson and girlfriend [[Evan Rachel Wood]] kissing while drenched in blood. Later, the video appeared on Manson's official website.

On May 22, 2007, an exclusive single was released through [[Hot Topic]], containing a different B-side than the other singles.

On May 23, 2007, Marilyn Manson and [[Tim Skold]] performed an acoustic version of the track on [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref name="AcousticRadio1"&gt;
[http://www.mansonusa.com/headlines/fullnews.php?id=466 Marilyn Manson On UK's Radio 1's Live Lounge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228102058/http://www.mansonusa.com/headlines/fullnews.php?id=466 |date=2007-12-28 }} Last accessed May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The video officially premiered on the German website [https://web.archive.org/web/20070912081134/http://en.sevenload.com/videos/636FW3s/Weltpremiere-Marilyn-Manson-Heart-Shaped-Glasses sevenload] on May 8, 2007. It contains a 2:47 introduction featuring Manson and girlfriend [[Evan Rachel Wood]] kissing maliciously while having simulated sex and scenes of her being covered in blood, overdubbed with an instrumental of the ''Eat Me, Drink Me'' track "[[Evidence (Marilyn Manson song)|Evidence]]". At the 1:35 mark the scene cuts to Manson and Wood driving down a highway in the dark, Wood daring Manson to go faster, to which Manson proclaims "[I'm] going as fast as I can." Manson takes his hands off the wheel to take numerous pictures of Wood, who lifts her leg up to the wheel and holds a knife to her mouth while wearing heart-shaped glasses. The two kiss again, concluding the introduction, and the setting cuts to a club.

On stage, in front of a large crowd, Manson begins singing as Wood watches him intently, apparently masturbating, from the crowd (still wearing the heart-shaped glasses), while numerous photos begin to fall over the audience. Shots of the two driving are flashed throughout the video, as the scene once again changes, this time revealing Manson and Wood in a bed, drenched in what appears to be blood. The two begin kissing vigorously again before the final scene returns to the two of them speeding along the highway. The front of the car erupts in flames, and they continue along, kissing once again. Manson says "Together as one...", and Wood replies "Against all others", before they drive off a cliff and fall, the video ending as they crash.

The video was directed by Marilyn Manson using a 3-D system developed by [[James Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1559650/20070515/marilyn_manson.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson's Sex Scene: 'Stellar Acting' Or The Real Deal? - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been rumored that the scenes in the video depicting sex between Manson and Wood was footage of legitimate sex between the two. To make matters more confusing, in an MTV interview with Manson, he did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the depictions, at one point dismissing it:

{{cquote|There were two crews there: one that was mine and one that hated me. Everything that I wanted to do was technically wrong to the people who hated me, because of the stellar acting and performances that took place in the sex scenes. They considered it to be pornographic, because they thought there may or may not have been too much realism to what was being filmed.|author=Marilyn Manson|source=MTV News&lt;ref name="Stellar Acting?"&gt;''Marilyn Manson's Sex Scene: 'Stellar Acting' Or The Real Deal?'' MTV.com, reported by [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1559650/20070515/marilyn_manson.jhtml MTV.com]. Last retrieved May 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And at another point implying the possibility that the sex was in fact real:

{{cquote|And Manson admits the scenes — in which Wood moans like a banshee, at times — seem very realistic but wouldn't confirm fans' suspicions one way or the other. "It does look real," he said, with a telling snicker.|author=MTV News&lt;ref name="Stellar Acting?"/&gt;}}

Evan Rachel Wood has said the sex was not real, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20051621,00.html People magazine] Retrieved on August 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_5842&amp;pageNum=2 EVAN ALMIGHTY: GQ magazine interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181656/http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_5842&amp;pageNum=2 |date=2007-09-30 }} Retrieved on August 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right|caption=The percentage of marine animal extinction at the [[genus]] level through the five [[mass extinction]]s}}

The '''Holocene extinction''', otherwise referred to as the '''Sixth extinction''' or '''Anthropocene extinction''', is the ongoing [[extinction event]] of [[species]] during the present [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], mainly as a result of human activity.&lt;ref name="WorldScientists"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos |first1=Gerardo |last2=Ehrlich |first2=Paul R. |title=The misunderstood sixth mass extinction |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1080.2 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=8 June 2018 |volume=360 |issue=6393 |pages=1080-1081 |doi=10.1126/science.aau0191 |pmid=29880679 |oclc=7673137938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s. With widespread degradation of [[Biodiversity hotspot|highly biodiverse]] habitats such as [[coral reef]]s and [[rainforest]]s, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be ''undocumented'', as no one is even aware of the existence of the species before they go extinct, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawton95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{Cite journal|last=De Vos|first=Jurriaan M.|last2=Joppa|first2=Lucas N.|last3=Gittleman|first3=John L.|last4=Stephens|first4=Patrick R.|last5=Pimm|first5=Stuart L.|date=2014-08-26|title=Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12380|journal=Conservation Biology |volume=29|issue=2|pages=452–462|doi=10.1111/cobi.12380|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06/&gt;

The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as [[megafauna]], starting at the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. Megafauna outside of the [[African continent]], which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation, and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (additionally, many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]]). These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]–[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].

The arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction. The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.

Ecologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented "global superpredator" that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be linked to the [[human impact on the environment]]. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[decline in amphibian populations]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[Human impact on the environment#Biodiversity|decline in biodiversity]]. [[Human overpopulation]] (and continued [[Human population growth|population growth]]) along with [[Overconsumption|profligate consumption]] are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline.&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Kristine |title=Earth is on its way to the biggest mass extinction since the dinosaurs, scientists warn  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/12/earth-is-on-its-way-to-the-biggest-mass-extinction-since-the-dinosaurs-scientists-warn/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (methane) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Scientists that are employing a variance of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus, not originating as early as the [[Industrial Revolution]].

[[Australia]] was once home to a [[Australian megafauna|large assemblage of megafauna]], with many parallels to those found on the African continent today. Australia's fauna is characterised by primarily [[marsupial]] mammals, and many reptiles and birds, all existing as giant forms until recently. [[Indigenous Australians|Humans]] arrived on the continent very early, about 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The extent human arrival contributed is controversial; climatic drying of Australia 40,000–60,000 years ago was an unlikely cause, as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna.

There has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of [[megafauna]] at the end of the last [[glacial period]] can be attributed to human activities by hunting, or even by slaughter&lt;ref&gt;This may refer to groups of animals endangered by climate change. For example, during a catastrophic drought, remaining animals would be gathered around the few remaining watering holes, and thus become extremely vulnerable.&lt;/ref&gt; of prey populations. Discoveries at Monte Verde in South America and at [[Meadowcroft Rock Shelter]] in Pennsylvania have caused a controversy&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Early Settlement of North America. The Clovis Era. Gary Haynes 2002 {{ISBN|9780521524636}}. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the [[Clovis culture]]. There likely would have been human settlements prior to the Clovis Culture, and the history of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|humans in the Americas]] may extend back many thousands of years before the Clovis culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated: for example, in [[Wrangel Island]] in Siberia the extinction of dwarf [[woolly mammoth]]s (approximately 2000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = P.S. | year = 1995 | title = Mammoth Extinction: Two Continents and Wrangel Island | url = | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1017/s0033822200014739}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not coincide with the arrival of humans, nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the South American continent, although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions (approximately since the [[industrial revolution]]) and the Pleistocene extinction near the end of the last [[glacial period]]. The latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the [[woolly mammoth]] and the carnivores that preyed on them. Humans of this era actively hunted the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitulko | first1 = V. V. | last2 = Nikolsky | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Girya | first3 = E.

E. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;

The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction, and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans. Therefore, the actions of the Clovis people, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Megafaunal extinction====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name="Wolf2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C.

Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=D.

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

=== Disease ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis, proposed by Ross MacPhee in 1997, states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 978-1-56098-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1998"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first = Ross D.E.| last = MacPhee|author2=Marx, Preston | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions| booktitle = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar| pages = 169–217| publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press| year = 1997| location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacPhee, aboriginals or animals travelling with them, such as [[domestic dog]]s or livestock, introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them, eventually leading to their extinction. [[K-selection]] animals, such as the now-extinct megafauna, are especially vulnerable to diseases, as opposed to [[r-selection]] animals who have a shorter [[gestation period]] and a higher population size. Humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"/&gt;

There are many problems with this theory, as this disease would have to meet several criteria: it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no [[host (biology)|hosts]]; it has to have a high [[infection rate]]; and be extremely lethal, with a [[mortality rate]] of 50–75%. Disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]], and even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile Virus]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.&lt;ref name="Lyons et al2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lyons|first=K.|last2=Smith|first2=F.

The decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation. As well as habitat loss, introduced predators and pollution, [[Chytridiomycosis]], a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs, including (among many others) the extinction of the [[golden toad]] in Costa Rica and the [[Gastric-brooding frog]] in Australia. Many other amphibian species now face extinction, including the reduction of [[Rabb's Fringe-limbed Treefrog|Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog]] to an [[endling]], and the extinction of the [[Panamanian golden frog]] in the wild. Chytrid fungus has spread across Australia, New Zealand, Central America and Africa, including countries with high amphibian diversity such as [[cloud forest]]s in [[Honduras]] and [[Madagascar]]. ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans]]'' is a similar infection currently threatening [[salamander]]s.

Millions of bats in the US have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from European bats, which appear to be immune. Population drops have been as great as 90% within five years, and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted.

Some leading scientists have advocated for the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis as the human population is projected to grow to 10 billion by the middle of the century.

The LISA mission's primary objective is to detect and measure gravitational waves produced by compact binary systems and mergers of supermassive black holes. LISA will observe gravitational waves by measuring differential changes in the length of its arms, as sensed by laser interferometry.&lt;ref name=eLISAconcept&gt;{{Cite web | title = eLISA: the mission concept | publisher = eLISA Consortium | url = https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/mission-concept | accessdate = 12 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051420/https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/mission-concept | archivedate = 5 December 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the three LISA spacecraft contains two telescopes, two lasers and two test masses (each a 46&amp;nbsp;mm, roughly 2&amp;nbsp;kg, gold-coated cube of gold/platinum), arranged in two optical assemblies pointed at the other two spacecraft.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt; This forms [[michelson interferometer|Michelson-like interferometers]], each centred on one of the spacecraft, with the test masses defining the ends of the arms.&lt;ref name=eLISAmeasure&gt;{{Cite web | title = eLISA: distance measurement | publisher = eLISA Consortium | url = https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/distance-measurement | accessdate = 12 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205093143/https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/distance-measurement | archivedate = 5 December 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire arrangement, which is ten times larger than the orbit of the Moon, will be placed in solar orbit at the same distance from the Sun as the Earth, but trailing the Earth by 20 degrees, and with the orbital planes of the three spacecraft inclined relative to the ecliptic by about 0.33 degree, which results in the plane of the triangular spacecraft formation being tilted 60 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic.&lt;ref name="eLISAconcept"/&gt; The mean linear distance between the formation and the Earth will be 50 million kilometres.&lt;ref name=eLISAkeyfeatures&gt;{{Cite web | title = eLISA: key features | publisher = eLISA Consortium | url = https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/key-features | accessdate = 12 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205080002/https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/key-features | archivedate = 5 December 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To eliminate non-gravitational forces such as light pressure and [[solar wind]] on the test masses, each spacecraft is constructed as a [[zero-drag satellite]], and effectively floats around the masses, using [[Capacitive displacement sensor|capacitive sensing]] to determine their position relative to the spacecraft, and very precise thrusters to keep itself centered around them.&lt;ref name=eLISAdragfree&gt;{{Cite web | title = eLISA: dragfree operation | publisher = eLISA Consortium | url = https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/drag-free-operation | accessdate = 12 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205072116/https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/drag-free-operation | archivedate = 5 December 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arm length ===
The longer the arms, the more sensitive the detector is to long-period gravitational waves, but its sensitivity to wavelengths shorter than the arms (2.5 million km corresponds to {{#expr:2.5e9/299792458 round 1}} seconds or {{#expr:299792458/2.5e9 round 3}} Hz) is reduced. As the satellites are free-flying, the spacing is easily adjusted before launch, with upper bounds being imposed by the sizes of the telescopes required at each end of the interferometer (which are constrained by the size of the launch vehicle's [[payload fairing]]) and the stability of the constellation orbit (larger constellations are more sensitive to the gravitational effects of other planets, limiting the mission lifetime). Another length-dependent factor which must be compensated for is the "point-ahead angle" between the incoming and outgoing laser beams; the telescope must receive its incoming beam from where its partner was a few seconds ago, but send its outgoing beam to where its partner will be a few seconds from now.

The original 2008 LISA proposal had arms 5 million km (5&amp;nbsp;Gm) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robert L. |last=Byer |title=LISA: Drag-free Formation Flying at 5 million kilometres |conference=Stanford 2008 Position Navigation and Time Symposium |date=November 5–6, 2008 |location=[[SLAC]] |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scpnt/pnt/PNT08/Presentations/10_Byer_PNT_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When downscoped to eLISA in 2013, arms of 1 million km were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Numerical simulation of time delay interferometry for eLISA/NGO |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/30/6/065011 |first1=Gang |last1=Wang |first2=Wei-Tou |last2=Ni |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume=30 |issue=6 |page=065011  |date=February 2013 |arxiv=1204.2125 |bibcode=2013CQGra..30f5011W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approved 2017 LISA proposal has arms 2.5 million km (2.5&amp;nbsp;Gm) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1703.09858 |title=Galactic binary science with the new LISA design |first1=Neil |last1=Cornish |first2=Travis |last2=Robson |date=29 March 2017 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/840/1/012024 |volume=840 |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |page=012024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

==Detection principle==

[[Image:LISA GW+ effect.gif|thumb|right|300px|View of amplified effects of a + polarized gravitational wave (stylized) on LISA laser beams / arms paths.]]

Like most modern [[gravitational wave observatory|gravitational wave observatories]], LISA is based on laser interferometry technique. Its three satellites form a giant [[Michelson interferometer]] in which two "slave" satellites play the role of reflectors and one "master" satellite the one of source and observer. While a gravitational wave is passing through the interferometer, lengths of the two eLISA arms are varying due to [[space-time]] distortions resulting from the wave. Practically, it measures a relative [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]] between one local laser and one distant laser by [[Interference (wave propagation)|light interference]]. Comparison between the observed laser beam frequency (in return beam) and the local laser beam frequency (sent beam) encodes the wave parameters.

Unlike terrestrial GW observatories, LISA cannot keep its arms "locked" in position at a fixed length.  Instead, the distances between satellites varies significantly over each year's orbit, and the detector must keep track of the constantly changing distance, counting the millions of wavelengths by which the distance changes each second.  Then, the signals are separated in the [[frequency domain]]: changes with periods of less than a day are signals of interest, while changes with periods of a month or more are irrelevant.

This difference means that LISA cannot use high-finesse [[Fabry–Pérot]] resonant arm cavities and signal recycling systems like terrestrial detectors, limiting its length-measurement accuracy.  But with arms almost a million times longer, the motions to be detected are correspondingly larger.

==LISA Pathfinder==

[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] seeks to use direct measurements of gravitational waves to study astrophysical systems and to test [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[gravity]]. Indirect evidence of [[gravitational waves]] was derived from observations of the decreasing orbital periods of several [[binary pulsar]]s, such as the [[Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stairs|first=Ingrid H.|title=Testing General Relativity with Pulsar Timing|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=6|doi=10.12942/lrr-2003-5|arxiv = astro-ph/0307536 |bibcode = 2003LRR.....6....5S |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the [[Advanced LIGO]] project announced that it had directly [[Gravitational wave detection|detected gravitational waves]] from a black hole merger.&lt;ref name="Discovery 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=February 11, 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361  |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger| authors=B. P.

Observing gravitational waves requires two things: a strong source of gravitational waves—such as the merger of two [[black holes]]—and extremely high detection sensitivity. A LISA-like instrument should be able to measure relative displacements with a resolution of 20&amp;nbsp;[[picometre]]s—less than the diameter of a helium atom—over a distance of a million kilometres, yielding a strain sensitivity of better than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; in the low-frequency band about a millihertz.

A LISA-like detector is sensitive to the low-frequency band of the gravitational-wave spectrum, which contains many astrophysically interesting sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Amaro-Seoane, Pau; Aoudia, Sofiane; Babak, Stanislav; Binétruy, Pierre; Berti, Emanuele; Bohé, Alejandro; Caprini, Chiara; Colpi, Monica; Cornish, Neil J; Danzmann, Karsten; Dufaux, Jean-François; Gair, Jonathan; Jennrich, Oliver; Jetzer, Philippe; Klein, Antoine; Lang, Ryan N; Lobo, Alberto; Littenberg, Tyson; McWilliams, Sean T; Nelemans, Gijs; Petiteau, Antoine; Porter, Edward K; Schutz, Bernard F; Sesana, Alberto; Stebbins, Robin; Sumner, Tim; Vallisneri, Michele; Vitale, Stefano; Volonteri, Marta; Ward, Henry|title=Low-frequency gravitational-wave science with eLISA/NGO|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 June 2012|volume=29|issue=12|pages=124016|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/29/12/124016|arxiv = 1202.0839 |bibcode = 2012CQGra..29l4016A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a detector would observe signals from binary stars within our galaxy (the [[Milky Way]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelemans|first=Gijs|title=The Galactic gravitational wave foreground|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 May 2009|volume=26|issue=9|pages=094030|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/26/9/094030|arxiv = 0901.1778 |bibcode = 2009CQGra..26i4030N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroeer|first=A|author2=Vecchio, A |title=The LISA verification binaries|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 October 2006|volume=23|issue=19|pages=S809–S817|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/19/S19|arxiv = astro-ph/0605227 |bibcode = 2006CQGra..23S.809S }}&lt;/ref&gt; signals from binary [[supermassive black holes]] in other [[Galaxy|galaxies]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=Éanna É.|title=Measuring gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences.

===Galactic compact binaries===
LISA will be able to detect the nearly monochromatic gravitational waves emanating of close binaries consisting of two compact stellar objects ([[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s) in the [[Milky Way]]. At low frequencies these are actually expected to be so numerous that they form a source of (foreground) noise for LISA data analysis. At higher frequencies LISA is expected to detect and resolve around 25,000 galactic compact binaries. Studying the distribution of the masses, periods, and locations of this population, will teach us about the formation and evolution of binary systems in the galaxy. Furthermore, LISA will be able to resolve 10 binaries currently known from electromagnetic observations (and find ≈500 more with electromagnetic counterparts). Joint study of these systems will allow inference on other dissipation mechanisms in these systems, e.g. through tidal interactions.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Supermassive black hole mergers===
LISA will be able to detect the gravitational waves from the merger of a pair of (super)massive black holes with a [[chirp mass]] between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es all the way back to their earliest formation at [[redshift]] around ''z'' ≈ 15. The most conservative population models expect at least a few such events to happen each year. For mergers closer by (''z&lt;3''), it will be able to determine the spins of the components, which carry information about the past evolution of the components (e.g. whether they have grown primarily through [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] or mergers). For mergers around the peak of star formation (''z'' ≈ 2) LISA will be able to locate mergers within 100 square degrees on the night sky at least 24 hours before the actual merger, allowing electromagnetic telescopes to search for counterparts, with the potential of witnessing the formation of a [[quasar]] after a merger.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Extreme mass ratio inspirals===
{{main|extreme mass ratio inspiral}}
Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) consist of a stellar compact object (&lt;60 solar masses) on a slowly decaying orbit around a massive black hole of around  ''10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'' solar masses. For the ideal case of a prograde orbit around a (nearly) maximally spinning black hole, LISA will be able to detect these events up to ''z=4''. EMRIs are interesting because they are slowly evolving, spending around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; orbits and between a few months and a few years in the LISA sensitivity band before merging. This allows very accurate (up to an error of 1 in  10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)  measurements of the properties of the system, including the mass and spin of the central object and the mass and orbital elements ([[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]]) of the smaller object. EMRIs are expected to occur regularly in the centers of most galaxies and in dense star clusters. Conservative population estimates predict at least one detectable event per year for LISA.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Intermediate mass black hole binaries===
LISA will also be able to detect the gravitational waves emanating from black hole binary mergers where the lighter black hole is in the intermediate black hole range (between ''10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' solar masses). In the case of both components being intermediate black holes between ''600'' and ''10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' solar masses, LISA will be able to detect events up to reshifts around 1. In the case of an intermediate mass black hole spiralling into a massive black hole (between ''10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' solar masses) events will be detectable up to at least ''z = 3''. Since little is known about the population of intermediate mass black holes, there is no good estimate of the event rates for these events.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Multi-band gravitational wave astronomy===
Following the announcement of the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first gravitational wave detection]], GW150914, it was realized that a similar event would be detectable by LISA well before the merger.&lt;ref name="sesanaPRL"&gt;{{cite article
|first=Alberto |last=Sesana
|title=Prospects for Multiband Gravitational-Wave Astronomy after GW150914
|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.
|volume=116
|year=2016
|number=23
|pages=231102
|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.231102
|arxiv=1602.06951
|bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116w1102S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the LIGO estimated event rates, it is expected that LISA will detect and resolve about 100 binaries that would merge a few weeks to months later in the LIGO detection band. LISA will be able to accurately predict the time of merger ahead of time and locate the event with 1 square degree on the sky. This will greatly aid the possibilities for searches for electromagnetic counterpart events.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Fundamental black hole physics===
{{expand section|date=January 2018}}
Gravitational wave signals from black holes could provide hints at a quantum theory of gravity.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Probe expansion of the universe===
LISA will be able to independently measure the redshift and distance of events occurring relatively close by (''z&lt;0.1'') through the detection of massive black hole mergers and EMRIs. Consequently, it can make an independent measurement of the [[Hubble parameter]] ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' that does not depend on the use of the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. The accuracy of such a determination is limited by the sample size and therefore the mission duration. With a mission lifetime of 4 years one expects to be able to determine ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' with an absolute error of 0.01&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc. At larger ranges LISA events can (stochastically) be linked to electromagnetic counterparts, to further constrain the expansion curve of the universe.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Gravitational wave background===
Finally, LISA will be sensitive to the stochastic [[gravitational wave background]] generated in the early universe through various channels, including [[cosmic inflation|inflation]], [[first order phase transition]]s related to [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], and [[cosmic string]]s.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

===Exotic sources===
LISA will also search for currently unknown (and unmodelled) sources of gravitational waves. The history of astrophysics has shown that whenever a new frequency range/medium of detection is available new unexpected sources show up. This could for example include kinks and cusps in cosmic strings.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

== Other gravitational-wave experiments ==
{{gravitational wave observatory principle.svg}}
Previous searches for gravitational waves in space were conducted for short periods by planetary missions that had other primary science objectives (such as [[Cassini–Huygens]]), using [[Doppler radar|microwave Doppler tracking]] to monitor fluctuations in the Earth-spacecraft distance. By contrast, LISA is a dedicated mission that will use laser interferometry to achieve a much higher sensitivity.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
Other [[gravitational wave antennas]], such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], and [[GEO 600]], are already in operation on Earth, but their sensitivity at low frequencies is limited by the largest practical arm lengths, by seismic noise, and by interference from nearby moving masses. Thus, LISA and ground detectors are complementary rather than competitive, much like astronomical observatories in different electromagnetic bands (e.g., [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
The first design studies for gravitational wave detector to be flown in space were performed in the 1980s under the name LAGOS (Laser Antena for Gravitational radiation Observation in Space). LISA was first proposed as a mission to ESA in the early 1990s. First as a candidate for the M3-cycle, and later as 'cornerstone mission' for the 'Horizon 2000 plus' program. As the decade progressed, the design was refined to a triangular configuration of three spacecraft with three 5-million kilometre arms. This mission was pitched as a joint mission between ESA and NASA in 1997.&lt;ref name="roma1.infn.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roma1.infn.it/teongrav/TEONGRAV14/Talks/TEONGRAV_Colpi.pdf|title=The Gravitational Universe (science theme)|work=Monica Colpi|date=4 February 2014|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=University of Bicocca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warwick"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/research/meetings/amcvn3/program/gijs_elisa.pdf|title=eLISA (or NGO): the New LISA|work=Gijs Nelemans|publisher=Rabould University Nijimegen|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s the joint ESA/NASA LISA mission was identified as a candidate for the 'L1' slot in ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme. However, due to budget cuts, NASA announced in early 2011 that it would not be contributing to any of ESA's L-class missions. ESA nonetheless decided to push the program forward, and instructed the L1 candidate missions to present reduced cost versions that could be flown within ESA's budget. A reduced version of LISA was designed with only two 1-million kilometre arms under the name NGO (New/Next Gravitational wave Observatory). Despite NGO being ranked highest in terms of scientific potential, ESA decided to fly [[Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer]] (JUICE) as its L1 mission. One of the main concerns was that the [[LISA Pathfinder]] mission had been experiencing technical delays, making it uncertain if the technology would be ready for the projected L1 launch date.&lt;ref name="roma1.infn.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="warwick"/&gt;

Soon afterwards, ESA announced it would be selecting themes for its [[Cosmic Vision#Large class|Large class]] L2 and L3 mission slots. A theme called "the Gravitational Universe" was formulated with the reduced NGO rechristened eLISA as a straw-man mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Danzmann|first=Karsten|author2=The eLISA Consortium|title=The Gravitational Universe|eprint=1305.5720|date=24 May 2013|class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2013, ESA announced that it selected "the Gravitational Universe" for its L3 mission slot (expected launch in 2034).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the successful detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO, ground-based detectors in September 2015, NASA expressed interest in rejoining the mission as a junior partner. In response to an ESA call for mission proposals for the `Gravitational Universe' themed L3 mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/2016-l3-mission-call|title=CALL FOR MISSION CONCEPTS FOR THE LARGE-SIZE 'L3' MISSION OPPORTUNITY IN ESA’S SCIENCE PROGRAMME}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mission proposal for a detector with three 2.5 million km arms again called LISA was submitted in January 2017.&lt;ref name="2017proposal"/&gt;

'''''Last Men in Aleppo''''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] آخر الرجال في حلب) is a 2017 documentary film about the Syrian Civil War. Written and directed by Feras Fayyad, produced by Kareem Abeed and Søren Steen Jespersen, it documents the life in [[Aleppo]] during the war and particularly sheds light on the search-and-rescue missions of the internationally recognized [[White Helmets (Syrian Civil War)|White Helmets]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/last-men-in-aleppo-movie-reivew.html Vulture.com: You Can’t Look Away From Last Men in Aleppo]&lt;/ref&gt; an organization consisting of ordinary citizens who are the first to rush towards military strikes and attacks in the hope of saving lives. The documentary highlights the lives of three White Helmets founders, [[Khaled Omar Harrah]], Subhi Alhussen and Mahmoud as they grapple the dilemma to flee their country or stay and fight for it.

The film won the World Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] in 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/last-men-in-aleppo-review-1201978236/ ''Variety'': Film Review: ‘Last Men in Aleppo’ - Amid a recent influx of Syria-themed docs, Feras Fayyad's Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner stands out for its rich craft and practical candor.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]].

Written in the [[operatic]] style similar to the creative team's previous efforts, ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', the bulk of the show is [[sung-through]], with little spoken dialogue between the musical numbers.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It failed to match the box office success of its two predecessors.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Synopsis==
Loosely based on the real-life historical figure [[Martin Guerre]] and the 1982 film ''[[The Return of Martin Guerre]]'' he inspired, the story is set in [[early modern]] [[France]] in the [[Anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]] town of [[Artigat]], where young Martin Guerre is forced into an arranged marriage with Bertrande de Rols in order to produce a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] heir. Martin is unsatisfied with the marriage, complicated by the fact that a childhood friend, Guillaume, is secretly in love with Bertrande. Beaten by the priests due to his failure to consummate the union, Martin abandons his home and Bertrande to fight the [[Protestant]] [[Huguenots]], and it is during the skirmishes that he befriends Arnaud du Thil with whom he shares his history, beginning the story at this point, seven years later, ''[[in medias res]]''. When Martin appears to die in battle, Arnaud goes to his village to inform Bertrande of her husband's death but, mistaken for the deceased soldier by the residents, he decides to play along with their error and becomes involved with Bertrande. Aware of Arnaud's deception, Bertrande decides to keep his secret and the two discover a mutual romantic attraction while Arnaud takes the name "Martin Guerre" for himself. Guillaume, who had until now hoped for a chance with Bertrande romantically, becomes envious of the supposedly returned soldier. As Bertrande, secretly converted to [[Protestantism]], also turns Arnaud to her faith, Guillaume uncovers their beliefs and so they are assaulted by a roused mob. Before Arnaud is killed, however, Benoit, the knowing [[village idiot]], reveals that he is not truly Martin Guerre, but rather, an [[imposter]]. The authorities arrest Arnaud&amp;mdash;still claiming that he is Martin&amp;mdash;under charges of deception and at the end of the trial, Martin Guerre himself, having apparently survived the war, appears as the last witness. In prison, Arnaud, however, is freed by Martin who forgives him for stealing his identity, noting the legitimacy of Arnaud and Bertrande's love for each other. The mob, though, sets the town ablaze and Guillaume stabs Arnaud before he can escape. As Arnaud dies in Bertrande's arms, Martin and Bertrande sing mournfully about love and the two part for good. The town contemplates their own [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] actions remorsefully.

==Productions and background==
When first approached by Schönberg and Boublil, [[Cameron Mackintosh]], who had produced their earlier works, expressed little interest in producing the project as it existed. Only after several dramatic revisions, in which the character of Guerre became more heroic and greater emphasis was placed on the theme of religious intolerance, did he become enthusiastic about its potential.

===London (1996–1998)===
Six years in the making, Mackintosh's $6 million [[West End theatre|West End production]], directed by [[Declan Donnellan]] and [[choreographed]] by [[Bob Avian]], with lyrics by Edward Hardy, opened on July 10, 1996 at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/princeedward48.html Martin Guerre, 1996] thisistheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a spectacular production, but not only were the reviews mixed, there were also some major concerns expressed by the public and the creative team alike. In the early weeks, the creative team worked hard and quickly to clarify the narrative, rearrange some of the material, and remove one pretty, but nonessential song.

The mostly brutal reviews prompted the producer to examine carefully all the problems and take dramatic action to fix them. While the cast continued to perform the show, the creative team – now augmented by additional lyricist Clark – virtually rewrote it, adding new scenes and songs, shortening the overly long beginning, providing a happier ending, and shifting the focus to Bertrande. In order to make more radical changes, the show closed from October 28–31, 1996, and the production was completely revised. This revised version opened after a week of previews on November 11, 1996. The critical response was significantly improved, and the revised show went on to win the 1997 [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best Musical and Best Choreography.

In June 1997 some further changes were made to the production to coincide with the cast change. The production closed on February 28, 1998 after 675 performances.

===UK tour (1999)===
The [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in Leeds was the new home for a completely rewritten version of ''Martin Guerre''. The Artistic Director [[Jude Kelly]] invited the writers Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg to rework their musical there, and in a co-production between the West Yorkshire Playhouse and Cameron Mackintosh, ''Martin Guerre'' opened on December 8, 1998. The libretto was rewritten extensively, a number of new songs were added, and many of the original tunes were retitled, repositioned, and/or were given new lyrics. The physical production was trimmed considerably to make it more intimate and less blockbuster.  In addition, the logo was changed from the original red to a black background.

It then embarked on a national tour which ended in Bristol on August 7, 1999 after 227 performances. The tour also played Newcastle, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Norwich, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Llandudno, Nottingham and Plymouth.

===US tour (1999–2000)===
The North American premiere was at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis on September 29, 1999, for an 8-week engagement.&lt;ref name=weber&gt;Weber, Bruce.[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/theater/theater-when-the-commercial-theater-moves-in-on-nonprofits.html?pagewanted=all "When the Commercial Theater Moves In on Nonprofits"]. ''The New York Times'', October 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The Artistic Director [[Joe Dowling]] welcomed the opportunity for a co-production between the Guthrie Theater and Cameron Mackintosh so that Martin Guerre could be fine-tuned for its first American audience.

There was some more reworking for this production. Some musical numbers were moved and there was a general softening of the village characters to make them more likable and more individualized. According to Mackintosh "Forty percent of the current material was not in the original."&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; The production starred [[Hugh Panaro]], [[Erin Dilly]] and Stephen R. Buntrock in the [[United States|US]] tour in 1999–2000. The tour played Minneapolis, Detroit, Washington, Seattle and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt;

A planned [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] opening never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Chris.

===Denmark (1999–2000)===
A licensed production of ''Martin Guerre'' opened at the [[Odense Teater|Odense Theater]] in Denmark on December 30, 1999 and it ran until March 6, 2000.

===Newbury (2007)===
A revival of the musical at the [[Watermill Theatre]] near [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[England]], ran in July 2007. There was a company of 12 actor/musicians, starring [[Andrew Bevis]] and directed by [[Craig Revel Horwood]]. Based largely on the London version that had premiered in November 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Robert.[http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/A_Spellbinding_Martin_Guerre_at_the_Watermill_20070721 A Spellbinding "Martin Guerre" at the Watermill"] westend.broadwayworld.com, July 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; there were further lyrical changes, and "Live With Somebody You Love" from the touring version was inserted into the score. This production made one central change to the premise of the previous versions of the musical; Bertrande does not (appear to) know that the imposter is not her returning husband until the court scene in act 2. The character of Martin was made far more hostile in this version.  This production also had more spoken dialogue, a conscious decision made by the composers, who reworked the show whilst they were in rehearsals for ''[[The Pirate Queen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepublicreviews.blogspot.com/2007/07/martin-guerre-watermill-theatre-bagnor.html "Review 'Martin Guerre' Watermill Theatre"] thepublicreviews.blogspot.com, 17 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[American folklore]] of [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], and [[Connecticut]], '''Melon Heads''' are beings generally described as small humanoids with bulbous heads who occasionally emerge from hiding places to attack people. Different variations of the legend attribute different origins to the entities. 

==Legend in Michigan==
The melon heads of Michigan are said to reside around [[Felt Mansion]], although they have also been reportedly seen in southern forested areas of [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]].&lt;ref name="grand haven"&gt;[http://www.grandhaventribune.com/article/strange-grand-haven/307691 The origin of the Melon Heads] ''Grand Haven Tribune''. Retrieved 24 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one story, they were originally children with [[hydrocephalus]] who lived at the Junction Insane Asylum near Felt Mansion.&lt;ref name="grand haven" /&gt; The story explains that, after enduring physical and emotional abuse, they became feral and were released into the forests surrounding the asylum. The [[Allegan County]] Historical Society asserts that the asylum never existed, although it was at one point a prison;&lt;ref&gt;Mike LaVey. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Rv64wjtnnoC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=melon+heads&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=id8lGycvVqHqrYwuj04_ZPZn0HQ The Legend of the Melon Heads]". ''Weird Michigan''. Sterling Publishing Company, 2006. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the story has been part of the local folklore for several decades. Laketown Township Manager Al Meshkin told the ''[[Holland Sentinel]]'' that he had heard the tales as a teenager, noting that his friends referred to the beings as "wobbleheads". Some versions of the legend say that the children once lived in the mansion itself but later retreated to a system of underground caverns (or caves in a nearby hill left over from an abandoned zoo). Some versions of this legend say that the children devised a plan to escape and kill the doctor that abused them. It is said that the children had no place to hide the body, so they cut it up in small pieces which they hid around the mansion. Rumors exist that teenagers who had broken into the mansion saw ghosts of the children and claimed to see shadows of the doctor's murder through the light coming from an open door. The legend has spread throughout the region, even becoming the subject of a 2011 film simply titled ''The Melonheads,'' which is based around the West Michigan legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2648138/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 imdb.com ''The Melonheads'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William F.

==Legend in Ohio==
The melon head stories of Ohio are primarily associated with the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] suburb of [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]]. According to local lore, the melon heads were originally orphans under the watch of a mysterious figure known as Dr. Crow (sometimes spelled Crowe, Krohe or Kroh or known as Dr. Melonhead&lt;ref name="weirdus"&gt;Mark Moran and Mark Scuerman. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bU9LwRjANagC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=melon+heads&amp;sig=-O5RwO79fRtd5JZEZTGLMOlS_hc#PPA60,M1 The Hideous Melon Heads]". ''Weird US''. Sterling Publishing Company. 2005. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;). Crow is said to have performed unusual experiments on the children, who developed large, hairless heads and malformed bodies.&lt;ref name=B/&gt; Some accounts claim that the children were already suffering from [[hydrocephalus]] and that Crow injected even more fluid into their brains.&lt;ref name="weirdus" /&gt;

Eventually, the legend continues, the children killed Crow, burned the orphanage, and retreated to the surrounding forests and supposedly feed on babies. Legend holds that the melon heads may be sighted along Wisner Road in Kirtland, and [[Chardon Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Chardon Township]].&lt;ref name=B&gt;James Renner.

==Legend in Connecticut==

[[Image:Saw Mill City Road.jpg|thumb|200px|Saw Mill City Road is the dirt road where the [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]] Melon Heads supposedly lurk.]]

Several variations of the Melon Head legend can be found throughout Southwest Connecticut, especially in central &amp; eastern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and western [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], [[Connecticut]]. In eastern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], many tales can be found in communities such as [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]], [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]], [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]], [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]], [[Easton, CT|Easton]] and [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]]. In western and central [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]] tales can be found in towns like [[Seymour, Connecticut|Seymour]], [[Oxford, Connecticut|Oxford]], [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Southbury, Connecticut|Southbury]].

There are several primary Connecticut variations.&lt;ref name="DamnedCT1"&gt;[http://www.damnedct.com/the-melon-heads/ "The Melon Heads"]. ''Damned Connecticut''. Accessed April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one variation of the myth, Fairfield County was the location of an asylum for the criminally insane that burned down in the fall of 1960, resulting in the death of all of the staff and most of the patients with 10-20 inmates unaccounted for, supposedly having survived and escaped to the woods.The legend states that the melon heads' appearance is the result of them having resorted to cannibalism in order to survive the harsh winters of the region and to inbreeding, which in turn caused them to develop [[hydrocephalus]]. Some retellings of this version substitute the asylum or prison with places of business or camp grounds and the inmates/patients with employees, staff or camp-goers. Individual variations will modify what town these individuals were originally from and where they end up.

According to the second variation, the melon heads are descendants of a Colonial-era family from Shelton-Trumbull who were banished after accusations of witchcraft were made against them causing them to retreat to the woods. As with the first version of this legend, this variation attributes the appearance of the melon heads to inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctparanormalsearchers.weebly.com/melonheads.html |title=Melonheads - CT Paranormal Searchers |publisher=Ctparanormalsearchers.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melon Heads allegedly prey upon humans who wander into their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kooz |url=http://kooztop5.blogspot.com/2012/01/top-5-fake-creatures-some-people-think.html |title=Kooz Top 5: Top 5 Fake Creatures Some People Think Are Real |publisher=Kooztop5.blogspot.com |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the first version, individual retellings will modify what town the family was originally from and where they end up.

===Dracula Drive===

A number of Connecticut-based legends of the melon heads have one characteristics in common: the inclusion of a secluded, rustic or single-lane (usually) dirt road running through the melon heads' wooded territory. Many towns in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]] have rural and forested sections, and it is not uncommon for these forests to have rural roads running through them. These roads at times are associated with the local variation of the Melon Head legend and are said to be part of the Melon Heads' territory.

In a number of towns such as [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]], [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] and [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]], several legends place the melon heads' territory around a mysterious and mythical street commonly referred to as Dracula Drive. None of the towns that have a melon head legend have roads designated as Dracula Drive. Depending on what version of the legend is told, one of several existing streets are mistakenly referred to or coincidentally coincide with the Dracula Drive mentioned in the melon head stories. For instance, some legends place the melon heads' territory in and around Velvet Street, which runs through a wooded area of Trumbull and Monroe, near the [[Easton, Connecticut|Easton]] border. Other legends mistake Saw Mill City Road in [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]] as Dracula Drive. Some roads mistakenly referred to as Dracula Drive include:

# Saw Mill City Road in [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]].
# Edmonds Road in [[Oxford, Connecticut|Oxford]].
# Velvet Street in [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] and [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]]. (Runs between Tashua Road in [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] and Judd Road in [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]] near the [[Easton, Connecticut|Easton]] border.)
# Zion Hill Rd in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]].
# The roads around Lake Mohegan in [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]].
# Marginal Road in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].
# Jeremy Swamp Road in [[Southbury, Connecticut|Southbury]].
# Paths/roads in and around Roosevelt Forest in [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]].

===Connecticut Legend - Inspirations and Origins===

Over time, characteristics of the legend evolve and parts of various versions of the legend affect other parts/versions of the legend. For example, some legends claim the melon heads would bite or consume whoever entered their territory. Also, the Melon Heads' territory commonly involves a secluded, rustic or dirt road running through it. This is one instance where elements of the legend interact over time and why some actual streets are mistakenly referred to as Dracula Drive by some locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Citro |url=http://connecticut.livejournal.com/1054864.html |title=THE MELONHEADS MENACE FAIRFAX COUNTY, CONNECTICUT |publisher=LiveJournel |date=2005-10-20 |accessdate=2014-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219204429/http://connecticut.livejournal.com/1054864.html |archivedate=2015-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bendici |url=http://www.damnedct.com/the-melon-heads |title=The Melon Heads |publisher=Damned Connecticut|date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bendici |url=http://www.damnedct.com/the-melon-heads |title=Murder on Melon Head Road? |publisher=Damned Connecticut|date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, some of the inspiration for a number of versions of the Melon Heads' legends may be attributed to the local surroundings and landmarks. Central Fairfield County is home to the now defunct [[Fairfield Hills Hospital|Fairfield Hills State Mental Hospital]] as well as the [http://www.ct.gov/doc/cwp/view.asp?q=265410 Garner Correctional Institution], both located in [[Newtown, Connecticut|Newtown]], as well as the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury|Federal Correctional Institution]] located in nearby [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]. Also this area of Fairfield County has been historically a rural area filled with farms and forests. The proximity of several criminal and psychiatric institutions as well as there juxtaposition to rural areas of the county may have contributed elements to the legend of the Melon Heads.

While the legend of the Melon Heads is more widely told throughout Southwest Connecticut, one of several other similar legends of deformed or mutated humans can be found in various locations of Fairfield and New Haven County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Citro |url=http://connecticut.livejournal.com/1054864.html |title=THE MELONHEADS MENACE FAIRFAX COUNTY, CONNECTICUT |publisher=LiveJournel |date=2005-10-20 |accessdate=2014-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219204429/http://connecticut.livejournal.com/1054864.html |archivedate=2015-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bendici |url=http://www.damnedct.com/the-melon-heads |title=The Melon Heads |publisher=Damned Connecticut|date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bendici |url=http://www.damnedct.com/the-melon-heads |title=Murder on Melon Head Road? |publisher=Damned Connecticut|date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These legends have been told in overlapping communities were some individuals would tell versions of one legend alongside other individuals who would tell versions of another legend. Over time this overlapping of oral tradition may have allowed the cross-contribution of elements to each other. Some similar legends include:

# [[The Danbury Frog People]] (commonly told in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]/[[Bethel, Connecticut|Bethel]]).
# The Faceless People of Monroe / The House of the Faceless People (commonly told in [[Monroe, Connecticut|Monroe]]).
# [[Mongoloid Village]] (commonly told in the communities of eastern New Haven County like [[North Branford, Connecticut|North Branford]]).

{{History of East Timor}}

The '''Santa Cruz massacre''' (also known as the '''Dili massacre''') was the shooting of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators in the Santa Cruz cemetery in the capital, [[Dili]], on 12 November 1991, during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]] and is part of the [[East Timorese genocide]].

==Background==
In October 1991 a delegation to East Timor consisting of members from the [[Portuguese Parliament]] and twelve journalists was planned during a visit from [[UN Special Rapporteur]] for [[Human Rights]] on [[Torture]], [[Pieter Kooijmans]].&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indonesian Government]] objected to the inclusion in the delegation of [[Jill Jolliffe]], an [[Australia]]n journalist who it regarded as supportive of the [[Fretilin]] independence movement,&lt;ref&gt;Alatas, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ign&gt;Hyland, Tom: [http://www.hamline.edu/apakabar/basisdata/1991/10/28/0003.html "Jakarta 'sabotage Timor visit'"], ''[[The Age]]'', 28 October 1991. Read at ''Hamline University Apakabar Site''. URL Accessed 26 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Portugal]] subsequently cancelled the delegation. The cancellation demoralised independence activists in East Timor, who had hoped to use the visit to raise the international profile of their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, p. 183; Alatas, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Tension between Indonesian authorities and East Timorese youths rose in the days after Portugal's cancellation. On 28 October, Indonesian troops had located a group of resistance members in Dili's Motael Church. A confrontation ensued between pro-integration activists and those in the church; when it was over, one man on each side was dead. Sebastião Gomes, a supporter of independence for East Timor, was taken out of the church and shot by [[Indonesian troops]], and integration activist Afonso Henriques was stabbed and killed during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, pp. 155–156; Pinto, pp. 183–184; Carey, p. 49; Alatas, p. 57. Alatas and Singh do not mention the presence of Indonesian troops at the church. Carey describes Henriques as "a Timorese member of a ''ninja'' (masked killer) unit which had broken into the Motael Church&amp;nbsp; ... to harass the sheltering students". Pinto describes him as "working for Indonesian intelligence".&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreigners who had come to East Timor to observe the Portuguese delegation included independent US journalists [[Amy Goodman]] and [[Allan Nairn]], and British cameraman [[Max Stahl]]. They attended a memorial service for Gomes on 12 November, during which several thousand men, women, and children walked from the Motael Church to the nearby Santa Cruz cemetery. Along the way, members of the group pulled out banners and East Timorese flags.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, p. 50; Jardine, p. 15; Alatas, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers of the protest maintained order during the protest; although it was loud, the crowd was peaceful and orderly, by most accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 146; Carey, p. 50; Singh, p. 157; Alatas, pp. 57–58; Amnesty (1991), p. 1. Alatas describes a peaceful procession "taken over by a small group of agitators", whose provocations included "the display of FRETILIN flags and banners" and "the shouting of anti-integration slogans".&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and most visible demonstration against the Indonesian occupation since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto and Jardine, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The massacre==
During a brief confrontation between Indonesian troops and protesters, some protesters and a major, Geerhan Lantara were stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stahl claimed Lantara had attacked a group of protesters including a girl carrying the flag of East Timor, and FRETILIN activist Constâncio Pinto reported witness accounts of beatings from Indonesian soldiers and police.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiak, W. David. [http://www.nancho.net/fdlap/maxstahl.html "20 Years of Terror: Indonesia in Timor – An Angry Education with Max Stahl"]. ''Kyoto Journal''. 28. Reprinted at [http://www.nancho.net/fdlap/ The Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia-Pacific]. Retrieved on 14 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinto and Jardine, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; When the procession entered the cemetery some continued their protests before the cemetery wall. Around 200 more Indonesian soldiers arrived and advanced on the gathering, weapons drawn. &lt;ref&gt;Carey, p. 50; Pinto and Jardine, p. 191; Anderson, pp. 149–150; Alatas, p. 58; Singh, pp. 157–159. Pinto insisted that "there was no provocation", while Anderson discussed in detail the lack of warning shots. [[Amnesty International]] (1991) confirmed these claims via eyewitness testimony.&lt;/ref&gt; In the graveyard, they opened fire on hundreds of unarmed civilians. At least 250 East Timorese were killed in the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, p. 51; Jardine, p. 16. The Portuguese solidarity group ''[[A Paz é Possível em Timor Leste]]'' compiled [http://www.etan.org/timor/SntaCRUZ.htm a careful survey] of the massacre's victims, listing 271 killed, 278 wounded, and 270 "disappeared".&lt;/ref&gt; One of the dead was a [[New Zealand]]er, [[Kamal Bamadhaj]], a [[political science]] student and [[human rights]] [[activism|activist]] based in Australia. The [[massacre]] was witnessed by the two [[United States|American]] journalists&amp;mdash;[[Amy Goodman]] and [[Allan Nairn]]&amp;mdash;and caught on videotape by [[Max Stahl]], who was filming undercover for [[Yorkshire Television]]. As Stahl filmed the massacre, Goodman and Nairn tried to "serve as a shield for the Timorese" by standing between them and the Indonesian soldiers. The soldiers began beating Goodman, and when Nairn moved to protect her, they beat him with their weapons, fracturing his skull.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Amy and Allan Nairn.[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/28/massacre_the_story_of_east_timor "Massacre: The Story of East Timor"]. 1992. Excerpted at ''[[Democracy Now]]'', 28 January 2008. Retrieved on  February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The camera crew managed to smuggle the video footage to Australia. They gave it to Saskia Kouwenberg, a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] journalist, to prevent it being seized and confiscated by Australian authorities, who subjected the camera crew to a strip-search when they arrived in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], having been tipped off by [[Indonesia]]. The video footage was used in the ''[[First Tuesday (documentary strand)|First Tuesday]]'' documentary ''In Cold Blood: The Massacre of East Timor'',&lt;ref name="1992OverallWinnerITN001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITVProgs/1992/01/07/Y05870109/ | title=FIRST TUESDAY (COLD BLOOD: THE MASSACRE OF EAST TIMOR) | publisher=[[ITN| ITN (Independent Television News)]] | accessdate=9 January 2013 | archivedate=9 January 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DXxSnXp4}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the UK in January 1992, as well as numerous other, more recent documentaries. Stahl's footage, combined with the testimony of Nairn and Goodman and others, caused outrage around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, pp. 16–17; Carey, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The program ''In Cold Blood: The Massacre of East Timor'' was the overall winner at the inaugural [[Amnesty International UK Media Awards]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="1992ReutersInauguration001"&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.library.ohiou.edu/indopubs/1992/06/04/0013.html | title='Cold Blood' AI Winner | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=4 June 1992 | accessdate=9 January 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DXbCGoUv | archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InColdBloodBook 002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constâncio Pinto|author2=Matthew Jardine|title=East Timor's Unfinished Struggle: Inside the Timorese Resistance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdHlt6CSp54C&amp;pg=PA270|year=1997|publisher=[[South End Press]]|isbn=978-0-89608-541-1|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian authorities described the incident as a spontaneous reaction to violence from the protesters or a "misunderstanding".&lt;ref&gt;Brigadier General Warouw in Amnesty (1991), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Objectors cited two factors: the documented history of mass violence committed by Indonesian troops in places such as [[Quelicai]], Lacluta, and Kraras,&lt;ref&gt;Carey, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of statements from politicians and officers in Indonesia, justifying the military's violence. [[Try Sutrisno]], Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian forces, said two days after the massacre: "The army cannot be underestimated. Finally we had to shoot them. Delinquents like these [[agitator]]s must be shot, and they will be."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carey, p. 52. A slightly different wording ("...and we will shoot them") is quoted in Jardine, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|A re-enactment of the Santa Cruz massacre, November 1998.]]

In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese. Although a small network of individuals and groups had been working for human rights and self-determination in East Timor since the occupation began, their activity took on a new urgency after the 1991 massacre.&lt;ref name="JarSol"&gt;Jardine, pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etan.org/etan/default.htm "About ETAN"]. East Timor Action Network. Retrieved on 18 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, [[Japan]], [[Germany]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ireland]], and [[Brazil]].

The television pictures of the massacre were shown worldwide, causing the Indonesian government considerable embarrassment. The coverage was a vivid example of how growth of new media in Indonesia was making it increasingly difficult for the "New Order" to control information flow in and out of Indonesia, and that in the post-[[Cold War]] 1990s, the government was coming under increasing international scrutiny. Copies of the Santa Cruz footage were distributed back into Indonesia allowing more Indonesians to see the actions of their government uncensored.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Vickers (2005), pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt; A number of pro-democracy student groups and their magazines began to openly and critically discuss not just East Timor, but also the "New Order" and the broader history and future of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="JarSol"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIIR, pp. 62–63; Dunn, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Congress]] voted to cut off funding for [[IMET]] training of Indonesian military personnel although arms sales continued from the US to the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name = "ETAN01"&gt;[http://etan.org/timor/uspolicy.htm ETAN: U.S. Policy toward East Timor], [http://etan.org/  East Timor and Indonesia Action Network].&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] cut off all US military ties with the Indonesian military in 1999.&lt;ref name = "ETAN02"&gt;[http://etan.org/news/2002a/05back.htm  ETAN Backgrounder for May 20 Independence], [http://etan.org/  East Timor and Indonesia Action Network].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, the US had resumed training and co-operation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ETAN|title=Senator Leahy on Military Aid to Indonesia and East Timor|url=http://www.etan.org/et2005/november/07/10leahy.htm|publisher=East Timor and Indonesia Action Network|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2012 President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] had increased military financial aid to US$ 1.56 Billion and approved the resumption of direct US military training of Indonesian special forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UPI|title=Indonesia gets $1.56B in U.S. military aid|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/02/13/Indonesia-gets-156B-in-US-military-aid/UPI-39321360767598/|work=World News|publisher=United Press International|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles Times|title=U.S. to resume aid to Kopassus Indonesia's controversial military forces|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/23/world/la-fg-0723-indonesia-obama-20100723|work=LA Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre prompted the [[Portuguese government]] to increase its diplomatic campaign. Portugal unsuccessfully tried to apply pressure by raising the issue with its fellow [[European Union]] members in their dealings with Indonesia. However, other EU countries such as the [[UK]] had close economic relations with Indonesia, including arms sales, and were reluctant to jeopardise these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/countries/indonesia-0604.php CAAT Publications - Arms to Indonesia Factsheet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, there was criticism of the federal government's recognition of [[Jakarta]]'s sovereignty over East Timor. The government had been promoting increased ties with the Indonesian military at the time of the massacre, but in 1999 temporarily cut off military ties in response to the violence after that year's independence referendum.&lt;ref name = "Reuters"&gt;[http://www.etan.org/et2004/november/01-07/04adf.htm "Australia should avoid ties with Indonesia military: Study"]. ''[[Reuters]]''. Retrieved on 16 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian foreign minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], described the killings as "an aberration, not an act of state policy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k9Ro7b0tWz4C&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=%22an%20aberration%2C%20not%20an%20act%20of%20state%20policy%22&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q=%22an%20aberration,%20not%20an%20act%20of%20state%20policy%22&amp;f=false ''The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective''], Robert Gellately, Ben Kiernan, Cambridge University Press, 2003, page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemorated as a [[public holiday]] in now independent East Timor, 12 November is remembered by the East Timorese as one of the bloodiest days in their history, one which drew worldwide attention to their fight for independence.

The '''South Sudanese Civil War''' is an ongoing conflict in [[South Sudan]] between forces of the [[Government of South Sudan|government]] and opposition forces. In December 2013, [[Salva Kiir Mayardit|President Kiir]] accused his former deputy [[Riek Machar]] and ten others of attempting a [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koos|first=Carlo|last2=Gutschke|first2=Thea|date=2014|title=South Sudan's Newest War: When Two Old Men Divide a Nation|url=https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/publication/south-sudan%E2%80%99s-newest-war-when-two-old-men-divide-a-nation|journal=GIGA Focus International Edition|volume=|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=1 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulish"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulish |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/world/africa/new-estimate-sharply-raises-death-toll-in-south-sudan.html |title=New Estimate Sharply Raises Death Toll in South Sudan |publisher=''The New York Times''|date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machar denied trying to start a coup and fled to lead the [[SPLM-IO|SPLM – in opposition]] (SPLM-IO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25427619|title=South Sudan opposition head Riek Machar denies coup bid|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=18 December 2013|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting broke out between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and SPLM-IO, igniting the civil war.

Negotiations were mediated by "[[IGAD]] +" (which includes the eight regional nations called the Intergovernmental Authority on Development as well as the [[African Union]], [[United Nations]], China, the EU, USA, UK and Norway). A peace agreement known as the "Compromise Peace Agreement" was signed in August 2015.&lt;ref name="South Sudan country profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc.com/news/world-africa-14069082|title=South Sudan country profile|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machar returned to Juba in 2016 and was appointed vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36140423|title=South Sudan rebel chief Riek Machar sworn in as vice-president|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=30 April 2016|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a second breakout of fighting within Juba,&lt;ref name=exile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/south-sudan-riek-machar-khartoum-medical-care-160823161508776.html|title=South Sudan's Riek Machar in Khartoum for medical care|publisher=aljazeera|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SPLM-IO fled to the surrounding and previously peaceful Equatoria region.

[[File:South Sudan 022.jpg|thumb|left|A South Sudanese man holding a [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|HK G3]]]]

=== Previous rebellions ===
{{See also|South Sudan Democratic Movement|South Sudan Liberation Army}}
In 2010, after a disputed election, [[George Athor]] led the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement]] in rebellion against the government. The same year, a faction of the South Sudan Democratic Movement, called the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A - Cobra Faction|Cobra Faction]], led by [[David Yau Yau]] rebelled against the government they accused of being prejudiced against the [[Murle people|Murle]]. His faction signed a cease-fire with the government in 2011 and his militia was reintegrated into the army but he then defected again in 2012. After the army's notorious [[Shilluk people#violence|2010 disarmament campaign]] with widespread abuses of the [[Shilluk people]], who were alleging persecution by the ruling [[Dinka]], [[John Uliny]] from the Shilluk people began a rebellion, leading the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction|Upper Nile faction]] of the South Sudan Democratic Movement. [[Gabriel Tang]], who led a militia allied to Khartoum during the Second Sudanese Civil War, clashed regularly with the SPLA until 2011 when his soldiers were reintegrated into the national army. In 2011, [[Peter Gadet]] led a rebellion with the [[South Sudan Liberation Army]], but was reintegrated into the army the same year. In a strategy of co-option known as "big tent", the government often buys off community militia and pardons its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2016/10/12/south-sudans-never-ending-war|title=South Sudan's never ending war.|date=12 October 2016|publisher=Irinnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others call the use of rebellion to receive public office as "bad culture"&lt;ref name=voa2/&gt; and an incentive to rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonreview.net/world/mahmood-mamdani-south-sudan-failed-transition|title=Who's to blame in South Sudan?|date=28 June 2016|publisher=Boston Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== President consolidates power ===

After rumors about a planned coup surfaced in [[Juba]] in late 2012, South Sudanese President [[Salva Kiir]] began reorganizing the senior leadership of his government, party, and military in an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref name="st police" /&gt; In January 2013, Kiir replaced the inspector general of the [[South Sudan Police Service|national police service]] with a lieutenant from the army and dismissed six deputy chiefs of staff and 29 major generals in the army.&lt;ref name="st police"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kiir appoints new head of South Sudan police|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article45272|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=Sudan Tribune|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Kiir retired an additional 117 army generals&lt;ref name="afp generals"&gt;{{cite news|title=South Sudan president retires over 100 army generals|url=http://www.arabnews.com/south-sudan-president-retires-over-100-army-generals|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=Arab News|date=18 February 2013|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was viewed as troublesome in regards to a power grab by others.&lt;ref name="aljazanalysis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis: Struggle for power in South Sudan|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/analysis-struggle-power-south-sudan-20131217845861691.html|author=Musaazi Namiti|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiir had also suggested that his rivals were trying to revive the rifts that had provoked infighting in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="aljaz18dec" /&gt; In July 2013, Kiir dismissed Vice President [[Riek Machar]], one-time leader of the [[Nasir Declaration|Nasir revolt]], along with his entire cabinet.

He cited their failed performance and the expiration of their term limits.&lt;ref name="st structures"&gt;{{cite news|title=S.

== Course of the conflict ==
=== Initial mutiny (2013) ===
[[File:Riek Machar VOA photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Riek Machar]], founder of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition]] ]]

It began on the evening of Sunday, 15 December 2013, at the meeting of the National Liberation Council at [[Juba|Nyakuron]], when opposition leaders Dr. [[Riek Machar]], [[Pagan Amum]] and [[Rebecca Nyandeng]] voted to boycott the meeting.&lt;ref name="southsudannation.com"&gt;{{Citation | title = It wasn’t a coup: Salva Kiir shot himself in the foot | url = http://www.southsudannation.com/it-wasnt-a-coup-salva-kiir-shot-himself-in-the-foot/ | newspaper = South Sudan nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Sudanese ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'' reported clashes breaking out in the Munuki neighbourhood&lt;ref name="start" /&gt; late on 14 December in South Sudan's capital, [[Juba]], between members of the presidential guard.&lt;ref name="aljaz1" /&gt; Kiir also claimed that the fighting began when unidentified uniformed personnel started shooting at a meeting of the SPLM.&lt;ref name="aljazanalysis" /&gt; Former Minister of Higher Education Peter Adwok said that on the evening 15 December after the meeting of the National Liberation Council had failed, Kiir told Major General Marial Ciennoung to disarm his soldiers of the "Tiger Battalion," which he did. Adwok then controversially claims that the officer in charge of the weapons stores, opened them and rearmed only the Dinka soldiers. A Nuer soldier passing by questioned this and a fistfight then ensued between the two and attracted the attention of the "commander and his deputy to the scene." Unable to calm the situation, more soldiers got involved and raided the stores. It culminated in the Nuer soldiers taking control of the military headquarters. The next morning, he says that [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) reinforcements arrived and dislodged the mutineers. He then explained standard procedure:&lt;blockquote&gt;Military doctrine dictates that once a contingent of mutinous troops have been dislodged, appeal is made for their surrender and then disarmed. Those who remained loyal (to the president) are also disarmed to prevent bad blood. The loyal troops of Tiger, hailing mainly from [[Warrap (state)|Warrap]] and [[Aweil, South Sudan|Aweil]], have not been disarmed. In fact, they are the ones rampaging Juba, looting and shooting to kill any Nuer in the residential neighbourhoods."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adwok was then placed on a list of wanted politicians, to which he said "this may be my last contribution, because, as I said, I'm waiting for the police in order to join my colleagues in detention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/peter-adwok-president%E2%80%99s-order-disarm-nuer-guards-caused-mutiny-and-chaos-south-sudan |title=Peter Adwok : 'President's order to disarm Nuer guards caused mutiny and chaos in South Sudan' |publisher=Radio Tamazuj |accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Christmas Day, five days after his controversial publication, Adwok was arrested and held for two days. He was later detained at the Juba airport when attempting to leave the country. His passport was also confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25687502 |title=BBC News – South Sudan: Nyaba tells of Juba 'house arrest' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the international front, the African Union, after the Juba clashes, backed plans for the deployment of troops from regional nations with a strong mandate similar to that of the [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade]] that swiftly defeated the [[March 23 Movement|M23 rebel]]s in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] as UN troops presently within the country have struggled to protect civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36833875|title=South Sudan conflict: African Union approves regional force|date=19 July 2016|publisher=bbcnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the UN [[Security Council]] authorized such a force for Juba.

===Violence against UN and foreign workers===
It has been argued that with increased tension with the UN and outside powers over the government's actions there has been a new shift in violence by the government against foreign peacekeepers, aid workers and diplomats.&lt;ref name=foreignpolicy2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/10/south-sudans-attacks-on-u-n-could-imperil-future-peacekeeping/|title=South Sudan's Attacks on U.N.

Violence has come from the rebel side as well. On 26 August 2014, a UN [[Mi-8]] cargo helicopter was shot down, killing 3 Russian crew members, and wounding another. This occurred 9 days after rebel commander [[Peter Gadet]] threatened to shoot down UN aircraft, which he alleged were transporting government forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/09/09/un-crashed-helicopter-in-south-sudan-shot-down Helicopter that crashed in South Sudan was shot down after rebel commander issued threat] ''Associated Press''. 9 September 2014.

'''Stockholm Pride''' (styled as STHLM Pride) is an annual [[gay pride]] festival held in [[Stockholm]], the capital of [[Sweden]]. Since the start in 1998, Stockholm Pride has grown. In 2014, some 60,000 participated and 600,000 followed the parade at the streets.

The celebrations normally starts with lectures and exhibitions all over the city on the Monday. Pride House is the festival's cultural centre. It is packed with seminars, debates, workshops, exhibitions, film, theatre and other performances.

On the Wednesday it's the grand opening of the closed off Pride Park which is the festival arena for tens of thousands{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} of people, and in the park organisation stalls, stages, restaurants, shops, and other attractions are built. Pride Park is open Wednesday through Sunday and every afternoon and evening a wide variety of famous artists and shows appear on the main stage.

Also outside the official Pride Park, there is a green and leafy area where people join up, drink, listen to the music and party into the warm summer night.

Many people have been out on the streets of Stockholm, enjoying the parade that ends in the park.

In addition to the official Stockholm Pride events, the week is noticeable elsewhere in the city. Many of the gay clubs have their own events and themed nights, one of these is [[Mr Gay Sweden]].

The festival is held in the end of July or beginning of August each year.

In 1998, 2008 and 2018 Stockholm Pride was the host of the [[EuroPride]].

==Dog-tag==
Each year a unique design accessory is create to accompanies the Stockholm Pride festival event. The Dog-tag is chosen through a design competition, alternating internationally renowned names such as [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Efva Attling]], [[Lars Wallin]] and young debutant designer.

'''Synthalin''' was an oral [[anti-diabetic drug]]. Discovered in 1926 it was marketed in Europe by [[Schering AG]] of Berlin as a synthetic drug with [[insulin]]-like properties that could be taken orally. However, it was toxic to the liver and kidney and was withdrawn from the market in the early 1940s.

==History==
The folk remedy [[Galega officinalis|French lilac]] (''Galega officinalis''), was used to treat the symptoms of [[diabetes]], and towards the end of the nineteenth century it was discovered to contain [[guanidine]]. This had an [[hypoglycaemic]] effect but was very toxic to the liver. [[Karl Slotta]] at the Chemistry Institute of the [[University of Vienna]] synthesied derived compounds that had a [[polymethylene]] chain with a guanidine group at each end. These diguanides were less toxic and more potent than guanidine. In 1926, E. Frank, working in [[Oskar Minkowski]]'s clinic in [[University of Wroclaw|Wroclaw]] performed a clinical trial on one of these agents. It was subsequently marketed as Synthalin by Schering AG for treating mild cases of diabetes.

Adverse reports on the toxicity of Synthalin prompted the development of Synthalin B (which had a slightly longer polymethylene chain and was claimed to be safer) and the former product was re-branded Synthalin A. However liver toxicity continued to be a problem, leading to discontinuation in the 1930s, though Synthalin B continued to be used in Germany until the mid-1940s.

===Anti-trypanosome===
After it was discovered{{when|date=June 2016}} that [[Trypanosomatid|trypanosome]]s require a plentiful supply of glucose in order to reproduce, researchers tested Synthalin and related compounds to see if they could be effective treatments. Synthalin was effective, at doses lower than would interfere with blood sugar in the patient.{{cn|date=June 2016}} Further modifications to the chemical structure led to the [[diamidine]] class of drugs, of which [[pentamidine]] is still used against [[trypanosomiasis]]. Pentamidine is also effective against a range of protozoa such as ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'', which causes [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] in [[AIDS]] patients.

The '''Tesco bomb campaign''' was an attempted [[extortion]] against British supermarket chain [[Tesco]] which started in [[Bournemouth]], Dorset, in August 2000 and led to one of the largest and most secretive operations ever undertaken by [[Dorset Police]]. During the campaign, a blackmailer identified by the pseudonym "Sally" sent letters to Tesco stores threatening to harm customers if his demands, for [[Clubcard]]s modified so that the holder could withdraw cash from [[automated teller machine|ATM]]s, were not met.

Several months after the threat first came to light, "Sally" sent out several [[letter bomb]]s, one of which was received and exploded in the face of the householder, causing her shock and minor injuries, while the [[Royal Mail]] intercepted several other packages, which had been held up because insufficient stamps had been put on them. In October 2000, "Sally" threatened to use pipe bombs against Tesco customers and the threat was taken seriously enough that Tesco began the production of the modified [[Clubcard]]s, but were unable to produce the required number before the deadline set by the blackmailer. In November, "Sally" claimed to have placed a [[pipe bomb]] in a garden in the [[Ferndown]] area of Dorset. No bomb was found.

Police eventually mounted a surveillance operation on the postbox to which several of the extortion letters had been traced and identified "Sally" as Robert Edward Dyer. Dyer was arrested in February 2001, over six months since the beginning of the extortion attempt, and charged with several offences, including nine counts of blackmail and one of [[common assault]], of which he was found guilty in May 2001. He was sentenced to 16-years imprisonment on 12 June 2001, later reduced to 12 on appeal. A number of similar extortion attempts against supermarket chains and other businesses and subsequent attacks on Tesco have since been compared to Dyer's campaign by the media.

==Beginnings==
The campaign began in August 2000, when John Purnell, director of security for Tesco, the United Kingdom's largest supermarket chain, was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth, Dorset, who had discovered a copy of an extortion letter left on his shop's photocopier. The letter demanded that Tesco give away [[Clubcard]]s, modified for use in [[Automated teller machine|cash machines]], in the ''[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]]''. Over the following days, [[Dorset Police]] received two other letters, threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met.&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/realcrime/thetescobomberwk32/default.html|title=Real Crime—the Tesco bomber|date=6 August 2009|publisher=[[ITV Network|ITV]]|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele I"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1308835/Tesco-bomb-blackmailer-is-jailed-for-16-years.html|title=Tesco bomb blackmailer is jailed for 16 years|last=Savill|first=Richard|date=12 June 2001|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The police investigation into the campaign, codenamed Operation Hornbill, was one of the most secretive ever undertaken by Dorset Police&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt; and one of the largest in British policing history.&lt;ref name="beeb II"/&gt; After receiving the second letter, which had been damaged by fire, police made enquiries with the [[Royal Mail]] and discovered that a fire had been reported in a postbox on Bradpole Road, Bournemouth, leading to speculation that "Sally"—the alias by which all the letters were signed—had changed his mind and attempted to destroy the letter. They received a third letter on 29 August 2000, in which "Sally" claimed to have prepared [[letter bomb]]s to send to Tesco's customers.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

After receiving the third letter, the police attempted to communicate with "Sally" by covertly taking out a [[classified advert]] in the ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'' to buy more time. After receiving no response in three weeks, the senior investigating officer, [[Detective Superintendent]] Phil James, convened a meeting with other senior officers from across the United Kingdom to assess the threat posed.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

==Bombings==
[[File:Tesco bournemouth.jpg|thumb|A Tesco store in Bournemouth]]
During James' meeting, he was informed that a letter bomb had exploded in a suburb of Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said "There was a knock at the door and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real".&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt; Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries, and a [[bomb disposal]] team from the [[British Army]] was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a [[party popper]] to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope.&lt;ref name="tele I"/&gt; Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them,&lt;ref name="beeb II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stamps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1329223/Bungling-letter-bomber-put-on-too-few-stamps.html|title=Bungling letter bomber put on too few stamps|last=Savill|first=Richard|date=5 May 2001|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

Another threatening letter was sent in October, threatening to attack Tesco customers with [[pipe bomb]]s if the demands were not met. The letter contained a [[cipher]] which allowed the police to communicate with "Sally" in code through cryptic adverts in the ''Bournemouth Daily Echo''. James contacted the editor of the ''Echo'' and the police were allowed to place the messages in the ''Echo'', disguised as [[Mensa International|Mensa]] puzzles and made to look like [[wordsearch]]es.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; By this time, the police had narrowed the focus of their investigation on a square-mile area of Bournemouth and James became convinced that they would find "Sally" through the postbox on Bradpole Road, through which the fire-damaged letter had passed in August. The box was placed under surveillance and, eventually, the October letter was traced back to that box. The footage from the surveillance operation was reviewed, but the image was of poor quality.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

In November 2000, "Sally" lost patience and sent a letter in which he said he would place a pipe bomb in the garden of a Tesco customer if his demands were not met, prompting the police to seriously consider producing the modified Clubcards. They discovered that they could not produce sufficient cards by 12 December, the deadline "Sally" had set. Approximately 100,000 Clubcards, modified for use in ATMs, were eventually produced, but none were distributed.&lt;ref name="beeb II"/&gt; At the end of November, "Sally" sent another letter, telling the police that he had planted a bomb in a garden in the [[Ferndown]] area, giving a [[grid reference]] which included over 500 houses. The claim prompted the mobilisation of hundreds of police officers to the area, but no bomb was found.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

==Arrest==
The police received another letter from "Sally" on 7 December. Once again, the letter was traced back to the Bradpole road postbox, where the surveillance operation had continued. The operation had captured good-quality footage of all the users of the postbox that day, but, as it was close to Christmas, the postbox was busier than normal, with 172 items posted by 38 people. Royal Mail regulations meant that detectives could not open or delay the letters, so they made enquiries with the recipients to identify the senders. They eventually managed to identify all but a small number of the senders.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

On 17 February 2001, over six months after the receipt of the first demand and three months since the last letter from "Sally", the police made a major breakthrough. [[Detective Constable]] Alan Swanton, a junior detective on the case, spotted one of the people caught by the surveillance of the postbox who had yet to be identified. The man was carrying a fuel container, which Swanton believed had come from a nearby filling station. Officers obtained CCTV footage from the filling station, where their suspect had paid by cheque, and identified the man as Robert Edward Dyer.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

Dyer, who, at the time, was a 51-year-old [[widower]] and unsuccessful businessman living with his two teenage daughters, was placed under [[surveillance]].&lt;ref name="beeb II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stamps"/&gt; The surveillance operation did not yield any results, so the police decided to confront Dyer and visited him at his home on 19 February, where they found an extortion note on his computer and cryptic notes in his handwriting. Dyer was arrested and interviewed. The police later intercepted the final letter from "Sally", which surveillance footage showed Dyer posting the day before he was arrested and which was an exact match to the letter found on Dyer's computer. Detective Superintendent James later revealed that Dyer "was an individual in desperate need of money and believing that Tesco was the answer to all his problems."&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

==Conviction==
Dyer was charged and, in May 2001, pleaded guilty on nine counts of [[blackmail]], as well as a sole count of [[common assault]] against Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb. On 12 June 2001, he was sentenced to 16-years imprisonment by a judge at Dorchester Crown Court.&lt;ref name="tele I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4130860.Echo___s_role_in_Dorset_Tesco_bomber_case_on_TV/|title=Echo's role in Dorset Tesco bomber case on TV|last=Reader|first=Jane|date=16 February 2009|work=[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was reduced to 12-years imprisonment on appeal and Dyer was released from prison in 2007.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

During the trial, it emerged that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on the letters and used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, but that he had made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself.&lt;ref&gt;Real Crime: The Tesco Bomber. Perf. Mark Austin. ITV, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5&amp;nbsp;million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the ''Bournemouth Echo''.&lt;ref name="tele I"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The investigation was one of the largest and most secretive that had ever been undertaken by [[Dorset Police]].&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt; The campaign was compared in the media to other similar extortion attempts against Tesco and other British businesses. Dyer got inspiration for the campaign from an article he read about [[Rodney Whitchelo]],&lt;ref name="beeb II"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1383121.stm|title=Tesco blackmail 'bomber' jailed|date=11 June 2001|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who attempted to extort £4 million from [[Heinz|H. J. Heinz Company]] by spiking jars of baby food. Witchelo was sentenced to 17-years imprisonment in 1990. Dyer's campaign was also compared to that of [[Edgar Pearce]], dubbed the "Mardi Gras bomber" by the media. Over three years, Pearce had used bombs in an attempt to extort money from [[Barclays]] Bank and [[Sainsbury's]] supermarkets. He was sentenced to 21-years imprisonment in 1999. Later incidents have also been compared to Dyer's campaign, including another against Tesco in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7209008.stm|title=Supermarkets targeted by hoaxers|date=28 January 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary about the campaign was made in 2009 and broadcast by [[ITV Network|ITV]]. The documentary featured interviews with Neal Butterworth, then-editor of the ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'' and DSI James, the police officer who led the investigation.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

'''''Toma''''' is an American crime drama series that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1973 and 1974.

==Overview==
The series stars [[Tony Musante]] and [[Susan Strasberg]] and was based on the real-life story and published biography of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey, police detective David Toma. Toma had compiled an amazing arrest record during his years on the force, particularly in arresting [[drug dealer]]s.&lt;ref name="newark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A13F9355F107A93C3AB1788D85F478785F9|title=Newark Detective of Many Disguises Gets a Bit Part in TV Film of His Life; Still Wears Disguises|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1973-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His boss, Inspector Spooner, was played by [[Simon Oakland]].

The show ended production after one season, as Musante had only agreed to film one full season, citing a desire not to get trapped into only playing one character over a long period of time.  The network and show runners had initially assumed this to be a negotiating ploy, but Musante held firm and decided not to return.

Although the role was recast with [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], it was soon felt that Blake would be better served with a reworked and rewritten concept;  accordingly, ''Toma'' was overhauled into the 1975 series ''[[Baretta]]''.  Aside from the circumstances of its conception, ''Baretta'' has no on-screen connection with ''Toma'', as the shows have no characters or settings in common.

Many of the people on the ''Toma'' writing staff would go on to write episodes of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', which debuted shortly after ''Toma'''s cancellation.  These writers included [[Stephen J. Cannell]], [[Roy Huggins]] (who signed most of his work on both shows as "John Thomas James"), [[Juanita Bartlett]], Zekial Marko, Don Carlos Dunaway, and Gloryette Clark.  Series stars Musante, Strasberg and Oakland would also guest star on various episodes of ''The Rockford Files''.

==Legacy==

===''Baretta''===
{{main|Baretta}}
Rather than recast the starring role of Toma, the show was retooled as ''Baretta'' starring [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], with violent scenes toned down. ''Baretta'' debuted as a [[mid-season replacement]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in early 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haber|first=Joyce|title=Networks Running Out of Seasons|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1974-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Rockford Files''===
{{main|The Rockford Files}}
According to interviews on ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'' DVD set, a writers strike during the shooting of ''Toma'' is what indirectly led to ''The Rockford Files''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Writer [[Stephen J. Cannell]] and his mentor [[Roy Huggins]] created the character of Jim Rockford as a way to get around an impossible schedule created by the strike.

===Reruns===
Despite having contributed to the development of the popular ''Baretta'', reruns of ''Toma'' were never syndicated to local stations, and repeats of the show on national television post-cancellation have been rare. Repeats of ''Toma'' aired in the late-1970s during ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment|ABC Late Night]]'', and later on [[USA Network]]'s ''Crimebusters'' in 1984-1985. One episode aired on [[TV Land]] in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7365">A '''toxic workplace''' is a workplace that is marked by significant drama and infighting, where personal battles often harm [[productivity]]. Toxic workplaces are often considered the result of toxic employers and/or toxic employees who are motivated by personal gain ([[Power (social and political)|power]], [[money]], [[Celebrity|fame]] or special [[Social status|status]]), use unethical, mean-spirited and sometimes illegal means to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and annoy those around them; and whose motives are to maintain or increase power, money or special status or divert attention away from their performance shortfalls and misdeeds. Toxic workers do not recognize a duty to the organization for which they work or their co-workers in terms of [[ethics]] or [[professional conduct]] toward others. Toxic workers define relationships with co-workers, not by [[organizational structure]] but by co-workers they favour and those they do not like or trust.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, Suzanne (2011) "Toxic Employees: great companies resolve this problem, you can too!" Falmouth, Maine: BCSPublishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite similarly, Harder et al. (2014) define a '''toxic work environment''' as an environment that negatively impacts the viability of an organization. They specify: "It is reasonable to conclude that an organization can be considered toxic if it is ineffective as well as destructive to its employees".

In the [[United States]], the issue of [[workplace bullying]] is getting increasing attention from state governments; twenty-six states have introduced a version of the [[Healthy Workplace Bill]] which provides a definition of this conduct and support for employers to address the behaviour through discipline.&lt;ref&gt;The Healthy Workplace Campaign accessed June 14, 2011 at: http://www.healthyworkplacebill.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by National Occupational Safety and Health found toxic workplace environments a leading cause of workplace violence such as “violent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.” Studies on this issue include verbal violence (threats, verbal abuse, hostility, harassment, and the like) can cause significant psychological trauma and stress, even if no physical injury takes place. Verbal assaults and hostility can also escalate to physical violence.

==Corporate and organizational results==
This phenomenon harms both the company and the other employees, including those who are not direct targets. Co-workers are distracted by drama, [[gossip]] and by choosing sides in the ongoing animosity. This can translate into lost productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bitting, Robert. "Using Effective Leadership Strategies in the Workplace". {{cite web |url=http://www.robertbitting.com/files/articles/Toxic-Employees-in-the-Work-Place.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813050332/http://www.robertbitting.com/files/articles/Toxic-Employees-in-the-Work-Place.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}. Retrieved May 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While employees are [[Distraction|distracted]] by this activity, they cannot devote time and attention to the achievement of business goals. Positively [[Motivation|motivated]] and ethical employees may try to speak up to a toxic employee but this can make them a target (see [[whistleblower]]). Managers of toxic employees can feel intimidated by a toxic employee and try to appease the employee in an effort to avoid confrontation. Over time, positively motivated employees drift away from the workplace and may begin to view management as inept and ineffective. This can result in poor job performance as they begin to feel less valued, therefore less loyal to the company. 

Fellow employees may begin to experience physical symptoms from the [[Occupational stress|stress]] and worry over whether they or someone they care about in the work place may be targeted. This can even develop into a clinical depression requiring treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Andrews and Smith. "Do You Have a Toxic Employee in Your Workplace?" Retrieved May 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and resolution==
[[Intervention (counseling)|Interventions]] to address this negative behaviour in the workplace should be undertaken carefully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/nov2007/ca2007111_532773.htm The Toxic Employee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A four-tiered approach involving fellow employees is suggested by Dr. Gerald Hickson and colleagues at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. This approach starts with an informal intervention, then, if that is not effective, moves on to a true awareness intervention, an authoritarian intervention and finally, [[discipline]].&lt;ref name="SHARP"&gt;SHARP Report, April 2011, Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, "Workplace Bullying and Disruptive Behaviour" accessed at: http://www.lni.wa.gov/safety/research/files/bullying.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When toxic workers leave the workplace, it can improve the culture overall because the remaining staff become more engaged and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Ruth "Is employee turnover always bad?" accessed at: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-turnover-always-bad-11089.html&lt;/ref&gt; Companies who articulate a strong set of cultural values regarding communication, respect and professionalism as well as a [[performance appraisal|performance evaluation]] system that ranks both technical performance and the professional treatment of fellow employees are felt by [[human resources|HR]] professionals to be less [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]].&lt;ref name="SHARP" /&gt;

The '''Uprising of Peter Delyan''' ({{lang-bg|Въстанието на Петър Делян}}, {{lang-el|Επανάσταση του Πέτρου Δελεάνου}}), which took place in 1040–1041, was a major [[Bulgaria]]n rebellion against the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T91k6HAODzAC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=delyan+bulgarian+uprising  A world history of tax rebellions: an encyclopedia of tax rebels, revolts, and riots from antiquity to the present, David F. Burg, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, ISBN 0-415-92498-7, pp. 74–75.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and best-organised attempt to restore the former [[Bulgarian Empire]] until the rebellion of [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of Bulgaria|Petar IV]] in 1185.

==Prerequisites for the uprising==
[[File:DeljanTihomirAndBulgarians.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Peter Delyan, Tihomir and the Bulgarian rebels.]]

After [[Byzantine]] troops conquered [[Bulgaria]] in 1018, [[Basil II]] wisely decided not to change the Bulgarian taxation system in order to placate the population. Although the [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was downgraded to Archbishopric, its head remained an ethnic Bulgarian till Basil II's death in 1025. Under the rule of Emperor [[Romanos III]] the population was forced to pay its taxes in coin rather than in [[Barter|goods-in-kind]], which caused poverty and widespread unrest.

==Initial progress==
In 1040, [[Peter Delyan]], who claimed to be a descendant of [[Samuil of Bulgaria]] escaped from [[Constantinople]] and began roaming throughout the Bulgarian lands, eventually reaching [[Great Morava|Morava]] and [[Belgrade]]. The rebellion broke out in Belgrade, where Delyan was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;М. Psellus, pp. 61, 64&lt;/ref&gt; assuming the name of the sainted Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]]. The Bulgarians moved southwards towards the last political centres of their Empire, [[Ohrid]] and [[Skopje]]. On their way the local population joined them, accepted Peter Delyan for its Emperor and killed every Byzantine they met.&lt;ref&gt;Skуl.-Cеdr. p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time local Bulgarians from the [[Dyrrhachium]] area gathered around the soldier [[Tihomir of Bulgaria|Tihomir]]&lt;ref&gt;Skyl.-Cedr. p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; and headed westwards to reach the old capitals. The existence of two separate rebel camps&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; became an actual threat for the success of the rebellion. Petar Delyan wrote a letter to Tihomir to negotiate for joint actions and made a speech in which, in figurative language, he told the assembled people that as it was not possible for two parrots to the share a bush without discord, so two emperors could not share one country&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; and that they should chose only one leader, either him or Tihomir. He deliberately used the ''parrots'' because the two parrots used to be the coat-of-arms of the [[Comitopuli]] House.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} As he had greater influence than his rival, Delyan was unanimously chosen as leader and Tihomir was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Skyl.-Cedr, pp. 528–529&lt;/ref&gt;

With his enlarged army Petar II advanced to the south, surprised and defeated the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] at [[battle of Salonica (1040)|Thessaloniki]]&lt;ref&gt;М. Аttаlеiаtes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; taking his treasury.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} One of Michael's commanders the Bulgarian [[Manuel Ivats]], probably a son of Samuil's [[boyar]] [[Ivats of Bulgaria|Ivats]]&lt;ref&gt;Златарски, В. ''История на България'', p. 758&lt;/ref&gt; joined Peter II.&lt;ref&gt;Skyl.-Cedr., p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory the Bulgarian troops under the ''[[voivoda]]'' Kavkan captured Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and some forces penetrated deep into [[Thessaly]] eventually reaching [[Corinth]]. [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] were conquered. Another Bulgarian army led by Antim marched deep to the south and defeated the Byzantine commander Alakaseus in the battle of Thebes in [[Boeotia]]. Upon the news of the Bulgarian success the Byzantine population of [[Athens]] and [[Piraeus]] who were uneasy due to the heavy taxes also revolted but were quickly crushed by [[Normans|Norman]] mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Hopf, ''Geschichte Griechenlands im Mittelalter'' (German: ''History of Greece in the Middles Ages'') (Ersch — Gruber, 85), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The decisive actions of the rebels caused serious anxiety in Constantinople where plans for crushing the rebellion were hastily discussed.

==Arrival of Alusian==
[[File:Bulgarian uprising of Peter Delyan (1040-1041).svg|250px|thumb|right|Maximum extent of territory controlled by Peter Delyan]]
Soon the news for the Bulgarian uprising reached [[Armenia]], where the descendents of the last Bulgarian Emperors were deported. The most respected of them was the son of the last Emperor [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], [[Alusian of Bulgaria|Alusian]]. Disguised as a mercenary he reached Constantinople and despite the strict security measures managed to go to Bulgaria in September 1040. The appearance of a new pretendent for the throne meant new tensions among the rebels. In the beginning Alusian did not dare to reveal his origin but tried to find devoted supporters of his kin. He proved his claims with a black spot on his right elbow and soon gathered many adherents.

Petar II Delyan warmly welcomed his cousin although he knew that Alusian might be a potential candidate for the crown. He gave him a 40,000 strong army to seize [[Thessaloniki]] but he failed, having attacked the enemy with a tired army.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The [[battle of Salonica (2nd 1040)|defeat]] cost 15,000 dead and Alusian fled from the battle field leaving his arms and armour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==The treason of Alusian==
[[File:Alusian has Delyan blinded at a banquet.jpg|thumb|250px|Alusian invites Peter Delyan to a banquet and has him blinded. Miniature from the ''[[Skylitzes Chronicle]]''.]]
The heavy defeat sharply worsened the relations between the two leaders: Alusian was ashamed by the defeat and Petar Delyan suspected treason. Alusian decided to act first and plotted against his cousin.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} He invited Delyan to a feast, where his followers served the Emperor many cups of wine. When Petar got drunk on the wine, the conspirators came down on him and pulled out his eyes with a knife. Thus Alusian became the single leader.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In the beginning he undertook active operations but was defeated again and had to flee for his life. Then he secretly negotiated with the Byzantines. After they reached an agreement in the summer of 1041, Alusian pretended to give a decisive battle, but when the two armies met he abandoned his troops and changed sides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Suppression of the uprising==
[[File:The body of Leo V is dragged to the Hippodrome through the Skyla Gate.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Varangian Guard played a major role in the Bulgarian defeat]]
The Byzantine Emperor Michael IV prepared a major campaign to finally defeat the Bulgarians. He gathered an elite army of 40,000 men with capable generals and moved constantly in a battle formation.&lt;ref name="AD 1041"&gt;J. Herrin, ''Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; There were a lot of mercenaries in the Byzantine army including the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Prince and later King [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardråde]] with 500 [[Varangians]]. From Thessaloniki the Byzantines penetrated in Bulgaria and defeated the Bulgarians at [[battle of Ostrovo|Ostrovo]] in the late summer of 1041. It seems that the Varangians had a decisive role in the victory as their chief is hailed in the Norse sagas as the "devastator of Bulgaria". Though blind, Petar Delyan was in command of the army. His fate is unknown; he either perished in the battle or was captured and taken to Constantinople.

Soon the Byzantines eliminated the resistance of Delyan's remaining voivodes, Botko around [[Sofia]] and Manuil Ivats in [[Prilep]], thus ending the Bulgarian revolt.

'''''Vestalia''''' was a Roman religious festival in honor of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the goddess of the hearth and the burning continuation of the sacred fire of Rome. It was held from 7 - 15 June.

Domestic and family life in general were represented by the festival of the goddess of the house and of the spirits of the storechamber - Vesta and the [[Penates]] - on ''Vestalia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mommsen|1894|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of festivities the ''penus Vestae'' (''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'' of the [[temple of Vesta]] which was usually curtained off) was opened, for the only time during the year, at which women offered sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Marouzeau"&gt;{{harvnb|Marouzeau|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the curtain remained open, mothers could come, barefoot and disheveled, to leave offerings to the goddess in exchange for a blessing to them and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brulé|1987|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The animal consecrated to Vesta, the donkey, was crowned with garlands of flowers and bits of bread on 9 June. [[Ovid]] says that donkeys were adorned with necklaces of bread-bits in memory of the myth where Vesta is nearly violated by [[Priapus]]. In that myth, it is the untimely bray of a donkey that startles Priapus causing him to flee. Before that, he says donkeys were honored on 9 June in thanks for the services they provided in the bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littlewood|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' VI. 319-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RW29"&gt;{{harvnb|Fraschetti|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final day (15 June) was Q(uando) S(tercum) D(elatum) F(as) ["when dung may be removed lawfully"] - the ''penus Vestae'' was solemnly closed; the ''Flaminica Dialis'' observed mourning, and the temple was subjected to a purification called ''stercoratio'': the filth was swept from the temple and carried next by the route called ''clivus Capitolinus'' and then into the Tiber.&lt;ref name="Marouzeau"/&gt;

The military ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'' of AD 224 records the first day of ''Vestalia'' as ''Vesta apperit[ur]'' and the last day as ''Vesta cluditur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowerstock|Brown|Grabar|1999|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zvezde Granda''''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: ''Звезде Гранда''; "''Grand Stars''") is a Serbian [[reality television]] music competition organized by the [[Grand Production]] record label to find new singing sensations. The contestants are aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. The show features elements from the international franchises such as [[Idol (franchise)|Idol]] and [[The X Factor]]. It is broadcasting on commercial television throughout the former [[Yugoslavia]], airing primary on [[Prva TV]] in Serbia, previously on [[RTV Pink|Pink TV]], as well as other regional television channels. The competition has so far been held in twelve seasons with the thirteenth season beginning in September.

The show has had fourteen winners so far with various other contestants who have appeared on the show and gained success in the music industry like [[Tanja Savić]], [[Rada Manojlović]], [[Milan Stanković]], [[Milica Pavlović]], [[Aleksandra Prijović]] and many others. Zvezde Granda is arguably the most popular talent show on the [[Balkans]] with high viewership most of the season.

==Concept==
The show starts with a jury consisting of music stars and show's producers, led by the owner of Grand Production, Saša Popović, picking out the contestants in the auditions throughout Serbia and other west Balkan countries. Musical numbers performed by the contestants usually fall in the [[Folk music]], then [[pop music|pop]] and sometimes [[rock music|rock]].

Those picked at the auditions get a chance to showcase their skills by singing in front of the judging panel on televised broadcasts over the next few months. The show is consisted of six rounds, while in each round the number of remaining contestants is reducing. In the first round judges are enabled to see the contestants and are deciding exclusively based on their vocal abilities. Later on contestants are also judged by their stage presence and appearance. Finalists then sing live in big arenas such as the [[Štark Arena|Belgrade Arena]] or [[Zetra Olympic Hall, Sarajevo]] or in the television studio and the results are based on the public vote or the judges. The winners are awarded with record label contract with [[Grand Production]], an album or single and a music video, and material prize in form of a car or an apartment. I the 13th season judges are mentors selecting a team of singers whose assets they believe will allow them to win the competition. Each jury member has a professional team of people from the music industry by their choice helping their contestants with vocal performance and stage appearances.

==Judges==
The production jury, consisted of the show's creator, founder and CEO of [[Grand Production]], Saša Popović and music icon Lepa Brena, can put a contestant through to the next round even without receiving any votes from the judges. Lepa Brena later withdrew from the show and Snežana Đurišić, a folk singer with more than 40 years of career, filled her spot.

The 2013 panel was consisted of folk musicians Šaban Šaulić, dubbed the "King of Folk"; Zorica Brunclik, who has sold 15 million records; Aca Lukas, arguably the most popular Serbian [[pop-folk]] singer, and Dragan Stojković 'Bosanac', famous [[accordion]] player and musician. Ana Bekuta joined the show in the following year, while Brunclik left a year later to join ''Pinkove Zvezde'', also a singing contest. Jelena Karleuša and Marija Šerifović were brought in 2015, due to their popularity and success in pop music. Same year, following the highly viewed argument with Karleuša in one of the episodes, pop-folk star of the 2000s, Viki Miljković, perviously a guest judge, was made a permanent one. Šaulić, for same reasons like Brunclik, left the show in 2016. Since the 11th season there has also been a secret judge, most of the time a well known person from the show business, who's identity is kept secret for other judges and contestants. Former member of the [[metal music|metal]] band [[Generacija 5]], Đrorđe David was signed in 2018 to bring variety as a rock musician. Same year, Lukas left the show due to personal reasons.

==Series overview==
To date, 13 series have been broadcast, as summarised below.&lt;br&gt;
