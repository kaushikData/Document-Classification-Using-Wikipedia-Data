'''Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana''' (''All-India History Reform Project'') is a subsidiary organisation of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), founded in 1978-79 with the stated objective of writing,&lt;ref group=web name="ABISY-home" /&gt;&lt;ref group=news name=TOI /&gt; or rewriting,{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=15}}&lt;ref group=news name="thehindu2006" /&gt; Indian history from a RSS perspective.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=15}}&lt;ref group=web name="ABISY-home" /&gt;&lt;ref group=news name="thehindu2006" /&gt;&lt;ref group=news name=TOI /&gt;

==Ideology==
ABISY is a subsidiary of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), founded in 1978-79 with the stated objective of writing,&lt;ref group=web name="ABISY-home"&gt;[http://itihasabharati.org/ Akhila Bharateeya Itihasa Sankalana Yojana (ABISY), ''Vision and objectives'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=news name=TOI /&gt; or rewriting,{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=15}}&lt;ref group=news name="thehindu2006" /&gt; Indian history from a national perspective.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=15}}&lt;ref group=news name="thehindu2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rewrite history with a positive outlook |newspaper=The Hindu | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rewrite-history-with-a-positive-outlook/article3100514.ece | accessdate=18 Aug 2014 |date=5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Berti|2007}}&lt;ref group=news name=TOI /&gt; The name ABISY means ''"The Plan (also in the sense of committee) for collecting History of the Whole of India"''.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=7}} It was envisioned in 1973 by [[Moropant Pingley]], a ''[[pracharak]]'' of the RSS.{{sfn|Berti|2006}} The main leaders of the organisation have been described as having a [[Hindutva]] ideology, although its participants may have their own reasons for participating, "which may have nothing to do with political ideology."{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=7}}

The organisation holds that India's history was distorted by the [[British Raj]]:&lt;ref group=news name="niti" /&gt; 
{{quote|The British distorted Bharatheeya history; destroyed / perverted the tradition, heroes, culture, literature and language. Hence ABISY coordinates patriotic, bold and incorruptible scholars &amp; historians to write history truthfully on the basis of facts and evidences.&lt;ref group=web name="ABISY-home" /&gt;}}

According to organising secretary Balmukund Pandey, Indian historians have been exposed to western distortions,&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes" /&gt; which created a false impression of Indian cultural diversity, and screened its uniformly [[Aryan]] past.&lt;ref group=news name="niti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niticentral.com/2014/08/24/rss-and-a-new-indian-historical-perspective-236502.html |title=RSS and a new Indian historical perspective |newspaper=NitiCentral |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002441/http://www.niticentral.com/2014/08/24/rss-and-a-new-indian-historical-perspective-236502.html |archivedate=11 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ABISY, beneath the diversity of India's culture is a unifying [[Hindu culture]].{{sfn|Berti|2006|p=17}}{{sfn|Berti|2007}} It regards the Vedic culture to have originated in the Janjati and Adivasis traditions,&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes" /&gt; the local Indian cultures: {{sfn|Berti|2007|p=8}}
{{quote|There is a close link between Vedic traditions and janjati/adivasis traditions – of worshipping river, trees, and nature. They are the ancestors of the ‘civilized people’.&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes" /&gt;}}

ABISY tries to show this link by investigating those local cultures,{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=8}} teaching its participants to write history based on Indian evidence.&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes" /&gt; Berti notes that this kind of "new local historiography"{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=8}} is not unique to Hindutva-writers, but has also appeared in African nationalistic discourse, and that "the political construction and utilisation of folklore was at the very heart of the XIX century’s European nationalisms."{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=9}}

==Activities==

===Research-projects===
In August 2014, the organisation stated that it had completed four research projects, namely retracing the journey of the [[Saraswati river]], countering [[Out of India theory|the theory that Aryans migrated into India]] and instead claiming that Aryans were originally from India who had migrate out of India,{{refn|group=note|ABISY: "Archeological investigations and DNA studies by the scientists have proved that no outsiders came to Bharath in ancient times; In contrary, Indians have immigrated to the entire world and spread their knowledge, culture and contributed for their growth."&lt;ref group=web name="ABISY-miconceptions"&gt;[http://itihasabharati.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101&amp;Itemid=120 ABISY, ''Misconceptions about Aryans'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} dating the [[Mahabharatha]], [[Shankaracharya]] and [[Buddha]], and emphasizing that the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]] was the First War of Independence.&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes" /&gt;

It announced that its next ten-year project would be to compile all Hindu ''[[Purana]]s'' into an encyclopedia, get scholars to interpret its original meaning, and to put it forward as India's real history.&lt;ref group=news name=puranas&gt;{{cite news |title=History according to puranas: RSS's next big project |newspaper=Firstpost |date=18 Aug 2014 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/history-according-puranas-rsss-next-big-project-1669673.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABISY is also going to document the history of all the 670+ districts in India, as describe the history of the more than 600 tribal communities in India.&lt;ref group=news name="IndianExpress" /&gt;

===Methodology===
The ABISY centers its historical work around [[Hindu scriptures]].{{sfn|Berti|2007}} Organising secretary [[Balmukund Pandey]] stated that according to the RSS, the ''[[puranas]]'' were the most significant source of Indian history.&lt;ref group=news name="IndianExpress"&gt;{{cite news|title=6 times more ‘Puranas’ in hand, RSS puts 100 on job for new history|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/6-times-more-puranas-in-hand-rss-puts-100-on-job-for-new-history/|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berti states that ABISY methodology, as exemplified in its interpretation of [[Kullu]] mythology, is to collect orally preserved stories of the gods, or ''bharthā'', which are to be regarded as reliable sources for an understanding of those gods:
{{quote|For ABISY leaders, the bharthā becomes the original source as well as the proof (pramāṇ) of the deity, for the very reason that it is revealed by the deity itself. In this sense, they consider bharthā similar to the Veda which, being revealed knowledge, is supposed to be a discourse of "truth" par excellence.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=24}}}}

ABISY leaders "decipher" those texts, or often just snippets of them, to reveal their similarity with [[:Category:Sanskrit texts|Sanskrit texts]], by focusing on specific words or expressions. This would reveal the Sanskrit identity of the village gods.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=23-24}}

===Publications===
The ABISY publishes the journal ''Itihas Darpan'' (Mirror of History), edited in Delhi. A majority of the articles are written in English, while a few are in [[Hindi]]. The editorial standards of the journal emphasize the urgency of "scientific character" in Indian historical research,{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=14}} with repeated reference to a "scientific"{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=14}} framework, such as "the importance of making reference to sources, and to proving with documents what is put forward.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=14}} Not all local history is deemed worth researching, but only those facts which have a "historical basis" and are in accordance with the organisation's ideology.{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=14}}

==Organisation==
ABISY headquarters are located at Keshav Kunj, the [[Delhi]] office of the RSS.{{sfn|Berti|2007}} Under the central office are thirteen ''ksetra'', or provincial, offices, each run by a president. These centres are responsible for connecting ABISY ideology to local cultural lore and tradition.{{sfn|Berti|2007}} Branches of ABISY exist in [[Chandigarh]], [[Shimla]] and [[Kullu]].{{sfn|Berti|2007|p=12}}

ABISY also has links to historians from multiple universities.&lt;ref group=news name=TOI&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/RSS-man-will-head-historical-research-body/articleshow/37673645.cms|title = RSS man will head historical research body|date = 3 July 2014|work = |accessdate = 11 Aug 2014|newspaper = Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABISY states that it has 500 professors associated with it.&lt;ref group=news name="HindustanTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Among new projects, RSS to focus on studying adivasis traditions |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=21 Aug 2014 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/among-new-projects-rss-to-focus-on-studying-adivasis-traditions/article1-1254754.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Yellapragada Sudershan Rao]], the head of the [[Andhra Pradesh]] chapter of ABISY, was appointed Chairperson of the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]] (ICHR) by the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] government headed by [[Narendra Modi]].&lt;ref group=news name=TOI /&gt;&lt;ref group=news name="Firstpost"&gt;{{cite news | last=Iyer |first=Kavitha | title=Coming soon from Modi sarkar: RSS takeover of top research, cultural bodies |newspaper=Firstpost |date=3 Jul 2014 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/righting-india-modi-will-post-rss-men-lead-top-research-cultural-bodies-1602761.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, three other ABISY-affiliated historians were nominated as members to the Council:&lt;ref group=news&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">The '''Asian Physics Olympiad''' (APhO) is an annual [[physics]] competition for [[high school]] students from [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]] regions. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s. The first APhO was hosted by [[Indonesia]] in 2000. The next Asian Physics Olympiad (2019) will be held in [[Australia]].

APhO has its origins in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] and is conducted according to similar statutes (One five-hour theoretical examination and one or two laboratory examinations). It is usually held about two months before the IPhO and can also be seen as additional training for the teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apho.ias-ntu.org/history_sub.html APhO history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each national delegation is made up of eight competitors (unlike five in the IPhO) plus two leaders. Observers may also accompany a national team. The leaders are involved in the selection, preparation and translation of the exam tasks, and the translation and marking of exam papers. The students compete as individuals, and must sit through intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded a medal (gold, silver or bronze) or an honorable mention.

== History ==
In 1999, the team leader of Indonesia, Prof. [[Yohanes Surya]], Ph.D., together with the president of IPhO, Prof.[[Waldemar Gorzkowski]], undertook to create and organize the first APhO, which was held in Indonesia, between April 24 and May 2, 2000. At this time, prof. Gorzkowski was also working in Indonesia to help with the IPhO team. The event attracted participants from 12 Asian countries. It now is attended by up to 27 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Actively participating countries include [[Australia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong|China Hong Kong SAR]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Macau]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. [[Russia]] and [[Romania]] have participated as guest teams&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apho.ias-ntu.org/Statistic_Participant_Countries.pdf|title=Statistics of Participant Countries of APhO|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the past years.

== Differences between APhO and IPhO ==
APhO has 8 students in each delegation, while IPhO has 5.

=== The award system ===
In 2001, the IPhO International Board accepted a new system of awarding the prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jyu.fi/kastdk/olympiads/minutes2001.html Minutes of the Meetings of the International Board during the XXXII International Physics Olympiad in Antalya (Turkey) June 28 – July 6, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The new system, designed by [[Cyril Isenberg]] and Dr. Gunter Lind was based on relative number of contestants for each type of award, instead of the score boundaries defined by percentage of the best contestant's score.

This was not acceptable for APhO, because the average level of contestants is different. The old system remained in power for APhO since the beginning up to [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mps.org.mn/apho-2008/index.php 9th APhO in Mongolia], where the leaders voted for replacing it by a new award system suggested by Dr. Eli Raz from the Israeli delegation. The new system, sometimes unofficially referred to as the '''Israeli Award System''', is based on a reference score that is the lowest between twice the [[median]] score and the mean score of the top 3 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutes of the Asian Physics Olympiad |url=https://apho.ias-ntu.org/statutes.html |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used on [http://mpec.sc.mahidol.ac.th/apho10/ 10th APhO in Thailand].

'''Institut Pertanian Bogor''' ('''IPB''' or '''Bogor Agricultural University''') is a state-run agricultural university based in the city of [[Bogor]], [[Indonesia]].

The institute began as an agricultural school formed by the Dutch colonial regime in the early 20th century. After independence it was part of the [[Universitas Indonesia]] before becoming an independent institute on September 1, 1963.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-embrional-step History of IPB Embryonal Step (1941-1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Growth phase"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/history-of-ipb-growth-phase History of IPB Growth phase].&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Dr. Ir. Herry Suhardiyanto, M.Sc. serves as its director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/about/rectors-of-ipb History of IPB - Rectors] retrieved September 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016646.jpg|thumb|The Middelbare Landbouwschool Buitenzorg in the 1920s]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nederlands-Indische Veeartsenschool Buitenzorg TMnr 60016929.jpg|thumb|The Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool in the 1920s]]
The first school in Bogor was established in 1876 under [[Rudolph Scheffer]], under the name ''landbouwschool te Buitenzorg'' (agriculture school).&lt;ref name="Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaalherbarium.nl/FMCollectors/S/SchefferRHCC.htm|title=Scheffer, Rudolph Herman Christiaan Carel|publisher=[[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New schools for different fields were opened in the following years for Native Indonesians. The institute started in the early 20th century as a veterinary medicine and agricultural school.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step"/&gt; Before World War II, the institutions were known as Middelbare Landbouwschool (secondary agricultural school), Middelbare Bosbouwschool (secondary forestry school) dan Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool (veterinary school).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|H. J. Lovink's]] appointment as department director of agricultural education in 1910 marked a curriculum shift toward training for the government and private sides of colonial agribusiness, including basic biology classes augmented with practical education about cultivation techniques and technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Floracrats: State-Sponsored Science and the Failure of the Enlightenment in Indonesia|last=Goss|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-299-24864-2|location=United States of America|pages=92|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Hermanus_Johannes_Lovink|Lovink]] argued that department officials in the Ministry of Agriculture "needed to familiarize themselves with Javanese farming practices."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1940, the Dutch government founded an Institution of Agricultural Higher Education in Bogor with the name Landbouw Hogeschool, which later on 31 October 1941 was called Landbouwkundige Faculteit (Agronomy Faculty). However, the school was closed down during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945). The Nederlandsch Indische Veeartsenschool remained in operation, but its name was changed to Bogōru jūigakkō (ボゴール獣医学校) (Bogor Veterinary School).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

Sometime after the declaration of independence in 1946, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the new Republic of Indonesia upgraded the Veterinary School in Bogor to the College of Veterinary Medicine (PTKH).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

The Netherlands returned to Indonesia and retook control of the institution in 1947, thus Landbouwkundige Faculteit was reopened as the Faculteit Voor Landbouw-Wetenschappen, which had majors in Agriculture and Forestry. In 1948 the PTKH or College of Veterinary Medicine was changed to Faculteit voor Diergeneeskunde under Universiteit van Indonesië (later the [[University of Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt; 
 
After Indonesia gained its independence in 1950, Landbouw-wetenschappen became the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Indonesia, with three departments — Socio-Economics, Physical Sciences, and Forestry. In 1957 the Department of Land Fishery was formed. Meanwhile, Faculteit voor Dieergeneeskunde became the Faculty of Veterinary Medicines and Animal Husbandry.&lt;ref name="Embryonal step" /&gt;

IPB was founded on September 1, 1963 by the decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education No. 92/1963 and was approved by President [[Sukarno]]'s decree No. 279/1965.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt; At the time, the two faculties of University of Indonesia which is in Bogor were separated into an independent institution. The new university (IPB) has five faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Fisheries, Animal Science, and Forestry. In 1964 the Faculty of Technology and Mechanization of Agriculture was added.&lt;ref name="Growth phase" /&gt;

===Recent events===
On December 26, 2000 the Indonesia government changed IPB's autonomy status to a state-owned university.

In 2005, IPB applied the [[Minor (academic)|minor]] and [[Major (academic)|major]] system instead of the national curriculum system.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate"&gt;[http://ipb.ac.id/index.php/education/undergraduate IPB Undergraduate system].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.ipb.ac.id/handle/123456789/12503 IPB Undergraduate system evaluation].&lt;/ref&gt; This allow IPB students to take more than one department field.&lt;ref name="IPB Undergraduate" /&gt;

The '''Broad Left''' was a political faction within the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students of the United Kingdom]] (NUS) during the 1970s. It consisted of a working relationship between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]], the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), and other, non-aligned, supporters in order to work as a single voting bloc against the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and some [[Trotskyist]] student groups. It held the union presidency from 1973 to 1982.

The Broad Left movement should not be confused with the [[Student Broad Left]] movement, also an NUS faction.

==Notable members==
Those elected to the NUS executive on the Broad Left ticket include the following:

The minister with overall responsibility for the department was the Minister for Employment and Learning.  The department was initially known as the '''Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment''' ('''DHFETE'''), between 1999 and 2001.

Following the [[Fresh Start Agreement]], DEL was dissolved and its functions transferred to the [[Department for the Economy]] and [[Department for Communities]], in order to reduce the size of the Northern Ireland Executive.

==Aim==
DEL's overall aim was to "promote learning and skills, to prepare people for work and to support the economy".&lt;ref&gt;Northern Ireland Budget 2011–15, page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==

The department's network of 'job centres' and 'jobs and benefits offices' advertised job opportunities for Northern Ireland residents.  It was also responsible for policy in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/about-the-dept.htm DEL: About the Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419003354/http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/about-the-dept.htm |date=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DEL's main counterparts in the [[United Kingdom Government]] were:
* the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (including employment relations); and&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/about BIS: About BIS]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (on general employment policy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwp.gov.uk/about-dwp/ministers/ DWP: About DWP]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Irish Government]], its main counterparts were:

==History==
Following a [[Northern Irish Belfast Agreement referendum, 1998|referendum]] on the [[Belfast Agreement]] on 23 May 1998 and the granting of [[royal assent]] to the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] on 19 November 1998, a [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]] were established by the [[United Kingdom Government]] under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. The process was known as [[devolution]] and was set up to return devolved legislative powers to Northern Ireland. DEL is one of five new devolved Northern Ireland departments created in December 1999 by the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and [[The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999]].

The department was named the '''Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment''' until 20 July 2001 but was changed to its current title as the initials DHEFETE were pronounced as "Defeat".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/northernireland/acts/acts2001/pdf/nia_20010015_en.pdf Department for Employment and Learning Act (Northern Ireland) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A devolved minister first took office on 2 December 1999.  Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] ministers from the [[Northern Ireland Office]]:
* between 12 February 2000&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Commencement) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 May 2000;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 11 August 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 22 September 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* between 15 October 2002&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and 8 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 8 May 2007, devolution has operated without interruption.  The Independent Review of Economic Policy, which reported in September 2009, recommended a single economic policy department within the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], which would result in the abolition of DEL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review of Economic Policy|url=http://www.irep.org.uk/publications.html|publisher=Independent Review of Economic Policy (Northern Ireland)|accessdate=29 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007102103/http://www.irep.org.uk/publications.html|archivedate=7 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2012, the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]], [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] and [[Martin McGuinness]] respectively, announced their intention to abolish the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice 2012 – Stormont Castle proposals|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-10112-justice-2012-stormont.htm|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=11 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423113009/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-10112-justice-2012-stormont.htm|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department's functions would be "divided principally" between the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]] and the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] "in an agreed manner".
The proposal was resisted by the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford says cutting Department for Employment and Learning could damage economy|url=http://allianceparty.org/article/2012/006237/ford-says-cutting-department-for-employment-and-learning-could-damage-economy|publisher=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which viewed it as "power grab" by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Sinn Féin]], but was approved on 18 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice 2012 – The Way Forward|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-180112-justice-2012-the.htm|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=18 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423112958/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-releases-archive-ofmdfm-jan-2012/news-ofmdfm-180112-justice-2012-the.htm|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; No timescale for the abolition was outlined and the department remained in operation, as of February 2015.

==Test phase==

The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]]. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the [[Araucanía Region]], (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite book

==First phase==

From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, [[computer]]s, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web

==Future plans==

In 2007,  the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.

Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are [[electronic whiteboard]]s for [[math]], palm pilots or pocket PCs for [[physics]], and projectors for teaching sciences.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web

The [[science]] program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI ([[hypothesis]], [[experimentation]], [[Education|instruction]]) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for [[chemistry]], and animals for dissection for [[biology]]) that many schools in Chile face.

===Adult Education===

Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through [[adult education]]. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a [[word processor]], how to use the [[internet]], and how to create and use an [[email]] account.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt;

'''Family Educational Services Foundation''' (FESF) is a non-profit, educational organization based [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It is working in Pakistan since 1984.  FESF provides educational services, with particular focus on Deaf children and youth. FESF is registered as a non-profit organization with the SECP and is tax exempt.

The organization’s main projects are:
* Deaf Reach Program  
* Move Program
* Eduserve Training Program  
* Community Services Program

== Projects ==

=== Deaf Reach Program ===
Upwards of nine million people in [[Pakistan]] (5% of pop.) have some form of hearing loss. Of this group, there are approximately 1.5 million profoundly deaf children of school age – the majority of whom suffer from no educational opportunities. 
The Deaf Reach Program was established in Pakistan in 1998, initially working informally with deaf youth and young adults.  The first Deaf Reach School  was established by FESF in [[Karachi]] in 2005, and the program has grown rapidly to where there are now seven Deaf Reach Schools and Training Centers located in [[Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Nawabshah]], and [[Lahore]], with a new large campus in [[Rashidabad, Sindh|Rashidabad]], [[Tando Allahyar]].&lt;ref name="Deaf Reach Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaf Reach Program|url=http://www.fesf.org.pk/projects/deaf-reach-program|publisher=Family Educational Services Foundation|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These schools are providing free education and training to over 1,200 deaf children and young adults from low-income families in both urban and rural areas. There is an important focus on girls attending school, with a  female enrollment of 48%.

Deaf Reach is the only school for the Deaf in Pakistan that has a branch network, providing educational opportunities in rural areas. Training is also provided for all parents and families in learning how to communicate and care for their children. There is also an active Financial Inclusion program for deaf young adults with training in marketable skills leading to employment and financial independence.&lt;ref name="Special Education Directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Education Directory|url=http://directory.nowpdp.org/?q=directory/special-education-private/family-educational-services-foundation|publisher=nowpdp|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, FESF launched a Pakistan Sign Language (PSL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psl.org.pk&lt;/ref&gt; lexicon referencing 5,000 words. The PSL Lexicon received the 2014 P@SHA Award in e-Inclusion &amp; e-Community category.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/791888/diversity-praised-at-psha-ict-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivated Volunteer Empowerment Program===
The Motivated Volunteer Empowerment (MOVE) Program is aimed at high school and university students but is also effective as a training program. The training courses are organized and implemented by Family Educational Services Foundation (FESF).&lt;ref name="MOVE Program"&gt;{{cite web |title=MOVE Program |url=http://www.fesf.org.pk/projects/move |publisher=Family Educational Services Foundation |accessdate=11 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705084109/http://www.fesf.org.pk/projects/move |archivedate=5 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MOVE program is an educational development resource, which focuses on leadership, soft skills and volunteerism. The program meets the need for developing committed volunteers and engaging youth voice in solving social problems.

The six training sessions are followed by two project planning workshops. At least one community development project is carried out by participants from each MOVE program. Theoretical training along with practical experience is a vital ingredient of MOVE. To this effect, FESF coordinates field implementation projects for the students in partnership with local institutions around the country. Many of the MOVE graduates have gone on to be actively involved in their community with some initiating and sustaining highly effective volunteer projects on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="MOVE Program" /&gt;

=== Community Services ===
A few programs that are regularly organized are:
# A yearly Summer Camp for deaf and orphan children
# An annual Children's Benefit Concert for approx. 5,000 handicapped and underprivileged children.
# Uplift programs in hospitals
# Extra-curricular classes and events for less privileged children
# Regular book drives and creation of libraries in needy schools and institutes
All of these programs are achieved with the help of volunteers.

==== Master Trainer Program ====
FESF, in collaboration with [[NOWPDP]]&lt;ref name="NOWPDP Collabration"&gt;{{cite web|title=NOWPDP - Catalysing opportunities for people with disabilities|url=http://www.nowpdp.org/|publisher=NOWPDP|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a master trainer program in Jan. 2010, "Instructing and Guiding Children with Special Education Needs." The program objective is capacity building for teachers who impart special education in government and private schools countrywide. 10 master trainers were developed who went on to conduct courses for 226 teachers from 25 different institutes in Karachi and Islamabad.

====Funding and support====
Family Educational Services Foundation is exempt from taxation under the Pakistan law. FESF receives the majority of its funding via donations and sponsorship from individuals, businessmen, corporate sponsorship and foundations.

Interested in the ways in which moving-image-based technologies (film, video) are able of inaugurating and establishing new forms of relationship across human and nonhuman animals, her research focuses on the intersection of art history, eco-activisms and film studies, with a particular emphasis on animal presences in artists' cinema. At the same time she is interested in the way the cinema and the zoo look at one another and shape each other as cinematic entities and spaces. In 2017 she held a public conversation at [[Tate Modern]] with [[Donna Haraway]] and Fabrizio Terranova on the occasion of the London film premiere of ''Storytelling for Earthly Survival'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/film/donna-haraway-story-telling-earthly-survival|title=Fabrizio Terranova: Donna Haraway: Story Telling for Earthly Survival – Film at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 she was in conversation with writer and poet [[Eileen Myles]], discussing animals, companionship and loss on occasion of their book ''Afterglow (A Dog's Memoir)''. With Serpentine Galleries' public programmes curator Lucia Pietroiusti, she initiated the research project "The Shape of a Circle in the Mind of a Fish", whose first symposium was held at the London Zoo in May 2018, featuring [[Diana Reiss]], [[Ted Chiang]], ''[[Superflex|Superflex's]]'' Rasmus Nielsen and [[Peter Gabriel]]. It also featured the performance ''Sleep Walkers/Zoo Pieces'' by [[Simone Forti]], interpreted by long-time collaborator Claire Filmon, and the screening of Michela di Mattei's videos.

She maintains a keen interest as well as an advocacy position in supporting the efforts to acknowledge the rights and welfare of non-human animals, in diffusing pro-animal sensibilities as well as in promoting ethic and humane knowledge advance in animal studies.

'''The Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music''' ({{lang-hu|Liszt Ferenc Zeneművészeti Egyetem}}, often abbreviated as ''Zeneakadémia'', "Music Academy") is a concert hall and music conservatory in [[Budapest]], Hungary, founded on November 14, 1875. It is home to the [[Liszt Collection]], which features several valuable books and manuscripts donated by [[Franz Liszt]] upon his death, and the [[AVISO studio]], a collaboration between the governments of Hungary and Japan to provide sound recording equipment and training for students. The Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music was founded by Franz Liszt himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/the-university |title=About the University |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=lfze.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though named after its founder only in 1925, approx. 50 years after it was relocated to its current location at the heart of Budapest). Between 1877-1879 the Academy moved into its present building, a masterpiece of art Neo-Renaissance architecture.

==Facilities==

The Academy was originally called the "Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music" and it was also called "College of Music" from 1919-1925. It was then named after its founder [[Franz Liszt]] in 1925. It was founded in Liszt's home, and relocated to a three-story [[Neo-Renaissance]] building designed by [[Adolf Lang|Adolf Láng]] and built on today's [[Andrássy út|Andrássy Avenue]] between 1877 and 1879. That location is referred to as "the old Music Academy" and commemorated by a 1934 plaque made by [[Zoltán Farkas (architect)|Zoltán Farkas]]. It was repurchased by the academy in the 1980s, and is now officially known as "the Ferenc Liszt Memorial and Research Center." 

Replacing "the old Music Academy", the Academy moved into a building erected in 1907 at the corner of Király Street and Ferenc Liszt Square. It serves as a centre for higher education, music training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franz Liszt Academy of Music|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/hungary/budapest/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154673108199|accessdate=2008-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612213057/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/hungary/budapest/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154673108199|archivedate=2008-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concert hall. The [[Art Nouveau]] style building is one of the most well known in Budapest. It was designed by [[Flóris Korb]] and [[Kálmán Giergl]] at the request of Baron [[Gyula Wlassics]], who was the Minister of Culture at that time. The [[façade]] is dominated by a statue of Liszt (sculpted by [[Alajos Stróbl]]). The inside of the building is decorated with frescoes, [[Zsolnay]] ceramics, and several statues (among them that of [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]]). Originally the building also had [[stained glass]] windows, made by [[Miksa Róth]].

Other facilities used by the Academy are the Budapest Teacher Training College, located in the former National Music School on Semmelweis Street, a secondary school (Béla Bartók Secondary Grammar and Technical School of Music), and a student dormitory.

Ever since its foundation, the Academy has been the most prestigious music university operating in Hungary. A major development in its history was the recent establishment of a new, independent Folk Music Faculty. The Franz Liszt Academy of Music is as much a living monument to Hungary's continued musical life, as it is to the country's musical past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Franz Liszt Academy of Music |title=Budapest Corner |url=http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/news/universities-in-budapest/381-franz-liszt-academy-of-music-budapest |accessdate=2010-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its president (rector) is [[András Batta]].

'''Giacomo Gotifredo Ferrari''' (baptised 2 April 1763 – 2 December 1842)&lt;ref&gt;Di Marco (1996) and Slonimsky and Kuhn (2001) give only the date of baptism. A memorial plaque in Rovereto, Ferrari's birthplace, gives his year of birth as 1763 (see [[:File:Lapide Storiche Rovereto Gotifredo Ferrari.JPG|Lapide Storiche Rovereto, Gotifredo Ferrari]]). Two older sources, Gehring (1900) p. 513 and Saint-Foix (1939) p. 455, give the unlikely year of birth as 1759.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Rovereto]] in the Italian Alps, and was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[composer]] and singing teacher who spent most of his career in France and England.

'''GSAW''', the Ground System Architectures Workshop, provides a forum for the world’s space-related ground system experts to collaborate with other ground system users, developers, and researchers through tutorials, presentations, working groups, panel discussions, and new for this year, technical exhibits.

The capabilities of satellites, sensors, and computer systems have been growing at a phenomenal rate. With that growth comes a corresponding growth in data, complexity, and threats. This creates challenges in mission data and telemetry processing; predicting system behaviors; and operating securely. This year’s theme, “Creating Smarter Ground Systems,” spans the entire ground system life-cycle. The use of autonomy, intelligent/cognitive systems, and machine learning are some approaches to efficiently exploiting data, predicting and preventing anomalies, detecting intrusion, and optimizing performance.Innovative development processes, architectures, and acquisition strategies can lead to smarter systems. Come share your ideas, emerging technologies, lessons learned, and roadmaps to achieving the goal of a smarter enterprise. 

==Event Details==
GSAW 2019 will be held at the Renaissance Los Angeles Airport Hotel Feb. 25-28, 2019.  Monday, Feb. 25 will be tutorial day.  Tuesday through Thursday, Feb. 26-28, the general workshop will be held.  Thursday afternoon, Feb.28, the classified session will be held at The Aerospace Corporation. [http://gsaw.org/cfp/ Select] to download Call for Participation flyer.

==Beginnings==
In the mid-1990s, a small group of ground system architects and researchers at [[The Aerospace Corporation]] envisioned a series of annual workshops to help ground system planners transition to common consensus-based open system architectures. To realize this vision, Aerospace began working with the [[University of Southern California]]'s Center for Software Engineering (USC-CSE), which was pursuing a project on complex software design cosponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] and [[U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory]].

The workshop became a reality in February, 1997, when Aerospace and the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) cosponsored the first Ground System Architectures Workshop (GSAW) held at the Aerospace campus in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], California, USA. More than 200 participants met for three days of plenary presentations, panel discussions, and a keynote address by the SMC commander. That first GSAW focused on the role of software architectures in spacecraft ground system standardization, implementation (using commercial products, [[middleware]], and frameworks), and interoperability.

Since 1997, the Ground System Architectures Workshop (GSAW) has served as the premier forum for spacecraft ground system experts from around the world.

== GSAW Cooperating Organizations ==
GSAW is sponsored by The Aerospace Corporation in cooperation with:
* United States Air Force Space Command
* United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center
* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center
* NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology

'''Henriette Goldschmidt''' (1825-1920) was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] [[Feminism in Germany|feminist]], [[pedagogist]] and [[social worker]]. She was one of the founders of the [[German Association of Female Citizens|German Women's Association]] ({{lang-de|Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein}}) and worked to improve women's rights to access education and employment. As part of that effort, she founded the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare ({{lang-de|Verein fuer Familienerziehung und Volkswohl}}) and the first school offering higher education to women in [[Germany]].

==Early life==
Henriette Benas was born on 23 November 1825 in [[Krotoszyn|Krotoschin]], [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], to Eva (née Laski) and the Jewish merchant, Levin Benas. Her mother died when she was five years old and her father remarried an illiterate woman who was not a nurturing maternal figure. Benas completed school at the Higher School for Girls ({{lang-de|Höhere Töchterschule}}) at age 14,{{sfn|Berger|1995}} but her education was limited to subjects which taught women how to be effective housewives.{{sfn|Doff|2005|pp=6-7}} She supplemented her meager education by reading German classics and the newspaper, ''Breslauer Zeitung'', which aroused her early interest in politics.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} In 1853 Benas married her cousin, Abraham Meir Goldschmidt, a widower with three sons, who was the [[rabbi]] of the [[Warsaw]] German-Jewish congregation. Five years later, her husband was appointed to succeed [[Adolf Jellinek]] as rabbi of [[Leipzig]] and the family relocated.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}}

==Activism==
[[File:Henriette Goldschmidt 1859.jpg|thumb|left|Henriette Goldschmidt, circa 1859]]
Goldschmidt equated the move to the university town of Leipzig with an awakening to freedom and humanitarian spirit. She quickly became involved in the German-Jewish community{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} and was exposed to the ideas of [[Friedrich Fröbel]], founder of the early-childhood [[kindergarten]] education system. Encouraged by her husband to pursue her interests in education, Goldschmidt studied history, literature, pedagogy and philosophy on her own.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} In 1865, she, [[Louise Otto-Peters]] and [[Auguste Schmidt]] organized a conference of German women and founded the [[German Association of Female Citizens|German Women's Association]] ({{lang-de|Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein}}) to work towards improving the lives of women. Goldschmidt had initially been hesitant about becoming a board member of the group, as the legal statutes at that time forbade women voting in volunteer organizations, but with her husband's encouragement, she became an active member. Between 1867 and 1906, she served as a member of the board and presented many lectures for the organization.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}}

In 1867, Goldschmidt organized petition drives for submission to the [[Reichstag (North German Confederation)|Reichstag]] in support of women's rights to access education and employment and she was a signatory to the petition to protect [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]].{{sfn|Spear|2008}} She also proposed that women be participants in their communities, because women would lend a sensitivity to dealing with culturally divisive issues. The following year, she proposed a mandatory social service initiative requiring women to serve for a year in social work.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} In 1871, Goldschmidt founded the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare ({{lang-de|Verein fuer Familienerziehung und Volkswohl}}),{{sfn|Spear|2008}} with the goal of training kindergarten teachers in the Fröbel method. She served as president of the organization for over four decades. By the following year, the organization was sponsoring teaching seminars to a growing number of adherents{{sfn|Berger|1995}} and had opened a public kindergarten.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} By 1878, she organized the High School for Ladies ({{lang-de|Lyzeum für Damen}}), where professors from the [[University of Leipzig]] gave lectures to students. Because women were barred from attending college, and only a few private schools offered inferior education, the lectures were attended by hundreds of women and offered them the chance for not only an education, but employment as a teacher.{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}}

[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1883) 721.jpg|thumb|1883 leaders of the German feminist movement]]
In 1889, the Jewish community sponsored a donation drive and purchased a house for the organization's operations. It was located at 16 Weststraße (later named Friedrich-Ebert-Straße) and became not only Golschmidt's home after her husband's death, but the center of women's education, sponsoring educational courses and lectures, as well as cultural and social events. Members of the association were also allowed to reside in the house and both the writer {{Interlanguage link multi|Josephine Siebe|de}} and educator Anna Zabel were known to have lived there.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} In 1898 Goldschmidt and Auguste Schmidt, on behalf of the German Women's Association prepared a petition to establish the Fröbel educational method as the official municipal and state educational system. The petition asked for kindergartens to come under state standardization and supervision, with mandatory attendance for all children. They were met with waves of opposition from those who saw forced education as supplanting familial rights to children's upbringing and accused the women of trying to destroy the family. There were also opponents who saw the measure as forcing children of different social classes to mix.{{sfn|Berger|1995}} Though Goldschmidt defended the plan, publishing a response to her critics ''Ist der Kindergarten eine Erziehungs- oder Zwangsanstalt?'' (Is kindergarten an educational institution or forced?) in 1901,{{sfn|Goldschmidt|1901}} it was ultimately defeated.{{sfn|Berger|1995}}

Goldschmidt did not give up and continued writing and giving speeches on the need for kindergartens and women's education.{{sfn|Berger|1995}} In 1906, women were finally admitted to university study in Germany,{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} but the coursework did not prepare women to meet their societal obligations, as Goldschmidt believed that the natural calling of woman was to transform society through their cultural involvement.{{sfn|Berger|1995}} She strove to fill a gap and not compete with university studies{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} and in 1911, Goldschmidt achieved the high point of her career, with the establishment of the first institution in Germany offering higher education specifically to women.{{sfn|Spear|2008}} The {{Interlanguage link multi|Leipzig College for Women|de|3=Hochschule für Frauen zu Leipzig}} ({{lang-de|Hochschule für Frauen zu Leipzig}}) designed its classes for women{{sfn|Fassmann|2009}} as a means of formalizing Goldschmidt's vision of womanhood. It aimed to teach women to participate in the intellectual life of their culture, prepare them to be successful mothers and teachers, and to develop a sensitivity to the needs of their community and the skills to perform charitable works to help their community.{{sfn|Berger|1995}} Once again, she utilized professors from the University of Leipzig, to supplement the coursework, but Goldschmidt and {{Interlanguage link multi|Agnes Gosche|de}} taught classes between 1911 and 1913.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} After the 1916-1917 term, Goldschmidt retired and turned the operation of the school over to the Saxon Ministry of Worship and Public Instruction.{{sfn|Berger|1995}} Goldschmidt died on 30 January 1920 in Leipzig, [[Weimar Republic]]{{sfn|Berger|1995}} and was buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery of Leipzig.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}}
[[File:AJF Lzg. Henr. Goldschm.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Leipzig]]

==Legacy==
In 1921, the clubhouse of the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare was renamed as the Henriette Goldschmidt House, in her honor.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} But, that same year, the society was dissolved and merged with the [[Henri Hinrichsen]] Foundation, with Hinrichsen in charge of the school.{{sfn|Leipziger Internet Zeitung|2010}} During the [[Nazi]] era, the school eradicated any ties to its Jewish founder, Goldschmidt and later director, Hinrichsen, also barring admittance to Jewish girls. With the establishment of [[East Germany]], the school was renamed after Henriette Goldschmidt and served as a pedagogical training school for kindergarten teachers. In 1992, the school, now called the Henriette-Goldschmidt Vocational School, became a technical training institution for social work and special education.{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}} While the school survived, in 1999, the city demolished the Henriette Goldschmidt House, despite protests, for a road expansion, which never took place.{{sfn|Leipziger Internet Zeitung|2010}}{{sfn|Jensen|1999}}

There are two public plaques honoring Goldschmidt in Leipzig. One was dedicated on the 75th anniversary in 1986 at the entry to the Henriette Goldschmidt School, which states: "Here in 1911 the Academy of Women opened, initiated and supported by the women's rights activist and Fröbel educator Henriette Goldschmidt (1825-1920), financially made possible by Dr. Henri Hinrichsen (1868-1942)." The second plaque in honor of Goldschmidt was affixed to a house located at 7 Spittastraße in 1996 to mark the location of the first children's day care center. A bust of Goldschmidt's likeness was cast in 2001 to mark the 90th anniversary of the school. The original is in the [[Museum der bildenden Künste|Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts]] and a replica is on a stele at the Henriette Goldschmidt School with a plaque inscribed to match the one removed by the Nazis and originally added to the wall by Hinrichsen, with the words "To the noble pursuit of German women".{{sfn|Kämmerer|2013}}

'''INJAZ''' (Arabic: إنجاز‎‎) is a youth-centered non-profit organization established in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1999.  Over, '''1.9''' million youths have benefited from participating in INJAZ activities since its inception.

This non-profit organization focuses on developing skills of the youth in '''four main thematic areas''':

1. Financial Education

2. Life Skills

3. Business and Entrepreneurship

4. Employment

These four fundamental skills are developed through a variety of demand-driven programs, which are delivered to youth in schools, universities, community colleges, and various social institutions.

This organization implements programs across Jordan, in twelve governorates, by working with partners from the private and public sectors.

==History==
Sponsored by [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania]],&lt;ref name="Altorki2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwecCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA398|title=A Companion to the Anthropology of the Middle East|author=Soraya Altorki|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1-118-47567-6|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; INJAZ was established in 1999 as a project under the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) funded organization [[Save the Children]]. In the early stages the project encountered opposition, notably in [[Ma'an]]; it was re-launched in 2001 by [[Soraya Salti]] as an independent non-profit.&lt;ref name="AndrewsWood2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0qvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT150|title=Uberpreneurs: How to Create Innovative Global Businesses and Transform Human Societies|author1=P. Andrews|author2=F. Wood|date=8 December 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-37615-2|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities reached over 100,000 school students in Jordan during the 2010&amp;ndash;11 academic year.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxmmxZcrRPYC&amp;pg=PA246|title=Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work|publisher=UNESCO|year=2012|isbn=978-92-3-104240-9|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 17 years, it has established itself as a leading solution provider, linking the public, private, and civil society sectors.

It has developed its own programs in consultation with local and regional experts.  It has collaborated with international development organizations to bring new, high-impact programs to Jordan and adapt them to local sensibilities.

INJAZ has a broad network of domestic and international partners.  It has also developed solid strategic partnerships with key ministries, including the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD), the King Abdullah II Fund for Development (KAFD), the Vocational Training Center (VTC), and the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ).

Its aim is to meet a perceived need for vocational training, providing young people with [[entrepreneurship]] skills and enhancing their employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on trade mission to Tunisia, Jordan, Oman, and Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BanVhdibzUC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2005|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-5005-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DhillonYousef2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Navtej Dhillon|author2=Tarik Yousef|title=Generation in Waiting: The Unfulfilled Promise of Young People in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMUTmWJm4V0C&amp;pg=PA160|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-0472-0|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been funded in part by the business sector,&lt;ref name="Schroeder2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHOk6WAhqMYC&amp;pg=PA122|title=Startup Rising: The Entrepreneurial Revolution Remaking the Middle East|author=Christopher M.

==Mission==
"Inspire and prepare youth to become productive members of their society and accelerate the development of the national economy."

INJAZ provides youth with skills and resources to enter the workforce by filling the gap between the national educational system and the needs of the job market.

In Jordan, the unemployment rate among the youth is staggeringly high.  One of the major reasons behind the worrying unemployment rate is that Jordan has an underdeveloped entrepreneurial culture.

However, young Jordanians were more likely than their regional counterparts to have a favorable view of entrepreneurship. This suggests that it is not a lack of interest that keeps Jordanians from becoming entrepreneurs, but other factors, such as the perceived legal, financial, and bureaucratic challenges, as well as the lack of educational resources necessary to prepare for such a career.

"Inspire and prepare youth to become productive members of their society and accelerate the development of the national economy."

INJAZ provides youth with skills and resources to enter the workforce by filling the gap between the national educational system and the needs of the job market.

==Programs==
INJAZ’s portfolio of programs addresses the wide range of needs of young Jordanians.  The programs complement the education and training provided by traditional educational institutions.  These programs are designed to develop their vital soft and hard skills.  They also help build entrepreneurial skills necessary to be strong candidates and entrepreneurs in a competitive job market.

INJAZ reaches over '''130,000''' youth a year with its programs. It implements over '''44''' programs throughout Jordan's '''12''' governorates, in close collaboration with '''3000''' schools, '''41''' universities/colleges, and '''50''' youth centers.

==Volunteerism==
INJAZ has a platform to set up volunteer services in a more coordinated, systematic, and efficient manner.  It offers effective means to engage volunteers in building their society and to spread a culture of volunteerism in Jordan.

INJAZ already succeeded in institutionalizing volunteerism within the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, which have been already adopted by many of its over-300 private and public sector partners.

INJAZ removes typical logistical and/or bureaucratic barriers to enable members of the private sector to work directly with the youth. This model has been developed in consultation with partners, which includes government officials and institutions, the private sector, educators, volunteers and students.

==Organization==
INJAZ is headquartered in Amman, Jordan with field offices in [[Irbid]], [[Zarqa]], [[Al Karak|Karak]], [[Wadi Musa]], [[Tafilah]] and [[Aqaba]].

'''Karolina Sofia Bock''' née ''Richter'' (August 28, 1792, Stockholm – 22 March 1872) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] stage actress.  She was the principal and drama teacher of the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' twice: from 1831 to 1834, and from 1841 to 1856.  She was an elite actress of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)"&gt;Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska skådespelare från Gustav III till våra dagar.

== Life ==

Karolina Richter was born to the [[hautboist]] Carl Johan Richter and Magdalena Sofia Rytting.

She was a student of the ''Dramatens elevskola'' at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] between 1806 and 1810.  She was a student of [[Sofia Lovisa Gråå]], and belonged to those female stage artists of her generation referred to as the "Grå Girls".&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;

===Early life===

Karolina Bock was engaged at the ''[[Djurgårdsteatern]]'' and the ''Nya komiska teatern'' of [[Isak de Broen]] in 1813-14.   In 1814, she was engaged at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], where she remained active until her retirement in 26 June 1863.

Karolina Bock came to belong to the elite of Swedish actors generation.  She was not regarded suitable for heroine parts, which where often the women main roles of the plays of the epoch, but established herself well already in her youth in the roles of old women in comedies, a category in which she formed a successful career and never lacked assignments, becoming: 
:"...an often used and well seen actress, who never spoiled a part but were terrific in most and always gave her figures a sharply lined characteristic. :Particularly in her interpretation of old women's parts she developed in to a talent of the first order."&lt;ref&gt;Carolina S Bock (f. Richter), urn:sbl:17841, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av N. Personne.), hämtad 2015-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;   
It was said of her that she had a rare quality: she knew her own limitations.

Among her most successful roles were the title role in ''Min tante Aurore'' by [[Boieldieu]], Veneranda in ''Slottet Montemero'', Mrs Slammerström in ''Bildhuggaren'', Aunt Vivika in ''General Eldhjelm'', Mrs Griponiai in ''Brodertvisten'' by [[Kotzebue]], Mrs Miller in ''Kabal och kärlek'', Viarda in ''[[Preciosa (play)|Preciosa]]'', Mrs von Fromuth i ''Porträttet'', Mrs Wunschell in ''Grefvarne Klingsberg'', Theodolinda in ''Doktor Wespe'', Mrs Darmantiéres in ''Dottersonen'', Margarita in ''Mazarin'', Fadette in ''Syrsan'' (the dramatisation of ''La Petite Fadette'' by [[George Sand]]), Mrs Malapropp in ''Rivalerna'', Mrs Harleigh in ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and Gunilla Fipps in ''Mäster Smith''.   On 26 June 1863, Bock retired after having made her final performance in her favorite part, the grandmother in ''Porträttet''.

Karolina Bock was given the ''[[Litteris et Artibus]]'' by the king in 1857, in recognition of her dramatic career.

=== Educator ===

[[File:Carolina Bock DTM.jpg|thumb|Carolina Bock DTM]]

Karolina Bock was the principal and drama teacher of the ''Dramatens elevskola'' twice: from 1831 to 1834 and from 1841 to 1856.  She also served as instructor of [[declamation]] there.

Several generations of Swedish actors were shaped by Bock.  Among her students were [[Emilie Högquist]] and [[Jenny Lind]].  Her method was that of the French technique which had been introduced at the school by [[Anne Marie Milan Desguillons]] and kept at the time of her own tenure as student there under Sofia Lovisa Gråå.  She was known for her skill at giving instruction in the correct distinction of the language in both song and speech, and it was said that all of her students were recognizable by having the distinction taught during her tenure.

Her technique, however, belonged to the elder French school of solemnity which was replaced by the new romantic schools more natural acting by the mid-19th century.  Furthermore, though Karolina Bock was described as an excellent teacher, she was also described as one who forced a more strict discipline upon her students, and in 1856, she was deposed as principal after protests by the acting class.

The "Bock Woman" was described as a "theatre original" with a fierce temperament.  When she was given the task to instruct the Danish guest artist  [[Charlotte Bournonville]] (daughter of [[August Bournonville]]) in the Swedish language in 1857, she performed the task so well that Bournonville could perform soon after as a native Swede in the part of Fatima in ''Oberon'', where she made success.  When the direction thanked Bock for this, she "gave them such a load of barking that they quickly retreated."

===Private life===

Karolina Bock was married twice.  In 1813, she married Johan Gabriel Svanberg [[violin]]ist at the [[Kungliga Hovkapellet|royal chapel]], from whom she divorced in 1822, assuming the name Mrs Richter.  In 1826 she married Carl Friedrich Bock, who played the [[flute]] in the royal chapel.   She was the mother of [[Bertha Tammelin]], who became an actor, singer, [[composer]], [[musician]] and a teacher at ''Dramatens elevskola''.

==Mission==
Katha's mission is given momentum by a solitary idea that children can bring positive change to their community if they are empowered through education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comminit.com/en/node/297097/303 Early Childhood Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Katha has set up around 96 schools in Delhi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comminit.com/en/node/297097/303 Early Childhood Dev elopement]&lt;/ref&gt; and works with a large team of volunteer and intellectuals. Many of these schools are in urban slums, where over 7,000 underprivileged children gain access to education.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/student/gap-year/gap-years-in-india-discover-a-land-of-wondrous-variety-411862.html Gap years in India: discover a land of wondrous variety] [[The Independent]], 14 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It executes stories in identity building of the children and believes that there is a need to tell stories from India in order to create a new generation of children that would have a strong sense of rooted-ness to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://floatingsun.net/udai/files/Katha%20profile.doc Katha Vilasam, Story Resource and Research Centre  (MS Word File)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is Katha NGO's cultural resistance that is done through its publishing division [[Katha Books]], that has been working in the area of translating [[Indian Literature]] since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takepart.com/actions/katha-by-santhanam-r/11797 Take Part Now]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, it formed KITES (Katha Information Technology and E-commerce School) in Govindpuri, New Delhi, a non-conventional school, in a joint initiative with British telecom major [[British Telecom]], providing information and communication skills to 3000 children from the poorest communities.&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/foreign-firms-give-csrhearing/298326/ Foreign firms give CSR a hearing: British Telecom gives back to Indian society] BS Reporter/ New Delhi, [[Business Standard]], 18 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2005/oct/08spec.htm How KITE changed these children's lives] [[Rediff.com]], 8 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Katha which also runs several income generation programs for women, by training skills like cooking, baking, tailoring and teaching at its various community centres, gave away the `Dilli ki Shaan' (Pride of Delhi) Awards to 15 women community leaders; speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister of Delhi, [[Sheila Dikshit]] said: "I think Katha is doing a better job than even the Delhi Government to bring under-privileged women to the forefront."&lt;ref name=sh&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-26/delhi/28041411_1_slum-children-women-work-camp | title=Sheila lauds NGO for work on women's uplift | author=TNN | newspaper=[[The Times of India]] | date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/slum-women-add-colour-to-dilli-ki-shaan/88670-3.html | title=Slum women add colour to Dilli ki Shaan | first=Suraj | last=Anand | publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] | date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090309/delhi.htm#3 | title=Slum women spread wings | first=Ananya | last=Panda | publisher=Tribune News Service | newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lavinia Lloyd Dock''' (February 26, 1858 – April 17, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/nursing/courses/nur361/leader07/bio.html Biography of Lavinia Lloyd Dock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819221824/http://www.asu.edu/nursing/courses/nur361/leader07/bio.html |date=2012-08-19 }}. asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; was a nurse, feminist, author, pioneer in nursing education and social activist.&lt;ref name="sueb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Philips |first=Deborah |title=Healthy Heroines: Sue Barton, Lillian Wald, Lavinia Lloyd Dock and the Henry Street Settlement |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=65–82 |year=1999|doi=10.1017/S0021875898006070 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dock was an assistant superintendent at [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]] under [[Isabel Hampton Robb]]. With Robb and [[Mary Adelaide Nutting]], she helped to found the organization that would become the [[National League for Nursing]]. Dock was a contributing editor to the ''American Journal of Nursing'' and she authored several books, including (with M. Adelaide Nutting as co-author) a four-volume history of nursing and what was for many years a standard nurse's manual of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat|oclc=2960535|name=Text-book of Materia Medica for Nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt; She campaigned for women's rights for many years.

==Early life and career==
Lavinia Dock was born one of six children in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] on February 26, 1858. She received nursing training at the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]], graduating in 1886. By 1888, Dock was working with [[Jane Delano]] at a Florida hospital during a yellow fever outbreak.&lt;ref name=Grave&gt;{{cite web|title=Lavinia Lloyd Dock 1858 - 1956|url=http://www.aahn.org/gravesites/dock.html|publisher=American Association for the History of Nursing, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delano was a young nurse who later founded the [[American Red Cross Nursing Service]]. Dock wrote and published (with help from her father and brother) a book on therapeutic medicines in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science|last = Ogilvie|first = Marilyn|publisher = Routledge|year = 2000|isbn = 0-415-92038-8|location = |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Dock went to [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]] in 1890, where she was assistant superintendent of the school under [[Isabel Hampton Robb]].&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; In 1893, Dock, with the assistance of Robb and [[Mary Adelaide Nutting]], founded the American Society of superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses of the United States and Canada, which became the [[National League for Nursing]].

==Later life==
After her retirement from nursing, her activities included membership in the [[National Woman's Party]], led by [[Alice Paul]]. Dock campaigned for woman suffrage by leading several protests, including pickets at the White House; she was arrested after militant demonstrations in June 1917, August 1917 and August 1918.&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt; She participated in protest movements for women's rights that resulted in the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. In addition, she campaigned for legislation to allow nurses rather than physicians to control their profession.

Dock died on April 17, 1956, after suffering a broken hip in a fall.&lt;ref name=Grave/&gt;

==Legacy==
The American Association for the History of Nursing has named an award in honor of Dock. The Lavinia L. Dock Award for Exemplary Historical Research and Writing recognizes outstanding writing and research in a book by an experienced scholar of nursing history.&lt;ref name=Award&gt;{{cite web|title=AAHN Research Awards|url=http://www.aahn.org/awards.html|publisher=American Association for the History of Nursing, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Missouri Library Network Corporation''' (MLNC) was a [[library consortium]] founded on October 19, 1981 by the representatives of thirty-one [[Missouri]] libraries. In July 2012, MLNC merged with Amigos Library Services of Dallas Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Votes Finalize Amigos/MLNC Merger|url=http://www.amigos.org/node/1235|publisher=Amigos Library Services|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and purpose==
The Missouri Library Network Corporation (MLNC) was founded on October 19, 1981 by the representatives of thirty-one Missouri libraries. The mission of the Missouri Library Network Corporation (MLNC) was to organize and deliver to its member libraries and other contracting entities [[OCLC]]-based information services, related electronic services and content, and training in the management and use of information.

MLNC’s primary role from 1983-2009 was to provide OCLC services to Missouri libraries. They were an active OCLC partner that provided billing, marketing, and training services to libraries throughout the Midwest region. In addition, MLNC provided discounts on a variety of library-related products and services, including electronic reference databases from vendors such as [[LexisNexis]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[Congressional Quarterly]], and others as well as library supply catalogs (such as [http://www.demco.com Demco] and [[Brodart]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLNC - About Us|url=http://www.mlnc.org/about.html|publisher=MLNC|accessdate=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing education==
MLNC offered workshops on library-related topics including:
* OCLC WorldCat Resource Sharing
* OCLC Connexion client and browser
* Descriptive cataloging
* Library management and administration
* Digitization
* Emerging technologies
* Collection management

MLNC staff contracted with libraries and statewide organizations for keynote and professional speaking engagements such as in-house training, staff development events, and other library programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1998">The '''National Society for Promoting Religious Education''', often just referred to as the '''National Society''',and since 2016 also as '''The Church of England Education Office (CEEO)''' is a [[Church of England]] body in [[England and Wales]] for the promotion of [[church school]]s and [[Christian education]].  

It was founded on 16 October 1811 as the ''"National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in England and Wales"''.  Its aim was that "the National Religion should be made the foundation of National Education, and should be the first and chief thing taught to the poor, according to the excellent Liturgy and Catechism provided by our Church."  One of the principal founders was [[Joshua Watson]]. 

Historically, schools founded by the National Society were called [[National school (England and Wales)|National Schools]], as opposed to the non-denominational "British schools" founded by the [[British and Foreign School Society]].

According to the Society's website, "Five thousand Church of England and Church in Wales schools, educating almost a million children and young people, are the heirs of that proud tradition."

'''Northeast Maritime Institute''' (also called NMI) is a [[Private university|private]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]], maritime college offering an Associate in Applied Science in Nautical Science degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.edu/foradmin/academic/independentpurview.asp|title=Academic Program Approval &amp; Review / Massachusetts Department of Higher Education|last=Education|first=Massachusetts Department of Higher|website=www.mass.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1981, Northeast Maritime Institute is the only private maritime college in the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newbedfordguide.com/northeast-maritime-institute/2015/06/17|title=World class Northeast Maritime Institute offers locals career opportunities within the maritime industry – New Bedford Guide|website=www.newbedfordguide.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The college is in the Town of [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]], Massachusetts located in the [[United States]] and is within walking distance from the [[Acushnet River]] across from New Bedford Harbor.  The college was originally established to provide an alternative to traditional maritime academy regimented-styled training and graduates of the college’s Associate program are eligible to receive a United States Coast Guard Masters license upon graduation.  The college operates a training ship, the m/v Navigator, as well as the [[brigantine]] [[tall ship]] [http://www.sailtraining.org/membervessels/vessel.php?@=254 m/s Fritha]. 

== History ==
Northeast Maritime Institute was founded in 1981 as the Tidewater School of Navigation, Inc. in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], Massachusetts.  The school originally provided only continuing education courses and programs approved by the [[United States Coast Guard]] prior to becoming a college.  In 1997 the school was renamed Northeast Maritime Institute and later moved its location to Fairhaven, Massachusetts where its main campus building is located today.  Since its relocation the school has grown to four campus buildings all within walking distance and located within the center of Fairhaven.

In 2008, the Institute launched The Fairhaven Project through a public-private partnership with the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] to advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine.  The program brought groups of Israeli and Palestinian students to Fairhaven where they would work together onboard the brigantine tall ship m/s Fritha.  A 30-minute documentary of the 2008 program was created and utilized by U.S. Embassies and Consulates in the Middle East and other regions of conflict to stimulate student discussions and extend a message of equality and understanding to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/oes/rls/fs/2009/119487.htm|title=The Fairhaven Project: Israeli &amp; Palestinian Youths Sail Tall Ship for Peace|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northeast Maritime Institute delivers a range of on-line maritime education and training programs through its Learning Management System “NEMO°” (also called Northeast Maritime Online).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://northeastmaritimeonline.com|title=Northeast Maritime Online (NEMO) Education and Examination System|website=northeastmaritimeonline.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online education and training system was designed so that seafarers could complete training at sea rather than during their shore leave.

In 2018, Northeast Maritime Institute entered into a partnership program with the University of Virgin Islands for development of a degree program in maritime management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stthomassource.com/content/2018/06/03/uvi-board-oks-new-maritime-degree/|title=UVI Board OKs New Maritime Degree|last=staff|first=Source|date=2018-06-04|website=St. Thomas Source|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic programs ==

=== Nautical science ===
The Institute’s College of Nautical Science is a [[Merchant navy|merchant marine]] college intended to prepare students to work onboard ships as [[Deck department|deck officers]] and [[Sea captain|captains]] upon graduation.  In addition to completing all shore-side college classes, students are required to complete two “Semesters at Sea” whereby they work onboard U.S. flagged commercial vessels.  Students may elect to complete their Semesters at Sea onboard any vessel that meets program requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northeastmaritime.com/collegeofmaritimescience/|title=Maritime College  {{!}}  Northeast Maritime Institute|website=www.northeastmaritime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">An '''online community manager''' builds, grows, and manages [[online communities]], performing [[Community management]], often around a brand or cause.

==History==
The most recognized origin of the term (online) community manager is in the computer games industry with the advent of [[MMORPG]] (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games) in the mid 1990's. Roles have expanded to include a wide variety of responsibilities and skill-sets including social media management, marketing, product development, PR, and customer support. Game community management often includes supporting open communications between the developer and player community. 

While the term "online community manager" may not have been used at the time, the role has also existed since online systems first began offering features and functions that allowed for community creation. These early efforts, in the form of [[Bulletin Board System|bulletin board systems]], had leaders known as system operators or [[Sysops]]. The early 1990s saw the growth of mainstream online computer services such as [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]] and [[AOL|America Online]]. Prominent features of these services included communities which went by various names; Special Interest Groups, Communities of Interest and so on. And their leaders were often referred to as community managers.

==General roles==
Online community managers may serve a variety of roles depending on the nature and purpose of their online community, which may or may not be part of a profit motivated enterprise. Patti Anklam has asserted that "Every network has an underlying purpose" and motivations for such network creation include; Mission, Business, Idea, Learning or Personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Anklam
  | first = Patti
  | title = Net Work
  | publisher = Elsevier
  | year = 2007
  | isbn = 978-0-7506-8297-8 }}
  | pages=4,31,108
&lt;/ref&gt;
She says such leaders hold the collective vision, create and manage relationships and manage collaborative processes. Anklam does not distinguish a fundamental difference for these roles as related to the varying purposes of network, (i.e. community), creation.

==Professional roles==
Community managers are involved in the computer games industry, branded online communities, [[online research communities]], corporate blogs, and other social media marketing and research activities.

Roles have expanded to include a wide variety of responsibilities and skill-sets including social media management, marketing, product support and development, PR, and customer support. At the core, community management encompasses a little bit of each of these, while retaining its core tenet - ensuring open communications between the developer and community.

===Culture and appreciation===
International [[Community Manager Appreciation Day]] takes place on the 4th Monday of January.&lt;ref&gt;Original blog post where the event originated (25/01/2010): [http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2010/01/25/community-manager-appreciation-day-cmad-every-4th-monday-of-jan/ "Community Manager Appreciation Day #CMAD (Every 4th Monday of Jan)"]&lt;/ref&gt; People are encouraged to send sincere thank you notes to their online community managers.

This tradition started in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8554">[[File:Osap english colour logo.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Ontario Student Assistance Program''' ('''OSAP''') ''([[French language|French]]: '''Régime d'aide financière aux étudiantes et étudiants de l'Ontario''' ('''RAFEO'''))'' is financial aid to help Ontario students pay for their post-secondary education. When a student applies for OSAP, they are considered for a combination of:
* grants (money they don’t have to pay back)
* loans (money they need to repay)
After a student submits an application, OSAP determines the mix of grant and loan money a student can receive. More than 380,000 students – more than half of all full-time students –received student financial aid in 2014-15.

In 2017, the Province of Ontario is moving forward with the single largest modernization of OSAP in its history to ensure student financial aid is more transparent and targeted to those with the greatest financial need.

== Changes to OSAP starting in 2017-18 ==
* Eligible students whose parents earn $50,000 or less in annual income will receive enough OSAP grants to cover average tuition.
* 50 per cent of students from families with incomes of $83,300 or less will get non-repayable grants that more than cover the average cost of tuition.
* No eligible student will receive less aid than they are eligible for now under the 30% Off Ontario Tuition grant
* Weekly loan limits will increase for all students and continue to be indexed annually to inflation.

== Changes to OSAP starting in 2018-19 ==
* Middle- and upper-income families will have improved access to subsidized loans.
* The amount parents are expected to contribute towards the cost of their child’s postsecondary education will be reduced. 
* A new billing system will be implemented for public colleges and universities that takes into account government and institutional grants for students. Students’ tuition bills will reflect their out-of-pocket costs. This will make it easier for students and their families to understand what the true cost of tuition is – for tens of thousands of students, they will owe $0 towards their tuition.

== Amount of financial aid students may receive ==
When students apply for OSAP, it is determined how much they’ll receive by comparing their tuition fees and living expenses with the amount the student and their family are expected to pay.

== Free tuition for eligible students ==
Starting in 2017, OSAP will give Ontario students enough grants to cover the average cost of tuition if:
* their parents earn $50,000 or less per year
* they’re going to study full-time
* they’re attending a publicly assisted college or university, and
* they meet the eligibility requirements for OSAP
Many students from middle-income families will receive grants that exceed the value of their tuition.

These grants do not fully cover the tuition costs of programs with higher tuition fees, such as engineering, medicine, and law. 

Some students who meet these requirements may not receive these grants, including students who:
* have enough money to cover their tuition (e.g. savings, RESPs or scholarships)
* have already received their lifetime limit for the Ontario Tuition Grant

== Parental contributions ==
Students within four years of having graduated high school are usually considered dependents, and will automatically have a parental contribution factored into their OSAP needs based assessment.

Students who have been out of secondary school for more than four years will not have a parental contribution factored into their assessment.

==Eligibility==
Both full- and part-time students can apply for OSAP.

To qualify for assistance, an applicant must be:
* attending (or planning to attend) an approved program at a postsecondary institution that has been approved for OSAP purposes
* enrolled in a program that is 12 weeks or longer which leads directly to a degree, diploma or certificate
* a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or protected person, and
* an Ontario resident (e.g. Ontario is the last Canadian province in which you resided for 12 consecutive months without being a full-time postsecondary student)


=== New Canadians ===
For new Canadian citizens, permanent residents and protected persons who have resided in Canada for less than 12 months, a residency review is available to determine the province from which they would be eligible to receive student aid.

=== Mature students ===
Students who finished high school four or more years ago can qualify for more grants to go back to school.

==Registering and applying for OSAP==
In order to apply for funding consideration from OSAP, students must first register as a new user online at ontario.ca/osap

Applications for OSAP for the 2017-18 school year are available in spring 2017.

Students can get ready now by registering with OSAP. They’ll create their OSAP profile and get an OSAP Access Number (OAN). When the application opens in spring 2017, students will get a message from OSAP that it’s time to apply.

=== Notice to 2016-17 OSAP applicants ===
If applying for OSAP for the 2016-17 academic year, please visit ontario.ca/osap for more information.

==Ontario Student Access Guarantee==
If OSAP doesn’t cover all of the expenses that directly relate to a student’s program (books, tuition, mandatory fees), and they still require additional financial assistance, public colleges and universities in Ontario are required to provide financial help.

This money could include:
* bursaries
* scholarships
* work study programs
* summer employment programs

==Financial Aid Offices==
Students should visit the Financial Aid Office (FAO) at the college or university they plan to attend for more information about OSAP, the Ontario Student Access Guarantee and other financial aid questions. Students can find a list of FAOs at Ontario’s public colleges and universities [https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/Contacts/ProvinciallyfundedSchoolsinOntario/index.htm online].

=== Exceptional circumstances ===
The OSAP assessment may not reflect exceptional circumstances some students may have.  As a result, a number of reviews have been developed to allow students to provide additional information regarding their specific circumstances. To learn more about the review process or to initiate a review, students can contact their school’s financial aid office.

==When you need to repay==
For the first 6 months after graduation, finishing studies, or no longer being a full-time college or university student:
* you don’t need to make any loan payments
* no interest is charged on the Ontario portion of your student loan
* interest is charged on the Canada portion of your student loan
This is a 6 month grace period.

Recipients of OSAP can expect to start repaying their loan at the '''end of the 7th month''' after they leave school.

=== Grace Period Extensions ===
If a student has recently completed their studies, they can apply to have their grace period extended for an additional six months through one of these two programs:

[https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR015072.html One-Year OSAP Grace Period for Entrepreneurs]''':'''  for the owner or joint owner of an eligible new business located in Ontario.

[https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR015074.html One-Year OSAP Grace Period for Not-for Profit Employees]: for borrowers working at an eligible not-for-profit organization in Ontario.

== How to repay OSAP loans ==
Within 6 months of leaving school, OSAP recipients will get a package in the mail from the National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC) that tells them:
* how much they owe
* their expected monthly payment
* the total number of payments they will need to make
* the date of their first payment
* the interest rate
Monthly loan payments are made to the [https://csnpe-nslsc.cibletudes-canlearn.ca/eng/default.aspx National Student Loans Service Centre.]

The '''Royal Veterinary College''' (informally the '''RVC''') is a [[Veterinary school]] located in London and a [[Collegiate university|constituent college]] of the federal [[University of London]]. The RVC was founded in 1791 and joined the University of London in 1949. It is the oldest and largest Veterinary school in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/5050069/Elephant-giraffe-crocodile-and-whale-to-be-dissected-for-new-Channel-4-show.html|title=Elephant, giraffe, crocodile and whale to be dissected for new Channel 4 show|date=25 March 2009|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of only eight in the country where students can study to become a [[Veterinary physician|vet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/education/i-want-to-be-a-vet/|title=Veterinary schools in the UK|date=7 March 2016|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===18th century===
The '''Veterinary College of London''' was founded in 1791 by a group led by [[Granville Penn]], a grandson of [[William Penn]], following the foundation of the first veterinary college in Europe  in [[Lyon]], France in 1762. The promoters wished to select a site close to the metropolis, but far enough away to minimise the temptations open to the students. [[Earl Camden]] was just then making arrangements to develop some fields he owned to the north of London, and he replied to the College's newspaper advertisement for a suitable site with an offer to sell it some of his land. The site was rural, but urban developments appeared on all sides in the early decades of the 19th century, creating [[Camden Town]].

[[File:Veterinary College, London.jpg|thumb|Veterinary College, London, the original building, 1804 engraving.]]
[[Charles Benoit Vial de St Bel]] of the Lyon establishment was appointed as the first principal of the new college. The first students, just four of them, began their studies in 1792, and the first horse was admitted for treatment in 1793. St Bel died later that year and was succeeded by [[Edward Coleman (veterinary surgeon)|Edward Coleman]], who managed the college for nearly forty six years and established its reputation. Among the first students were [[Delabere Pritchett Blaine]] and [[Bracy Clark]]. In its early years it was mainly concerned with horses, but the range of animals covered gradually increased. The original building was a quadrangle in a neoclassical style, and there was a paddock on the opposite side of [[Royal College Street]], but this was later sold for housing development.

In 1796 John Shipp was the first qualified veterinary surgeon to join the British Army.

===19th century===
The college first acquired royal patronage from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. In 1844 it was awarded a Royal Charter.

In 1865 RVC Professor [[James Beart Simonds]] was appointed as the first Chief Inspector and Veterinary Advisor to the Privy council, with particular regard to cattle plague.

In 1875 college was granted a Royal Charter as the Royal Veterinary College; it remains the only veterinary college in the UK to have its own Royal Charter.

In 1879 the Cheap Practice Clinic was established, later known as the Poor People's Out-Patients Clinic. Some veterinary surgeons were concerned that the college was threatening their livelihoods, but the college argued that poor people could not afford veterinary fees, therefore their animals would go untreated if the Clinic were closed.

The college celebrated its centenary in 1891 and in that year the Students' Union was founded. In 1895 the first X-ray machine was acquired.

===20th century===
There was a major renovation in 1907 of the college horse boxes, which had fund-raisers' commemorative shields hung at their doorways.

In 1924 the Research Institute in Animal Pathology was built, headed by Professor [[John McFadyean]].

Various extensions were added to the Camden Town site over the years. The buildings had become obsolete and in 1927 were officially declared dangerous structures. A fund-raising scheme for the total rebuilding of the college was launched by the new Principal, Professor Sir [[Frederick Hobday]].

In 1932 the Beaumont Animals' Hospital opened.

New buildings were opened by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in November 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Royal Veterinary College | title=The Royal Veterinary College and Hospital : prepared to commemorate the opening of the Royal Veterinary College by His Majesty King George VI | publication-date=1937 | publisher=[s.n.] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15138379 | accessdate=23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, the RVC evacuated to [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]], [[Berkshire]], although the Beaumont Animals' Hospital remained open at Camden Town.

In 1949 the RVC became a school of the [[University of London]].

In 1958 the Hawkshead field station, in Hertfordshire, was officially opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

In the 1980s the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust was launched with the [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] as patron, and the [[Queen Mother Hospital for Animals]] was opened at Hawkshead by the Queen Mother. Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, and Chancellor of the University of London, opened the surgical wing of the Sefton Equine Referral Hospital.

The bicentenary celebrations were held in 1991. The skeleton of the famous racehorse Eclipse, dissected in 1789 by St. Bel was once more the property of the RVC and was placed on display in the Museum at Hawkshead.

===21st century===
The [[London BioScience Innovation Centre]] was opened in 2001.

The Learning Resource Centre (Eclipse Building) was officially opened at Hawkshead by Her Majesty the Queen in October 2003. The Large Animal Clinical Centre was officially opened by HRH Prince Philip The Duke of Edinburgh in October 2003.

In 2005 the Duchess of Cornwall visited the Hawkshead Campus as new Patron of the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust.

The LIVE Centre at Hawkshead was officially opened by HRH The Princess Royal in February 2007.

==Campuses==
[[File:Royalvetcoll.jpg|thumb|right|The frontage of the Camden campus of the RVC]]
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
The RVC has two campuses, one in Camden in central London and the other near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire. On the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine course, students spend two years in Camden followed by three years in Potters Bar.

The 1930s buildings on Royal College Street in Camden Town, near [[St Pancras railway station]] remain, with minor extensions. Around half of the undergraduate students are based there at any one time. The Camden campus is also home to the main bulk of the RVC Student Union (RVCSU), including the main college bar, the Haxby.

The Hawkshead Campus is located in [[Brookmans Park]], rural [[Hertfordshire]], about {{convert|17|mi|km|0}} north of central London, was officially opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1959. The majority of the college sports teams train and play on the sports courts and fields at this campus, which is also home to the [[Queen Mother Hospital for Animals]], [[Bolton's Park Farm]] and the Buttery (a second union-run bar).

The college provides a number of undergraduate courses, including the [[Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine]] (BVetMed) as well as accelerated graduate entry BVetMed and a combined BVetMed, [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science]] (BSc) degree. BSc degrees are also provided in veterinary nursing, bioveterinary sciences, biological sciences and veterinary pathology, and a foundation degree in veterinary nursing is also offered.

The college also offers the Gateway course; the first year of an extended six-year veterinary degree programme, created for students who are part of the UK Widening Participation cohort. It is designed to equip students with the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to join a career-building veterinary degree course. This is a widening participation programme for UK non-selective state school students whose parents have not been to university and who receive, or would be eligible for, an [[Education Maintenance Allowance]] payment.

There is a distance learning department and the Graduate School provides masters courses, PhD studentships and clinical training scholarships in a wide range of disciplines. The College's Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Unit is a major academic provider of educational services to the veterinary community.

The RVC has an e-Media Unit which collaborates with other UK veterinary schools on the development of the [[WikiVet]] site.

== Student life ==
Students are encouraged to participate in extra-curricular activities both inside and outside of the college authority. Some examples of sports offered are rowing (see: the [[Royal Veterinary College Boat Club]]), rugby, netball, hockey, football, and, more unusually, dance, ice-skating, polo and shooting. For purpose of sports, the RVC is a part of the [[United Hospitals]], and the sports clubs compete (and sometimes socialise) with the London medical schools (such as [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|Barts]], [[Imperial College School of Medicine|ICSM,]] and [[UCL Medical School|RUMS]]).

There are also a number of academically-inclined clubs, such as the Farm Animal Clinical Club, the Dissection Club and the RVC Zoological Society, and non-academic societies, such as wine-tasting, games society, and the RVC Christian Union.

The Student Union runs a number of events throughout the year. In the past, these have included [[May Ball]], Christmas Ball and Sports Ball, as well as Halfway Dinner (which takes place in the second term of third year for students on the BVetMed course), [[Burns Night]], an elaborate [[Fresher's week|Freshers' Week]] and [[Raising and Giving]] (RAG) Fortnight.

Students on the BVetMed course are also invited to attend events organised by the [[Association of Veterinary Students]] (AVS) such as Sports Weekend (which, in 2016, will be held at the RVC) and AVS [[Congress]] (which will be held at the [[University of Liverpool]]). These allow veterinary students from the UK veterinary schools and the [[University College Dublin]] veterinary faculty to convene once or twice a year to socialise, network and compete.

RVC students are also invited to participate in societies run by other universities in London, as, given the relatively small size of the college, the provision for extra-curricular arts and music is not great; the [[University of London Union]] offers a selection of sports and societies, as does the [[Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union|Imperial College School of Medicine Student's Union,]] and students tend to use these opportunities as well as being involved in RVC societies.

==Research==
The Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 ranked the RVC as England's best veterinary school of those institutions whose research is exclusively veterinary related. 55% of their submitted academic staff were viewed as producing "world class" or "internationally excellent" research.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is a self-governing college within the University of London and its scientists  work together in interdisciplinary teams within one research division.

The disciplines of Epidemiology, Microbiology, Pathology, Immunology and Clinical Science are drawn together in the Centre for Emerging, Endemic and Exotic Diseases (CEEED Centre), opened in 2008.

Animal Welfare and the Animal Welfare unit situated at the college are fundamental to the RVC's research mission and underpins their research programmes. The Structure and Motion Laboratory of the College also has facilities to study locomotion. Understanding how animals and people move is fundamental to [[musculoskeletal]] health and diseases that result from ageing, physical activity and the environment.  The leaders of this Centre of Excellence are at the forefront of developing technologies to study animal movement, which are used in both basic and applied research.

The RVC has a Clinical Investigation Centre, co-ordinating disciplined study of its clinical caseload through its electronic patient record system and undertaking [[Phase II Clinical Trials]] under a Home Office license. They aim to translate research into solutions for veterinary and human medicine and use their expertise and veterinary patient caseload to undertake comparative research of both biomedical and veterinary significance.

==Clinical services==
The RVC runs three animal hospitals and three first opinion practices, all based in London and [[Hertfordshire]]. The hospitals treat over 20,000 patients per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Services Division|url=http://www.rvc.ac.uk/About/Departments/Clinical-Services-Division.cfm|work=About the RVC|publisher=Royal Veterinary College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small animals, the RVC runs the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital, a first-opinion hospital based at the RVC's Camden campus, and the [[Queen Mother Hospital for Animals]], an animal referral hospital which provides clinical services in a wide range of specialities.

The equine services include the Equine Practice which is a first opinion ambulatory service, serving Hertfordshire and other local areas and the Equine Referral Hospital which provides referral clinical services to equine practices and horse owners throughout the south of England.

The RVC operates a referral farm animal hospital at its Hawkshead Campus, which provides full hospitalisation, diagnostic and surgical facilities for individual farm animals. The college has a collaboration with the Dairy Development centre, the [[Welsh Regional Veterinary Centre]] (WRVC), which provides a farm health investigation service to vets and farmers in the South Wales region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14269">The '''Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf''' was (despite the name) the first international [[Meeting|conference]] of [[deaf]] educators held in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1880. It is commonly known as "the '''Milan Conference'''". After deliberations from September 6 to 11, 1880, the conference declared that [[oral education]] (oralism) was superior to [[sign language|manual education]] and passed a resolution banning the use of sign language in school. After its passage in 1880, [[schools]] in European countries and [[History of deaf education in the United States|the United States]] switched to using [[speech therapy]] without [[sign language]] as a method of [[education for the deaf]]. A formal apology was made by the board at the 21st International Congress on Education of the Deaf in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]], in 2010 accepting the dangerous ramifications of such ban as an act of discrimination and violation of human and constitutional rights.

== Background ==

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], both prominent U.S. figures in deaf education, had been debating the effectiveness of oral-only education versus an education that utilizes [[sign language]] as a means of visual communication, culminating in the Milan Conference in 1880 that passed eight resolutions on deaf education.

The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite its name, was actually the first) was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and approximately 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as "Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb".&lt;ref name=Milan1880&gt;

{{cite web |url=http://milan1880.com/milan1880congress/eightresolutions.html |title=Eight Resolutions |last=Sturley |first=Nick |year=2010 |work=Milan 1880 |publisher= |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milan Conference was organized by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of [[Jacob Rodrigues Pereira]] of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including the [[Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier]]). The Pereire Society was a strong supporter of oralism. They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting [[oralism]].

== Delegates ==

The Milan Conference was attended by 164 delegates of various countries. Out of these 164 delegates only one, James Denison, was deaf. The conference president was [[Abbot|Abbe]] Giulio Tarra.

The nationality of the remaining delegates is unknown. The five U.S. delegates present were James Denison, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], [[Thomas Gallaudet (1822–1902)|Reverend Thomas Gallaudet]], Isaac Lewis Peet and Charles A Stoddard.

== Conference ==

The Conference was held in the Regio Instituto Tenico di Santa Martha, Milan. It was held from 6 September to 11 September 1880. The aim of the conference was to ban sign language from deaf education. During the conference there were 12 speakers who gave their opinions on the issues connected with deaf education. Nine of the twelve speakers gave an oralist view, and three (the Gallaudet father and son, and Richard Elliot, a teacher from England) supported the use of sign language.

== Eight resolutions ==

1. The Convention, considering the incontestable superiority of articulation over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society and giving him a fuller knowledge of language, declares that the oral method should be preferred to that of signs in education and the instruction of deaf-mutes.
::Passed 160 to 4

2. The Convention, considering that the simultaneous use of articulation and signs has the disadvantage of injuring articulation and lip-reading and the precision of ideas, declares that the pure oral method should be preferred.
::Passed 150 to 16

3. Considering that a great number of the deaf and dumb are not receiving the benefit of instruction, and that this condition is owing to the impotence of [[family|families]] and of [[institution]]s, recommends that [[government]]s should take the necessary steps that all the deaf and dumb may be educated.
::Passed unanimously.

4. Considering that the teaching of the speaking deaf by the Pure Oral method should resemble as much as possible that of those who hear and speak, declares 
:a) That the most natural and effectual means by which the speaking deaf may acquire the knowledge of language is the "intuitive" method, viz., that which consists in setting forth, first by [[speech]], and then by writing the objects and the facts which are placed before the eyes of the pupils.
:b) That in the first, or maternal, period the [[deaf]]-[[Muteness|mute]] ought to be led to the observation of [[grammar|grammatical]] forms by means of examples and of practical exercises, and that in the second period he ought to be assisted to deduce from these examples the grammatical rules, expressed with the utmost simplicity and clearness.
:c) That books, written with words and in forms of [[language]] known to the pupil, can be put into his hands at any time.
::Motion carried.

5. Considering the want of books sufficiently elementary to help the gradual and progressive development of language, recommends that the [[teacher]]s of the Oral system should apply themselves to the publication of special works on the subject.
::Motion carried.

6. Considering the results obtained by the numerous inquiries made concerning the deaf and dumb of every age and every condition long after they had quit school, who, when interrogated upon various subjects, have answered correctly, with sufficient clearness of articulation, and [[lip reading|read]] the lips of their questioners with the greatest facility, declares:
:a) That the deaf and dumb taught by the Pure Oral method do not forget after leaving school the knowledge which they have acquired there, but develop it still further by conversation and reading, when have been made so easy for them.
:b) That in their [[conversation]] with [[speech|speaking]] persons they make use exclusively of speech.
:c) That speech and lip-reading so far from being lost, are developed by practice.
::Motion carried.

7. Considering that the education of the deaf and dumb by speech has peculiar requirements; considering also that the experienced of teachers of deaf-mutes is almost unanimous, declares
:a) That the most favourable age for admitting a deaf child into school is from eight to ten years.
:b) That the school term ought to be seven years at least; but eight years would be preferable.
:c) That no teacher can effectually teach a class of more than ten children on the Pure Oral method.
::Motion carried.

8. Considering that the application of the Pure Oral method in institutions where it is not yet in active operation, should be to avoid the certainty of failure prudent, gradual, progressive, recommends 
:a) That the pupils newly received into the schools should form a class by themselves, where instruction could be given by speech.
:b) That these pupils should be absolutely separated from others too far advanced to be instructed by speech, and whose education will be completed by signs.
:c) That each year a new speaking class be established, until all the old pupils taught by signs have completed their education.
::Motion carried.

== Opposition ==

Delegates from the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] were the only ones who opposed the use of oralism as a sole method of instruction, but were unsuccessful in their efforts at the congress. Edward Miner Gallaudet and Reverend Thomas Gallaudet were among the protesters who fought against the oralist method. Since failing to overturn the Milan resolutions, Gallaudet ensured that the United States would not be completely converted to oralism-only, which included allowing high school students in institutes for the deaf to use sign language and maintaining [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]] (now Gallaudet University) as a [[university]] that permits full usage of [[sign language]].

The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] was also formed in the United States in response to the Milan Conference and was dedicated toward preserving [[American Sign Language]].

== First repudiation 100 years later in Hamburg ==

At the 15th International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany in 1980, the first major precedent for the repudiation of the 1880 resolutions was set by a large group of attendees who rejected the 1880 resolutions in practical-moral terms by the method of informal consensus in deciding that the 1880 resolutions had no appropriate standing, originally, in 1880. As explained by Richard G. Brill: "At the International Congress in Hamburg in 1980, however, the Milan resolutions were challenged head-on in major professional addresses at the opening of the congresses. It was recognized and accepted that resolutions concerning methodology were not appropriate at such international congresses because of the unlikelihood that the delegates fully represented the practices and philosophies of their home countries."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garretson, Merv. 2010. ''My Yesterdays'', Xlibris, pp. 127-128.{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seek to directly overturn the 1880s resolutions, the Congress put forward "Recommendations" for informational purposes, including the following: "Recommended that this International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in convocation gathered at Hamburg, West Germany, in August 1980, affirms and declares that all deaf children have the right to flexible communication in the mode or combination of modes which best meets their individual needs."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharkey and Hikins deemed this Recommendation, along with the others, as constituting overturning the 1880 Milan Congress's resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, William F. and James W. Hikins. 1993. Edward Miner Gallaudet's "Remarks on the Combined System": An Analysis of the "Preservative" Function of Rhetoric of Education, ''Communication Education'', Vol. 42, No. 1, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the previous precedent set in 1980, in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, the board of the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) formally voted to reject all of the 1880 Milan resolutions.&lt;ref name="ICED"&gt;Tucker, James.

{{Spanish language}}
The term '''Spanish as a second or foreign language''' is the learning or teaching of the [[Spanish language]] for those whose [[first language]] is not Spanish.

==Regional programmes==

===Argentina===
In October 2001, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Foreign Relations, International Commerce and Culture of the Argentine Republic approved the guidelines in order to evaluate the knowledge and use of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language in [[Argentina]]. Known as the ''''''Resoluciones 919 del MECyT and 3164 MRREECIyC)'''''', it recognised the role of universities in the development of the evaluation.

Meanwhile in 2004, a group of national universities created an inter-university consortium oriented towards the teaching, evaluation and certification of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language (o '''ELSE''' from the Spanish, '''Español como Lengua Segunda y Extranjera'''), aiming to contribute to political and educational linguistics.

By June of the same year, three national universities (University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Universidad Litoral (UNL) and the University of Córdoba (UNC)) were working together to design and implement the first official examination to measure competence of Spanish as a foreign language. The exam is called CELU ([[Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish]])) and was approved by Resolution 28 in January 2005.

====The Certification of Spanish Language and Use====
{{Main article|Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish}}

The CELU (Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish) is a certificate of competence in the Spanish language from [[Argentina]]. Like the [[DELE]] (Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera), it also has international validity. The Certificate can be taken by speakers of any language other than Spanish in order to validate their knowledge of Spanish as a second language in their work or study.

In [[Argentina]] it is the only examination officially recognised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture. Any speaker who can use Spanish in an effective manner, whose goal is to interact efficiently with the other members of the community can take the CELU, independently of the course or method that was used to learn the language.

===Spain===
'''Español como lengua extranjera''' ('''ELE''') is the term used to refer to various systems used by different learning institutions that teach the [[Spanish language]] to speakers of other languages, like the [[Escuelas Oficiales de Idiomas]] and the [[Instituto Cervantes]].

Following the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] or the ''CEFR'', these institutions offer examinations that will measure the competence of a learner. There are six exams (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) which can be taken independently (i.e. it is not necessary to pass A1 to get B2) no matter the method of instruction used by the learners.

[[Español en Toledo]], a Spanish course started by the University of Castile-La Mancha General Foundation, brings students to monuments and historical sites in the city of [[Toledo, Spain]] for more experiential learning.

====Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera====
The "[[Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera]]" (Certificates of Spanish as a Foreign Language) is an official diploma granted by the [[Instituto Cervantes]] on behalf of the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]] to evaluate a person's knowledge of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

There are six levels of qualification, each corresponding to a certain level described by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages:
#Diploma de Español (Nivel A1) (level A1): This qualification attests to sufficient linguistic ability for a very basic range of the most commonly simple expressions used in the Spanish-speaking world and in order to satisfy immediate needs of a concrete type.

[[File:SULEJMAN-ZALLA1.jpg|thumb|Sulejman Zalla in a youth image]]
'''Sulejman Zalla''' (1892&amp;ndash;1966) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] teacher, patriot and activist of the [[Rilindja Kombëtare]] of the early 20th century. He was the founder of the first modern Albanian school in the County of Durrës.

==Biography==
Originally from the city of [[Krujë]], where he was born in 1892, Sulejman Zalla pursued elementary studies in his home city and later pursued a degree in the ''Shkolla Normale'' of [[Shkodër]] in order to become an [[Albanian language|Albanian]] teacher.

On 4 March 1913, in [[Ishëm]], Zalla opened the first school in the [[Drač County (Kingdom of Serbia)|County of Durrës]] (which at that time included the cities of [[Tirana]], [[Krujë]], [[Durrës]] and [[Kavajë]]). As recorded by contemporary sources,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} the opening of the school was met with opposition from the local authorities, which saw the teaching of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] in the [[Latin alphabet]] as a heresy, given the Muslim dominant culture of the area. As a result of this opposition, the student count was reduced within the first months from 40 pupils to only 10. In addition, the prefect decided to transfer away the local Muslim clergy, but the decision was reverted by governor [[Esat Toptani]]. In these conditions Muslim fanatics organized the killing of Sulejman Zalla, who was the teacher of the school, and who was declared by them as a heretic. This intention was countered by the local population of Ishëm, who took the teacher under their protection. Zalla's love for the Albanian language earned him the name of "Sulë Shqipja" (''Sulejman the Albanian language'').&lt;ref name="Sudar"&gt;Sudar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Esat Pasha had Zalla arrested in 1914 and kept him in prisons of Durrës and then Krujë. Rebels of the [[Peasant Revolt in Albania]] got him out of prison and Zalla had to become the secretary of [[Haxhi Qamili]], leader of an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and anti-feudal [[Peasant Revolt in Albania]] in 1914–15. Later he managed to leave Qamili and to go to [[Prênk Bibë Doda]], the [[bayrak]]tar of [[Mirdita]], where he obtained protection under the Albanian [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]].&lt;ref name="Sudar"/&gt; At the end of the Peasant Revolt, Zalla returned in the municipalities of Krujë, Prezë, and Ishëm, to teach, and, eventually, in 1927, settled down in the town of [[Shijak]], where he continued to teach Albanian.&lt;ref name="Sudar"/&gt;

When [[Albania under Italy|Albania was under Italy]] during [[World War II]], Zalla put his house at the use of the resistance against fascist Italy. For this reason a decision was made that he be transferred to [[Tuzi]] of [[Montenegro]], then part of Albania. The decision was never implemented.&lt;ref name="Sudar"/&gt;

During [[Communist Albania]], Zalla and his brother were both arrested in 1947 for unknown reasons. He was released two years later with no right to teach. Some years later this right was granted back. At that point he went back to his teaching career and was recipient of several government medals for his educational endeavors, including the People's Teacher ({{lang-sq|Mësues i Popullit}}) which was granted in 1994.&lt;ref name="Sudar"/&gt;

The Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) is an academic institute in Kuwait, it is considered one of the largest institutes in the Middle East in terms of the number of enrolled students. The PAAET offers a wide variety of programs across its different colleges and training institutes.

==Historical Overview==
It was established on December 28, 1982, by [[law]] number (63) with the [[goal|objective]] of developing and upgrading [[Human resources|manpower]] to meet the challenge of shortfall in technical manpower created by [[Industry|industrial]] and [[economic development]] of the [[country]].

The foundation of applied education and training was laid along with the initiation of [[oil]] [[exploration]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[export]] in [[Kuwait]]. In the 1950s, the State began to establish training centres and organised programmes to prepare the manpower needed for the oil [[industry]]. After building the fundamental structure of the [[educational]] [[system]], the Ministry of Education established a number of specialised [[institutions]] to meet the increasing demand for skilled manpower. The other ministries established their own training centres and institutes as well. The State found it essential to establish a central body to supervise and coordinate the activities of these numerous institutes.

The Technical and [[Vocational Education]] Department was established in 1972 to supervise technical and vocational education. The Central Training Department was established to supervise training centres and institute set up by to State Ministries.

The Technical and Vocational Education Department continued to function until 1982 when the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) was established as an autonomous body to supervise technical and vocational training and envision and implement an overall plan for the sector.

==Objectives==
The goal of PAAET is to [[Social development|develop]] the [[nation]]al technical manpower and to meet [[human]] resource needs of the country through its two sectors: Education and Training.

==Colleges &amp; Institutes==
*'''The applied education sector includes four [[Colleges]], which offers several specialisations:'''

#[[Basic Education College|College of Basic Education]]
#College of Business Studies
#College of Technological Studies
#College of Health Sciences.

*'''Besides the four colleges, there are number of training [[Institutes]] such as:'''

#The Higher Institute of Energy ( Formerly Electricity and Water Institute )
#The Higher Institute of Telecommunication and Navigation ( Formerly Telecommunication and Navigation Institute )
#Industrial Training Institute (Sabah Al-Salem &amp; Shuwaikh)
#Nursing Institute
#Constructional Training Institute
#Vocational Training Institute

==Special Training Courses==
The Authority’s Training Coordination Department offers programs predicated on the requested needs of the various Kuwaiti ministries, state [[institutions]] and the private sector. These differ from the regular programs offered by the [[colleges]] and [[institutes]] of the [[Authority]] in that they are implemented in response to special requests only, and in almost all cases the [[students]] are already in the employed or guaranteed [[employment]] after [[graduation]], by the [[government]] or private sector.  	

*'''Departmental Objectives :'''
The [[Goal|objectives]] of this department are to prepare a well skilled cadre to meet the various and particular needs for manpower as requested by the public and/or the private sector.

*'''Specializations :'''
The very nature of this department is such that the programs offered will depend almost entirely upon the requested needs of the [[government]] and private sectors. Listed below are some of the most often requested programs:-
	
#Under Technical (Engineering and Technology)
#Under Para-Medical
#Under Administrative Secretary ship and Office Work
#Services
#Agriculture

*'''Study System :'''
The programs offered by this department are of varying duration, a matter of weeks or months, while others are of the usual two year institutional span. If they are of two year duration or longer the successful [[Graduation|graduate]] will be granted the normal PAAET diploma, if less than the minimum required for a diploma, they will be granted a certificate of attendance and/or a certificate of participation.

*'''Opportunities :'''
As the [[wikt:participation|participants]] in these programs are already guaranteed employed by the Kuwaiti [[government]] or the private sector, the question of [[employment]] does not arise. However successful completion of one of these programs almost inevitably leads to promotion.

'''''Train Fever''''' is a [[business simulation game]] by Urban Games, funded via the [[crowdfunding]] platform [[Gambitious]] on 20 March 2012 for a total budget of €300,000 and therefore published digitally by [[Gambitious Digital Entertainment]] and to retail by [[Astragon]].

Train Fever was made available for pre-order on 22 July 2014 and released on 4 September. On November 8, 2016 the successor, ''Transport Fever'', was released: it is based on the same engine and has new transport types and larger map sizes.

The game is heavily inspired from other transport simulation games, such as ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'', ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' and ''[[OpenTTD]]''; and, to a lesser extent, ''[[Cities in Motion]]''.

== Funding ==
On 22 June 2012, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that they would need to seek funding in order to be able to develop the final release of their game. It was decided to use a [[Crowd funding|crowd-funding platform]], although no name was given at that time. The first activities on ''Train Fever'''s [[Gambitious]] page were observed on 26 August. The crowd-funding campaign started officially on 1 September 2012. The original funding target was €300 000, split by €20 shares, with an initial [[Equity (finance)#Equity investments|equity]] of 60% for private investors. The deadline was fixed for 1 March 2013, for a total duration of six months.

On 14 October 2012, ''Train Fever'' lead developer announced that everyone investing €40 (2 shares) or more in the project will receive a copy of the final version of the game. On 27 October, a new gameplay video was released and announced on both the Gambitious project page and the official website.

Three months after the beginning of the campaign, on 12 December 2012, the campaign had reached 6.5% completion, with 70 investors and €20,000 invested. On 27 December 2012, ''Train Fever'' was accepted on Valve's [[Steam (software)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]], in the "Concept" section. Reception was very positive, allowing ''Train Fever'' to reach the first page of Steam Greenlight "Top Rated All Time" at beginning of February. At that time, the project was supported by 200 investors on Gambitious.

On 18 February 2013, eleven days before the campaign deadline, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that an institutional investor backed the project for a total of €50,000. As a consequence, several decisions were made:
* The target funding on Gambitious campaign was lowered from €300,000 to €250,000
* The [[Equity (finance)#Equity investments|equity]] for private investors was lowered from 60% to 50%. However, the same ratio of "equity percentage / money invested" was kept (1% of equity for €5,000 invested).
* The campaign deadline was moved to 31 March 2013, in order not to surprise investors with last-minute changes.
* The start of the development was moved to May 2013, with a new expected release date in May 2014.

On 25 February 2013, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that the game will be available at release on [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. On 2 March 2013, €155,000 was invested, with €95,000 remaining to find, and 29 days to the deadline. Finally, on 20 March 2013, the crowd-funding campaign reached its target of €250,000, with 651 investors.

== Development ==
At the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign in September 2012, Train Fever was already in development at a prototype stage. The initial release date was set for May 2014, and pushed back to Q3 2014 at the end of February 2014.

Train Fever was originally developed by two people, Urban and Basil Weber, but the team grew to three developers with two additional artists.

On August 2013, an update explained the major gaming design decisions taken by the team:

* At the beginning, Train Fever was focusing on passenger transport only, but due to requests from the community, it was developed to allow to transport of several cargo goods (coal, iron ore, steel, wood, stock, grain, oil and goods);
* The size of the playable map was enlarged to 256 square kilometers;
* The maximum number of vehicles for the release was set at 30 trains, and more than 30 buses, trucks and streetcars.

Since November 2013, several more updates added content, such as procedurally generated terrain, in addition to improved road and rail systems.

On 22 January 2014, another developer update explained more precisely the in-game freight simulation functions, welcoming feedback on the current implementation from the community. This update listed only six transportable goods out of the nine explained in the "major design decisions" update (stock, grain and steel were no longer listed as goods). Developers explained that this number will likely be increased through downloadable content and community-developed modifications.

The beta test was announced 30 June 2014, and planned between 14 and 24 July. The number of beta testers was limited, and the total number will be split equally between Gambitious supporters and newcomers. The test was done on Windows only, and a [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]] signed by testers.

== Distribution ==
Train Fever is distributed online (on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]]). In German speaking countries, the game is also sold on physical media (published by [[Gambitious]] and [[Astragon|Astragon Software GmbH]]).

== Gameplay ==
The game is a single-player game designed for 20 hours of gameplay in which the story-time runs from 1850 until 2050.

The game takes place in an environment comparable with Europe and the cities are procedurally generated and evolve accordingly. The player builds transport infrastructure like railroads and stations and has to maintain this infrastructure. The player also buys vehicles and creates routes. They need to develop their transport company, eventually becoming a transport empire.

=== Sound ===
The in-game soundtrack, totaling over 70 minutes, is entirely composed by [[Admiral James T.]], a Swiss solo musician from Winterthur.

== Successor ==
On 11 April 2016, Urban Games announced ''Transport Fever'' as a successor to ''Train Fever'', described as a "next generation transport simulation game coming to PC on the 8 November 2016. Players build up a thriving transport company and create complex rail-road-water-air networks. In addition to the genre-typical endless game mode, two historical campaigns offer real world challenges from more than 150 years of transportation history". A video trailer for ''Transport Fever'' was also released on the same day.

The new game was released on November 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/transport-fever|title=Transport Fever|website=Metacritic|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the same engine and has new transport types, larger map sizes and better [[gameplay]].

'''Travellingua''', also known as the '''Language and Culture Explorers’ Club''', is a project which was supported by the [[European Commission]] under Socrates Lingua 1 (Promotion of Language Learning) action.
The project was implemented from 1 November 2006 to 30 September 2008.

==Outputs==
The official website (''www.travellingua.eu'') has 5 main parts:
# LEARN: A linguistic part with the Phrase book and audio material in 5 languages ([[English language|English]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]);
# EXPLORE: a part which gives basic information about 4 countries, their cultures and languages ([[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]);
# SHARE: a part where the material (phrase book and [[MP3]] files) can be downloaded for free and learners share their knowledge and experience in language learning and travelling;
# CONSULT: a linguistic part where any learner can ask a general question about language learning or a specific language (Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish) and get a professional answer from a linguist. Answers then are posted for the general public;
# CONTINUE STUDIES: a part which gives useful links (with free linguistic resources, [[European Union|EU]]-sponsored linguistic projects are presented among them) for those who decide to continue self-studying Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish or to find more information about travelling.

==Results==
As a '''result''' of this project:
* there will be more people having survival-level [[linguistic competence]] of the target languages and being able to use it while travelling or working abroad;
* there will be more people self-studying other European languages (especially from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic group]]);
* less popular European countries and languages will be promoted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">The Tri-State Area '''Tuition Mission Foundation''', popularly known as Tuition Mission or TMF, is a [[scholarship]] foundation located in [[East Liverpool]], [[Ohio]].

==Mission==
The foundation makes [[tuition]] awards to needy area students who want to pursue post-secondary education. Scholarships are made solely based on financial need, and may be used for tuition at a trade school, [[college]] or graduate school.

==History==
Tuition Mission Foundation began as a [[Dollars for Scholars]] chapter. It was incorporated on November 28, 1962.

The chapter made its first tuition awards in 1963. These scholarships totaled $9,750 and were made to 20 needy college-bound students from the school districts of [[East Liverpool]], Beaver Local, Chester-Newell ([[West Virginia]]) and Wellsville.

On May 7, 2013, the board of directors voted to disaffiliate from Dollars for Scholars and its parent organization, [[Scholarship America]]. This was in response to an early 2013 effort by Scholarship America to update standards and practices among all Dollars for Scholars chapters, which number about 1,000 nationwide. Specifically, Scholarship America had decided that it would no longer allow repayments by past recipients.

The Tri-State Area Citizens' Scholarship Foundation chapter of Dollars for Scholars had, from its inception, required that past recipients repay their tuition awards. About half of the monies granted each year come from repayments, so negating that source of funding was unsupported by the board. This fundamental philosophical difference became the impetus for the chapter to disaffiliate and take on the new name of Tuition Mission Foundation.

==Funding and scholarships==
Tuition awards are funded by donations from area residents and former area residents; local businesses and clubs; investment income; and repayments from recipients who have graduated or discontinued their education.

All tuition awards are essentially interest-free loans. Applicants sign a pledge stating that upon graduating or discontinuing their education, they will repay their tuition award. Past recipients determine the pace at which they can comfortably make repayments, and generally do so on a monthly basis.

From 1992 to present, Tuition Mission has put 100% of its income towards scholarships. The only exception to this rule is when a donor asks that his or her contribution be invested. In those cases, the investment income is put towards scholarships. All overhead and administrative costs associated with the foundation are donated by a few generous local supporters.

Since 1963, the foundation has provided tuition awards to over 6,000 individual students, totaling over $6.7 million. For the 2018 - 2019 academic year, awards totaling over $284,950 were made. The top award was $6,000 per student, with the vast majority of recipients receiving this top amount.

==Governing body==
Tuition Mission has a board of directors, representing the seven school districts served by the foundation. There are five officers: president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and alumni vice-president.

==Service area==
Students who reside within seven specific school districts in the tri-state area are eligible to apply. In eastern Ohio, these districts are Beaver Local, East Liverpool and Wellsville. In northern West Virginia, Tuition Mission serves the Oak Glen district (also known as the Hancock County district). In western Pennsylvania, districts served include Midland, South Side and Western Beaver.

Tuition Mission also serves students who attend a number of tri-state area non-traditional schools such as [[Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School]] and the [[Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School]], both in Midland, Pennsylvania, Quaker Digital Academy (headquartered in [[New Philadelphia, Ohio]]) and Buckeye Online School for Success and East Liverpool Christian School, both in East Liverpool. If enrolled in any of these non-traditional schools, applicants must reside in any of the seven school districts served by the foundation.

The '''University Grants Commission''' ('''UGC''') ({{lang-bn|বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় মঞ্জুরী কমিশন}} ''Biśbobidyālaẏ mañjurī komiśan'') of [[Bangladesh]] was established on 16 December 1972. It was created according to the Presidential Order (P.O. No 10 of 1973) of the [[Government of Bangladesh|Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh]]. In 2010, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) announced bringing out reforms in University Grants Commission (UGC) and decided to change UGC into [[Higher Education Commission of Bangladesh]] (HEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/15_16/ber/en/Ch-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308222035/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/15_16/ber/en/Ch-12.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsbangladesh.com/english/details/10341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/city/pm-glorifies-teachers-role-198211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The UGC is the apex body of all the affiliated [[Public University|public]], [[Private University|private]] and [[International university|international]] [[Universities in Bangladesh|universities of Bangladesh]]. It provides fund for "Government Funded Universities" of [[Bangladesh]]. Its mission is to ensure the quality of higher education throughout the country. Private universities must obtain permission from UGC before they operate. 
UGC was designed to maintain the autonomous nature of the universities. The underlying principle is that the Government should not deal directly with the universities, either individually or collectively; instead, it should deal with the UGC, which, in turn, deals directly with the universities.
UGC offers scholarships to outstanding students, funds research, and organizes seminars.

== Administrative structure ==
BUGC consists of the following members:
* [[Chairman]]: [[Abdul Mannan (educator)|Abdul Mannan]]
* Full-time members: 5
* Part-time members: 6
* [[Vice-Chancellor]]s: 2 (by rotation)
* Professors of Universities: 3 (from the universities Vice-Chancellors of which are not members)
* Government nominees: 3 (Secretary, Minister of education, a member of the Planning Commission)
* Representative of the Ministry of Finance: 1 (not below the rank of a secretary)

==Divisions==
* Administrative Division
* Planning and Development Division
* Information Management, Communication and Training Division
* Finance and Accounts Division
* Private Universities Division
* Public Universities Division
* Research and Publication Division
* Strategic Planning, Quality Assurance and Right to Information Division

'''Institute of Scientific Instrumentation''' (ISI) is a subsidiary organ of the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh.

The '''University of Edinburgh School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences''' is a school within the College of Humanities and Social Science at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The School was formed in 2002 as a result of administrative restructuring, when several departments of what was then the Faculty of Arts were brought together. The University of Edinburgh's academic foundation is based on three Colleges containing a total of 22 Schools;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/introduction&lt;/ref&gt; among these is the School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences (PPLS).

The School is composed of three subject areas:
* [[Philosophy]] (ranked 4th in the UK (29th in the world)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp |title=Philosophical Gourmet Report |access-date=22 August 2007 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100813142000/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp |archive-date=13 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Psychology]] (ranked 5th in the UK  (37th in the world)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011/subject-rankings/life-sciences/psychology|2011 QS World University survey]&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Linguistics]] and English Language (LEL) (ranked 1st in the UK in internationally leading research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-results-2008-linguistics|2008 RAE]&lt;/ref&gt;)

It also houses much of the [[Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Ourresearch/ResearchInitiatives/LLHW/ Cross-council Lifelong Health and Well-being initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the School, research in Psychology is organized along 3 broad themes:

* Differential Psychology, which looks at individual differences in the way people think, behave, and feel emotions differently.
* Human Cognitive Neuroscience, which studies memory, attention, executive function, visual memory, sensory integration, and perceptuo-motor control in adults who function normally and those who possess disorders within the nervous system.
* Language Cognition and Communication, which covers topics in linguistic comprehension,  understanding, invention and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research: Psychology|url=http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/psy_research/index.php|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Forestry and Environmental Science  (Yezin)''' ({{lang-my|သစ်တောနှင့်ပတ်ဝန်းကျင်ဆိုင်ရာ တက္ကသိုလ် (ရေဆင်း)}}, {{IPA-my|θɪʔtɔ́ tɛʔkəθò (jèzɪ́ɴ)|pron}}), in [[Yezin]] near [[Nay Pyi Taw]], is the only  [[university]] specialized in [[forestry]] in Myanmar. It mainly offers a five-year [[Bachelor of Science]] degree program in forestry as well as two-year master's and three-year doctoral programs. The university is administered by the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (Myanmar)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation]] and is affiliated with the Forest Research Institute (FRI), a government R&amp;D agency. Undergraduate students are required to take part in a field training program each winter. Graduates of the university typically become forestry officers at the Forestry Department, the Dry Zone Greening Department or the Myanmar Timber Enterprise.

==History==
Forestry education in Myanmar was first offered in [[Yangon University]] since 1920 and the first batch graduated in 1925. In 1982, the forestry study was moved to the Yezin campus, under the purview of the Department of Forestry at the [[Yezin Agricultural University|Yezin Institute of Agriculture]]. In 1992, the Forestry Department was carved out and founded as the '''Institute of Forestry (Yezin)'''. In 2002, it was renamed the '''University of Forestry (Yezin).''' The Bachelor of Science (Forestry) B.Sc. (Forestry) degree program used to take six years to complete; it has since been changed to five years program and recently rescheduled to be 6-year program starting 2014.

==Admissions==
The annual intake of students has always been low. Up to 2005, the intake was only 50.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes13-255/e003.htm | title=A Golden Land of golden opportunities | author=Minh Zaw | date=2005-02-21 | publisher=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; No female students were admitted until 1995.

[[Image:Graz University main-front.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|University of Graz]]
The '''University of Graz Library''' ({{lang-de|Universitätsbibliothek Graz}}), in [[Graz]], Austria is the largest scientific and [[public library]] in [[Styria]] and the third largest in Austria. It holds the right of [[legal deposit]]. It is part of the [[University of Graz]] and consists of the main library, two faculty libraries (for law and social and economic sciences, and for theology) and several branch libraries and is open to the public.

== History ==

=== Jesuit university library ===
[[Image:Graz University-Library reading-room.jpg|thumb|Historical reading room]]
The University of Graz Library owes its origin to the Counter-Reformation. Since 1571 the Jesuits had been pushing the re-catholization in the predominantly Protestant city of Graz according to the wishes of the Archduke [[Charles II of Austria]]. For that reason a [[Jesuit]] college with a school and a library were founded next to the cathedral in 1573. In 1585 this school was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] as a Jesuit University, thus the library came into the status of a university library. It grew rapidly because many books got transferred from monasteries to Graz and because of donations and continuous purchases. The university was more or less a theological faculty, and the library's main focus in purchasing books was also theology – but not necessarily Catholic theology. Natural sciences were well represented due to the influence of the mathematician Paul Guldin, who was one of the university professors. When the Jesuit order was abolished in 1773 the university became a state university.

=== Public university library ===
In 1775 the university was officially founded again by a decree and was put under national control together with its library. However, most of the imperial officials who administrated the university as well as the library were former Jesuits. In 1781 the library was re-opened after several adjustments of its new premises and became open for the public for the first time. Unfortunately, the 28 volume library catalogue was untraceable, it might have been taken away or destroyed by some glowering Jesuits and has never been detected until today. The considerable increase of books from monasteries aggravated the chaos.

=== Lyceum library ===
[[Image:Graz University-Library new-front.jpg|thumb|New front built between 1994 and 1996]]
As well as several other universities the University of Graz was downgraded to the status of [[lyceum]] in 1782 by the emperor [[Josef II, Holy Roman Emperor|Josef II]]. Its collections increased nonetheless.

=== Re-established university library ===
On the 19. April 1827, after 45 years, the old rights were re-confirmed by the emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis I of Austria]]. Since then the university mentions both founders in its name "Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz". Adjunctive to the re-installation was a requirement: the university must not cause any additional costs to the state. Therefore, it stayed dependent on donations and bequests. Only when the number of personnel was raised from 3 to 6 and the endowment from 830 to 4000 guilder in 1870, the university could again accomplish its tasks properly.

=== From the relocation to the end of World War II ===
Due to the limited space at the city centre, a new complex of buildings was erected in the periphery (present day Geidorf) in 1891. The various buildings were opened at different times. Between 9 and 22 September 1895 the library moved 135.000 volumes to the main building of the new university. Its further development in stock increase and administration suffered heavy setbacks in both world wars. 60.000 volumes were evacuated to save them from air raids in 1944. On 22 October 1945 the library was re-opened. 4.500 volumes (including 200 incunabula) had been destroyed during World War II.

=== Latest developments ===
[[Image:Library gallery.jpg|thumb|Gallery of the main reading room]]
The second half of the 20th century is predominantly characterized by constructional changes and progressive decentralisation. In 1950 both stacks situated edgeways behind the reading room got an annex in the south-east. 1970 a new building (of no architectural value whatsoever) was added-on to the old house with a new entrance and hall. From 1994 to 1996 the ReSoWi-Library which accommodates the Law and Social and Economic Sciences Libraries was built. At the same time another building was erected directly attached to the library's original front leaving it unaltered. This addition is exclusively used by the library. Additionally, there were several branch libraries opened in some distance to the main library, e. g. in the Universitätszentrum Wall situated in Merangasse 70. In 1996, a media library for visual media was installed. As a consequence of the university-splitting in 2004, the medical branches became an autonomous university library. Together with the University Libraries of Vienna and Innsbruck Graz has been assuming control of the establishment of national and international consortia installed in order to use electronic journals and books in cooperation and thus more cost-effectively in 1998. On 1 July 2005 the "Cooperation of e-media in Austria" was constituted. The University of Graz Library authoritatively participates in the [[Austrian Literature Online]] project, the digitisation of Austrian literature.

When the library was taken over by the state, it got two employees: the director and a library servant. At the beginning of the 20th century the staff numbered 17, 8 of them being scientific civil servants. At the turn of the millennium the library staff had grown to 120.

The number of books in the old library is historically uncertain. According to one source there were 10.000 volumes in 1773, and according to another one 42.000 in 1776. Another similarly unreliable source counts 50.000 volumes or fewer for the year 1839. A survey in the year 1860 states 38.000 printed works, many of them had more than one volume. In 1879 the library owned about 100.000 volumes, in the first year of the 20th century 200.000. At the turn of the millennium, the actual stocks were almost 3 million printed books, more than 2000 manuscripts, about 1200 [[incunabula]], bequests of many scholars and about 1400 current periodicals.

== Special collections ==

The Special Collections Department holds all manuscripts and works printed up to 1900. Some of the most notable [[parchment]] manuscripts are the five oldest Georgian scripts (7th to 11th century) found in the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]]. Some of the most important paper manuscripts are [[Johannes Kepler]]'s letters to [[Paul Guldin]]. 42 [[papyrus]]-manuscripts from [[Oxyrhynchos]] and Hibeh must also be mentioned. They were found by the British Egypt Exploration Society between 1896 and 1907 and entered into the library's possessions as quid pro quo for the city's financial support of the Society's excavations. Today, the greatest part of these findings is located in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]].

The '''University of Salamanca''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Salamanca}}) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[higher education]] institution, located in the city of [[Salamanca]], west of [[Madrid]], in the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]]. It was founded in 1134 and given the Royal charter of foundation by [[Alfonso IX of León|King Alfonso IX]] in 1218. It is the oldest university in the [[Hispanic world]] and the third oldest university in the entire world [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|still in operation]]. The formal title of "University" was granted by [[Alfonso X of Castile|King Alfonso X]] in 1254 and recognized by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1255.

== History ==
Its origin, like all older universities, was a Cathedral School, whose existence can be traced back to 1130.  The university was founded in 1134 and recognized as a "General School of the Kingdom" by the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] [[Monarch|King]] [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]] in 1218. Granted Royal Chart by King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, as the University of Salamanca this established the rules for organization and [[financial endowment]].

On the basis of a papal bull by [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]] in 1255, which confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X,&lt;ref name="usal"&gt;[http://www.usal.es/web-usal/Ingles/Universidad/Historia/Historia.shtml University of Salamanca, ''A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306231824/http://www.usal.es/web-usal/Ingles/Universidad/Historia/Historia.shtml |date=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the school obtained the title of University.

The historical phrases ''Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat'' (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and ''Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet'' (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centenario.usal.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=144&amp;lang=es VIII Centenario de la Universidad de Salamanca - Reseña Histórica de la Universidad de Salamanca:]. Centenario.usal.es. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reign of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] government was revamped. Contemporary with the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the expulsion of the [[Jews]] and Muslims, and the conquest of [[Granada]], there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of "letrados", i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were "licenciados" (university graduates), particularly, of [[Salamanca]], and the newly founded [[University of Alcalá]]. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the [[Consejo de Indias]] and [[Casa de Contratacion]], the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Empire in the New World]].

While [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. In the next century, the morality of [[colonization]] in the [[West Indies|Indies]] was debated by the [[School of Salamanca]], along with questions of [[economics]], [[philosophy]] and [[theology]].

By the end of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] (c. 1550–1715), the quality of academics in Spanish universities declined. The frequency of the awarding of degrees dropped, the range of studies shrank, and there was a sharp decline in the number of its students. The centuries-old European wide prestige of Salamanca declined.

Like [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Salamanca had a number of colleges (''Colegios Mayores'').  These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the University.  By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them.  Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. Today some have been turned into faculty buildings while others survive as halls of residence.

In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of [[canon law]] and [[theology]].  They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the [[Pontifical University of Salamanca]].

==Related affairs==
The faculty of this university discussed the feasibility of Christopher Columbus's project and the effects his claims brought. Once America was discovered, they discussed the rights of indigenous people as being recognized with full plenitude, which was revolutionary for that period, economic processes were analyzed for the first time and they developed the science of law as it became a classical scholarly focus. It was the period when some of the brightest minds attended the university and it was known as the [[School of Salamanca]]. The school's members renovated theology, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the [[Council of Trent]]. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration were nourished. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, [[Beatriz Galindo]] and Lucía de Medrano, the latter being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.

==Present day==
Salamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other [[Comunidad autonoma|regions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usal.es/webusal/files/Discurso_rector_Inauguracion_09_10_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/07/02/castillayleon/1215017453.html La USAL inaugura los cursos de verano con 2.000 estudiantes extranjeros]. elmundo.es. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cicancer.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León],&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www-incyl.usal.es/ INCyL]. INCyL. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre].

In conjunction with the [[University of Cambridge]], the University of Salamanca co-founded the [[Association of Language Testers in Europe]] (ALTE) in 1989.

In 2018, the institution will celebrate its eighth centennial, for which preparations are currently being made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centenario.usal.es/index.php VIII Centenario de la Universidad de Salamanca - VIII Centenario de la Universidad de Salamanca].

'''Venetta Lee Fields''' (born 1941, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an [[United States|American]] born singer, musical theater actress and vocal coach. She was a [[backing vocalist]] for American and British rock and pop acts of the [[1960s in music|1960s]] and [[1970s in music|1970s]] including [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Elkie Brooks]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Steely Dan]], and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Having emigrated to Australia in 1982 she took dual [[Australian-American]] citizenship. She recorded or toured as a backing singer for Australian artists, [[Richard Clapton]], [[Australian Crawl]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[James Morrison (musician)|James Morrison]] and [[John Farnham]].

==Early career==
Fields was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1941, into a religious family. Her early musical training was from regular gospel performances at church.&lt;ref name="BMHoF Bio"/&gt; Her inspiration was [[Aretha Franklin]]. Fields singing career began with the Templaires, a group she formed with members of her church, followed by the Corinthian Gospel Singers.&lt;ref name="BMHoF Bio"/&gt; In late 1961 [[Ike and Tina Turner]] Revue were playing in Buffalo; Fields successfully auditioned as a new member of Tina's backing vocalists, [[the Ikettes]].&lt;ref name="BMHoF Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Fields joined the revue in addition to backing Tina in performance and on recordings.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

She is recorded on singles by the Ikettes, including "Peaches 'N' Cream" (1965), and was given some solo songs on live recordings, such as "You're My Baby" (1963), "The Love of My Man" (November 1964), "I Know (You Don't Love Me no More)" (February 1965) and "Good Time Tonight" (February 1965).&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ikettes-mn0000085095/biography | title = The Ikettes &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History | last = Hamilton | first = Andrew | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | accessdate = June 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Second Hand"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://secondhandsongs.com/artist/63458/covers#nav-entity | title = Cover versions by Venetta Fields | work = SecondHandSongs | accessdate = 8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby Jane a Canadian DJ described "Peaches 'N' Cream" on ''WeFunk Radio'' as "a boisterous romp of a '60s R&amp;B tune about the joys and perils of young love... It could be called schoolyard soul, with girls in pigtails chanting it as they play [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|Double Dutch]]. The harmonica playfully echoes the line peaches and cream, and the throaty ah, ah, ah at the top of the chorus is delivered with a raucous enthusiasm that shouts at you to get on the dance floor. This is one of those girl-group anthems that’s fun and rowdy and fills you with sweet, sweet joy."&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/forgotten-treasures-ikettes-peaches-cream | title = Forgotten Treasures: The Ikettes 'Peaches "N" Cream' (1965) | last = Jane | first = Ruby | work = WeFunk Radio: Music Is My Sanctuary | date = August 5, 2014| accessdate = June 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ike Turner moved his base to Los Angeles and, in 1966, Fields left the revue, along with fellow Ikettes: Jessie Smith and Robbie Montgomery.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Fields later recalled "I was an Ikette for five years. It was a rough job, but it was a very good experience. It's just like a school. You go from grade 1 to 2, not from 1 to 8. And when you graduate you have to leave. There is such a thing as staying too long; when you start getting stagnant and stifled by what you're doing.

Fields worked as a session vocalist from about 1969, often with [[Clydie King]] and [[Sherlie Matthews]], for [[Quincy Jones]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Tim Buckley]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Elkie Brooks]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Burton Cummings]].&lt;ref name="AMG Credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/venetta-fields-mn0000264297/credits | title = Venetta Fields &amp;#124; Credits | publisher = AllMusic | accessdate = 8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others: [[Diana Ross]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Supremes]], and for [[Aretha Franklin]] – her mentor and inspiration. Notable performances during this time included ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (September 1975) with [[Pink Floyd]], and recording [[the Rolling Stones]]' album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (May 1972).&lt;ref name="AMG Credits"/&gt; Fields later reflected on her sessions for the latter album, they were at midnight but she wanted money for clothing, "I was more interested in the coat than I was in the Rolling Stones".&lt;ref name="Shedden"/&gt; With King, she sang on four tracks, "[[Tumbling Dice]]", "[[I Just Want to See His Face]]", "[[Let It Loose (song)|Let It Loose]]" and "[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones song)|Shine a Light]]", which she felt "were wonderful songs and they were just right for us... We knew gospel. That's what most people wanted from us, a gospel sound."&lt;ref name="Shedden"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/venetta-fields-hangs-her-coat-on-exile-on-main-street-session/story-e6frg8n6-1225866216741 | title = Venetta Fields embraces Exile on Main Street session legacy | last = Shedden | first = Iain | work = [[The Australian]] | date = May 13, 2010 | accessdate = June 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1971, Fields, King, and Matthews formed the Blackberries, with Matthews as producer and songwriter as well as vocalist. When backing [[Ray Charles]], the trio worked as [[the Raelettes]]. In 1972 [[Steve Marriott]] asked them to record and tour with his band, [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], and produced an unreleased Blackberries LP with Humble Pie as the backing band – they parted company in 1973. Michael Little of ''Vinyl District'' reviewed ''[[Eat It (Humble Pie album)|Eat It]]'' (April 1973), which showed Humble Pie "at its most eclectic. Each of its four sides emphasized a different aspect of the band, and the concept works."&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt; He described the track, "Get Down to It", which "makes maximum use of the band’s backing singers" including "the immortal" Fields.&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2015/05/graded-on-a-curve-humble-pie-eat-it/ | title = Graded on a Curve: Humble Pie, ''Eat It'' | last = Little | first = Michael H | work = The Vinyl District | date = May 29, 2015 | accessdate = June 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields and King acted as [[Barbra Streisand]]'s backing singers (The Oreos) in the 1976 musical film, ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (December 1976), and sang on its associated [[A Star Is Born (1976 soundtrack)|film soundtrack]] (November 1976).&lt;ref name="AMG Credits"/&gt; Fields had previously sung on two of Streisand's albums from 1971.&lt;ref name="AMG Credits"/&gt;

==Career in Australia==

As a member of [[Boz Scaggs]] backing band, Fields toured Australia in 1978 and 1980. While in the country in the latter year she contributed backing vocals to [[Marc Hunter]]'s (ex-[[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]) solo album, ''Big City Talk''.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46456217 | title = Moore on Pop | newspaper = [[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | volume = 48 | issue = 25 | date = November 19, 1980 | accessdate = June 8, 2016 | page = 54 | via = National Library of Australia }} Note: Fields is incorrectly given as Vanetta.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the US she provided backing vocals for ''[[So Lucky (Renée Geyer album)|So Lucky]]'' (December 1981), by [[Renée Geyer]] – the Australian artist was then working in California.&lt;ref name="Raffaele"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126863583 | title = Rock Music: Powerful, Emotive | newspaper = [[The Canberra Times]] | volume = 56 | issue = 16,873 | date = December 7, 1981 | accessdate = June 8, 2016 | page = 12 | via = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields decided to relocate permanently to Australia in 1982, "I had all that experience and a good reputation but I felt like I was stuck in a stereotyped box... I needed to do something else and I had to get away to somewhere where I could start again."&lt;ref name="Shedden"/&gt;

Fields continued to work with US artists when they toured her adopted country until 2000, including [[George Benson]], [[Dionne Warwick]], Streisand, [[Thelma Houston]], and [[Randy Crawford]]. She also recorded or toured as a backing singer with Australian artists, [[Richard Clapton]] (1983–84), [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[Australian Crawl]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[James Morrison (musician)|James Morrison]], Mark Gillespie (Australian singer), and as a long-term touring and session harmony vocalist for [[John Farnham]] (1986–95).&lt;ref name="Holmgren"&gt;Venetta Fields entries at [[Australian Rock Database]]:

&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Lade of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' reviewed Clapton's album, ''Solidarity'' (September 1984), and described its final track, "New World", as "It's a song that's slow and softly lulling. A song of peace and hope... and Clapton's voice is at its tuneful best. And the backing vocals of Vanetta Fields add a powerful and echoing dimension to what may be just the album's finest song."&lt;ref name="Lade"/&gt;

In the mid-1980s in Melbourne, Fields formed a new group, Venetta's Taxi, with a line-up including vocalist Sherlie Matthews, guitarist [[Michael den Elzen]], and [[Chong Lim]] on keyboards, while also performing regularly as a backing vocalist for local and touring artists. During this period Fields coached singing, including [[Karen Knowles]] and [[Colette Mann]], at Tony Bartuccio's Dance Academy in [[Prahran]]. She took vocal workshops at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]].

Fields and Farnham were both guest vocalists with [[The Incredible Penguins]] in late 1985, for a [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]", a charity project for research on [[little penguin]]s, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;10 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] in December.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970–1992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book Ltd|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives, NSW]]|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}} NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] created their own [[ARIA Charts|charts]] in mid-1988.

==Musical theatre==
In January 1989 Fields made her musical theater debut as Alice in the Australian production of ''[[Big River (musical)|Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney]].&lt;ref name="AusStage"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/214172 | title = Contributor: Venetta Fields | last = | first = | work = | publisher = AusStage | accessdate = June 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed with other stage appearances including two plays for the [[Melbourne Theatre Company]] – ''Racing Demon'' (April 1991) and ''[[The Crucible]]'' (May 1991)&lt;ref name="AusStage"/&gt; – ''[[Blues in the Night (musical)|Blues in the Night]]'' (August, October 1992),&lt;ref name="AusStage"/&gt; ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' (concert version), and as Ruby in the [[Buddy Holly]] show ''Buddy the Musical''.

'''''Victoria II''''' is a [[grand strategy game]] developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]]. It was announced on August 19, 2009, and released on August 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="ignsum" /&gt;

[[Virtual Programming]] published the Mac OS X version of the game on September 17, 2010.&lt;ref name=VP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.com/news/victoria-ii-released |title=Victoria 2 Released |date=September 17, 2010 |publisher=[[MacGamer]] |accessdate=2010-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714014539/http://www.macgamer.com/news/victoria-ii-released |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The game was localized for Russia by [[1C Company]] and Snowball Studios.&lt;ref name="snowball"/&gt;

Like its [[Victoria:_An_Empire_Under_the_Sun|predecessor]], ''Victoria II'' allows for the player to take control of and manage a [[19th century|19th-century]] state, including its political, diplomatic, economic, military, and technological aspects. The game has many historical aspects to it, such as the ability to [[Colonization|colonize]] places that, at the time, were not under the control of any European power, such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Western Canada|North-Western Canada]]. The time frame of the game is 1836-1936.

The game gives a lot of importance to the economy of a country by having a complex [[market system]] with over 50 types of goods and [[factories]].&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; While warfare is a component of the game it is not the primary focus as in other Paradox Interactive games such as the [[Hearts of Iron]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=445988  Developer Diary 3 – Design Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126053851/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=445988 |date=2010-01-26 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations' populations are divided into [[cultures]], [[religions]], and [[Employment|occupations]]. There are several different population groups or "pops" including aristocrats, officers, clergy, capitalists, clerks, craftsmen, soldiers, laborers, and farmers. ''Victoria II'' introduces two new groups, [[artisan]]s and bureaucrats. As in other Paradox titles, like [[Europa Universalis]], historical missions called "decisions" that are micro-objectives in the larger game have been added. There are thousands of historical events and decisions as well.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; These events and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] forces can lead to the creation or disintegration of nation states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=451973  A Paradox Christmas Carol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201192103/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=451973 |date=2010-02-01 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

''Victoria II'' contains a number of changes and improvements from its predecessor. The interface was streamlined when compared to the original game, which was described by producer [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]] as, "the interface God forgot".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud79BkQ4vOI Victoria II interview], Youtube&lt;/ref&gt; Automation of various tasks has been added, including trade and population promotion. The [[Education|education system]] has received an overhaul by having clergy educate people of the same religion, and each population group now has their own [[literacy]] levels. Education and literacy's importance is reflected in the vast technology system that contains thousands of inventions.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; Additionally, the functioning of ideology in the game was tweaked such that population groups are more sensitive to changes in their country's situation, as well as inclined to agitate for specific levels of political and social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=460203  Developer Diary 11 - PoPs &amp; Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215080451/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=460203 |date=2010-02-15 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
The economic system in ''Victoria II'' attempts to simulate the flow of resources in a world market. Every province in the game produces a resource in resource gathering operations (RGOs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=447243 Dev Diary 4 - The Economic System and why it may seem a little similar], Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt; Some resources, such as [[wheat]], are demanded principally by the population. Other materials, like [[iron]], are consumed primarily by industry, but are still tradeable.

The production and [[unemployment]] system from the original Victoria has been revised to better reflect market forces, whereas in the original the state provided the funds for resources and the player possessed a wide range of options with which to build their economy, provided they had access to the proper raw materials. All resources can be collected or produced by industry. The game also has a cottage production system simulating [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]].&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

=== Diplomacy ===
''Victoria II'' contains a deep [[political simulation]] reflected in 8 different types of governments, 7 ideologies and a new [[sphere of influence]] system, [[gunboat diplomacy]], and a new election system with [[Coalition government|coalition governments]] and legislatures.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

The diplomacy in ''Victoria II'' is similar to that of other Paradox titles. Each country has a relation value of –200 to +200 which represents how much they like each other. Diplomatic and in game actions shift this relationship around and it factors into the AI's decisions. However, Paradox Interactive has expanded parts of this system. War goals from [[Europa Universalis III|Heir to the Throne]], an expansion for [[Europa Universalis III]] have been integrated though they function in a slightly different way. More war goals can be added as the war progresses, although this does affect the population's temperament. Failure to achieve a war goal will increase the population's militancy, which can lead to revolts.

In the game controlling a [[Great Power]], one of the eight countries with highest total score, gives special diplomatic options not available to other countries. Great Powers do not just influence how a country sees them; they have the added ability to use their influence on other countries to change their perception of other Great Powers. The struggle for influence that the Great Powers wage around the world is not a simple bilateral basis but occurs with each other inside different countries, giving an added dimension to diplomacy which was not present in the original Victoria.

=== Warfare ===
Warfare is regarded as a lesser priority than politics and economics in ''Victoria II'', though it follows the basic pattern used in other Paradox grand strategy games, with armies moving between provinces and engaging enemy armies and capturing enemy territory.  The basic combat system is a combination of the systems used in [[Europa Universalis III]], [[Europa Universalis: Rome]], and [[Hearts of Iron III]].  A key component to combat is "frontage": the number of units in an army at the [[front line]], which decreases as technology improves to simulate the change from the roving armies of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic Era]] to the continuous trench lines of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="warfare"&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?p=10788944#post10788944 Developer Diary 12 - Military], Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt;

Several aspects of the military have been changed from ''Victoria''.  The base unit has been reduced from a 10,000-unit [[Division (military)|division]] to a 3,000-unit [[brigade]], which is no longer raised from a national manpower pool but directly raised from a provincial soldier POP, to which the brigade remains connected.  A new aspect to the military is [[reconnaissance]].  This is a value that gives a bonus (or penalty, if low) to capturing provinces and defeating enemy armies; in prolonged combat, however, the reconnaissance value drops.  Units such as cavalry and aeroplanes have high reconnaissance values and are intended to be used as scouts.&lt;ref name="warfare" /&gt;

== Development ==
The decision to create ''Victoria II'' was influenced by voting on the Paradox Interactive forums and debate within the company. The CEO of Paradox Interactive, [[Fredrik Wester]], publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]] were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=424492 A small note from a guy who didn't vote for this project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826194645/http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=424492 |date=2009-08-26 }}, Paradox Plaza&lt;/ref&gt; This belief stemmed from [[Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun|the first game's]] lackluster sales numbers.  It was revealed in a German interview with Fredrik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.makinggames.biz/features/im-gespr%C3%A4ch-mit-paradox-interactive,2540.html Im Gespräch mit Paradox Interactive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008173454/http://www.makinggames.biz/features/im-gespr%C3%A4ch-mit-paradox-interactive,2540.html |date=2014-10-08 }}, Making Games&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2010, [[Jessica Chobot]] from [[IGN]] shaved it off for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitpic.com/1xma93 Jessica Chobot shaving Frederik's head] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621220205/http://twitpic.com/1xma93 |date=2010-06-21 }}, [[Twitpic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions and mods==
''Victoria II'' has received two main expansion packs, as well as numerous other smaller additions. It was released before Paradox's current DLC plan was used, so differs from games such as ''Europa Universalis IV'' and ''Crusader Kings II'' in regards to this.

Many players consider the expansions to be essential to gaining full enjoyment from the game, going as far as to dismiss ''Victoria II'' without expansions as unplayable; having added not only new content and mechanics, but also significant user experience improvements like the ability to queue unit production, move/select units, and transport these over water (a common complaint addressed in early releases of Paradox titles such as CK2 and EU4 which Paradox has subsequently patched).{{Citation Needed|date=April 2018}}

Victoria II received generally favourable reviews, achieving a 75% average on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria II for PC Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/656PCxHrd?url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-ii|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]] said that there was much less [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] than in its predecessor. The reviewer stated: "Thanks to a friendlier interface and tutorials, Victoria II is a lot more playable and enjoyable than its predecessor."&lt;ref name=GameSpot&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/victoriaii/review.html Gamespot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906112943/http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/victoriaii/review.html |date=September 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameShark]] was less enthusiastic. The reviewer said: "As a strategy game, Victoria II frustrates me. It is an orgy of detail for detail's sake, yet the information I really want never seems to be at hand. The decisions I make seem mostly inconsequential, changing the game only by a slow process of accretion. Modeling has overtaken game design. Watching Victoria II is hypnotic and frequently awe-inspiring.

== Sequel ==

In an Ask Me Anything thread on [[reddit]] in October 2013, PDS manager Johan Andersson stated that they would consider making a sequel to ''Victoria II'', but that this would likely come after ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1p272v/we_are_the_independent_publisher_developer/ccyid2x|title=AMA Hearts of Iron 4|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=2013-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401160155/http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1p272v/we_are_the_independent_publisher_developer/ccyid2x|archivedate=1 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a beta patch was made for ''Victoria II'', long after it was assumed that no further patches would be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria 2 - 3.04 BETA PATCH - Merry Christmas!|url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/victoria-2-3-04-beta-patch-merry-christmas.898844/|website=Paradox Plaza|accessdate=28 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403043640/https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads%2Fvictoria-2-3-04-beta-patch-merry-christmas.898844%2F|archivedate=3 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted speculation that there could be refreshed interest in the ''Victoria'' series, although in a Reddit thread these rumours were played down by Paradox developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria 2 - 3.04 BETA PATCH|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3xuebw/victoria_2_304_beta_patch/?|website=Reddit|accessdate=28 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129012724/https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3xuebw/victoria_2_304_beta_patch/|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview for the company’s Paradox Podcast on February 2018, CEO Fredrik Wester mentioned "I'm not a firm believer that Victoria II is the most prioritised game to make a sequel out of", that he won't be the one making the decision either and that it would come "before 2025".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Paradox Podcast S02E02 - The Ascension of Fred (with Guest: Fred Wester) |url=https://www.buzzsprout.com/164561/665610 |website=buzzsprout |publisher=Paradox Interactive |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilderness Therapy and Backpacking.jpg|thumb|650x650px|Backpackers at a wilderness therapy program]]
'''Wilderness therapy''' (also known as ''outdoor behavioral healthcare'') is an [[adventure therapy|adventure-based therapy]] [[treatment modality]] for [[behavior modification]] and interpersonal self-improvement, combining [[experiential education]], individual and group therapy in a wilderness setting. The success of the [[Outward Bound]] [[outdoor education]] program in the 1940s inspired the approach taken by many current-day wilderness therapy programs, though some adopted a [[survivalist]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis-Berman|first=Jennifer|author2=Berman, Dene S. |title=Therapeutic wilderness programs: Issues of professionalization in an emerging field|journal=Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy|date=1 January 1993|volume=23|issue=2|pages=127–134|doi=10.1007/BF00952173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clients typically range in age from 10–17 for adolescents, and 18–28 for adults.

==Overview==
The New York Asylum and the San Francisco Agnew Asylum played an early role in the development of wilderness therapy, drawing upon the philosophies of [[Kurt Hahn]]. Although the therapy is often used for [[behavior modification]] by the families of young people, the aims and methods of wilderness therapy do not center on behavior modification.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Pioneers in the Industry ==
The pioneers in the field of wilderness therapy include Larry D. Olsen and Ezekiel C. Sanchez at [[Brigham Young University]]; Nelson Chase, Steven Bacon, and others at the Colorado Outward Bound School; Rocky Kimball at Santa Fe Mountain Center and others. Madolyn M. Liebing, Ph.D. (of Aspen Achievement then, and currently of Journey Wilderness) was the first clinical psychologist to integrate clinical therapy with wilderness programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adventure Therapy: Theory, Practice, and Research|date=2012|publisher=Routledge/Bruner-Mazel Press.|chapter=Chapter 2: "A History of Adventure Therapy"|last1=White|first1=W.|editor1-last=Gass|editor1-first=M|editor2-last=Gillis|editor2-first=L.|editor3-last=Russell|editor3-first=K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Given the proliferation of such programs, lax regulation, and absence of research setting uniform standards of care across programs, advocates have called on increased accountability to ensure programs are capable of providing care that is consistent with their marketing claims.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web |author= GAO |title= Residential Treatment Programs - Concerns Regarding Abuse and Death in Certain Programs for Troubled Youth, Statement of Gregory D.

Some programs which advertise as "wilderness therapy" are actually [[boot camp (correctional)|boot camps]] in a wilderness environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wildernesstherapy.org/Wilderness/WildernessVsBoot.htm |title= Wilderness Therapy Programs and Boot Camps: Is there a Difference? |publisher= www.wildernesstherapy.org |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |last= Conner |first= Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can sometimes be distinguished from other wilderness therapy by such programs promising [[behavior modification]] for troubled teens, but it is hard to tell just from the ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2008 |url= http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1509/ |title= Characterization and Comparative Analysis of Adolescents Admitted to Therapeutic Wilderness Programs and More Traditional Treatment Settings |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |last= Jeppson |first= Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences between boot camps and wilderness therapy is the underlying philosophical assumptions (wilderness therapy being driven by the philosophy of [[experiential education]] and theories of psychology and boot camps being informed by a military model). Additionally, most wilderness therapy programs have highly trained clinical staff either on the expedition or in active and ongoing consultation with the team. Boot camps may have no clinically trained staff working in the programs. Some staff members are from a correctional or military background. Nevertheless, incidents of alleged and confirmed abuse and death of youth, have been widely reported across many wilderness programs claiming to provide a less coercive environment than that of boot camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hcn.org/issues/61/1913 |title= The rise and fall of Steve Cartisano |publisher= High Country News |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |date= 1998-06-10 |last= Smith |first= Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry reports that, as with any type of treatment program, abusive situations have been reported and accidental deaths have taken place in some of these programs, but that compared with similar outdoor adventure activities deaths are extremely rare. These assertions cannot be independently verified due to inadequate regulation, poor monitoring, and a pattern of unreported deaths and state failure to prosecute offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cafety.org/privately-funded-programs/321-wilderness-school-counselor-charged-in-death-of-camper-or-obsidian-trails-august-2000 |title=Wilderness School Counselor Charged in Death of Camper |publisher=The Oregonian |date=2000 |accessdate= 2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cafety.org/privately-funded-programs/766-loving-them-to-death |title= Loving Them to Death |publisher=Outside Magazine |year=1995 |accessdate= 2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cafety.org/about-us/cafetymission/the-problem |title= The Problem |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2008/06/under-radar-child-abuse-bill-swap |title=Under the Radar |publisher=Mother Jones |last=Szalavitz |first =Maia |year= 2008 |accessdate= 2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/65114062.html |title=Investigation Suggests Boy’s Death a Homicide|publisher=KATU |year= 2009 |accessdate= 2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also controversy over whether parents should be allowed to make their child attend a wilderness therapy program by force, as is often the case. Apart from the thousands spent on the actual program (around $500/day), some parents pay a [[teen escort company]] thousands to ensure their child gets to the program by any means necessary, without the child's consent or foreknowledge. Generally the "transfer" occurs at night, when children are disoriented. Due to the trauma and alleged harm reported by former wilderness program residents who have been forcibly escorted into placement, psychologists have heavily criticized this approach as inappropriate, and grossly inconsistent with establishing the necessary trust required for building a therapeutic relationship between youth and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3ye8YB109M&amp;list=PL92FE4010DF42541C&amp;index=3 |title= Congressional Testimony: Hearings on Residential Treatment Programs: Concerns Regarding Abuse and Death in Certain Programs for Troubled Youth |publisher= Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives |accessdate= 2013-08-15 |last= Pinto |first= Dr Alison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountability==

October 2007 and April 2008, the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] convened hearings to address report of widespread and systemic abuse. In relationship with the hearing, they have issued a report about the wilderness therapy industry.&lt;ref name="GAO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEE758B17681E3F1F|title=Congressional Hearings on Child Abuse and Deceptive Marketing by Residential Programs for Teens|year=2008|publisher=Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives|accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Trade Commission has published a [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0185-residential-treatment-programs-teens list of questions] for parents to ask when considering a wilderness program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0185-residential-treatment-programs-teens|title=FTC|year=2009|accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs seeking additional accreditation and certification often pursue partnerships and memberships with associations such as;

* [https://obhcouncil.com/ The Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Council] 
* [https://www.iecaonline.com/ Independent Educational Consultant Association]

* [https://www.bbb.org/ The Better Business Bureau]
* [https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles Leave No Trace Center for Backcountry Ethics]
* [[Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth]]

==After the program==
Independent researchers have called into questions industry claims, criticizing the industry's use of 'bad science' due to methodological flaws in the research and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astartforteens.org/dangers-of-teen-wilderness-programs |author=ASTART|title=Dangers of Wilderness Programs |accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a wilderness therapy program, students may return home or may be transferred to a [[therapeutic boarding school]], young adult program or an intensive [[residential treatment center]]. Some estimate that 40% of children enrolled in wilderness programs are later sent to long-term residential behavioral care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astartforteens.org/dangers-of-teen-wilderness-programs |title=Summary of Research from 1999 – 2006 and Update to 2000 Survey of Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Programs in North America Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Research Cooperative |publisher=ASTART |last=Russell, Ph.D|first=Keith C.|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
