'''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.

Materials include M50 tool steel (AMS6491), carbon chrome steel (AMS6444), the corrosion resistant AMS5930, 440C stainless steel, silicon nitride (ceramic) and titanium carbide-coated 440C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bearing steels: into the 21st century|author1=J. J. C. Hoo|author2=Willard B. Green|pages=355–358|publisher=ASTM International|year=1998|isbn=0-8031-2421-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, special attention is given to the material specification, non-destructive testing, and to the traceability of the bearing (a system of documents that enables an engineer to trace a bearing, typically back to its manufacturing batch and material supply).

==Design==
When designing aerospace bearings, it is important to take a few things into account, including:

*material standard
*design
*[[lubrication]] type
*surface coatings and treatments
*non-destructive testing
*traceability

In order to assure bearing performance, it is necessary for the bearing steel to be of high quality. Jet engine bearings are typically manufactured from metals manufactured using a vacuum arc remelt to enable material requirements to be met.

Jet engine shaft bearings and accessory drive shaft bearings typically use single piece or two piece machined retainers. The pressed steel or moulded retainers found on mass-produced bearings are not used.

Temperature and moisture resistant oils, greases and lubricants are normally specified.  If the lubricant is not correct the performance of the bearing will be compromised.

==Application==
In jet engines bearings can operate at over 200 degrees Celsius (400 °F) and at speeds over 10,000 rpm for the turbine shafts to over 30,000 rpm in the accessory drives. In wing control surface applications temperatures as low as {{convert|-55|C|F|0}} may be encountered.

==Monitoring==
Bearings are a vital factor in many products and assemblies and their performance is often monitored continuously. In jet engines the oil supply is monitored to detect the presence of metallic debris that could identify a failure either of the bearings or of other components whose failure may contaminate the bearings.

'''{{lang|la|Anno Mundi}}''' ([[Latin]] for "in the year of the world"; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|לבריאת העולם}}, "to the creation of the world"), abbreviated as '''AM''', or '''Year After Creation''',&lt;ref name=YearAfterCreationChronology /&gt; is a [[calendar era]] based on the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world and subsequent history. Two such calendar eras have seen notable use historically:
*The [[Byzantine calendar]] was used  in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many Christian Orthodox countries and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and was based on the [[Septuagint]] text of the Bible. That calendar is similar to the [[Julian calendar]] except that its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is equivalent to 1 September 5509 BC on the [[Julian proleptic calendar]].
*Since the Middle Ages, the [[Hebrew calendar]] has been based on rabbinic calculations of the year of creation from the Hebrew [[Masoretic text]] of the bible. This calendar is used within Jewish communities for religious and other purposes. On the Hebrew calendar, the day begins at sunset. The calendar's epoch, corresponding to the calculated date of the world's creation, is equivalent to sunset on the Julian proleptic calendar date 6 October 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author1-link=Nachum Dershowitz|last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |author2-link=Edward M. Reingold|title=Calendrical Calculations |edition=1st |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |ISBN=0-521-56474-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new year begins at [[Rosh Hashanah]], roughly in September. Year ''anno mundi'' {{#time:xjY}}, or AM {{#time:xjY}}, began at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum}}-1 day}} on the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=13&amp;gm=9&amp;gy=2015&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=1&lt;/ref&gt;

While differences in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some differences in the creation date, most results fall relatively close to one of these two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Patriarchs from Adam to [[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]], are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint&lt;ref name=LXX5&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 5|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/5.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LXX11&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 11|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/11.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than they were in the Latin [[Vulgate]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|5|4}}; {{bibleref|Genesis|11|4}}) or the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] ({{bibleref|Gen|5|JPR}}; {{bibleref|Gen|11|JPR}}). The net difference between the two major [[genealogies of Genesis]] is 1466 years (ignoring the "second year after the flood" ambiguity), 85% of the total difference. (See [[Dating creation]].)

==Jewish tradition==
{{see| Hebrew calendar}}
During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th centuries AD, the center of the Jewish world was in the Middle East, primarily in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academies of Babylonia]] and [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel|Israel]]. Jews in these regions used [[Seleucid Era]] dating (also known as the "Anno Graecorum (AG)" or the "Era of Contracts") as the primary method for calculating the calendar year.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvVPlyYjX7YC&amp;pg=PA295 Chronology of the Old Testament, Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones] "When the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries AD, calculations from the Seleucid era became meaningless. Over those centuries, it was replaced by that of the ''anno mundi'' era of the ''Seder Olam''. From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the writings of [[Josephus]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees]] used Seleucid Era dating exclusively, and the [[Talmud]] tractate [[Avodah Zarah]] states:
{{quote|[[Rav]] [[Aha b. Jacob]] then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all? Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand? In that case, the document is really post-dated!

Said [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used. He [the questioner] thought that Rav Nahman wanted to dispose of him anyhow, but when he went and studied it thoroughly he found that it is indeed taught [in a [[Baraita]]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atenebris Adsole |url=http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_10.html |title=Avodah Zarah, tractate 10 |publisher=Halakhah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Occasionally in Talmudic writings, reference was made to other starting points for eras, such as Destruction Era dating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_9.html Avodah Zarah, tractate 9] Footnote: "The Eras in use among Jews in Talmudic Times are: (a) ERA OF CONTRACTS [H] dating from the year 380 before the Destruction of the Second Temple (312–1 BC) when, at the Battle of Gaza, Seleucus Nicator, one of the followers of Alexander the Great, gained dominion over Palestine. It is also termed Seleucid or Greek Era [H]. Its designation as Alexandrian Era connecting it with Alexander the Great (Maim. Yad, Gerushin 1, 27) is an anachronism, since Alexander died in 323 BC — eleven years before this Era began (v. E. Mahler, Handbuch der judischen Chronologie, p. 145). This Era, which is first mentioned in Mac. I, 10, and was used by notaries or scribes for dating all civil contracts, was generally in vogue in eastern countries till the 16th cent, and was employed even in the 19th cent, among the Jews of Yemen, in South Arabia (Eben Saphir, Lyck, 1866, p. 62b). (b) THE ERA OF THE DESTRUCTION (of the Second Temple) [H] the year 1 of which corresponds to 381 of the Seleucid Era, and 69–70 of the Christian Era. This Era was mainly employed by the Rabbis and was in use in Palestine for several centuries, and even in the later Middle Ages documents were dated by it. One of the recently discovered Genizah documents bears the date 13 Tammuz 987 after the Destruction of the Temple — i.e. 917 C.E. — (Op. cit. p. 152, also Marmorstein ZDMG, Vol. VI, p. 640). The difference between the two Eras as far as the tens and units are concerned is thus 20. If therefore a Tanna, say in the year 156 Era of Dest. (225 C.E.), while remembering, naturally, the century, is uncertain about the tens and units, he should ask the notary what year it is according to his — Seleucid — era. He will get the answer 536 (156 + 380), on adding 20 to which he would get 556, the last two figures giving him the year [1] 56 of the Era of Destruction."&lt;/ref&gt; being the number of years since the AD 70 [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]], and the number of years since the [[dating Creation|Creation year]] based on the calculation in the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] of Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] in about AD 160.&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Kantor&lt;/ref&gt; By his calculation, based on the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created on 1st of Tishrei ([[Rosh Hashanah]] Day 1) in 3760 BC,&lt;ref name=BirthdayAdamEve&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday of Adam &amp; Eve (3760 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/150485/jewish/Adam-Eve.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creation&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation (3761 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/156820/jewish/Creation.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishYear&gt;"To find the corresponding Jewish year for any year on the Gregorian calendar, add 3760 to the Gregorian number, if it is before Rosh Hashanah.

In the 8th and 9th centuries AD, the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, so calculations from the Seleucid era "became meaningless".&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities, replacing the Seleucid dating system.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era, Alden A. Mosshammer |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system reached its definitive form in AD 1178 when [[Maimonides]] completed the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. In the section ''Sanctification of the Moon'' (11.16), he wrote of his choice of Epoch, from which calculations of all dates should be made, as "the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world" (March 22, AD 1178).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Gandz, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3622160 Date of Composition of Maimonides Code], ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', 17 (1947–1948), pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He included all the rules for the calculated calendar epoch and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, and establishing the final formal usage of the ''anno mundi'' era.

The first year of the Jewish calendar, Anno Mundi 1 (AM 1), began about one year before Creation, so that year is also called the Year of emptiness. The first five days of Jewish Creation week occupy the last five days of AM 1, Elul 25–29. The sixth day of Creation, when [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created, is the first day of AM 2, [[Rosh Hashanah]] (1 Tishrei). Its associated [[molad]] Adam (molad VaYaD) occurred on Day 5 (yom Vav) at 14 (Yud Daled) hours (and 0 parts). A year earlier, the first day of AM 1, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), is associated with [[molad tohu#Anno Mundi|molad tohu]] (new moon of chaos), so named because it occurred before Creation when everything was still chaotic — it is also translated as the new moon of nothing. This is also called molad BaHaRaD, because it occurred on Day 2 (yom Beis), 5 (Hei) hours, 204 (RaD) parts (11:11:20 pm). Because this is just before midnight when the Western day begins, but after 6 pm when the Jewish calendrical day begins (equivalent to the next tabular day with the same daylight period), its Julian calendar date is 6/7 October 3761 BC (Gregorian: 6/7 September 3761 BC or −3760).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://strangeside.com/calendar-when-does-it-start/ | title=Calendar — when does it start | website=strangeside.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/hebrew.php | title=The Hebrew Calendar | last=Tøndering | first=Claus | date=2014 | website=www.tondering.dk | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hebrewcalendar.tripod.com/luachmail.html#029 | title=Is Creation at AM 1 or AM 2? | last=Landau | first=Remy | date=February 16, 2005 | website=hebrewcalendar.tripod.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek tradition==
[[File:Bevis Marks Synagogue P6110036.JPG|thumb|The inscription over the [[Bevis Marks Synagogue]], [[City of London]], gives a year in Anno Mundi (5461) and [[Anno Domini]] (1701).]]
The [[Septuagint]] was the most scholarly non-Hebrew version of the [[Old Testament]] available to [[early Christian]]s. Many converts already spoke Greek, and it was readily adopted as the preferred vernacular-language rendering for the eastern Roman Empire. The later Latin translation called the [[Vulgate]], an [[Christology|interpretative]] translation from the later [[Masoretic Text]] (a Jewish revision and consolidation of earlier Hebrew texts), replaced it in the west after its completion by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] c. 405, Latin being the most common vernacular language in those regions.

===Earliest Christian chronology===
The earliest extant Christian writings on the age of the world according to the biblical chronology were therefore based on the Septuagint, due to its early availability. They can be found in the ''Apology to Autolycus (Apologia ad Autolycum)'' by [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] (AD 115–181), the sixth bishop of Antioch,&lt;ref name="theophilus"&gt;[[Theophilus of Antioch]]. ''Theophilus of Antioch to Autolycus.'' Book III. Chapters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxiv.html XXIV] (Adam—Samuel), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxv.html XXV] (Saul—Cyrus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxvii.html XXVII] (Cyrus—M. Aurelius Verus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxviii.html Chap. XXVIII] (Adam—M. Aurelius Verus).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Five Books of Chronology'' by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (AD 200–245).&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Julius Africanus]]. ''Extant Writings III. The Extant Fragments of the Five Books of the Chronography of Julius Africanus.'' Chapters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_131.html III—VII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_132.html XI—XII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xiii.html XIII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06/Page_134.html XIV—XV], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xvi.html XVI], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xvii.html XVII], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.xviii.html XVIII].&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus presents a detailed chronology "from the foundation of the world" to emperor Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; His chronology begins with the biblical first man [[Adam]] through to emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], in whose reign Theophilus lived. The chronology puts the creation of the world at about 5529 BC: "All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total of 5,698 years."&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; No mention of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is made in his chronology. [[Seraphim Rose]] corrected the date to about 5530 BC, to recognise that there is no year 0 in [[Christian era]] dating.&lt;ref name="GENESIS 2000. p. 236"&gt;Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]].

Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] on this subject are of vital significance (''even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the [[Septuagint]], as compared to that of the [[Masoretic Text|Hebrew text]]''), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers{{refn|1=[[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene ]] (275–194 BC) represented contemporary Alexandrian scholarship; [[Eupolemus]], a Palestinian Jew and a friend of [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]], writing in 158 BC, is said to have been the first historian who synchronized Greek history in accordance with the theory of the Mosaic origin of culture. By the time of the 1st century BC, a world chronicle had synchronized Jewish and Greek history and had gained international circulation: [[Alexander Polyhistor]] (flourishing in 85–35 BC); [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC); Ptolemy priest of Mendes (50 BC), who is cited by [[Tatian]] (''Oratio ad Graecos'', 38); [[Apion]] (1st century AD); [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] (before AD 36); and [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]] (1st century AD) – all cited chronicles which had incorporated the dates of the [[Noachite]] flood and the exodus. (Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder. "Biblical Chronology in the Hellenistic World Chronicles". in ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol.61, No.3 (July 1968), pp. 451–452.)|group=note}} is preserved:

:An immense intellectual effort was expended during the [[Hellenistic period]] by both Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] to date [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], [[Flood (mythology)#Biblical deluge|the flood]], [[The Exodus|exodus]], [[Solomon's Temple|building of the Temple]]... In the course of their studies, men such as [[Tatian|Tatian of Antioch]] (flourished in 180), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died before 215), [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (died in 235), [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] of Jerusalem (died after 240), [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in Palestine (260–340), and Pseudo-Justin frequently quoted their predecessors, the Graeco-Jewish biblical chronographers of the Hellenistic period, thereby allowing discernment of more distant scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder.

===Alexandrian era===
The [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian era]], arising in AD 412, was the precursor to the [[Byzantine era]]. After the initial attempts by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and others, the Alexandrian computation of the date of creation was worked out to be 25 March 5493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias J Bickerman|title=Chronology of the Ancient World (Aspects of Greek &amp; Roman Life) |year=1980|publisher=Cornell Univ. Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-1282-X|edition=2nd sub|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexandrian monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria|Panodoros]] reckoned 5904 years from Adam to the year AD 412. His years began with 29 August, corresponding to the [[Thout|First of Thoth]], or the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] new year.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Philip Schaff (1819–1893), Ed. "Era." ''[[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]''. New Edition, 13 Vols., 1908–14. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_163.html Vol. 4, pp. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annianus of Alexandria]] however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodoros era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the ''Alexandrian era'', whose first day was the first day of the proleptic{{refn|1=A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the proleptic version of the calendar.|group=note}} Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC.

:This system presents in a masterly sort of way the mystical coincidence of the three main dates of the world's history: the beginning of Creation, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]. All these events happened, according to the Alexandrian chronology, on the 25th of March; furthermore, the first two events were separated by the period of exactly 5500 years; the first and the third one occurred on Sunday — the sacred day of the beginning of the Creation and its renovation through Christ.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"&gt;Pavel Kuzenkov (Moscow). "[http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf How old is the World? The Byzantine era κατα Ρωμαίους and its rivals"] ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093926/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 }}) ''21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies'', London 2006. pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] had earlier emphatically quoted mystical justifications for the choice of 25 March as the start of the year:
:March 25 was considered to be the anniversary of Creation itself. It was the first day of the year in the medieval [[Julian calendar]] and the nominal vernal equinox (it had been the actual equinox at the time when the Julian calendar was originally designed). Considering that Christ was conceived at that date turned March 25 into the Feast of the [[Annunciation]] which had to be followed, nine months later, by the celebration of the [[Nativity of Christ|birth of Christ]], Christmas, on December 25.

The ''Alexandrian Era'' of 25 March 5493 BC was adopted by church fathers such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]], as well as chroniclers such as [[George Syncellus]]. Its striking mysticism made it popular in Byzantium especially in monastic circles. However this masterpiece of Christian symbolism had two serious weak points: historical inaccuracy surrounding the date of [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] as determined by its [[Easter]] [[w:Computus|computus]],{{refn|1=In the commonly used 19‐year [[Easter]] moon cycle, there was no year when the Passover (the first spring full moon, Nisan 14) would coincide with Friday and the traditional date of the Passion, 25 March; according to Alexandrian system the date would have to have been Anno Mundi 5533 = 42(!)AD.|group=note}} and its contradiction to the chronology of the [[Gospel]] of [[John the Apostle|St John]] regarding the date of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] on Friday after the Passover.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt;

===Chronicon Paschale===
A new variant of the ''World Era'' was suggested in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year AD 630 by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt; It dates the creation of [[Adam]] to 21 March 5507 BC.

For its influence on Greek Christian chronology, and also because of its wide scope, the ''"Chronicon Paschale"'' takes its place beside [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and the chronicle of the monk [[George Syncellus|Georgius Syncellus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George Syncellus|George Synkellos]]. ''The Chronography of George Synkellos: a Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation''. Transl. Prof. Dr. William Adler &amp; Paul Tuffin. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; which was so important in the Middle Ages; but in respect of form it is inferior to these works.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Essen, L. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03730b.htm Chronicon Paschale]". In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of Byzantine era===
The Byzantine Anno Mundi era was the official calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] from c. AD 691 to 1728 in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. By the late 10th century the [[Byzantine era]], which had become fixed at 1 September 5509 BC since at least the mid-7th century (differing by 16 years from the Alexandrian date, and 2 years from the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''), had become the widely accepted calendar by [[Chalcedonian Christianity]]. The Byzantine era was used as the civil calendar by the [[Byzantine Empire]] from AD 988 to 1453, and by [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]] from c. AD 988 to 1700.

The computation was derived from the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Bible]], and placed the date of creation at 5509 years before the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], which was later taken to mean 5509 BC when conversions to the Christian era were desired. With a new year date of September 1, which coincides with the beginning of the Orthodox liturgical year, its epoch became 1 September 5509 BC (Julian), and year AM 1 thus lasted until 31 August 5508 BC. The "year of creation" was generally expressed in Greek in the Byzantine calendar as "Etos Kosmou", literally "year of the universe".

===Western church===
Western Christianity never fully adopted an Anno Mundi epoch system, and did not at first produce chronologies based on the Vulgate that were in contrast to the eastern calculations from the Septuagint. Since the Vulgate was not completed until only a few years before the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire#408–410; the end of an effective regular field army, starvation in Italia, sack of Rome|sack of Rome]] by the Goths, there was little time for such developments before the political upheavals that followed in the west. Whatever the reasons, the west eventually came to rely instead on the independently developed [[Anno Domini]] (AD) epoch system. AM dating did continue to be of interest for liturgical reasons, however, since it was of direct relevance to the calculation of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] (AM 5197–5199) and the [[Passion of Christ]] (AM 5228–5231). For example, [[Bede]] in his World-Chronicle (Chapter 66 of his ''[[De Temporum Ratione]]'', On the Reckoning of Time), dated all events using an epoch he derived from the Vulgate which set the birth of Christ as AM 3952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Axial mesoderm''', or '''chordamesoderm''', is a type of [[mesoderm]] that lies along the central axis under the [[neural tube]].

* will give rise to notochord
* starts as the [[Neurulation#Folding|notochordal process]], whose formation finishes at day 20.
* important not only in forming the notochord itself but also in inducing development of the overlying ectoderm into the neural tube 
* will eventually induce the formation of vertebral bodies.
* ventral floor of the notochordal process fuses with endoderm.
* The notochord will form the [[nucleus pulposus]] of interverterbral discs. There is some discussion as to whether these cells contributed from the notochord are replaced by others from the adjacent mesoderm.

It gives rise to the [[notochordal process]], which later becomes the [[notochord]].

Radio '''Blanketing Interference''' is a term used predominantly in the USA to refer to [[Blocking (radio)|Receiver Blocking]] which is [[Interference (communication)|interference]] caused when a strong unwanted off-channel [[radio]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] prevents the reception of another (wanted) transmission.  

This problem is greatly reduced by even moderate-quality [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], which have better [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] (filtering) and [[dynamic range]] than poorly designed inexpensive or [[disposable]] ones.

Related to [[closet drama]], a '''closet screenplay''' is a screenplay intended not to be produced/performed but instead to be read by a solitary reader or, sometimes, out loud in a small group.

While any published, or simply read, screenplay might reasonably be considered a "closet screenplay," 20th- and 21st-century Japanese and Western writers have created a handful of film scripts expressly intended to be read rather than produced/performed. This class of [[prose fiction]] written in screenplay form is perhaps the most precise example of the closet screenplay.

This genre is sometimes referred to using a romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[neologism]]: "Lesescenario (レーゼシナリオ)" or, following [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn’s romanization of Japanese]], sometimes “Rezeshinario.” A [[portmanteau]] of the German word ''Lesedrama'' ("read drama") and the English word ''scenario,'' this term simply means "closet scenario," or, by extension, "closet screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;''Sanseido's Concise Dictionary of [[Katakana]] Words''. Tokyo, [[Sanseido]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interest==
Brian Norman, an [[assistant professor]] at [[Idaho State University]], refers to [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s ''[[One Day When I Was Lost]]'' as a "closet [[screenplay]]."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Brian. “Reading a ‘Closet Screenplay’: Hollywood, James Baldwin’s Malcolms, and the Threat of Historical Irrelevance." ''[[African American Review]]'' 39.1-2 (Spring/Summer 2005): 10-18.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1-2_39/ai_n15675152]&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written for a project to produce a movie, but the project suffered a setback. After that, the script was published as a [[literary work]].

[[Lee Jamieson]]'s article "The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of [[Antonin Artaud]]"&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Lee. “The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of Antonin Artaud" ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' 44 (27 August 2007).[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/feature-articles/film-theory-antonin-artaud/]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses Artaud's three Lesescenarios (listed below) in the context of his "revolutionary film theory." And in ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'',&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Richard. ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'' (Princeton UP, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Abel lists the following critical treatments of several of the Surrealist "published scenario texts" (36) listed in the example section below:

* J. H. Matthews, ''Surrealism and Film'' (U of Michigan P, 1971), 51–76.
* Steven Kovács, ''From Enchantment to Rage: The Story of Surrealist Cinema'' (Associated UP, 1980), 59–61, 157–76.
* Linda Williams, ''Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film'' (U of Illinois P, 1981), 25–33.
* Richard Abel, "Exploring the Discursive Field of the Surrealist Film Scenario Text," ''Dada/Surrealism'' 15 (1986): 58–71.

Finally, in his article "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte,"&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. January 2010. "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte." [http://scriptjr.nl SCRIPTjr.nl] 1.1. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed November 21, 2009) [http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Quimby Melton outlines the history of the Lesescenario form, situates the genre in a historical literary context by drawing parallels between it and Western "[[closet drama]]," and argues we might consider certain instances of closet drama proto-screenplays. The article also argues that writing these sorts of "readerly" performance texts is essentially an act of subversion whereby (screen)writers work in a performance mode only to intentionally bypass production and, thereby, (re)assert narrative representation's textual primacy and (re)claim a direct (re)connection with their audience.

The comments section of Melton's article also has an ongoing discussion of the Lesescenario canon.[http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php#comments] The list of examples below is based on "Production's 'dubious advantage,'" that discussion, and Melton's "Lesecenario Bibliography" at Google Docs.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. 6 February 2011.

'''Commodity form theory''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] advanced by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] legal theorist [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the "guardians" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical.

==The logical premise==
"Every legal relation" proclaims Pashukanis, "is a relation between subjects". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls "the legal subject".

[[Property]], says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property.

Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects.

Commodities according to [[Karl Marx]] relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers.

Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this.

==The historical premise==
The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all.

==Fetishism==
Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of [[commodity fetishism]]. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law&amp;nbsp;– as the universal political equivalent&amp;nbsp;– has a life of its own.

In [[computer science]], the '''computational complexity''', or simply '''complexity''' of an [[algorithm]] is the amount of resources required for running it. The computational complexity of a problem is the minimum of the complexities of all possible algorithms for this problem (including the unknown algorithms).

As the amount of needed resources varies with the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function {{math|''n'' → ''f''(''n'')}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the size of the input, and {{math|''f''(''n'')}} is either the [[worst-case complexity]], that is the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed for all inputs of size {{math|''n''}}, or the [[average-case complexity]], that is average of the amount of resources over all input of size {{math|''n''}}.

When the nature of the resources is not explicitly given, this is usually the time needed for running the algorithm, and one talks of [[time complexity]]. However, this depends on the [[computer]] that is used, and the time is generally expressed as the number of needed elementary operations, which are supposed to take a constant time on a given computer, and to change by a constant factor when one changes of computer.

Otherwise, the resource that is considered is often the size of the memory that is needed, and one talks of [[space complexity]].

The study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called [[analysis of algorithms]], while the study of the complexity of problems is called [[computational complexity theory]]. Clearly, both areas are strongly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an [[upper bound]] of the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm.

==Resources==
===Time===
The resource that is most commonly considered is the time, and one talks of [[time complexity]]. When "complexity" is used without being qualified, this generally means time complexity.

The usual units of time are not used in [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], because they are too dependent on the choice of a specific computer and of the evolution of the technology. Therefore, instead of the real time, one generally consider the elementary operations that are done during the computation. These operations are supposed to take a constant time on a given machine, and are often called ''steps''.

===Space===
Another important resource is the size of [[computer memory]] that is needed for running algorithms.

===Others===
The number of [[arithmetic operations]] is another resource that is commonly used. In this case, one talks of '''arithmetic complexity'''. If one knows an [[upper bound]] on the size of the [[binary representation]] of the numbers that occur during a computation, the time complexity is generally the product of the arithmetic complexity by a constant factor.

For many algorithms the size of the integers that are used during a computation is not bounded, and it is not realistic to consider that arithmetic operations take a constant time. Therefore, the time complexity, generally called [[bit complexity]] in this context, may be much larger than the arithmetic complexity. For example, the arithmetic complexity of the computation of the [[determinant]] of a {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[integer matrix]] is &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; for the usual algorithms ([[Gaussian elimination]]). The bit complexity of the same algorithms is [[exponential function|exponential]] in {{mvar|n}}, because the size of the coefficients may grow exponentially during the computation. On the other hand, if these algorithms are coupled with [[modular arithmetic|multi-modular arithmetic]], the bit complexity may be reduced to [[soft O notation|{{math|''O''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)}}]].

In [[sorting]] and [[search algorithm|searching]], the resource that is generally considered is the number of entries comparisons. This is generally a good measure of the time complexity if data are suitably organized.

==Complexity as a function of input size==
:''For clarity, only time complexity is considered in this section, but everything applies (with slight modifications) to the complexity with respect to other resources.'' 
It is impossible to count the number of steps of an algorithm on all possible inputs. As the complexity increases generally with the size of the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size {{math|''n''}} (in [[bit]]s) of the input, and therefore, the complexity is a function of {{math|''n''}}. However, the complexity of an algorithm may vary dramatically for different inputs of the same size. Therefore several complexity functions are commonly used.

The [[worst-case complexity]] is the maximum of the complexity over all inputs of size {{mvar|n}}, and the [[average-case complexity]] is the average of the complexity over all inputs of size {{mvar|n}} (this makes sense, as the number of possible inputs of a given size is finite). Generally, when "complexity" is used without being further specified, this is the worst-case time complexity that is considered.

==Asymptotic complexity==
{{see also|Asymptotic computational complexity}}
It is generally difficult to compute precisely the worst-case and the average-case complexity. In addition, these exact values provide little practical application, as any change of computer or of model of computation would change the complexity somewhat. Moreover, the resource use is not critical for small values of {{mvar|n}}, and this makes that, for small {{mvar|n}}, the ease of implementation is generally more interesting than a good complexity.

For these reasons, one generally focuses on the behavior of the complexity for large {{mvar|n}}, that is on its [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behavior]] when {{mvar|n}} tends to the infinity. Therefore, the complexity is generally expressed by using [[big O notation]].

For example, the usual algorithm for integer [[multiplication]] has a complexity of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2),&lt;/math&gt; this means that there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c_u&lt;/math&gt; such that the multiplication of two integers of at most {{mvar|n}} digits may be done in a time less than &lt;math&gt;c_un^2.&lt;/math&gt; This bound is ''sharp'' in the sense that the worst-case complexity and the average-case complexity are &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2),&lt;/math&gt; which means that there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c_l&lt;/math&gt; such that these complexities are larger than &lt;math&gt;c_ln^2.&lt;/math&gt; The [[radix]] does not appear in these complexity, as changing of radix changes only the constants &lt;math&gt;c_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_l.&lt;/math&gt;

==Models of computation==
The evaluation of the complexity relies on the choice of a [[model of computation]], which consist in defining the basic operations that are done in a unit of time. When the model of computation is not explicitly specified, this is generally meant as being [[multitape Turing machine]].

===Deterministic models===
A [[deterministic model]] of computation is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state. Historically, the first deterministic models were [[μ-recursive function|recursive function]]s, [[lambda calculus]], and [[Turing machine]]s. The model of [[Random access machine]]s (also called RAM-machines) is also widely used, as closer to real [[computer]]s.

When the model of computation is not specified, it is generally the model of [[multitape Turing machine]]s. For most algorithms, the complexity is the same on multitape Turing machines and on RAM-machines, although, some care may be needed in storing data for getting this equivalence.

===Non-deterministic computation===
In a [[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministic model of computation]], such as [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, some choices may be done at some steps of the computation. In complexity theory, one considers all possible choices simultaneously, and the non-deterministic time complexity is the time needed, when the best choices are always done. In other words, one considers that the computation is done simultaneously on as many (identical) processors as needed, and the non-deterministic computation time is the time spent by the first processor that finishes the computation. This parallelism is partly amenable to [[quantum computing]] via superposed [[entangled state]]s in running specific [[quantum algorithms]], like e.g. [[Shor's algorithm|Shor's factorization]] of yet only small integers ({{as of|2018|03|lc=yes}}: 21 = 3 × 7).

Even when such a computation model is not realistic yet, it has theoretical importance, mostly related to the [[P = NP]] problem, which questions the identity of the complexity classes formed by taking "polynomial time" and "non-deterministic polynomial time" as least upper bounds. Simulating an NP-algorithm on a deterministic computer usually takes "exponential time". A problem is in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], if it maybe solved in [[polynomial time]] on a non-deterministic machine. A problem is [[NP-complete]] if, roughly speaking, it is in NP and is not easier than any other NP problem. Many [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] problems, such as the [[Knapsack problem]], the [[travelling salesman problem]], and the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] are NP-complete. For all these problems, the best known algorithm has exponential complexity. If any one of these problems could be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic machine, then all NP problems could also be solved in polynomial time, and one would have P = NP. {{As of|2017}} it is generally conjectured that {{nowrap|P ≠ NP,}} with the practical implication that the worst cases of NP problems are intrinsically difficult to solve, i.e., take longer than any reasonable time span (decades!) for interesting lengths of input.

===Parallel and distributed computation===
{{main|Parallel computing|Distributed computing}}
Parallel and distributed computing consist of splitting computation on several processors, which work simultaneously. The difference between the different model lies mainly in the way of transmitting information between processors. Typically, in parallel computing the data transmission between processors is very fast, while, in distributed computating, the data transmission is done through a [[computer network|network]] and is therefore much slower.

The time needed for a computation on {{mvar|N}} processors is at least the quotient by {{mvar|N}} of the time needed by a single processor. In fact this theoretically optimal bound can never be reached, because some subtasks cannot be parallelized, and some processors may have to wait a result from another processor.

The main complexity problem is thus to design algorithms such that the product of the computation time by the number of processors is as close as possible to the time needed for the same computation on a single processor.

===Quantum computing===
A [[quantum computer]] is a computer whose model of computation is based on [[quantum mechanics]]. The [[Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)|Church–Turing thesis]] applies to quantum computers, that is, every problem that can be solved by a quantum computer may be also solved by a Turing machine. However, some problems may theoretically be solved with a much lower complexity using a quantum computer than using a classical computer. This is, for the moment, purely theoretical, as no one knows how to build an efficient quantum computer.

[[Quantum complexity theory]] has been developed for studying computational complexity of quantum computing. It is used in [[post-quantum cryptography]], which consists of designing [[cryptographic protocol]]s that will resist to attacks with quantum computers, when such computers will really exist.

==Problem complexity (lower bounds)==
The complexity of a problem is the [[infimum]] of the complexities of the algorithms that may solve the problem, including the unknowns algorithm. Thus the complexity of a problem is not greater than the complexity of any algorithm that solves the problems.

It follows that every complexity that is expressed with [[big O notation]] is a complexity of the algorithm as well as of the corresponding problem.

On the other hand, it is generally hard to obtain nontrivial lower bounds for problem complexity, and there are few methods for obtaining such lower bounds.

For solving most problems, it is required to read all input data, which, normally, needs a time proportional to the size of the data. Thus, such problems have a complexity that is at least [[linear time|linear]], that is, using [[big omega notation]], a complexity &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n).&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of some problems, typically in [[computer algebra]] and [[computational algebraic geometry]], may be very large. In such a case, the complexity is lower bounded by the maximal size of the output, since the output must be written. For example, a [[system of polynomial equations|system of {{mvar|n}} polynomial equations of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} indeterminates]] may have up to &lt;math&gt;d^n&lt;/math&gt; [[complex number|complex]] solutions, if the number of solutions is finite (this is [[Bézout's theorem]]). As these solutions must be written down, the complexity of this problem is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(d^n).&lt;/math&gt; For this problem, an algorithm of complexity &lt;math&gt;d^{O(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is known, which may thus be considered as asymptotically quasi-optimal.

A nonlinear lower bound of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; is known for the number comparisons needed for a [[sorting algorithm]]. Thus the best sorting algorithms are optimal, as their complexity is &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n).&lt;/math&gt; This lower bound results from the fact that there are {{math|''n''!}} ways of ordering {{mvar|n}} objects. As each comparison splits in two parts this set of {{math|''n''!}} orders, the number of {{mvar|N}} of comparisons that are needed for distinguishing all orders must verify &lt;math&gt;2^N&gt;n!,&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;N =\Omega(n\log n),&lt;/math&gt; by [[Stirling's formula]].

A standard method for getting lower bounds of complexity consists of ''reducing'' a problem to another problem. More precisely, suppose that one may encode a problem {{mvar|A}} of size {{mvar|n}} into a subproblem of size {{math|''f''(''n'')}} of a problem {{mvar|B}}, and that the complexity of {{mvar|A}} is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(g(n)).&lt;/math&gt; Without loss of generality, one may suppose that the function {{mvar|f}} increases with {{mvar|n}} and has an [[inverse function]] {{mvar|h}}. Then the complexity of the problem {{mvar|B}} is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(g(h(n))).&lt;/math&gt; This is this method that is used for proving that, if [[P ≠ NP]] (a unsolved conjecture), the complexity of every [[NP-complete problem]] is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^k),&lt;/math&gt; for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}.

==Use in algorithm design==

Evaluating the complexity of an algorithm is an important part of [[algorithm design]], as this gives useful information on the performance that may be expected.

It is a common misconception that the evaluation of the complexity of algorithms becomes less important, because of the exponential growth ([[Moore's law]]) of the power of modern [[computer]]s. This is wrong because, this power increase allows working with large input data ([[big data]]). For example, when one want to sort alphabetically a list of a few hundreds of entries, such as the [[bibliography]] of a book, any algorithm should work well in less than a second. On the other hand, for a list of a million of entries (the phone numbers of a large town, for example), the elementary algorithms that require &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; comparisons would have to do a trillion of comparisons, which would need around three hours at the speed of 10 million of comparisons per second. On the other hand, the [[quicksort]] and [[merge sort]] require only &lt;math&gt;n\log_2 n&lt;/math&gt; comparisons (as average-case complexity for the former, as worst-case complexity for the latter). For {{math|1=''n'' = 1,000,000}}, this gives approximately 30,000,000 comparisons, which may be done in less than a second on a powerful computer.

Thus the evaluation of the complexity may allow eliminating many inefficient algorithms before any implementation. This may also be used for tuning complex algorithms without testing all variants. By determining the most costly steps of a complex algorithms, the study of complexity allows also focusing on these steps the effort for improving the efficiency of an implementation.

In '''computing with words and perceptions (CWP)''', the [[object (computer science)|objects of computation]] are [[words]], [[perception]]s, and [[proposition]]s drawn from a [[natural language]].  The central theme of CWP is the concept of a [[Constraint (mathematics)|generalised constraint]].  The meaning of a proposition is expressed as a generalised constraint.

CWP is a necessary tool when the available information is perception-based or not precise enough to use numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

* [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] (Università "Cà Foscari" di Venezia)

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

== History ==
Cytoscape was originally created at the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle in 2002.  Now, it is developed by an international consortium of open source developers. Cytoscape was initially made public in July, 2002 (v0.8); the second release (v0.9) was in November, 2002, and v1.0 was released in March 2003.  Version 1.1.1 is the last stable release for the 1.0 series. Version 2.0 was initially released in 2004; Cytoscape 2.83, the final 2.xx version, was released in May 2012. Version 3.0 was released Feb 1, 2013, and the latest version, 3.4.0, was released in May 2016.

== Development ==
The Cytoscape core developer team continues to work on this project and released Cytoscape 3.0 in 2013. This represented a major change in the Cytoscape architecture; it is a more modularized, expandable and maintainable version of the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cytoscape.wodaklab.org/wiki/Cytoscape_3/ developer's wiki page].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Image:Cytoscape network visualization1.png|thumb|450px|Yeast Protein–protein/Protein–DNA interaction network visualized by Cytoscape. Node degree is mapped to node size]]

While Cytoscape is most commonly used for biological research applications, it is agnostic in terms of usage.  Cytoscape can be used to visualize and analyze network graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges (e.g., social networks). A key aspect of the software architecture of Cytoscape is the use of plugins for specialized features. Plugins are developed by core developers and the greater user community.

== Features ==
'''Input'''
* Input and construct molecular interaction networks from raw interaction files (SIF format) containing lists of protein–protein and/or protein–DNA interaction pairs.  For yeast and other model organisms, large sources of pairwise interactions are available through the BIND and [[TRANSFAC]] databases. User-defined interaction types are also supported.
* Load and save previously-constructed interaction networks in [[Graph Modelling Language|GML]] format (Graph Modelling Language).
* Load and save networks and node/edge attributes in an XML document format called [[XGMML]] (eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language).
* Input mRNA expression profiles from tab- or space-delimited text files.
* Load and save arbitrary attributes on nodes and edges. For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein–protein interactions.
* Import gene functional annotations from the [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) and [[KEGG]] databases.
* Directly import GO terms and annotations from OBO and Gene Association files.
* Load and save state of the cytoscape session in a cytoscape session (.cys) file. Cytoscape session file includes networks, attributes (for node/edge/network), desktop states (selected/hidden nodes and edges, window sizes), properties, and visual styles.

'''Visualization'''
* Customize network data display using powerful visual styles.
* View a superposition of gene expression ratios and p-values on the network.  Expression data can be mapped to node color, label, border thickness, or border color, etc. according to user-configurable colors and visualization schemes.
* Layout networks in two dimensions.  A variety of layout algorithms are available, including cyclic and [[Force-based algorithms (graph drawing)|spring-embedded layouts]].
* Zoom in/out and pan for browsing the network.
* Use the network manager to easily organize multiple networks. And this structure can be saved in a session file.
* Use the bird's eye view to easily navigate large networks.
* Easily navigate large networks (100,000+ nodes and edges) by efficient rendering engine.

'''Analysis'''
* Plugins available for network and molecular profile analysis. For example:
** Filter the network to select subsets of nodes and/or interactions based on the current data.  For instance, users may select nodes involved in a threshold number of interactions, nodes that share a particular GO annotation, or nodes whose gene expression levels change significantly in one or more conditions according to p-values loaded with the gene expression data.
** Find active subnetworks/pathway modules. The network is screened against gene expression data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. interaction subnetworks, whose genes show particularly high levels of differential expression.  The interactions contained in each subnetwork provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed expression changes.
** Find clusters (highly interconnected regions) in any network loaded into Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance, clusters in a protein–protein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways. Clusters in a protein similarity network represent protein families.

'''Emergent literacy''' is a term that is used to explain a child's knowledge of reading and writing skills before they learn how to read and write words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405193056/http://www2.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-05|work=Provo City Library at Academy Square|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It signals a belief that, in literate society, young children—even one- and two-year-olds—are in the process of becoming literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831010615/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-31|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the support of parents, caregivers, and educators, a child can successfully progress from emergent to conventional reading.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Critical Issue: Addressing the Literacy Needs of Emergent and Early Readers|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817063554/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-17|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic components of emergent literacy include:

* '''Print motivation''': Being interested in and enjoying books.
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': Knowing the names of things.
* '''Print awareness''': Noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.
* '''Narrative skills''': Being able to describe things and events and to tell stories.
* '''Letter knowledge''': Understanding letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.
* '''[[Phonological awareness]]''': Being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

Emergent literacy is of critical importance in early education in light of research showing that children learn skills that prepare them to read years before they start school.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, society has considered reading and writing in their formalistic senses, and viewed children as being knowledgeable about literacy only when they were capable of identifying written words without picture clues, and spelling words that adults could read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.lcsc.edu/RE303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026153623/http://www.lcsc.edu/re303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-26|work=Academics|publisher=Lews-Clark State College|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, New Zealand researcher [[Marie Clay]] introduced the concept of emergent reading, using it to describe the earliest behaviors and concepts young children employ in interacting with [[book]]s even before they are capable of reading in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=Reading: The Patterning of Complex Behaviour|year=1967|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s and early 1980s saw robust research activity in children's early language development, early childhood education, and reexamination of the concept of reading readiness. This work resulted in Teale and Sulzby assembling a book authored by various leading researchers of the time that proposed reconceptualizing what happens from birth to the time when children reading and write conventionally as a period of emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teale|first=William H. |last2=Sulzby|first2=Elizabeth|title=Emergent Literacy: Writing and Reading|year=1986|publisher=Ablex|location=Norwood, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, an extensive body of research has expanded the concept, illuminating that a child's literacy development begins well before formal introduction in school, and can be influenced by social interactions with adults, exposure to literacy materials, and the use of engaged learning activities.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"/&gt;
While the concept of reading readiness suggested that there was a point in time when children were ready to learn to read and write, Clay's notion of emergent literacy suggested that there were continuities in children's literacy development between early literacy behaviors and those displayed once children could read independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is emergent literacy?|url=http://www.ets.uidaho.edu/cdhd/emerlit/intro.htm|publisher=Idaho Center on Developmental Disabilities.|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay also emphasized the importance of the relationship between writing and reading in early literacy development. Until then, it was believed that children must learn to read before they could learn to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=What Did I Write?|year=1975|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent literacy skills ==

=== Print motivation ===
This component relates to a child's interest in and enjoyment of books.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt; A child with print motivation might enjoy being read to, playing with books, pretending to write, and going to the library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-03 |title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children who enjoy books are more likely to want to read, and to keep trying, even when it is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Print Motivation|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521001712/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-21|work=Scribd.com|accessdate=2015-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vocabulary ===
The component "[[vocabulary]]" relates to the knowing of the names of things.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  Children with rich vocabularies are at a tremendous educational advantage, since studies show that vocabulary is the best predictor of reading comprehension at the end of second and third grades and is otherwise linked to overall academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS Strategy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|work=The Hanen Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print awareness ===
This component relates to noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  It includes knowing that books are organized from left to right, the words are read from left to right and top to bottom, and how to tell words from letters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy: Concepts about Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-04|work=George Mason University|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These skills are invaluable to a child's literacy development because without these skills, a child will have difficulty learning how to read and write.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Narrative skills ===
This component relates to the ability to describe things and events and to tell stories.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

=== Letter knowledge ===
This component relates to the understanding that letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117004246/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html |date=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonological awareness ===
This component relates to being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;
It involves rhyme recognition, syllables, onset, and rime. Types of [[phonological awareness]] include: phonemic awareness, syllable awareness, word awareness, and sentence awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacies: Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lessons and activities ==
Emergent literacy lessons may focus on one emergent literacy skill or blend them. Below are examples of emerging literacy games and activities that each focus primarily on one emergent literacy skill.

'''Building vocabulary'''&lt;br /&gt;
Sorting games can help children build vocabulary skills by asking them to identify defining characteristics of the items being sorted. Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by Kansas University, suggests a shoe sorting game in which each child takes off one of his or her shoes. The children work together to sort the shoes by different characteristics, thus building vocabulary related to color, types of fasteners (buckle, velcro), shoe type (sandal, gym shoe), etc. This activity could work with other objects such as legos and pasta. The full activity is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/shoe |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012942/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fshoe |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Hanen Centre outlines another strategy for teaching vocabulary to promote emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weitzman|first=Elaine|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS: A Strategy for Teaching Vocabulary to Promote Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|publisher=The Hanen Centre|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter recognition'''&lt;br /&gt;
Letter recognition games help children learn the letters of the alphabet. In one simple game, the teacher writes each letter of the alphabet on a separate notecard and passes them out to students. The students then have to arrange themselves in alphabetical order. This game is provided by Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by the University of Kansas, and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/abc]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012957/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fabc |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonological awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
One type of phonological awareness game involves rhyming, which helps children identify similar sounds in words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/emergent#Q1]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701033553/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Femergent |date=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one rhyming game, the teacher can present three different "consonant-vowel-consonant" words and ask children which word does not rhyme. For example, cat, log, and dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonologicalawareness.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full activity and other similar rhyming activities are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonological Awareness |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities include: songs and chants; word play, games, rhymes and riddles; Storybooks, poetry, nursery rhymes, Dr. Seuss;
Oral Storytelling; Clapping, jumping, manipulating letters, blocks.
Everything should be playful, engaging, interactive, social, deliberate, and purposeful, stimulate curiosity, and encourage experimentation with language and comprehensive language and literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacy Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print motivation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since print motivation involves a child's interest and enjoyment of books, there are a variety of activities that parents and teachers can share with children to help promote print motivation. Examples include:
* Read often and make it enjoyable
* Read when you{{Who|date=May 2012}} and the child are in a good mood, so the experience is a positive one
* Change your voice when you read aloud
* Keep books accessible to children
* Stop reading when a child becomes tired or loses interest

Print motivation tips adapted from the Loudon County Public Library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-03|title=??|publisher=Library.loudoun.gov|accessdate=2015-04-24|registration=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
Print awareness is a child's understanding of the parts of a book and how a book works. The State Library of Louisiana suggests an activity in which a child shares the parts of a book with an adult. For example, the teacher or parent could ask the child to point out different parts of the book and its contents, such as the front cover; the title; the first line of the book; a word; a letter; and the back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.lib.la.us/empowerlibrary/Print%20Awareness%20Activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Print Awareness Activities |publisher=State.lib.la.us |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George Mason University suggests additional family activities. These include: Make a book with your children. You might include familiar photographs with labels under each photo, or children might illustrate the book by themselves. Parents could write the words as the children dictate the story. Or, when going out to a restaurant, show the menu to your children and point to the words as you read to them.  Let them choose what they want to eat and make it an interactive experience. This will help children understand how print is connected to real life. Additional activities can be found online.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iantosca|first=Elena|title=Emergent Literacy Concepts About Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative skills'''&lt;br /&gt;
Children can build narrative skills by describing something that happened to him or her, even something as simple as taking a bath. Parents and teachers can promote narrative skills by prompting children for further detail. Other activities to promote narrative skills in both babies and toddlers are available from the Loudon County Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709163509/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Biophysical Societies' Association''' is an association existing to promote [[Biophysics]] in Europe and to disseminate "knowledge of the principles, recent developments and applications of biophysics, and to foster the exchange of scientific information among European biophysicists and biophysicists in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.M.|title=European Biophysical Societies' Association|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=1984|volume=11|issue=2|pages=77|doi=10.1007/BF00276620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
At the end of the 1970s, there appeared to be an interest in creating a formal association of various existing European Biophysical Societies. In November 1981, a meeting organized by the German Biophysical Society set the stage for developing concrete “aims of the Association…namely to promote scientific contacts and cooperation with the organization of joint meetings.”&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

EBSA was established in 1984, at the 8th IUPAB Congress of Biophysics, held in Bristol, after representatives from 8 European Biophysical Societies (Belgian, British, Danish, German, Italian, Netherlands, Swedish and Swiss) met to develop and sign a founding constitution and rules of association.&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was also in 1984 that the journal Biophysics of Structure and Mechanism became the [[European Biophysics Journal]], published by Springer-Verlag. Since 2000, EBJ has been owned entirely by EBSA and it is currently available free of charge to its members. Ownership of the journal has provided a financial base from which EBSA undertakes many of its activities.&lt;ref name="Bayley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayley|first=P.|title=EBSA - the early days|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2007|volume=36|pages=S1-S18|doi=10.1007/s00249-007-0175-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Because biophysics is a unique combination of diverse scientific subjects, particularly fertile with the advancement of biotechnology and quantitative and analytical methods in biology, EBSA’s has a prolific range of activities geared towards bringing innovative people and ideas together. Every two years EBSA organizes the European Biophysics Congress. The last Congress was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal|title=9th European Biophysics Congress|journal=European Biophysics Journal|year=2013|volume=42|doi=10.1007/s00249-013-0917-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2015 Congress will be held in Dresden, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th European Biophysics Congress|url=http://www.ebsa2015.org|work=EBSA 2015|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, EBSA offers a variety of sponsorship to institutions and individuals working towards promoting biophysics in Europe, such as organisers of European biophysics meetings and schools with biophysics courses.&lt;ref name="ebsaoffical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsorship|url=http://www.ebsa.org|work=EBSA Official Website|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

EBSA also offers bursaries to young scientists to attend scientific meetings and to participate in the Biophysics Congress, as well as the Young Investigators’ Medal and Prize, which is awarded every Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bursaries|url=http://www.ebsa.org|work=EBSA Official Website|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the recipient of the medal was Justin Molley, from York, UK; in 2003, it was Martin Weik, from Grenoble, France; in 2005, it was Gyorgy Panyi, from Debrecen, Hungary; in 2007, it was [[Marc Baldus]], from Göttingen, Germany; in 2009, it was Michel Valle, from Derio-Bizkaia, Spain; and in 2011, it was Kinneret Keren.

[[File:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Tuning-fork-style diagram of the [[Hubble sequence]]]]

'''Galaxy morphological classification''' is a system used by [[astronomer]]s to divide [[galaxy|galaxies]] into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the [[Hubble sequence]], devised by [[Edwin Hubble]] and later expanded by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] and [[Allan Sandage]].

== Hubble sequence ==

[[File:A remarkable galactic hybrid.jpg|thumb|Spiral galaxy [[UGC 12591]] is classified as an S0/Sa galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A remarkable galactic hybrid|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1709a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for [[galaxies]] invented by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="hubble26a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1926 |title=Extra-galactic nebulae |journal=Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington |volume=324 |pages=1–49|bibcode = 1926CMWCI.324....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |title=The Realm of the Nebulae |date=1936 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |lccn=36018182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is often known colloquially as the “Hubble tuning-fork” because of the shape in which it is traditionally represented. Hubble’s scheme divides galaxies into three broad classes based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s):
* '''[[Elliptical galaxy|Elliptical galaxies]]''' have smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in images. They are denoted by the letter "E", followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of ellipticity on the sky.
* '''[[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]]''' consist of a flattened disk, with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], which is similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]]. They are given the symbol "S". Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge. These [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spirals]] are given the symbol "SB".
* '''[[Lenticular galaxy|Lenticular galaxies]]''' (designated S0) also consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] surrounded by an extended, disk-like structure but, unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity.

[[File:The Hubble Sequence throughout the Universe's history.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hubble sequence throughout the universe's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble explores the origins of modern galaxies|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1315/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These broad classes can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance and to encompass other types of galaxies, such as [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]], which have no obvious regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal).

The Hubble sequence is often represented in the form of a two-pronged fork, with the ellipticals on the left (with the degree of ellipticity increasing from left to right) and the barred and unbarred spirals forming the two parallel prongs of the fork. Lenticular galaxies are placed between the ellipticals and the spirals, at the point where the two prongs meet the “handle”.

To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

More modern observations of galaxies have given us the following information about these types:

* Elliptical galaxies are generally fairly low in gas and dust, and are composed mostly of older stars.
* Spiral galaxies generally have plentiful supplies of gas and dust, and have a broad mix of older and younger stars.
* Irregular galaxies are fairly rich in gas, dust, and young stars.

From this, astronomers have constructed a theory of galaxy evolution which suggests that ellipticals are, in fact, the result of collisions between spiral and/or irregular galaxies, which strip out much of the gas and dust and randomize the [[orbit]]s of the stars. See [[galaxy formation and evolution]].

[[Image:Large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]: a type SBm galaxy.]]
The de Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies is a widely used extension to the [[Hubble sequence]], first described by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs|date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275|bibcode = 1959HDP....53..275D }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Vaucouleurs argued that Hubble's two-dimensional classification of [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]—based on the tightness of the spiral arms and the presence or absence of a bar—did not adequately describe the full range of observed galaxy morphologies. In particular, he argued that [[torus|rings]] and [[lens (geometry)|lenses]] are important structural components of spiral galaxies.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Vaucouleurs system retains Hubble’s basic division of galaxies into [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]], [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] and [[irregular galaxy|irregulars]]. To complement Hubble’s scheme, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more elaborate classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics:

{{unordered list
&lt;!-- this list is coded to allow proper formatting of the final item in which the first-level paragraph continues after the sublist --&gt;
|1= '''Bars.''' Galaxies are divided on the basis of the presence or absence of a nuclear bar. De Vaucouleurs introduced the notation SA to denote spiral galaxies without bars, complementing Hubble’s use of SB for barred spirals. He also allowed for an intermediate class, denoted SAB, containing weakly barred spirals.&lt;ref name="Class"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vaucouleurs|first=Gérard|title=Revised Classification of 1500 Bright Galaxies|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement|date=April 1963|volume=8|page=31|doi=10.1086/190084|bibcode = 1963ApJS....8...31D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenticular galaxies are also classified as unbarred (SA0) or barred (SB0), with the notation S0 reserved for those galaxies for which it is impossible to tell if a bar is present or not (usually because they are edge-on to the line-of-sight).

|2= '''Rings.''' Galaxies are divided into those possessing ring-like structures (denoted ‘(r)’) and those without rings (denoted ‘(s)’). So-called ‘transition’ galaxies are given the symbol (rs).&lt;ref name="Class"/&gt;

|3= '''Spiral arms.''' As in Hubble’s original scheme, spiral galaxies are assigned to a class based primarily on the tightness of their spiral arms. The de Vaucouleurs scheme extends the arms of Hubble’s tuning fork to include several additional spiral classes:
{{unordered list
  |1= Sd (SBd) - diffuse, broken arms made up of individual stellar clusters and nebulae; very faint central bulge
  |2= Sm (SBm) - irregular in appearance; no bulge component
  |3= Im - highly irregular galaxy
  }}
Most galaxies in these three classes were classified as Irr I in Hubble’s original scheme. In addition, the Sd class contains some galaxies from Hubble’s Sc class. Galaxies in the classes Sm and Im are termed the [[Magellanic spiral|“Magellanic” spirals]] and irregulars, respectively, after the [[Magellanic Clouds]]. The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] is of type SBm, while the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] is an irregular (Im).
}}

The different elements of the classification scheme are combined — in the order in which they are listed — to give the complete classification of a galaxy. For example, a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms and a ring is denoted SAB(r)c.

Visually, the de Vaucouleurs system can be represented as a [http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html three-dimensional version] of Hubble’s tuning fork, with stage (spiralness) on the ''x''-axis, family (barredness) on the ''y''-axis, and variety (ringedness) on the ''z''-axis.&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1994"&gt;{{cite journal | first = G. | last = De Vaucouleurs | authorlink = Gérard de Vaucouleurs | title = Global Physical Parameters of Galaxies | date = 1994 | url = http://www.stsci.edu/institute/conference/galaxy-morphology/devaucouleurs.ps | format = [[PostScript]] | accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical Hubble stage===
De Vaucouleurs also assigned numerical values to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage ''T'' run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers corresponding to early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to late types (spirals and irregulars). Elliptical galaxies are divided into three 'stages': compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and late types (E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), intermediate (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and late (S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) types. Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars (''T'' = 10) or 'compact' (''T'' = 11).

== Yerkes (or Morgan) scheme ==
Created by American astronomer [[William Wilson Morgan]].  Together with [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip Keenan]], Morgan developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. The Yerkes scheme uses the spectra of stars in the galaxy; the shape, real and apparent; and the degree of the central concentration to classify galaxies.

'''''Geisteswissenschaften''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaɪstəsˌvɪsənʃaftən}}, "sciences of mind") is a set of [[human science]]s such as [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[philology]], [[musicology]], [[linguistics]], [[theater studies]], [[literary studies]], [[media studies]], and sometimes even [[theology]] and [[jurisprudence]], that are traditional in German [[universities]]. Most of its subject matter would come under the much larger [[humanities]] faculty in the typical English-speaking [[university]].

==History==
The concept of ''[[Geist]]'' dates back to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century [[German idealism]], in particular to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder's]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] concept of a ''[[Volksgeist]]'', the alleged common "spirit", or rather, mind, of a people. To understand the term ''Geisteswissenschaften'', one should bear in mind that the continental ''faculty of philosophy'' inherited the medieval ''faculty of arts''.  Besides philosophy itself it encompassed the natural sciences with mathematics as well as the philological and historical disciplines and later on psychology and the social sciences. The term ''Geisteswissenschaften'' first was used as translation of [[John Stuart Mill]]’s term “''[[moral sciences]]''”. The historian, philosopher and sociologist [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] popularised the term, arguing that [[psychology]] and the emerging field of [[sociology]] – like the [[Philology|philological]] and historical disciplines – should be considered as ''Geisteswissenschaft'' rather than as ''Naturwissenschaft'' ([[natural science]]), and that their [[methodology]] should reflect this classification. His arguments were very influential in the theories of the prominent German sociologist [[Max Weber]], though Weber preferred the term ''Kulturwissenschaft'', which has been promoted by his [[Neo-Kantianism|neokantian]] colleagues ([[Wilhelm Windelband]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]]).

==Current use==
Since the times of Dilthey it became common to speak of the ''Naturwissenschaften'' on the one hand and the 'Geisteswissenschaften' on the other – not particularly considering the status of mathematics and of philosophy itself. After the separation of the natural sciences and mathematics into a particular faculty (in some universities not until the 1950s), the ''Geisteswissenschaften'' were left alone in the philosophical faculty and even philosophy often was subsumed under the term ''Geisteswissenschaften''. Meanwhile, many of the German universities have split up these faculties in smaller departments, so that the old common interests and the old borders are less visible.

The term is now used irregularly. In administrative contexts it is used broadly to discuss how to organise the academic institutions and describe the culture of academic discussions, so that the faculties of Theology and Law are added to the Geisteswissenschaften. In some contexts of science policy the ''Geisteswissenschaften'' are described as non-empirical sciences, drawing them near philosophy and excluding the social sciences from their area.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Gethmann, Dieter Langewiesche, Jürgen Mittelstraß, Dieter Simon, Günter Stock, ''Manifest Geisteswissenschaft'', ed. by Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin 2005 [http://www.bbaw.de/bbaw/Veranstaltungen/Veranstaltungsseite_ansehen.html?terminid=551 ''Welche Religion braucht die Gesellschaft?'' ].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of methodology on the contrary it has been emphasised, that ''Geisteswissenschaften'' such as ''history'' and the ''philological'' disciplines, relating on empirical data (documents, books and utterances), along with ''psychology'' and the ''social sciences'', have a common ''empirical character'', which is essentially based on comprehension (''[[Verstehen]]'') or understanding of expressions of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernward Grünewald: ''Geist – Kultur – Gesellschaft. Versuch einer Prinzipientheorie der Geisteswissenschaften auf transzendentalphilosophischer Grundlage''. Berlin: Duncker und Humblot 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors, like [[Rudolf Steiner]], used the term ''Geisteswissenschaft'' in a historically quite distinct sense to refer to a proposed "Science of Spirit".

== Example usage ==

From ''Kulturgeschichte Frankreichs'', Suchanek-Fröhlich, p.&amp;nbsp;633:&lt;ref&gt;''Kulturgeschichte Frankreichs'' Suchanek-Fröhlich, Stefan Kröner Verlag, Stuttgart, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Man hat Taine vorgeworfen, dass er, dessen Hauptziel die Einführung naturwissenschaftlicher Methoden in die Geisteswissenschaften war, selbst nicht induktiv, sondern deduktiv vorging.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some reproach [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]] in that he himself, whose goal was the introduction of the methods of natural science into the ''Geisteswissenschaften'', proceeded from methods which were not inductive but rather deductive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Grey atmosphere''' (or gray) is a useful set of approximations made for radiative transfer applications in studies of stellar atmospheres based on the simplification that the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; of matter within the atmosphere is constant for all frequencies of incident radiation.

== Application ==
The application of the grey atmosphere approximation is the primary method astronomers use to determine the temperature and basic radiative properties of astronomical objects including the Sun, planets with atmospheres, other stars, and interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Although the model demonstrates good correlation to observations, it deviates from observational results because real atmospheres are not grey, e.g. radiation absorption is frequency-dependent.

== Approximations ==

The primary approximation is assumption that the [[absorption coefficient]], typically represented by an &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, has no dependence on frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; for the frequency range being worked in, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\nu} \longrightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Typically a number of other assumptions are made simultaneously:
# The atmosphere has a [[plane-parallel|plane-parallel atmosphere]] geometry.
# The atmosphere is in a thermal radiative equilibrium.

This set of assumptions leads directly to the mean [[radiance|intensity]] and [[source function]] being directly equivalent to a [[blackbody]] [[Planck function]] of the temperature at that [[optical depth]].

The Eddington approximation (see next section) may also be used optionally, to solve for the source function. This greatly simplifies the model without greatly distorting results.

== Derivation of source function using the Eddington Approximation ==

Deriving various quantities from the grey atmosphere model involves solving an integro-differential equation, an exact solution of which is complex. Therefore, this derivation takes advantage of a simplification known as the Eddington Approximation. Starting with an application of a plane-parallel model, we can imagine an atmospheric model built up of plane-parallel layers stacked on top of each other, where properties such as temperature are constant within a plane. This means that such parameters are function of physical depth &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, where the direction of positive &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; points towards the upper layers of the atmosphere. From this it is easy to see that a ray path &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; at angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to the vertical, is given by

&lt;math&gt; ds = \frac{dz}{cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

We now define optical depth as

&lt;math&gt;d\tau = -\alpha ds&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the absorption coefficient associated with the various constituents of the atmosphere. We now turn to the radiation transfer equation

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{ds} = j - \alpha I &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the total specific intensity, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the emission coefficient. After substituting for &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; and dividing by &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; we have

&lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{d I}{d\tau} = I - S &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called total source function defined as the ratio between emission and absorption coefficients. This differential equation can by solved by multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;e^{-\tau/\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, re-writing the lefthand side as &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau}(Ie^{-\tau/\mu})&lt;/math&gt; and then integrating the whole equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the solution

&lt;math&gt;I(\tau, \mu) = \frac{e^{\frac{\tau}{\mu}}}{\mu}\int^{\infty}_{\tau}Se^{-\frac{\tau}{\mu}}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the limits &lt;math&gt;\tau \in [\tau, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; as we are integrating outward from some depth within the atmosphere; therefore &lt;math&gt;\mu \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. Even though we have neglected the frequency-dependence of parameters such as &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we know that it is a function of optical depth therefore in order to integrate this we need to have a method for deriving the source function. We now define some important parameters such as energy density &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, total flux &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and radiation pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as follows

&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{2\pi}{c}\int^{+1}_{-1}Id\mu&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F = 2\pi \int^{+1}_{-1}I\mu d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{2\pi}{c}\int^{+1}_{-1}I\mu^{2}d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

We also define the average specific intensity (averaged over all frequencies) as

&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{1}{2}\int^{+1}_{-1}Id\mu&lt;/math&gt;

We see immediately that by dividing the radiative transfer equation by 2 and integrating over &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, we have

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{dF}{d\tau} = J - S&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, by multiplying the same equation by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and integrating w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, we have

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{F}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting the average specific intensity J into the definition of energy density, we also have the following relationship

&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{c}{4\pi}U&lt;/math&gt;

Now, it is important to note that total flux must remain constant through the atmosphere therefore

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{d\tau} = 0 \iff J = S&lt;/math&gt;

This condition is known as radiative equilibrium. Taking advantage of the constancy of total flux, we now integrate &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{c}(\tau + \kappa)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration. We know from thermodynamics that for an isotropic gas the following relationship holds

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{3}U = \frac{4\pi}{3c}J  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have substituted the relationship between energy density and average specific intensity derived earlier. Although this may be true for lower depths within the stellar atmosphere, near the surface it almost certainly isn't. However, the Eddington Approximation assumes this to hold at all levels within the atmosphere. Substituting this in the previous equation for pressure gives

&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{3F}{4\pi}(\tau + \kappa)&lt;/math&gt;

and under the condition of radiative equilibrium

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{3F}{4\pi}(\tau + \kappa)&lt;/math&gt;

This means we have solved the source function except for a constant of integration. Substituting this result into the solution to the radiation transfer equation and integrating gives

&lt;math&gt;I(\tau = 0, \mu) = \frac{3F}{4\pi}\frac{e^{\tau/\mu}}{\mu}\int^{\infty}_{0}(\tau + \kappa)e^{-\tau/\mu}d\tau = \frac{3F}{4\pi}(\mu + \kappa)&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have set the lower limit of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to zero, which is the value of optical depth at the surface of the atmosphere. This would represent radiation coming out of, say, the surface of the Sun. Finally, substituting this into the definition of total flux and integrating gives

&lt;math&gt;F = 2\pi \int^{+1}_{0}I\mu d\mu = \frac{3F}{2} \int^{+1}_{0}(\mu^{2} + \kappa\mu)d\mu = \frac{3F}{2}(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{\kappa}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and the source function is given by

&lt;math&gt;S(\tau) = \frac{3F}{4\pi}(\tau + \frac{2}{3})&lt;/math&gt;

== Temperature solution ==
Integrating the first and second moments of the radiative transfer equation, applying the above relation and the [[Two-Stream Limit]] approximation leads to information about each of the higher moments. The first moment of the mean intensity &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is constant regardless of [[optical depth]]:

&lt;math&gt; H(\tau) = H &lt;/math&gt;

The second moment of the mean intensity &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is then given by:

&lt;math&gt; K(\tau) = \tau H + 2/3 H = 1/3 J(\tau) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the [[Radiative transfer#The Eddington approximation|Eddington approximation]] is a direct consequence of these assumptions.

Defining an effective temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{eff} &lt;/math&gt; for the Eddington flux &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and applying the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]], realized this relation between the externally observed effective temperature and the internal blackbody temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the medium.

&lt;math&gt; T^4 = T_{eff}^4 \frac{3}{4} \left( \tau + \frac{2}{3} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The results of the grey atmosphere solution: The observed temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{eff} &lt;/math&gt; is a good measure of the true temperature  &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; at an optical depth  &lt;math&gt;\tau = 2/3 &lt;/math&gt; and the atmosphere top temperature is  &lt;math&gt; 0.841T_{eff} &lt;/math&gt;.

This approximation makes the [[source function]] linear in optical depth.

'''Hanging coffins''' are [[coffin]]s which have been placed on cliffs. They can be found in various locations, including [[China]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]]. In China, they are known in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as ''xuanguan'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|悬|棺}}|t={{linktext|懸|棺}}|p=xuán guān}}) which also means "hanging coffin".

Hanging coffins are an ancient [[funeral]] custom of some [[List of past Chinese ethnic groups|ethnic groups]], especially the [[Bo people (China)|Bo people]] of southern China. Coffins of various shapes were mostly carved from one whole piece of wood. Hanging coffins either lie on beams projecting outward from vertical faces such as mountains, are placed in caves in the face of cliffs, or sit on natural rock projections on mountain faces.

It was said that the hanging coffins could prevent bodies from being taken by beasts and also bless the soul eternally.&lt;ref name=chinaculture1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hanging Coffin|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_curiosity/2004-10/26/content_62632.htm|work=The Hanging Coffin|publisher=chinaculture.org|accessdate=10 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151218/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_curiosity/2004-10/26/content_62632.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritually, the Bo people viewed the mountain cliffs as a stairway to heaven and believed that by placing the coffins up high the deceased would be closer to heaven.

The most common such divisions are by [[latitude|latitudinal]] or [[longitude|longitudinal]] markers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hemisphere/ | title=Hemisphere| date=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Hyperseal''' is the brand name for a series of specialized paints developed by noted inventor Col. [[Ronald Savin]].  The paints are divided into three categories: glass-infused paints, ''Hyperglass'', zinc-infused paints, ''Hyperzinc'', and rubber infused paints, ''Hyperflex''. The paints were developed to significantly cool surfaces in the desert, seal out water and galvanize rust. 

Part of a wave of environmentally friendly, “green products,” the paints are intended to significantly decrease energy expenditure, prevent toxic run-off from asphalt driveways, and ensure that water born vessels, marinas and bridges need only be repainted every 20 years to prevent rust; instead of once a year. 

'''Hyperglass''' is the first paint formulated with hollow [[glass “microspheres”]] suspended in a specialized white Teflon paint.  The paint has the remarkable ability to keep a surface in direct sunlight only 10 – 12 &amp;#176;F above ambient air temperature. The paint is used to coat roofs, patios and boat decks.  Before this, a typical asphalt roof would be 50 – 75 &amp;#176;F higher than the ambient air.  In [[Southern California]], homes with Hyperglass painted roofs, have seen a reduction of 50% of their air conditioning bills, thus significantly reducing their [[carbon footprint]]. Hyperseal has also developed a multipurpose caulk, called [[Hyperflex Caulk]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''IP over [[DWDM]]''' ('''IPoDWDM''') is a technology used in [[telecommunications networks]] to integrate IP [[Router (computing)|Routers]] and Switches in the OTN ([[Optical Transport Network]]).
A true IPoDWDM solution is implemented only when the IP Routers and  Switches  support ITU-T G.709.&lt;ref name=G709&gt;“Interfaces for Optical Transport Network (OTN)”, ITU-T G.709/Y.1331&lt;/ref&gt; In this way IP devices can monitor the optical path and implement the transport functionality as FEC ([[Forward Error Correction]]) specified by [[ITU-T]] [[G.709/Y.1331]]&lt;ref name=G709/&gt; or [[Super FEC]] functionality defined in ITU-T G.975.1.&lt;ref&gt;“Forward error correction for high bit-rate DWDM submarine systems”, ITU-T G.975.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
This approach saves network components including shelves, processors, interfaces cards and hence it permits to reduce the power consumption, OPEX ([[Operational expenditure]]) and CAPEX  ([[capital expenditure]]).
This approach brings also a simplification of the network, eliminating the [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]/[[SONET]] intermediate layer.&lt;ref&gt;Virgilio Puglia, Olga Zadedyurina, [http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/29/02/T29020000090053PDFE.pdf “optical transport networks: from all-optical to digital”], IEEE,31/08/2009 {{ISBN|978-92-61-12891-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivendors==
A DWDM network can be implemented using different vendor technology from the IP devices as long as they support [[alien wavelength]] transmission specified by ITU-T G.698.2.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ventorini, E. Moura, L. Paraschis, O. Gerstel, M. Silva, K. Wollenweber, A.J. Silverio, P.P. Henrique, L.A.C. Silva “Demonstration and evaluation of IP-over-DWDM networking as "alien-wavelength" over existing carrier  DWDM infrastructure”, Optical Fiber communication/ National Fiber Optic Engineers Conference, Issue , 24–28 February 2008 Page(s):1 – 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amplified multichannel DWDM applications with single channel optical interfaces”, ITU-T G.698.2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1581">The '''Institute for Solar Physics''' ({{lang-sv|Institutet för solfysik}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] research institute.  It is managed as an independent institute associated with [[Stockholm University]] through its [[Stockholm Observatory|Department of Astronomy]]. It is also a national research infrastructure under the [[Swedish Research Council]].

The institute was first established in 1951 by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] as The Research Station for [[Astrophysics]] on the island of [[Capri]], [[Italy]]. Around 1980 the station moved to [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. The new station is situated within the Spanish-International Observatory on the Roque de los Muchachos. It soon became obvious that the superior astronomical climate on La Palma called for a first-class solar telescope. The 47.5-cm [[Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope]], SVST, was erected in 1985. 

During the nineties, the daily operations of the institute gradually moved from La Palma to Stockholm.

The SVST was removed from the tower on 28 August 2000 after almost 15 years of successful operations.  The SVST has been replaced with the [[Swedish Solar Telescope|Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope]], which has twice as large aperture diameter.

In 2013, the institute was transferred from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] to its current home with [[Stockholm University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">The '''Internet Shakespeare Editions''' is a non-profit organization that produces a website devoted to [[William Shakespeare]] and his works. The organization is an associate member of the [[Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]], under the classification of theatre service provider,&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, Roberta, ''Quarto'', Spring-Summer 2001, "[http://www.staaonline.org/files/Quarto%20Spring-Summer%202001.pdf Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]", accessed 4 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the [[University of Victoria]] and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]].

The website includes a variety of Shakespeare-related resources, including fully annotated texts of his plays and poems, multimedia materials and records of his plays in performance, and historical information about Shakespeare's life and the Renaissance.

== History ==

The project began on a floppy disc in 1988, which creator Michael Best called ''Shakespeare's Life and Times.'' In 1994 he transferred it to CD-ROM. By 1996, Best decided that the Internet was the ideal medium for his Shakespeare project. He translated his earlier formats into a web  format and formally founded the Internet Shakespeare Editions in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Times Colonist, ''Williams World'', 23 April 2008, "[http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=e91a60df-c9dc-4528-96f6-c1e9a56f6e58&amp;k=78059 CanWest MediaWorks Publications]", accessed 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the freely accessible site was redesigned to include advertisements.

In addition to the website, the Internet Shakespeare Editions also published a CD-ROM titled ''A Shakespeare Suite.'' The CD-ROM, published in 2002 and distributed by Insight Media, is a companion tool for Shakespeare studies designed for teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;Steggle, Matthew, [http://purl.oclc.org/emls/09-2/stegbest.html ''Review of Internet Shakespeare Editions, A Shakespeare Suite CD-Rom'']. Early Modern Literary Studies 9.2 (September, 2003): 8.1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editing and publishing ==
The ISE's academic development is overseen by an Editorial Board of 23 members from universities in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In addition to featuring searchable texts and facsimiles of the folios and quartos, the website is a venue for Shakespeare scholars to publish their fully edited and annotated texts. Existing peer-reviewed publications include: 

* ''As You Like It'', edited by [[David Bevington]];
* ''Cymbeline'', edited by Jennifer Forsyth;
* ''Henry IV, Part One'', edited by Rosemary Gaby;
* ''Julius Caesar'', edited by John D. Cox;
* ''Romeo and Juliet'', edited by Roger Apfelbaum;
* ''The Tempest'', edited by Brent Whitted and Paul Yachnin;
* ''Troilus and Cressida'', edited by William Godshalk and Anthony Colianne; and
* ''Venus and Adonis'', edited by Hardy M. Cook.

Additional modern texts, complete with annotations and collations, have been published but have not yet been peer reviewed.

The ISE also publishes editions of plays written for the [[Queen's Men]], many of which influenced Shakespeare. These plays are prepared for the project [http://qme.internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/ Shakespeare and the Queen's Men], based out of McMaster University and the University of Toronto.

== Theater ==
The Internet Shakespeare Editions' database of Shakespeare in Performance is a searchable archive of information and materials related to performances of Shakespeare's plays. There are thousands of digitized artifacts—images, audio clips, and videos—currently available for public viewing on the site, as well as cast and crew lists for hundreds of films and live performances. The database is overseen by a board of actors, directors, and academics.

In winter 2007, the ISE launched its Performance Chronicle. The Performance Chronicle is a searchable blog-style database of reviews of contemporary Shakespearean productions, written by the general public and scholars. It also includes reviews from scholarly journals, such as ''Cahiers Élizabéthains'', ''Shakespeare Bulletin'', and ''Early Modern Literary Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Brett D., ''Reviewed and Re-Wired: Video and the Shakespeare Edition.''

'''Left-hand–right-hand activity chart''' is an illustration that shows the contributions of the right and left hands of a worker and the balance of the workload between the right and left hands.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, M. P. (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chart]] is very effective method to analyze the work done by a single worker and it is very helpful in improving the work done by the worker.

'''Lionel Bailey Budden''' [[FRIBA]] (1887, [[West Derby]], [[Liverpool]]&lt;ref&gt;http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=lionel&amp;lastname=budden&amp;eventyear=1887&amp;eventyear_offset=0&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 21 July 1956, [[Wirral Peninsula]], [[Cheshire]]&lt;ref&gt;http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-deaths-1837-2007?firstname=lionel%20b&amp;lastname=budden&amp;yearofbirth=1887&amp;yearofbirth_offset=2&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English architect.

Born to William Budden and Elizabeth Adams, Budden attended [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option,com_parksandgardens/task,person/id,229/Itemid,/ Parks &amp; Gardens UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106103810/http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_parksandgardens/task%2Cperson/id%2C229/Itemid%2C |date= 6 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933 Budden was [[Roscoe Professor in Architecture]] in the [[Liverpool University School of Architecture]]. He retired in 1952.

He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, taught there from 1911 and became Associate Professor in 1924. It was while he was Associate Professor that he contributed the article on [[Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)|Architectural Education]] to the fourteenth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1929).

He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the [[British School at Athens]] 1909-1912.  He was first an Associate of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA).
His architectural work included [[Birkenhead War Memorial]] and [[Liverpool Cenotaph]]; Liverpool Veterinary Hospital and extensions to Liverpool University Students’ Union.

He had married in 1921, and had one son and one daughter.

For his ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article, published shortly before the passing of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]] see: [[Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)]]. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]].

{{italictitle}}
'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is a children's book that was written by [[Dori Hillestad Butler]] and Illustrated by Carol Thompson. The book was published by Albert Whitman &amp; Company in 2005, but was banned in several states due to its content. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011 and is regarded as a highly controversial piece of children's literature. 

==Plot==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' is narrated by a young girl named Elizabeth whose mother is pregnant with another child. Elizabeth takes the reader through the nine months of her mother's pregnancy and explains everything that she learns along the way. At first Elizabeth learns about doctor's visits and ultrasounds, and eventually she learns the facts of life from her mother. When Elizabeth's mother is in the hospital having the baby Elizabeth stays with her grandmother, and in the end Elizabeth is thrilled to introduce her new little brother Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Dori|title=My Mom's Having a Baby|date=2005|publisher=Albert Whitman &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' was censored in Oregon, Indiana, Kansas, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, and Florida. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011, and was censored for nudity, sex education, and unsuitability to the age group.&lt;ref name = banned&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Kristen|title=Banned Books Month: Guest Post from Dori Hillestad Butler: How Censorship Has Changed Me|url=http://www.ekristinanderson.com/?p=7651|website=Write All the Words!|publisher=Kristen Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains nudity in order to provide a detailed description of how babies are created. The amount of detail in the explanation provided in the story has created controversy among parents due to the accuracy with which Butler describes the act of sex. The illustrations are controversial because they depict both male and female nudity, as well as the parents together under the covers in a way that implies they are having sex.

In an interview with ''Fox News'', Butler defended her work by stating that it is in the children's non-fiction section along with other explanatory children's books about childbirth, disease, and war. She stated that her book was meant to be explained to a child by a parent, and that parents should not assume that every book in the children's section can or should be read without supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Dori|title=Is Children's Book Too Graphic for Kids?|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4554700/is-childrens-book-too-graphic-for-kids/?#sp=show-clips|website=Fox News|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' received a starred review from Booklist, and was Booklist Editor's Choice Book for 2005 directly after its publication. It is also a Top Ten Science - Technology award winner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Butler states in her post as a guest blogger on ''Write All the Words!'' that she explained sex to her children in the very same way that she explains it in the book.&lt;ref name = banned/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8410">The National Institute for Social Work Training was set up in 1961, following proposals put forward in the 1959 [[Eileen Younghusband]] report for an independent staff college for social work.&lt;ref&gt; Ministry of Health Working Party on Social Workers in the Health and Welfare Services. Chaired by [[Eileen Younghusband]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its initial funding was assured for ten years by the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust. It was later renamed the National Institute for Social Work (NISW), with a governing body of  some twenty-five members. 

Its staff worked throughout the [[United Kingdom]], supporting users and carers, practitioners, managers and policy makers in their work. NISW also attracted students from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;these included Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Nigeria, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Zimbabwe&lt;/ref&gt; 

NISW’s later funding came as a grant from the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. This was supplemented by fees from courses and consultancies. Special projects e.g. research, were also funded by other government departments, as well by charitable trusts.

NISW was located in Mary Ward House, Tavistock Place, London. NISW North opened in 1986 with an office in Leeds. 

When the National Institute for Social Work closed in 2003, its archives were deposited at the [[Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick]]. Its Library collection moved to the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]], as did some staff from the Institute’s Research Unit. Other research staff working on the social services workforce project were transferred to Kings College, London University.&lt;ref&gt;the new group at Kings was named the Social Care Workforce Research Unit (SCWRU). For further information On SCWRU, see:  https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/scwru/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Activities ==

=== Teaching ===
NISW offered a one-year course and a three months course, aimed at social work practitioners and managers in both the statutory and voluntary sectors. These covered all aspects of social work, including casework, group work, community development, residential and community care, as well as management and staff development. 
NISW staff also provided a consultancy service, and an extensive programme of residental short courses throughout the UK. By the late 1970s, they had also begun to work with colleague organisations in other European countries.

=== Research ===
 
NISW’s Research Unit&lt;ref&gt; Directors of Research: Tilda Goldberg 1963-1977, Ian Sinclair 1977 – 1989,  Jan Pahl 1990 – 1995, Mike Fisher 1996 – 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  was established in 1963 by Tilda Goldberg,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jan/10/socialcare.guardianobituaries and also [http://www.beds.ac.uk/goldbergcentre www.beds.ac.uk/goldbergcentre]&lt;/ref&gt; who designed the first randomised controlled trials in British social work. The Unit's  numerous studies were each designed to answer the question: ‘What works, and why?’ These studies included evaluations of social work in general practice, the effectiveness of task-centred casework, the role of social work area offices and clients’ attitudes to social work. Thereafter, during the 1980s, the Unit carried out studies of the carers for the confused elderly, the reasons for admission into old people’s homes and the varying roles played by relatives, friends, neighbours and services in supporting frail elderly people living alone. During the 1990s, the Unit’s research included studies of respite services for those caring for someone with dementia, hospital discharge of elderly people, child care and the social services workforce. 
 
From its inception, the Unit’s staff also took part in the Institute’s teaching programme, and published widely.

=== Policy Influence === 

NISW hosted and/or provided members for a number of important committees and their reports. These included:
* the [[Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm|Frederic Seebohm]] committee on the integration of social work services&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services, 1968. Chaired by [[Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm|Frederic Seebohm]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the [[Geraldine Aves]] committee on the voluntary worker in social services.&lt;ref&gt;report published by NCSS in 1969. Chaired by Geraldine Aves&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Gillian Wagner committee on residential care&lt;ref&gt;published as A Positive Choice. Report of the Independent Review of Residential Care, HMSO, 1988. Chaired by Gillian Wagner&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the Peter Barclay committee on the roles and tasks of social workers&lt;ref&gt;published as The Barclay Report: Social Workers, Their Role and Tasks 1982, NISW. Chaired by Peter Barclay&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the [[Eileen Younghusband]] and [[Edward Boyle, Baron Boyle of Handsworth|Edward Boyle]] committees set up by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] to consider the future of community development in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;published as (1) Community Work and Social Change 1968 and (2) Current Issues in Community Work 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===

Southwark Community Project (1968-1973)&lt;ref&gt;see Organising for Social Change, D.N. Thomas, Allen and Unwin, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Race Equality Unit (1987-1995)&lt;ref&gt; see https://raceequalityfoundation.org.uk/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Library ===

By the end of the 1990s, NISW’s Library comprised some 30,000 books and 300 journal titles. &lt;ref&gt;see http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/uwenews/news.aspx?id=360&lt;/ref&gt; It had also developed an online information service, as well as an information and lending service for Social Services Departments. The Library attracted social workers, students and scholars, but it was also a valuable resource to staff from government departments, as well those in other statutory bodies and voluntary agencies who had their headquarters in or near central [[London]].

The Institute’s series, the ''National Institute Social Services Library'', was run in partnership with [[George Allen and Unwin]], who published over fifty books in the series on all aspects of social work practice and training. NISW also published its own in-house series, the ''National Institute for Social Work Papers'', designed as accessible guides to various elements of social work practice. 

Together with its Library, the Institute’s gardens, meeting rooms and Common Room provided a congenial setting for minds to meet, from all walks of social work life. NISW's policy of renting out office space to kindred organisations brought in not just valuable  income but also fellow professionals with new or different ideas to share.

=== Visiting Professors ===

All of NISW’s activities were strengthened by its ability to attract a steady stream of visiting professors, all but two of whom came from American universities:

Ken Daniels (New Zealand),  Eileen Gambrill,  Neil Gilbert,  Charles Grosser,  Arnold Gurin,  Ken Heap (Norway),  Ralph Kramer,  Frank Maple,  

Anne Minahan,  Mel Moguloff,  Robert Perlman,  Allen Pincus,  Jack Rothman,  Harry Specht,  Roland Warren, James Whittaker.

The '''Oswaldo Cruz Foundation''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] '''''Fundação Oswaldo Cruz''''', also known as '''FIOCRUZ''') is a scientific institution for research and development in biological sciences located in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], it is considered one of the world's main [[public health]] research institutions. It was founded by Dr. [[Oswaldo Cruz]], a noted physician and epidemiologist.

The organization started in 1898 as the '''Federal SeroTherapy Institute''' with the objective of developing serum and vaccines against the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpqrr.fiocruz.br/pg/en/about-us/history/ |title=History of Fiocruz Minas – Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located outside of [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The institute’s activities, however, changed from simple production into research and experimental medicine, especially after Oswaldo Cruz assumed its leadership in 1902. From there on, the institute became the base for memorable sanitation campaigns in an age of outbreaks and epidemics of the [[bubonic plague]], [[yellow fever]], and [[smallpox]]. 
The Institute, however, was not confined to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and, on the contrary, collaborated in the occupation of the country’s interior through scientific expeditions, aiding in the development of the country.

When Oswaldo Cruz died, in 1917, the Institute, which by then already bore his name, was nationally consolidated through important scientific achievements, such as [[Carlos Chagas]]’ description of the complete cycle of the [[American trypanosomiasis]] including the clinical pattern of the disease.
On 16 January 2007, the Institute announced that it had developed a gel from [[algae]] which it is hoped will reduce [[HIV]] transmission to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6266527.stm |title=Algae gel to combat HIV infection | work=BBC News | date=16 January 2007 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the institution has a broad range of responsibilities related to the health and wellbeing of the Brazilian population. This includes hospital and ambulatory care; health-related research; development of vaccines, drugs, reagents, and diagnostic kits; training of public health and health workers; and providing information and communications related to health, science, and technology. The Fiocruz workforce members are over 7,500. Fiocruz includes several fixed facilities in Rio de Janeiro and other locations; however, it contributes to improving health throughout the country, through its support to the Sistema Único de Saúde (Unified Health System, the Brazilian public health system), its proposals on public health policy-making, its research activities, its scientific expeditions, and the reach of its health services and products.

Fiocruz is one of the founding members of the [[International Association of National Public Health Institutes]], a membership organization of [[national public health institutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428072858/http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 28, 2013 |title=Hisyory |publisher=IANPHI |accessdate=August 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Evolution===
Similar sequences are often found along [[protein]] [[polypeptide]] chains in different species. This similarity is directly linked to the sequence of the [[DNA]] (the genetic material of the organism). Due to the improbability of this being random chance, and its consistency too long to be attributed to convergence by [[natural selection]], these similarities can be plausibly linked to the existence of a common ancestor with common genes. This allows polypeptide sequences to be compared between species, and the difference between two genetic sequences can be used to determine - within error - the time at which a common ancestor existed.&lt;ref name="Pauling" /&gt;

====Human evolution====
Using the thigh bone of a [[Neanderthal]] female, 63% of the Neanderthal genome was uncovered and 3.7 billion bases of DNA were decoded.&lt;ref name="pmid20448178"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green RE, Krause J, Briggs AW, Maricic T, Stenzel U, Kircher M, Patterson N, Li H, Zhai W | title = A draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979 | pages = 710–22 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 20448178 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188021 |display-authors=etal | pmc=5100745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saey&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saey TH | title = Story one: Team decodes neanderthal DNA: Genome draft may reveal secrets of human evolution | journal = Science News | year = 2009 | volume = 175 | issue = 6 | pages = 5–7 | doi = 10.1002/scin.2009.5591750604}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' was the closest living relative of ''Homo sapiens,'' until the former lineage died out 30,000 years ago. The Neanderthal [[genome]] was shown to be within the range of variation of those of anatomically modern humans, although at the far periphery of that range of variation. Paleogenetic analysis also suggests that Neanderthals shared more DNA with chimpanzees than ''homo sapiens''.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; It was also found that Neanderthals were less genetically diverse than modern humans are, which indicates that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' grew from a group composed of relatively few individuals.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; DNA sequences suggest that ''Homo sapiens'' first appeared  between about 130,000 and 250,000 years ago in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt;

Paleogenetics opens up many new possibilities for the study of hominid evolution and dispersion. By analyzing the genomes of [[hominid]] remains, their lineage can be traced back to from where they came, or from where they share a common ancestor. The [[Denisova hominid]], a species of hominid found in [[Siberia]] from which DNA was able to be extracted, may show signs of having genes that are not found in any Neanderthal nor [[Homo sapiens]] genome, possibly representing a new lineage or species of hominid.&lt;ref name="Zorich"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zorich Z | year = 2010 | title = Neanderthal Genome Decoded | journal = Archaeology | publisher = Archaeological Institute of America | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = | url = http://www.archaeology.org/1007/etc/neanderthal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of culture===
Looking at DNA can give insight into lifestyles of people of the past. Neandertal DNA shows that they lived in small temporary communities.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; DNA analysis can also show dietary restrictions and mutations, such as the fact that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' was [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]].&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt;

==Archaeology==

===Ancient disease===
Studying DNA of the deceased also allows us to look at the medical history of the human race. By looking back we can discover when certain diseases first appeared and began to afflict humans.

====Ötzi====
The oldest case of [[Lyme disease]] was discovered in the genome on a man called [[Ötzi|Ötzi the Iceman]].&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller A, Graefen A, Ball M, Matzas M, Boisguerin V, Maixner F, Leidinger P, Backes C, Khairat R | title = New insights into the Tyrolean Iceman's origin and phenotype as inferred by whole-genome sequencing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 698 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22426219 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1701 | layurl = http://news.discovery.com/history/iceman-mummy-lyme-disease-120228.html | laysource = DiscoveryNews |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ötzi died around 3,300 B.C., and his remains were discovered in the Eastern Alps in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"/&gt; An analysis of his genes was not run until 20 years later. Genetic remains of the bacterium that cause Lyme disease, ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', were discovered in genetic material from Ötzi.&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"/&gt;

===Domestication of animals===
Not only can past humans be investigated through paleogenetics, but the organisms they had an effect on can also be examined. Through examination of the divergence found in [[domesticated]] species such as [[cattle]] and the archaeological record from their wild counterparts; the effect of domestication can be studied, which could tell us a lot about the behaviors of the cultures that domesticated them. The genetics of these animals also reveals traits not shown in the paleontological remains, such as certain clues as to the behavior, development, and maturation of these animals. The diversity in genes can also tell where the species were domesticated, and how these domesticates migrated from these locations elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Ancient remains usually contain only a small fraction of the original [[DNA]] present in an organism.&lt;ref name="Pauling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Matt. [http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555 DNA has a 521-year half-life.] ''Nature News'', 10 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the [[DNA#Damage|degradation of DNA]] in dead tissue by biotic and abiotic factors once repair enzymes present in living tissue cease to be functional. DNA preservation is dependent on a number of environmental characteristics, including temperature, humidity, oxygen and sunlight. Remains from regions with high heat and humidity typically contain less intact DNA than those from [[permafrost]] or caves, where remains may persist in cold, low oxygen conditions for several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest. [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/02/dna_testing_richard_iii_how_long_does_dna_last.html What’s the Shelf-Life of DNA?] [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DNA degrades much more quickly following excavation of materials, and freshly excavated bone has a much higher chance of containing viable genetic material.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt; After [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], bone may also become contaminated with modern DNA (i.e. from contact with skin or unsterilized tools), which can create false-positive results.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt;

'''Pegging''' is a [[sexual practice]] in which a woman performs [[anal sex]] on a man by [[sexual penetration|penetrating]] the man's [[Human anus|anus]] with a [[strap-on dildo]]. This practice may also involve stimulating the [[male genitalia]].

The [[neologism]] "pegging" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in [[Dan Savage]]'s "[[Savage Love]]" sex advice column, held after an observation was made that there was no common name or dictionary definition for the act in the [[English language]].&lt;ref name=sl&gt;These three links chronicle how the term ''pegging'' came into usage.

==Pleasurable aspects==

===Physical pleasure===
{{Main|Strap-on dildo}}
In terms of physical pleasure, a woman's [[genitals]] may get direct stimulation from the base of the dildo, or in the case of a [[double-ended dildo]], from vaginal (or internal) penetration. A woman can use a secondary [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], between the dildo and her genitals, to get pleasure from pegging. Men may find stimulation of the anus, rectum, and especially the prostate, pleasurable. During anal sex, male pleasure can be particularly derived from the [[prostate]], which can lead to an [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Prostate massage"&gt;{{cite web|title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203540/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men enjoy [[masturbation|masturbating]] (or being manually stimulated) during pegging.
Triple-ended dildos provide both vaginal and anal stimulation of the female partner.

===Psychological pleasure===
Advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

==Instructional materials==
A few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including ''[[Bend Over Boyfriend]]'' (1998), Based on a series of lectures and workshops by Robert Lawrence and [[Carol Queen]] and co-produced by Fatale Media, Inc. The movie was created and directed by Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, SIR Video Movies co-founders. ''Bend Over Boyfriend'' originally inspired [[Dan Savage]] to call the act "BOBing" but his readers subsequently voted on the winning term, "pegging".&lt;ref name=nault&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]|number=52|date=Summer 2010|title=Bend Over Boyfriend to Take it Like a Man: pegging pornography and the queer representation of straight sex|first=Curran|last=Nault|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc52.2010/naultPegging/ |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pornographic film director and sex educator [[Tristan Taormino]] released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 by [[Vivid Entertainment]] Studio, ''Tristan Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bridges | first1 = Ana J. | last2 = Sun | first2 = Chyng | last3 = Wosnitzer | first3 = Robert | last4 = Scharrer | first4 = Erica | last5 = Liberman | first5 = Rachael | title = A comparison of male and female directors in popular pornography: what happens when women are at the helm? | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 312–325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00439.x | date = September 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it, she teaches a workshop with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes, in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual devices and positions for pegging.

As an author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]] wrote and released ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex'' in 2007.

Since 2010, the sex educator by the screen name of Ruby Ryder has been running a blog and podcast entitled ''Pegging Paradise''. As of September 2017, the podcast has over 166 episodes.&lt;ref name=peggingparadise&gt;[http://peggingparadise.com Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise].&lt;/ref&gt; She also runs the instructional site ''Pegging: 101'' which is especially targeting those interested in pegging with no interests in the association with BDSM. &lt;ref name=pegging101&gt;[http://pegging101.com Pegging: 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
The first pegging scene in film (long before the term was coined) appears to have been in the 1970 film ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Gore Vidal]], although it was not explicit. The first explicit pegging scene is believed to have been in the 1976 pornographic film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''.&lt;ref name=nault/&gt;

Female-to-male strap-on pornography became a popular subgenre in the early 21st century, with a number of studios producing dedicated series about it. Pegging films include ''Strap It On'', ''Babes Ballin Boys'', ''Strap Attack'', ''Strap-on Chicks'', ''Boss Bitches'', various films produced by LEDA Studios, as well as San Francisco-based BDSM themed website ''[[kink.com|Men In Pain]]''.

Female [[porn stars]] who expressed their pleasure in pegging their male partners include [[Taylor Wane]], [[Debi Diamond]], [[Brittany Andrews]], and [[Monique Covét]]. When questioned about her particular [[kink (sexual)|kink]], Covét replied, "If we women have to take it from behind, then why not a man?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |title=Not just another Barbie |date=July 25, 2002 |work=[[The Budapest Sun]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065043/http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}

|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

===Special case: Donation game===
The "donation game"&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbe|first=Christian |author2=Martin A.

Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related games==

===Closed-bag exchange===
[[File:Prisoner's Dilemma briefcase exchange (colorized).svg|thumb|The prisoner's dilemma as a briefcase exchange]]
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas R. | last=Hofstadter| authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter | title= [[Metamagical Themas]]: questing for the essence of mind and pattern | publisher= Bantam Dell Pub Group| year=1985 | isbn=0-465-04566-9|chapter= Ch.29 ''The Prisoner's Dilemma Computer Tournaments and the Evolution of Cooperation''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was "closed bag exchange":
{{quote|Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.}}

In this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

The rewards matrix is
{| class="wikitable"
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Pair 1}}|{{color|#900|Pair 2}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:6em;" | {{color|#900|"Friend"&lt;br /&gt;(cooperate)}}

|}

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

An '''RX meter''' is used to measure the separate [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] and [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] components of reactive parallel Z network.

The two variable [[frequency]] [[oscillator]]s track each other at frequencies 100&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] apart. The output of a 0.5-250&amp;nbsp;MHz oscillator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciardiello|first=Emilio|title=RX Meter 250-A|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/boonton_rx_meter_250_a.html|publisher=Radiomuseum|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; F1, is fed into a bridge. When the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] network to be measured is connected one arm across the bridge, the equivalent parallel resistance and reactance (capacitive or inductive) unbalances the bridge and the resulting voltage is fed to the mixer. The output of the 0.6-250.1&amp;nbsp;MHz oscillator F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, tracking 100&amp;nbsp;kHz above F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,is also fed to the mixer. This results in a 100&amp;nbsp;kHz difference frequency proportional in level to the bridge unbalance. The difference frequency signal is amplified by a filter amplifier combination and is applied to a null meter. When the bridge resistive and reactive controls are nulled, their respective dials accurately indicate the parallel impedance components of the network under test.

The best-known RX Meter was the RX250-A, developed in the early 1950s by [[Boonton Radio Corporation]]. After acquiring BRC, [[Hewlett-Packard]] continued to sell versions of the meter (both the original and the improved 250B) into the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mislanghe|first=Marc|title=Direct Measurement of Impedance|url=http://www.hpmemory.org/wa_pages/wall_a_page_14.htm|work=Quick Tour - From Vacuum Tube to Transistor|publisher=HP Memory Project|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Washington Manuscript of the Psalms''' (''Washington MS II''), is designated as '''Rahlfs 1219''', and '''van Haelst 83''' in the Van Haelst Catalogue numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Larry W. Hurtado, ''The Freer Biblical Manuscripts. Fresh Studies of an American Treasure Trove'', K. D. Clarke ''Paleography and philanthropy'' pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript (MS) contains the text of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 1:4-146:9a, 149:2b-151:6 in [[Koine Greek|Greek]], plus the first 6 verses of the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|book of Odes]], written on [[parchment]] sometime in the 5th Century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders, ''The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms'', pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description&lt;ref&gt;H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders, ''The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms'', pp. 107-114, 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;==
The codex is a book of 107 leaves, badly decayed and worm eaten. In his initial description of the manuscript, Henry A. Sanders noted that sometime in the 10th Century CE, some of the final pages of the codex that contained Psalms 142:9-151 were lost. Rather than having new pages written, other pages from a slightly less older codex were taken and added to the end, completing the Psalms and adding six verses from the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|book of Odes]] (1:1-6a). This is apparent due to the different page size, the repetition of Psalm 142:5-8, and the divergent handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Larry W. Hurtado, ''The Freer Biblical Manuscripts. Fresh Studies of an American Treasure Trove'', K. D. Clarke ''Paleography and Philanthropy'' pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt; H. A.&amp;nbsp;Sanders indicated the original codex by the Greek letter Λ (Lambda), and the secondary codex as Λ&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (Lambda A).

* '''Λ:'''
The [[parchment]] is a mixture of goat and sheep skin. The main text is written in a dark-brown ink, with red ink used for the Psalm titles and numbers, and also for the word διαψαλμα. The text is written in one column per page, which originally would've been around 25 x 35&amp;nbsp;cm, 30 lines per page, with about 25-30 letters per line.&lt;br&gt;
Due to decay, almost half of each leaf is missing, with some leaves having decay covering them in their entirety, although with letters still visible.&lt;br&gt;
The text is written in large square uncial, with the Psalm titles usually in a slightly smaller size.&lt;br&gt;
Each Psalm has its number in the left hand margin in uppercase letters representing numerals, with decorative lines above and below the letter .&lt;br&gt;
The manuscript covers Psalms 1:4-142:8, with the last pages of the manuscript completely missing.

* '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;:'''
The [[parchment]] is made of sheepskin only. The main text is written in a medium-brown ink, with red ink used for the Psalm titles and numbers as in '''Λ'''. The text is written in one column per page, which originally would've been around 27.5 x 21.58&amp;nbsp;cm, 24 lines per page, with about 18-24 letters per line.&lt;br&gt;
The seven leaves are in a fragmentary condition, and would originally have contained Psalms 142:5-151:6 and [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Odes]] 1:1-6a, but due to the loss of two leaves, Psalms 146:9b-149:2b are missing.&lt;br&gt;
The text is written in large, sloping letters known as ''Slavonic uncial''.

==Text of Codex&lt;ref&gt;H. Sanders, ''The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms'', pp. 113-117, 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;==
* '''Λ:'''
: - Has very little punctuation, with most occurring only at the end of lines, with Sanders only counting 8 exceptions.

: - Text is written in verses corresponding to the [[Psalms#Poetic characteristics|Hebrew parallelisms]], with any that go over one line being written on the line below, usually with an indent to signify that it's not a new phrase.

: - Has no [[stanza]] division, but the writing does align somewhat with the [[stichoi]] of [[Codex Vaticanus]].

: - Has certain [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]] (representing και, ου, μου, αυτου, ον, μαι, του, μνης, νην, θαι, ται) for the ends of lines where the text becomes crowded, although sometimes these [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]] are used within the lines themselves.

: - Employs the use of numerous [[Nomina Sacra]], consistently using the [[nomen sacrum]] for {{overline|ΘΣ}} (God), {{overline|ΚΣ}} (Lord), {{overline|ΔΑΔ}} (David), and {{overline|ΧΣ}} (Messiah/Anointed); with other [[nomen sacrum]] used frequently: {{overline|ΟΡΟΣ}} (heaven), {{overline|ΙΗΛ}} (Israel), {{overline|ΜΗΡ}} (mother), {{overline|ΣΗΡ}} (saviour), {{overline|ΠΡΣ}} (father), {{overline|ΑΝΟΣ}} (man/human), {{overline|ΠΝΑ}} (Spirit), {{overline|ΥΣ}} (son), and {{overline|ΙΗΛΜ}} (Jerusalem).

: - Uses diacritical strokes and dots over vowels (though not consistently), varying from a short grave accent to a small dot.

: - Uses the apostrophe consistently throughout, with a slightly varied shape. This appears mainly after final consonants, between double consonants, between unlike consonants, and after the Greek εκ.

* '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;:'''
: - Has only 11 extant cases of punctuation.
: - Text aligns with the [[stichoi]] of [[Codex Vaticanus]], with any verses going over one line being spread onto two or more lines, with indentation to signify inclusion with what precedes.
: - Has certain [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]] (representing μους, ται, αυτου, του) infrequently.
: - Employs the use of numerous [[Nomina Sacra]] (although with slight divergence from those seen in '''Λ'''), consistently using the [[nomen sacrum]] for {{overline|ΘΣ}} (God), {{overline|ΚΣ}} (Lord), and {{overline|ΔΑΔ}} (David); with other [[nomen sacrum]] used frequently: {{overline|ΟΥΝΟΣ}} (heaven), {{overline|ΙΣΛ}} (Israel), {{overline|ΠΡΣ}} (father), {{overline|ΑΝΟΣ}} (man/human), {{overline|ΠΝΑ}} (Spirit), and {{overline|ΙΗΛΜ}} (Jerusalem). In contrast to '''Λ''', υιος (son) is not a [[nomen sacrum]], and μητηρ (mother) doesn't occur.

==History of Manuscript&lt;ref&gt;H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders, ''The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms'' pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;==
Prior to its purchase by [[Charles Lang Freer|Freer]] in 1906 from an Arab dealer named ''Ali'' in [[Gizah]], [[Cairo]], very little is known about the manuscript, where it came from or for whom it was written. One possible place of origin is the ''Church of Timothy'' in the Monastery of the Vinedresser, a Coptic Monastery probably destroyed during the Muslim persecutions of the 14th Century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Larry W. Hurtado, ''The Freer Biblical Manuscripts. Fresh Studies of an American Treasure Trove'', K. D. Clarke ''Paleography and Philanthropy'' pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When the manuscript was granted to H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders, he had to go through a long and precarious process of separating the leaves of the codex, which due to decay had turned the [[parchment]] into a hard, glue-like substance, becoming a solid mass. H.&amp;nbsp;Sanders describes in detail in ''The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms'', pp 107–109 how he separated the leaves of the codex, which effectively employed the use of a woolen cloth, and a thin-bladed dinner knife.

Due to the fragmentary and fragile nature of the manuscript, Sanders was unable to separate more than two leaves in a day, having to create as accurate a [[collation]] as possible before further deterioration occurred on the leaves, and as such his reprint of the text shows letters that are now no longer extant.

The manuscript is one of the six main manuscripts that comprise the [[Biblical Manuscripts in the Freer Collection|Freer Biblical Manuscripts]], currently housed at The [[Freer Gallery of Art]].

In [[linguistics]], '''referential indeterminacy''' is a situation in which different people vary in naming objects. For example, [[William Labov]] studied this effect using illustrations of different drinking vessels to see what people would label as "cups" and what people would label as "mugs".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Regulated rewriting''' is a specific area of [[formal languages]] studying grammatical systems which are able to take some kind of control over the production applied in a derivation  step. For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are  also called "Grammars with Controlled Derivations". Among such grammars can be noticed:

== Matrix Grammars ==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Matrix Grammar, &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;, is a four-tuple &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where&lt;br /&gt;
1.- &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of non-terminal symbols&lt;br /&gt;
2.- &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.- &lt;math&gt;M = {m_1, m_2,..., m_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences  
&lt;math&gt;m_{i} = [p_{i_1},...,p_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;, 
with &lt;math&gt;k(i)\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, where each 
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} 1\leq j\leq k(i)&lt;/math&gt;, is an ordered pair
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} = (L, R)&lt;/math&gt;
being
&lt;math&gt;L \in (N \cup T)^*N(N\cup T)^*, R \in (N\cup T)^*&lt;/math&gt;
these pairs are called "productions", and are denoted
&lt;math&gt;L\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. In these conditions the matrices can be written down as
&lt;math&gt;m_i = [L_{i_{1}}\rightarrow R_{i_{1}},...,L_{i_{k(i)}}\rightarrow R_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4.- S is the start symbol

'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;MG = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; be a matrix grammar and let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
the collection of all productions on matrices of &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;.
We said that &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt; is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, or "increasing length" 
or "linear" or "without &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-productions" if and only if the grammar &lt;math&gt;G=(N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; has the corresponding property.

===The classic example ===
:''Note: taken from Abraham 1965, with change of nonterminals names''
The context-sensitive language 
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
is generated by the &lt;math&gt;CFMG&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;G =(N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the set of matrices is defined as
&lt;math&gt;M :&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow abc\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow aAbBcC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow aA,B\rightarrow bB,C\rightarrow cC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow a,B\rightarrow b,C\rightarrow c\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Time Variant Grammars==
'''Basic concepts''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Definition'''&lt;br /&gt;
A Time Variant Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, v)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;v: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a function from the set of natural
numbers to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

== Programmed Grammars ==
'''Basic concepts'''

===Definition===
A Programmed Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, s)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;s, f: P\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''success'' and ''fail'' functions from the set of productions
to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

==Grammars with regular control language==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Grammar With Regular Control Language, 
&lt;math&gt;GWRCL&lt;/math&gt;, is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, e)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a regular expression over the alphabet of the set of productions.

===A naive example===
Consider the CFG
&lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the productions set is defined as
&lt;math&gt;P = \{p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6\}&lt;/math&gt;
being 
&lt;math&gt;p_0 = S\rightarrow ABC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_1 = A\rightarrow aA&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_2 = B\rightarrow bB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_3 = C\rightarrow cC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_4 = A\rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_5 = B\rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;p_6 = C\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly,
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^*b^*c^*\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now, considering the productions set 
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as an alphabet (since it is a finite set),
define the regular expression over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;e=p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6)&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the CFG grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the regular expression
&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the CFGWRCL 
&lt;math&gt;(G,e)
=(G,p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6))&lt;/math&gt;
which generates the language
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Besides there are other grammars with regulated rewriting, the four cited above are good examples of how to extend [[context-free grammars]] with some kind of control mechanism to obtain a [[Turing machine]] powerful grammatical device.

His most significant work is ''Modern Typography.'' He is a proprietor of [[Hyphen Press]], which publishes books on design and typography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/authors/robin_kinross Robin Kinross | Authors | Hyphen Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinross did undergraduate and graduate studies at the Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the [[University of Reading]]. He moved to London in 1982. In the 1980s he contributed content to publications such as ''[[Blueprint (architecture magazine)|Blueprint]]'', ''[[Baseline (magazine)|Baseline]]'' and ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]''.

Kinross started Hyphen Press in 1980. ''Modern Typography'' was published in 1992. Since the 1990s, Hyphen produces about "two to four publications a year".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Important publications by Hyphen include Christopher Burke's ''[[Paul Renner]]'' and Fred Smeijers' ''Counterpunch''.

==''Modern Typography''==
''Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History'' is a critical history of printing and typography. Kinross asserts that modernism in typography emerged with the self-awareness of printing and the development of the rationality of its processes and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, Robin, Modern Typography: An Essay in Critical History, Hyphen Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinross dates these emerging attitudes to around 1700 and then traces the evolution of modernist typography. According to [[Matthew Carter]], "Most histories of typography, particularly British ones, have been histories of traditional typography that treat Modernism as an aberration. Studies of Modernism, for their part, have tended to isolate it from contemporary traditional typography.

Over the years, with research done at the Department of Informatics of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], it evolved into a semiotic theory of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10486 de Souza, C.S. (2005) The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction. The MIT Press.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133508/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10486 |date=2012-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Souza | first1 = C.S. | year = 2005 | title = Semiotic engineering: bringing designers and users together at interaction time | url = | journal = Interacting with Computers | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 317–341 | doi = 10.1016/j.intcom.2005.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic Engineering views HCI as [[computer-mediated communication]] between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. The designers' message to users includes even the interactive language in which users will have to communicate back with the system in order to achieve their specific goals. So, the process is in fact one of communication about communication, or metacommunication.

Semiotic engineering has two methods to evaluate the quality of metacommunication in HCI: the semiotic inspection method (SIM) and the communicability evaluation method (CEM). In the 2009 book ''Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI'', Clarisse de Souza and Carla Leitão discuss how SIM and CEM, which are both qualitative methods, can also be used in scientific contexts to generate new knowledge about HCI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00173ED1V01Y200901HCI002 de Souza, C.S.; Leitão, C.F. (2009) Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI. Morgan Claypool.]&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate their points, the authors present an extensive case study with a free open-source digital audio editor called Audacity. They show how the results obtained with a triangulation of SIM and CEM point at new research avenues not only for semiotic engineering and HCI but also for other areas of computer science such as software engineering and programming.

René Jorna and Clarisse de Souza independently developed two different kinds of ‘semiotic engineering.’ Jorna’s was originally closer to [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Cognitive Science]]. His ideas were later developed and applied to decision support systems and organizational semiotics rather than HCI. The authors were introduced to each other (and to each other's version of 'semiotic engineering') only in 1996, in a [[Dagstuhl#Seminar series|Dagstuhl Seminar]] on Informatics and Semiotics organized by Peter B. Andersen, [[Mihai Nadin]] and [[Frieder Nake]].

The '''shorthand for the orchestration''' of a classical [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] (and other similar ensembles), or Orchestra Instrumentation Numerical Notation, is used to outline which and how many [[musical instrument|instruments]], especially [[wind instrument]]s, are called for in a given piece of music. The shorthand is ordered in the same fashion as the parts of the individual instruments in the [[sheet music#Full scores, variants and condensations|score]], read from top to bottom.

==General approach==

The orchestra is divided into four groups and specified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://desatheory.janetpeachey.com/Orchestral%20Instruments.html The Order of Instruments in an Orchestral Score, Music Theory Website at Duke Ellington School of the Arts] Accessed 27 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Woodwind instrument]]s: [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s
* [[Brass instrument]]s: [[French horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]s
* [[Timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[harp]], [[piano]] etc.
* [[String section]]: [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[Double bass|basses]], frequently abbreviated to 'str', 'strs' or similar.

: The relations of the individual sections within the strings has been kept since the classical period for acoustical reasons, so a small string section could be 10/8/6/5/4; an example is given for a much larger orchestra in the table below.

If any soloists or a choir are called for, their parts are usually printed between the percussion/keyboards and the strings in the score. In shorthand however, they are usually omitted.

==Degree of standardisation==

The basic order of the instruments, as seen above, is common to all of the shorthand systems. However, there is no standardized version of this shorthand; different publishers and librarians use different systems, especially for doubling/alternate/additional instruments. David Daniels, in earlier versions of his seminal work gathering in print a catalogue of the orchestrations of some 4,000+ pieces,&lt;ref&gt;David Daniels: Orchestral Music A Handbook, Pub. (USA) Scarecrow Press, Inc, Lanham, Maryland, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8108-3228-3}} (3rd Ed.), cf. 2nd Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-1484-6}} and 1st Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-0537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; made use of a shorthand for doubling/alternate/additional instruments which was less clear, but in the newer online version&lt;ref&gt;[https://daniels-orchestral.com/about/this-online-tool/ Description of the online tool at daniels-orchestral.com] Retrieved 18 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels' approach has been refined to something more explicit, akin to the Chester Novello and Boosey &amp; Hawkes notations below.

Examples for different notations for the same orchestration:

{{sociology}}

The '''sociology of emotion''' applies [[sociological]] theorems and techniques to the study of human [[emotions]]. As sociology emerged primarily as a reaction to the negative effects of [[modernity]], many [[normative]] theories deal in some sense with emotion without forming a part of any specific subdiscipline: [[Karl Marx]] described [[capitalism]] as detrimental to personal '[[species-being]]', [[Georg Simmel]] wrote of the deindividualizing tendencies of 'the metropolis', and [[Max Weber]]'s work dealt with the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalizing]] effect of modernity in general.

==Theory==
Emotions are on one hand constitutive of, embedded in, and on the other hand manipulated or instrumentalized by entities that are studied by sociology on a micro level, such as social roles and norms and 'feeling rules' the everyday social interactions and situations are shaped by, and, on a macro level, by social institutions, discourses, ideologies etc. For example, (post-)modern marriage is, on one hand, based on the emotion of love and on the other hand the very emotion is to be worked on and regulated by it. Likewise, modern science could not exist without the emotion of curiosity but it does narrow it leading sometimes to over-specialization of science. Many forms of cultural stratification could not exist without disgust and contempt, and there are politics that could not exist without fear, as many civil and ethnic wars could not take place without hate. (requires citation)

We try to regulate our feelings to fit in with the norms of the situation, based on many - sometimes conflicting - demands upon us. Systematic observations of group interaction found that a substantial portion of group activity is devoted to the socio-emotional issues of expressing affect and dealing with tension.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, A. P. (1976). ''Handbook of small group research'' (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, field studies of social attraction in groups revealed that feelings of individuals about each other collate into social networks,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, A. P. (1976). ''Handbook of small group research'' (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; a discovery that still is being explored in the field of [[social network]] analysis. 

[[Ethnomethodology]] revealed emotional commitments to everyday norms through purposeful breaching of the norms. For example, students acting as boarders in their own homes reported others' astonishment, bewilderment, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, and anger; family members accused the students of being mean, inconsiderate, selfish, nasty, or impolite. Actors who breach a norm themselves feel waves of emotion, including apprehension, panic, and despair.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, S. (1974, ). An interview with Carol Tavris. ''Psychology Today'', pp. 70-73&lt;/ref&gt; However, habitual rule breaking leads to declining stress, and may eventually end in enjoyment. 

T. David Kemper&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, T. D. (1978). ''A social interactional theory of emotion''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that people in social interaction have positions on two relational dimensions: status and power. Emotions emerge as interpersonal events change or maintain individuals' status and power. For example, affirming someone else's exalted status produces love-related emotions.  Increases or decreases in one's own and other's status or power generate specific emotions whose quality depends on the patterns of change. 

[[Arlie Hochschild]]&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. R. (1983). ''The managed heart: The commercialization of human feeling''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that individuals manage their feelings to produce acceptable displays according to ideological and cultural standards. Hochschild showed that jobs often require such [[emotional labor]]. Her classic study of emotional labor among flight attendants found that an industry speed-up, reducing contact between flight attendants and passengers, made it impossible for flight attendants to deliver authentic emotional labor, so they ended up surface-acting superficial smiles. Peggy Thoits&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1990). Emotional deviance: research agendas. T. D. Kemper (Ed.), ''Research agendas in the sociology of emotions'' (pp. 180–203). Albany: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; divided emotion management techniques into implementation of new events and reinterpretation of past events. Thoits noted that emotions also can be managed with drugs, by performing faux gestures and facial expressions, or by cognitive reclassifications of one's feelings.

Sociologist Chris Lucerne states in her article titled “Emotions! Good or Bad”, that there are neither good nor bad emotions. However, you can judge emotions as such. According to Lucerne's theory emotion is believed to help humans express their feelings. Therefore, emotions are a part of human nature to help us communicate. In addition to Chris Lucerne’s theory, when humans experience a situation good or bad an emotion is triggered. As a result of emotion an action is followed. For example, here are a few emotions listed in Lucerne’s article in which people experience daily. The first is the emotion of happiness, which can ignite the sensation to dance. A second emotion is anger, in which the person begins to feel hot causing him or her to perspire. Finally is the emotion of sadness, which creates a sensation of feeling closed in. As a consequence of feeling closed in the person may react irrationally to make them comfortable. Chris Lucerne also states in her article "that no matter what, you cannot control your reactions to emotion." In conclusion to Lucerne's theory, reaction is random in expressing your feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrislucerne.com/pdfs/emotions.pdf Microso&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107091706/http://www.chrislucerne.com/pdfs/emotions.pdf |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Straker states that "we should watch our own emotions", likewise in Arlie Hochschild's theory of emotions. Straker talks about how emotions are signals that tell you something about what is happening in the inner you. Sometimes bad emotions can be misleading because of the reaction often causing conflict. To conclude based on Straker's theory, you can use emotions for good or bad. An example Straker talked about was the use of emotion to motivate others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changeminds.org/explanations/emotions/emotion_purpose.htm Purpose of emotions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas J. Scheff&lt;ref&gt;Scheff, Thomas J, and  Retzinger, Suzanne. (1991) ''Emotions and violence : shame and rage in destructive conflicts''. Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books&lt;/ref&gt; established that many cases of social conflict are based on a destructive and often escalating, but stoppable and reversible shame-rage cycle: when someone results or feels shamed by another, their social bond comes under stress. This can be cooperatively acknowledged, talked about and – most effectively when possible - laughed at so their social bond may be restored. Yet, when shame is not acknowledged, but instead negated and repressed, it becomes rage, and rage may drive to aggressive and shaming actions that feed-back negatively on this self-destructive situation. The social management of emotions might be the fundamental dynamics of social cooperation and conflict around resources, complexity, conflict and moral life. It is well-established sociological fact that expression and feeling of the emotion of anger, for example, is strongly discouraged (repressed) in girls and women in many cultures, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Some cultures and sub-cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, jealousy, excitedness, and many other emotions. The free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in many countries. 

Sociologist [[Randall Collins]] has stated that emotional energy is the main motivating force in social life, for love and hatred, investing, working or consuming, rendering cult or waging war.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Randall. (2004) ''Interaction Ritual Chains''. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional energy ranges from the highest heights of enthusiasm, self-confidence and initiative to the deepest depths of apathy, depression and retreat. Emotional energy comes from variously successful or failed chains of interaction rituals, that is, patterned social encounters –from conversation or sexual flirtation through [[Christmas]] family dinners or office work to mass demonstrations, organizations or revolutions. In the latter, the coupling of participants' behavior synchronizes their [[nervous system]]s to the point of generating a [[collective effervescence]], one observable in their mutual focus and emotional entraining (incorrect use of word, "entraining"), as well as in their loading of emotional and symbolic meaning to entities which subsequently become emblems of the ritual and of the membership group endorsing, preserving, promoting and  defending them. Thus social life would be most importantly about generating and distributing emotional energy. 

[[Affect Control Theory]], originated by [[David R. Heise]], proposes that social actions are designed by their agents to create impressions that befit sentiments reigning in a situation. Emotions are transient physical and subjective states depending on the current impression of the emoting person, and on the comparison of that impression with the sentiment attached to the person's identity. As such, emotions are visceral signals to self and observable signals to others about the individual's identity in the situation, and about the individual's understanding of events in the situation. Heise developed a [[simulation]] program for analyzing affect-control processes in social interaction, and for predicting moment-to-moment emotions of interactants. The program specifies emotions in terms of numerical profiles, emotion words, and cartoon-like drawings of interactants' facial expressions. A complete review of affect control theory is provided in Heise's 2007 book, ''Expressive Order''.&lt;ref&gt;Heise, David. (2007) ''Expressive Order: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions''. New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical applications ==

Workplaces. Following Hochschild's lead, the sociology of emotions has been applied extensively to a variety of workplace interactions. Jennifer Pierce, a student of Hochschild's, has examined law firms, for instance, and Robin Leidner the emotion work in fast food outlets.

Social Movements. Inspired by [[James M. Jasper]]'s cultural work in the late 1990s, especially The Art of Moral Protest, a number of scholars of protest and social movements have begun to examine the emotions involved. They include Erika Summers Effler, a student of [[Randall Collins]] who examines how emotions inform a sense of time in Laughing Saints and Righteous Heroes; Lynn Owens, who documents the emotions of a declining social movement, Amsterdams's squatters, in Cracking under Pressure; and Verta Taylor, whose book, Rock-a-Bye Baby documents struggles over the feelings new mothers are supposed to feel. Deborah Gould traces a number of emotional processes throughout the rise and fall of ACT UP in a series of articles and a book, Moving Politics. A 1999 conference, organized by [[James M. Jasper]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], and Francesca Polletta, helped spur this new development in social movement theory and research. Scholars worldwide have taken up the challenge to study the emotions of social movements, including a cluster of French researchers such as Olivier Fillieule, Isabelle Sommier, and Christophe Traini.

==As a measure of religiosity==
According to the sociologist [[Mervin F. Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], emotion may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. Furthermore, religious emotion may be broken down into four dimensions:

* Content
* Frequency
* Intensity
* Centrality

The content of one's religious emotions may vary from situation to situation, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person (frequency), the intensity of the emotion, and the centrality of the emotional feeling (in that religious tradition, or person's life).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, emotion is somewhat similar to [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s "experience" dimension of religiosity (Glock, 1972: 39).&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spoolbase''' is a shore-based facility used to facilitate [[continuous pipe laying]] for offshore [[oil industry|oil and gas production]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Metallurgist and materials technologist'', Institution of Metallurgists (Great Britain), 1980, Vol 12, p.491&lt;/ref&gt; The facility allows the welding of single or double joints (40' or 80') of steel pipe of 4" to 18" diameter, into predetermined lengths for spooling onto a [[reel lay vessel]].

Shore based spoolbases serve the oil and gas sector from locations in the USA, UK, Norway, Brazil, and Angola, and portable spoolbases may be set up in any location to suit local requirements.

[[File:James Strong theologian - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|James Strong (1822–1894)]]
{{italic title}}
'''''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible''''',{{refn|group=n|The complete title of the original work was ''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible: Showing Every Word of the Text of the Common English Version of the Canonical Books, and Every Occurrence of Each Word in Regular Order: Together with A Comparative Concordance of the Authorized and Revised Versions, Including the American Variations; Also Brief Dictionaries of the Hebrew and Greek Words of the Original, with References to the English Words''.{{sfnp|Strong|1890|p=1}}}} generally known as '''''Strong's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance]], an index of every word in the [[King James Version]] (KJV), constructed under the direction of [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]. Strong first published his ''Concordance'' in 1890, while professor of [[Exegesis|exegetical]] [[theology]] at [[Drew University|Drew Theological Seminary]].

[[File:Strongs Concordances.png|thumb|Editions and reprints of ''Strong's Concordance'', now in public domain]]

==Purpose==
The purpose of ''Strong's Concordance'' is not to provide content or commentary about the Bible, but to provide an [[Index (publishing)|index]] to the Bible. This allows the reader to find words where they appear in the Bible. This index allows a student of the Bible to re-find a phrase or passage previously studied. It also lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used elsewhere in the Bible. In this way Strong provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of text.

==Strong's numbers==
Each original-language word is given an entry number in the dictionary of those original language words listed in the back of the concordance. These have become known as the "Strong's numbers". The main concordance lists each word that appears in the [[KJV Bible]] in alphabetical order with each verse in which it appears listed in order of its appearance in the Bible, with a snippet of the surrounding text (including the word in italics). Appearing to the right of the scripture reference is the Strong's number. This allows the user of the concordance to look up the meaning of the original language word in the associated dictionary in the back, thereby showing how the original language word was translated into the English word in the KJV Bible.

''Strong's Concordance'' includes:
* The 8674 [[biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] root words used in the [[Old Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Hebrew|582}}'')
* The 5624 [[koine Greek|Greek]] root words used in the [[New Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Greek|3056}}'')

New editions of ''Strong's'' may exclude the comparative section (1611 KJV to 1614) and the asterisks that denote differential definitions of the same Hebrew or Greek words; due perhaps to denominational considerations, definitions may also be altered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

Although the Greek words in ''Strong's Concordance'' are numbered 1–5624, the numbers 2717 and 3203–3302 are unassigned due to "changes in the enumeration while in progress". Not every distinct word is assigned a number, but only the root words. For example, αγαπησεις is assigned the same number as αγαπατε – both are listed as {{Strong Greek|25}} αγαπαω.

Other authors have used Strong's numbers in concordances of other Bible translations, such as the ''[[New International Version]]'' and ''[[American Standard Version]]''.

Due to Strong's numbers it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible ("Новая учебная Библия Томпсона", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society "The Bible for everyone", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible]] (''The New Thompson Study Bible,'' La Buona Novella Inc. &amp; B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

New editions of ''Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible'' remain in print {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}.

==Strong's Dictionaries==
In the 1890 version, Strong added a "Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary" and a "Greek Dictionary of the New Testament" to his concordance. In the preface to both dictionaries, Strong explains that these are "brief and simple" dictionaries, not meant to replace reference to "a more copious and elaborate Lexicon." He mentions [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]] and [[Bible concordance#Hebrew|Fürst]] as examples of the lexicons that Strong's is drawn from. His dictionaries were meant to give students a quick and simple way to look up words and have a general idea of their meaning.

Strong reportedly based his lexicons on the work of contemporary scholars such as Gesenius, Fürst, [[A Greek-English Lexicon|Liddell &amp; Scott]], [[Joseph Henry Thayer|Thayer]], and [[Brown-Driver-Briggs|Brown, Driver, and Briggs]]. According to the preface, he and his team also made "numerous original suggestions, relations, and distinctions... especially in the affinities of roots and the classification of meanings." The work is intended to represent the best of 19th century scholarship, and both a simplification of it and an improvement on it. An important feature of Strong's dictionaries is the listing of every translation of a source word in the [[King James Version|AV (King James)]] after the definition itself.

It is important to note Strong's association with the committee working on the [[American Standard Version|American]] [[Revised Version|Revised Version]] of the Bible. His work does not tend to support the authority of the King James Version. He was part of the effort to update and replace it with what the translators believed would be a better version. As a result, he contributed deeper and more thorough study of Biblical languages, especially etymology, but also an inherently suspicious attitude toward the [[Textus Receptus]], the King James, and toward traditional, less "secular" definitions of original words. The translation committee was associated with the [[Historical criticism|Higher Critical]] movement and with the [[Westcott-Hort]] version of the Greek text. Strong, a Methodist layman and college professor, was acceptable to the committee, but one cannot assume he shared all of its views.&lt;ref name="Strong Delusion"&gt;[http://www.avpublications.com/avnew/downloads/PDF/HazMat/H-pp_157-202_Chapter_7_Strong_Delusion-James_Strongs_Dang.pdf], This is a hostile source but it cites original sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">{{Wiktionary|theme}}
In contemporary [[literary studies]], a '''theme''' is the central topic a text treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200321?rskey=8toWeL&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid
| title = Oxford English Dictionary
| work = 
| publisher = 
| accessdate = January 26, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes  can be divided into two categories: a work's ''thematic concept'' is what readers "think the work is about" and its ''thematic statement'' being "what the work says about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Griffith| first = Kelley| title = Writing Essays about Literature| place = | publisher = Cengage Learning| year = 2010| edition = 8| page =40| language =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a05Efo1hOa4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=| isbn =1428290419| accessdate=  February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; [[nostalgia]]; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Kirszner| first = Laura G. | last2 =Mandell| first2 =Stephen R.| title = Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing| publisher =Paulinas| year =1994| pages =3–4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=| isbn =015501014X | accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed |date=March 2013}} A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Weitz| first = Morris| title = Shakespeare Survey| publisher =Cambridge University Press| volume = 28| year = 2002| chapter = Literature Without Philosophy: "Antony and Cleopatra"| page =30| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-CdmtQURHc8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=| isbn =0521523656| accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed | march 2013}}

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''Brave New World''. Along with [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], theme is considered one of the [[literary element|components]] of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Obstfeld|2002|pp=1,65,115,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Various [[Literary technique|techniques]] may be used to express many more themes.

===Leitwortstil===
''Leitwortstil'' is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Pinault| first= David| title= Story Telling Techniques in the "Arabian Nights"| publisher= Brill| series= Studies in Arabic Literature| volume= 15| year= 1992| page= 18| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guHmLGJMbg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq= | isbn= 9004095306 | accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''. Its seeming message is that the world is [[deterministic]]: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that ''things could have been different''. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book ''Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now'' written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases "Don't do the same thing and expect different results", "It is a bad idea to lie to yourself", and "No one likes to be told what to do".

===Thematic patterning===
''Thematic patterning'' means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various scenes in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' are about loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Scalia| first = Joseph E.| last2 =Shamblin| first2 =Lena T. &amp; Research and Education Association | title =  John Steinbeck's Of mice and men| place =Piscataway, N.J | publisher =Research &amp; Education Association | year =2001| page =13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=96WfEbkKIKAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=| isbn =087891997X | accessdate= February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic patterning is evident in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'',&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Some common themes in literature are "love," "war," "revenge," "betrayal,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "patriotism," "grace," "isolation," "motherhood," "forgiveness," "wartime loss,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treachery," "rich versus poor," "appearance versus reality," and "help from other-worldly powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brown|Rosenberg|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1868 as the College of Agriculture under the federal [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], CNR is the first state-run [[Agricultural experiment station|Agricultural Experiment Station]]. The college is home to four academic departments: Agriculture and Resource Economics; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology; and Plant and Microbial Biology, and one interdisciplinary program, Energy and Resources Group.  Faculty include 40 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellows]], 29 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellows]], 16 [[National Academy of Sciences]] members, 12 [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellows]], 8 [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] members, 7 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], 4 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]], 2 [[Wolf Prize]] winners, and 2 [[World Food Prize]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/about|title=About|website=UC Berkeley College of Natural Resources|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Plans for the creation of this public university were first developed at the 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], but when the State of [[California]] was established in 1850, it lacked the funds necessary to create such a school. Missionaries sent west by the [[American Home Missionary Society|Home Mission Society]] of New York, however, created the [[College of California]] and eventually transferred its ownership to the State in 1855.

By 1862, the State had secured the land necessary to establish a college as a result of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act.]] This college was known as the Agricultural Mining and Mechanical Arts College, and opened formally in 1866.

On March 23, 1868, [[Henry Huntly Haight|Governor H.H. Haight]] combined the resources of this college with the College of California to create the first [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/daniel_gilman.html|title=Daniel Coit Gilman and the Early Years of UC - Special Topics - A History of UCSF|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Regents began admitting women to the University of California in 1871, and the first woman to graduate was Rosa L. Scrivner, with a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|PhB]] in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/graduates00univ/graduates00univ_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Graduates, 1864-1905.

== Campus ==
[[File:Cnr map.png|thumb|The original College of Agriculture consisted of the Hilgard, Wellman, and Giannini halls. Today, CNR has expanded to occupy the Koshland, Morgan, and Mulford buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/site/forms/pdf/CNR_Report.pdf|title=College of Natural Resources|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Forms &amp; Petitions|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The College of Natural Resources is located on the northwest end of the UC Berkeley campus, and comprises six main buildings.

These include the historic group of Wellman, Hilgard, and Giannini halls that composed the original college. This trio, known as the Agriculture Complex, is the most unified grouping of buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=William|last2=Knapp|first2=Frederic|date=2012-01-01|title=Hilgard Hall (John Galen Howard) Historic Structures Report|url=https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are visually unified by a Mediterranean landscape of olive and stone pine trees.

The first hall, Wellman, is a Classical Revival building designed in 1912 by [[John Galen Howard]] and named after [[Harry R. Wellman]], a professor of Agricultural Economics, and acting president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7t1nb4v2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00071&amp;toc.id=|title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1997|website=texts.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilgard was constructed six years later by the same architect, and named after [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], professor of Agricultural Chemistry and father of modern soil science. Its neo-classical design is inscribed with the phrase "''To Rescue for Human Society the Native Values of Rural Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noehill.com/alameda/nat1982004647.asp|title=National Register #82004647: Hilgard Hall on UC Berkeley Campus, California|website=noehill.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giannini Hall was designed by Howard's co-worker, William Charles Hays, through an endowment from the Bancitaly Corporation (now known as [[Bank of America]]) in memory of their founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]].

'''X-ray binaries''' are a class of [[binary star]]s that are luminous in [[X-ray]]s. 
The X-rays are produced by matter falling from one component, called the ''donor'' (usually a relatively normal [[star]]), to the other component, called the ''accretor'', which is very compact: a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]. 
The infalling matter releases [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]], up to several tenths of its rest mass, as X-rays.  (Hydrogen [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass.)  The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation.&lt;ref name=Tauris&gt;{{cite book

==Classification==
X-ray binaries are further subdivided into several (sometimes overlapping) subclasses, that perhaps reflect the underlying physics better.  Note that the classification by mass (high, intermediate, low) refers to the optically visible donor, not to the compact X-ray emitting accretor.

== Low-mass X-ray binary ==
A '''low-mass X-ray binary''' ('''LMXB''') is a [[binary star]] system where one of the components is either a [[black hole]] or [[neutron star]].{{r|Tauris}}  The other component, a donor, usually fills its [[Roche lobe]] and therefore transfers mass to the compact star.  In LMXB systems the donor is less massive than the compact object, and can be on the [[main sequence]], a degenerate dwarf ([[white dwarf]]), or an evolved star ([[red giant]]).  Approximately two hundred LMXBs have been detected in the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0707.0544|bibcode = 2007A&amp;A...469..807L|title = A catalogue of low-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC (Fourth edition)|journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 469|issue = 2|pages = 807|last1 = Liu|first1 = Q. Z|last2 = Van Paradijs|first2 = J|last3 = Van Den Heuvel|first3 = E. P. J|year = 2007|doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20077303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of these, thirteen LMXBs have been discovered in [[globular cluster]]s.  The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] has revealed LMXBs in many distant galaxies.

A typical low-mass X-ray binary emits almost all of its [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] in [[X-ray]]s, and typically less than one percent in visible light, so they are among the brightest objects in the X-ray sky, but relatively faint in visible light.  The [[apparent magnitude]] is typically around 15 to 20.  The brightest part of the system is the [[accretion disk]] around the compact object.  The orbital periods of LMXBs range from ten minutes to hundreds of days.

== Intermediate-mass X-ray binary ==
An '''intermediate-mass X-ray binary''' ('''IMXB''') is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate-mass star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2000ApJ...530L..93T|title = Formation of Millisecond Pulsars with Heavy White Dwarf Companions:Extreme Mass Transfer on Subthermal Timescales|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume = 530|issue = 2|pages = L93-L96|last1 = Tauris|first1 = Thomas M|last2 = Van Den Heuvel|first2 = Edward P.

D|year = 2002|doi = 10.1086/324686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== High-mass X-ray binary ==
A '''high-mass X-ray binary''' ('''HMXB''') is a [[binary star]] system that is strong in X rays, and in which the normal stellar component is a massive [[star]]: usually an O or B star, or a blue [[supergiant]]. 
The compact, X-ray emitting, component is a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].{{r|Tauris}}
A fraction of the [[stellar wind]] of the massive normal star is captured by the compact object, and produces [[X-ray]]s as it falls onto the compact object.

In a high-mass X-ray binary, the massive star dominates the emission of optical light, while the compact object is the dominant source of X-rays. 
The massive stars are very luminous and therefore easily detected. 
One of the most famous high-mass X-ray binaries is [[Cygnus X-1]], which was the first identified black hole candidate.  
Other HMXBs include [[Vela X-1]] (not to be confused with [[Vela X]]), and [[4U 1700-37]].

== Microquasar ==
[[Image:Ss433 art big.gif|250px|thumb|Artist's impression of the microquasar [[SS 433]].]]
A '''microquasar''' (or radio emitting X-ray binary) is the smaller cousin of a [[quasar]].  Microquasars are named after quasars, as they have some common characteristics: strong and variable radio emission, often resolvable as a pair of radio jets, and an [[accretion disk]] surrounding a [[compact object]] which is either a [[black hole]] or a [[neutron star]]. In quasars, the black hole is supermassive (millions of [[solar mass]]es); in microquasars, the mass of the compact object is only a few solar masses. In microquasars, the accreted mass comes from a normal star, and the accretion disk is very luminous in the optical and [[X-ray]] regions. Microquasars are sometimes called ''radio-jet X-ray binaries'' to distinguish them from other X-ray binaries. A part of the radio emission comes from [[relativistic jet]]s, often showing apparent [[superluminal motion]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Microquasars are very important for the study of [[relativistic jet]]s. The jets are formed close to the compact object, and timescales near the compact object are proportional to the mass of the compact object. Therefore, ordinary quasars take centuries to go through variations a microquasar experiences in one day.

Noteworthy microquasars include [[SS 433]], in which atomic emission lines are visible from both jets; [[GRS 1915+105]], with an especially high jet velocity and the very bright [[Cygnus X-1]], detected up to the High Energy [[gamma rays]] (E &gt; 60 MeV). Extremely high energies of particles emitting in the VHE band might be explained by several mechanisms of particle acceleration (see [[Fermi acceleration]] and [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]).

'''Zooarchaeology''' (or '''archaeozoology''') is the branch of [[archaeology]] that studies faunal remains related to ancient people.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yohe II|first=Robert M.|title=Archaeology: The Science of the Human Past|year=2006|publisher=Pearson|pages=248–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Faunal remains are the items left behind when an animal dies.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt; It includes: bones, shells, hair, [[chitin]], scales, hides, proteins and DNA.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  Of these items, bones and shells are the ones that occur most frequently at [[archaeological sites]] where faunal remains can be found.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  Most of the time, most of the faunal remains do not survive.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  They often decompose or break because of various circumstances.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  This can cause difficulties in identifying the remains and interpreting their significance.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;

==Development==
The development of zooarchaeology in Eastern North America can be broken up into three different periods.&lt;ref name="Landon2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landon|first=David B.|title=Zooarchaeology and Historical Archaeology: Progress and Prospects|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and|year=2005|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first being the [[Formative stage|Formative period]] starting around the 1860s, the second being the Systematization period beginning in the early 1950s, and the Integration period which began about 1969.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  
Full-time zooarchaeologists didn’t come about until the Systematization period.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  Before that it was just a technique that was applied but not specifically studied.

Zooarchaeological specialists started to come about partly because of a new approach to archaeology known as [[processual archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Thomas1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Kenneth D.|title=Zooarchaeology: Past, Present and Future|journal=World Archaeology|year=1996|volume=28|pages=1–4|doi=10.1080/00438243.1996.9980327|pmid=16475284|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This approach puts more emphasis on explaining why things happened, not just what happened.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;  [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] began to specialize in zooarchaeology, and their numbers increased from there on.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Archeozoölogie-Referentiecollectie-Tibia-RCE.jpg|thumb|A reference collection of shinbones (Tibia) of different animal species helps determining old bones. [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed|Dutch Heritage Agency]].]]
Zooarchaeology is primarily used to answer several questions.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;  These include:
# What was the diet like, and in what ways were the animals used for food?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# Which were the animals that were eaten, in what amounts, and with what other foods?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# Who were the ones to obtain the food, and did the availability of that food depend on age or gender?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# How was culture, such as technologies and behavior, influenced by and associated with diet?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# What purposes, other than food, were animals used for?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

Zooarchaeology can also tell us what the environment might have been like in order for the different animals to have survived.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

In addition to helping us understand the past, zooarchaeology can also help us to improve the present and the future.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyman|first=R. L.|title=Applied Zooarchaeology: The Relevance of Faunal Analysis to Wildlife Management|journal=World Archaeology|year=1996|volume=28|pages=110–125|doi=10.1080/00438243.1996.9980334}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Studying how people dealt with animals, and its effects can help us avoid many potential ecological problems.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  This specifically includes problems involving wildlife management.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  For example, one of the questions that wildlife preservationists ask is whether they should keep animals facing extinction in several smaller areas, or in one larger area.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  Based on zooarchaeological evidence, they found that animals that are split up into several smaller areas are more likely to go extinct.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;

==Techniques==
One of the techniques that zooarchaeologists use is close attention to [[taphonomy]].&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This includes studying how items are buried and deposited at the site in question, what the conditions are that aid in the preservation of these items, and how these items get destroyed.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  Then they interpret that information.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

Another technique that zooarchaeologists use is lab analysis.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This analysis can include comparing the skeletons found on site with already identified animal skeletons.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This not only helps to identify what the animal is, but also whether the animal was domesticated or not.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

Yet another technique that zooarchaeologists use is [[Quantification (science)|quantification]].&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  They make interpretations based on the number and size of the bones.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  These interpretations include how important different animals might have been to the diet.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

== Limitation of techniques ==
There are limitations to using excavation techniques in studying different kinds of faunal remains. It is difficult to screen or sieve large animals remains, and thus it is hard to recover larger animals and bone fragments. Second, it is hard to collect the remains of all animals species, potentially creating biased and unrepresentative data collection. Third, it is difficult to distinguish the original use and reuse of the land, since different activities can be represented in the same area at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woollett|first1=James M.|title=Living in the Narrows: Subsistence Economy and Culture Change in Labrador Inuit Society during the Contact Period|journal=World Archaeology|date=1 January 1999|volume=30|issue=3|pages=370–387|jstor=124958|doi=10.1080/00438243.1999.9980418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==

Human-Animal relationships and interactions were diverse during [[Prehistory]] from being a food source to playing a more intimate role in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Erica|date=2013|title=Archaeology and Animal Persons: Toward a Prehistory of Human-Animal Relations|journal=Environment and Society|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.3167/ares.2013.040108|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals have been used in non-economical ways such as being part of a human burial.  However, the major zooarchaeology has focused on who was eating what by looking at various remains such as bones, teeth, and fish scales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the twenty-first century researchers have begun to interpret animals in prehistory in wider cultural and social patterns, focusing on how the animals have affected humans and possible animal agency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   There is evidence of animals such as the [[Mountain Lion]] or the [[Jaguar]] being used for ritualistic purposes, but not being eaten as a food source.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Animal burials date back to prehistory with examples emerging from the [[Mesolithic]] period.  In Sweden at the burial site Skateholm I dogs were found buried with children under eight years old or were found buried by themselves.  Some of the dogs who were buried alone have grave goods similar to their human contemporaries such as flint weapons and deer antlers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, during the same time period Skateholm II emerged and was very different than Skateholm I, as dogs were buried along on the North and West boundaries of the grave area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another burial site in Siberia near [[Lake Baikal|Lake Biakal]] known as the "Lokomotiv" cemetery had a wolf burial among human graves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bazaliiskiy &amp; Savelyev|first=|date=2003|title=The Wolf of Baikal: The "Lokomotiv" Early Neolithic Cemetery in Siberia (Russia)|url=|journal=Antiquity|volume=77|issue=295|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buried together with, but slightly beneath the wolf was a male human skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wolf breed was not native to this area as it was warm and other research for the area shows no other wolf habitation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Bazaliiskiy &amp; Savelyev suggests that the presence and significance of the wolf could possibly reflect human interaction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another example occurred in 300 B.C. in [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]] known as the [[Pazyryk burials]] where ten horses were buried alongside a human male, the horses were fully adorned with saddles, pendants, among other valuables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oldest horse as also the horse with the grandest attachments.  Erica Hill, a professor in archaeology, suggests that the burials of prehistory animals can shed light on human-animal relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Significance ==
Zooarchaeology allows researchers to have a more holistic understanding of past human-environment interactions. Whether it is diet, domestication, tool use, or ritual; animal remains reveal so much about the groups that interacted with them. Archaeology provides information on the past which often proves invaluable for understanding the present and preparing for the future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Terence P. 2013. The archaeology of animal bones. Stroud: History Press. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Zooarchaeology plays a valuable part in contributing to a holistic understanding of the animals themselves, the nearby groups, and the local environments.
