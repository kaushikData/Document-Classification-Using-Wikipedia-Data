The '''Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize''', formally '''Ahmadiyya Muslim Prize for the Advancement of Peace''', is awarded annually "in recognition of an individual’s or an organisation’s contribution for the advancement of the cause of peace". The prize was first launched in 2009 by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Peace Prize Committee under the directive of the [[Khalifatul Masih|caliph]] of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]]. The Prize is announced annually at the [[Jalsa Salana|United Kingdom Annual Convention]] and is presented the following year at the National Peace Symposium held at the [[Baitul Futuh Mosque]] in London. The Prize includes a monetary sum, which is normally set at 10,000 [[pounds sterling]].

The '''Balinese people''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: '''''Suku Bali''''') are an [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[ethnic group]] native to the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Bali]]. The Balinese population of 4.2 million (1.7% of [[Indonesia]]'s population) live mostly on the island of [[Bali]], making up 89% of the island's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/17/bali-faces-population-boom-now-home-42-million-residents.html Bali faces population boom, now home to 4.2 million residents]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant populations on the island of [[Lombok]] and in the easternmost  regions of [[Java (island)|Java]] (e.g. the municipality of [[Banyuwangi]]).

==Origins==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Balinese danseressen TMnr 60046652.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balinese dance|Balinese dancers]], circa 1920–1940.]]
The Balinese originated from three periods of migration. The first waves of immigrants came from Java and [[Kalimantan]] in prehistoric times and were of proto-Malay stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Shanker Tiwary &amp; P.S. Choudhary|title=Encyclopaedia Of Southeast Asia And Its Tribes (Set Of 3 Vols.)|year=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=81-261-3837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave of Balinese came slowly over the years from Java during the [[Hindu]] period. The third and final wave came from Java, between the 15th and 16th centuries, about the same time as the conversion to [[Islam]] in Java, causing aristocrats and peasants to flee to [[Bali]] after the collapse of the Javanese [[Majapahit|Hindu Majapahit Empire]] in order to escape [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]]'s Islamic conversion. This in turn reshaped the Balinese culture into a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] form of classical Javanese culture mixed with many Balinese elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andy Barski, Albert Beaucort and Bruce Carpenter|title=Bali and Lombok|year=2007|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al., found that 12% of Balinese [[Y-chromosome]]s are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] origin, and 2% of likely [[Melanesian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Karafet, Tatiana M.; Lansing, J S.; Redd, Alan J.; and Reznikova, Svetlana (2005) "Balinese Y-Chromosome Perspective on the Peopling of Indonesia: Genetic Contributions from Pre-Neolithic Hunter- Gatherers, Austronesian Farmers, and Indian Traders," Human Biology: Vol. 77: Iss. 1, Article 8.

==Culture==
{{main article|Music of Bali |Balinese dance |Balinese art |Balinese architecture}}
[[File:Three Balinese girls wearing kebaya.jpg|left|thumb|Balinese girls wearing ''[[kebaya]]''.]]
Balinese culture is a mix of Balinese Hindu-Buddhist religion and Balinese customs. It is perhaps most known for its dance, drama and sculpture. The island is also known for its [[Wayang#Wayang kulit|Wayang kulit]] or [[Shadow play]] theatre. Even in rural and neglected villages, beautiful temples are a common sight; and so are skillful gamelan players and talented actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Vickers|title=Bali Tempo Doeloe|year=2012|publisher=Komunitas Bambu|page=293|isbn=602-9402-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even layered pieces of palm leaf and neat fruit arrangements made as offerings by Balinese women have an artistic side to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Vickers|title=Bali Tempo Doeloe|year=2012|publisher=Komunitas Bambu|page=294|isbn=602-9402-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mexican art historian [[José Miguel Covarrubias]], works of art made by amateur Balinese artists are regarded as a form of spiritual offering, and therefore these artists do not care about recognition of their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Vickers|title=Bali Tempo Doeloe|year=2012|publisher=Komunitas Bambu|page=296|isbn=602-9402-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balinese artists are also skilled in duplicating art works such as carvings that resemble Chinese deities or decorating vehicles based on what is seen in foreign magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Vickers|title=Bali Tempo Doeloe|year=2012|publisher=Komunitas Bambu|page=298|isbn=602-9402-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture is noted for its use of the [[gamelan]] in music and in various traditional events of Balinese society. Each type of music is designated for a specific type of event. For example, music for a ''piodalan'' (birthday celebration) is different from music used for a ''metatah'' (teeth grinding) ceremony, just as it is for weddings, ''[[Ngaben]]'' (cremation of the dead ceremony), ''[[Melasti]]'' (purification ritual) and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beryl De Zoete, Arthur Waley &amp; Walter Spies|title=Dance and Drama in Bali|year=1938|publisher=Faber and Faber|page=298|oclc=459249128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse types of [[gamelan]] are also specified according to the different types of dance in Bali. According to [[Walter Spies]], the art of dancing is an integral part of Balinese life as well as an endless critical element in a series of ceremonies or for personal interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beryl De Zoete, Arthur Waley &amp; Walter Spies|title=Dance and Drama in Bali|year=1938|publisher=Faber and Faber|pages=6–10|oclc=459249128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, displaying of female breasts is not regarded as immodest. Balinese women can often be seen with bared chests; however, a display of the thigh is considered immodest. In modern Bali these customs are normally not strictly observed, but visitors visiting Balinese temples are advised to cover their legs.

In the Balinese [[Balinese name|naming system]], a person's rank of birth or caste is reflected in the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Howe|title=Hinduism &amp; Hierarchy In Bali|year=2001|publisher=James Currey|page=46|isbn=1-930618-09-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puputan===
{{main article|Puputan}}
A [[puputan]] is an act of mass suicide through frontal assaults in battle, and was first noted by the Dutch during the colonization of Bali. The latest act of puputan was during the Indonesian war of Independence, with Lt. Colonel [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai]] as the leader in the battle of Margarana. The [[Ngurah Rai International Airport|airport in Bali]] is named after him in commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Creese, I Nyoman Darma Putra &amp; Henk Schulte Nordholt|title=Seabad Puputan Badung: Perspektif Belanda Dan Bali|year=2006|publisher=KITLV-Jakarta|isbn=979-3790-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{main article|Balinese Hinduism}}
{{other uses|Balinese temple}}
[[Image:Bali1981-019.jpg|thumb|upright|Balinese people bring offerings to the [[Balinese temple|temple]].]] 
The vast majority of the Balinese believe in ''Agama Tirta'', "holy-water religion". It is a [[Shiva]]ite sect of [[Hinduism]]. Traveling Indian priests are said to have introduced the people to the sacred literature of Hinduism and Buddhism centuries ago. The people accepted it and combined it with their own [[Balinese mythology|pre-Hindu mythologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Stephen Lansing|author-link=J. Stephen Lansing| title=The Three Worlds of Bali|year=1983|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-03-063816-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Balinese from before the third wave of immigration, known as the [[Bali Aga]], are mostly not followers of Agama Tirta, but retain their own [[animist]] traditions.

==Festivals==
[[Image:Bali 0720a.jpg|thumb|Balinese women preparing for a religious festival.]]
Balinese people celebrate multiple festivals, including the Kuta Carnival, the [http://www.sanurvillagefestival.com/ Sanur Village Festival], and the [[Bali Kite Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Tempo: Indonesia's Weekly News Magazine, Volume 7, Issues 9-16|year=2006|publisher=Arsa Raya Perdana|page=66|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participants fly fish-, bird-, and leaf-shaped kites while an orchestra plays traditional music.

'''Benhuan''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|本|焕}}|p=Běnhuàn}}; 21 September 1907 – 2 April 2012) was a [[Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]], [[Zen master|Chan master]] and [[religious leader]] in [[China]]. He held several abbatial posts, such as being first abbot of the [[Hongfa Temple]] in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name=xinhua&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Chinese Buddhist master passes away in Shenzhen|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-04/02/c_131503433.htm|work=[[Xinhua]]|publisher=|date=2012-04-02|accessdate=2012-04-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405040743/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-04/02/c_131503433.htm|archivedate=2012-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the honorary president of the [[Buddhist Association of China]] in 2010, holding the position until his death in 2012.&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt;&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt;

==Early life==
Benhuan was born as '''Zhang Zhishan''' (张志山) in 1907 in [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou]], [[Hubei]] Province. He went to the old-style private school when he was 7 years old and became an apprentice in the local grocery store. When in his twenties, Zhang gave up home life and took tonsure in the Baoen Temple.

==Religious life==
[[File:Hongfa Temple, Shenzhen 009.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Hongfa Temple]], a Buddhist temple in [[Shenzhen]], [[South Central China]]'s [[Guangdong]], where Benhuan lived until he died.]]

In 1930, he went to Baotong Temple to receive and uphold precepts in Wuchang. In that same year, he came to the Gaoyu Temple and formally acknowledged Laiguo as his master, where he spent 7 years in practicing the Dharma. In February 1937, he spared no effort to worship at the shrine on Mount Wutai and then lived in Bishan temple. Two years later, he became the third Master Monk Guan there.

In 1947, he visited many other temples all over China,  namely Mile Monastery in Beijing, Jushi Lodge in Tianjin and Puji Temple in Shanghai. In 1948, he left Mount Wutai for [[Nanhua Temple]] in Guangdong Province to take the place of Master Hsu Yun. In January 1949, he acceded to the abbotship of Nanhua temple.  In April, 1980, the people's government of Huanan county and the Buddhism community invited him to be the abbot of Biechuan temple in Danxia Mountain. In January 1987 he acceded to the abbotship of Guangxiao temple in Guangzhou Province; from 1992-2008 he was elected the abbot of Hongfa temple, at that point in time he was known as the "Greatest in Chinese Buddhism".

As a religious leader in Mainland China, Benhuan served as honorary President of the Buddhist association of China (a post he was elected to in 2010), honorary President of the Buddhist association of Hubei province and Guangdong province, the President of Shenzhen Buddhism association, the honorary President of the Buddhist association of Shaoguan city, the Chinese people's political consultative conference in Guangdong province.

==Personality==
Benhuan’s legendary spiritual and religious cultivation include, as legend has it, sitting in meditation that lasted 91 days without sleep in his youth; locking himself in a temple for seven years, spending an entire year travelling on a pilgrimage from Baoding in Hebei Province to Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, and copying 19 Buddhist scriptures with more than 200,000 characters with blood from his fingers and tongue.

He was also known for his good memory. According to his disciple Yin Shun, who is now the abbot of Hongfa Temple, Ben Huan once instantly recognized a visitor who visited him five years before. The famous monk would have tens of thousands of visitors every day asking for blessings. These "blessing seekers" would include important government officials and successful businesspeople, and all would be treated equally.

==Influence==
[[File:Hongfa Temple, Shenzhen 005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chinese character "福", written by Benhua.]]

Benhuan became a monk in 1930 and was the 44th generation lineage holder of the Linji school. He promoted Buddhism in more than 20 countries and regions, attracting more than 2 million followers.

He was regarded as an eminent Buddhist both in China and overseas. He was also a generous philanthropist. During his 80 years of Buddhism practice, he donated more than 10 million yuan (US$1.59 million) to building roads, schools and hospitals across the country. Hongfa Temple’s donations and contributions to public facilities and charitable organizations totaled more than 50 million yuan.

He became a centenarian in 2007, and died on April 2, 2012, age 104, Benhuan died in the Hongfa Temple in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, according to an announcement of the temple posted on its official website.

{{Jainism}}
'''[[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]''' are two ancient [[Indian religion]]s that developed in [[Magadha]] ([[Bihar]] region) and continue to thrive in the modern times. [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha]] are generally accepted as contemporaries (circa 5th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2003). Jainism and Buddhism, in Buswell, Robert E. ed. Encyclopedia of Buddhism, New York: Macmillan Reference Lib. {{ISBN|0028657187}}; p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keown127/&gt; Jainism and Buddhism share many features, terminology and ethical principles, but emphasize them differently.&lt;ref name=keown127&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown|author2=Charles S.

According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of [[Skandha|five skandhas]] or heaps—the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering."&lt;br /&gt;[c] {{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, Quote: "...Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jains believe that their religion is ancient and eternal with 24 Tirthankaras. Of the 24, the last two – [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]] – are generally accepted as historical persons, with the 23rd Tirthankara pre-dating the Buddha and the Mahavira by probably some 250 years.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30-33}} Buddhists believe [[Gautama Buddha]], the historical buddha, rediscovered the long forgotten [[Dharma#Buddhism|dharma]] around the 5th century BCE, and began to teach it again. In Buddhism there were [[List_of_the_named_Buddhas|previous buddhas]], too, 27 in total as described in the ''[[Buddhavamsa]]'', the 14th book of the ''[[Khuddaka Nikāya]]''.&lt;ref name="Horner1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicittasarabivamsa1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law1938"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Takin1969"/&gt; Buddhists also believe that Gautama Buddha had many previous rebirths as described in the [[Jataka Tales]].&lt;ref name="Jataka"/&gt;

Buddhist scriptures record that during Prince Siddhartha's ascetic life (before attaining enlightenment) he undertook many fasts, penances and austerities, the descriptions of which are elsewhere found only in the Jain tradition{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In the ''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'', the Buddha shares his experience:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruthi|first1=R.K.|title=Buddhism and Indian Civilization|date=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-71418664|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J07QJQPYz8kC|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Thus far, Sāriputta, did I go in my penance? I went without clothes. I licked my food from my hands. I took no food that was brought or meant especially for me. I accepted no invitation to a meal.}} 

The Jain text of [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]] confirms Mahavira's asceticism, whose life is a source of guidance on many of the ascetic practices in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Jainism in Buddhist Texts==

===Pāli Canon===
The [[Pāli Canon]] does not record that Mahavira and Gautama Buddha ever met, though instances of Mahavira's disciples questioning Gautama Buddha are to be found in various sutras. For instance, in the ''[[Majjhima Nikāya]]'' (MN 56), [[Upali|Upāli]] —one of Gautama Buddha's foremost disciples— is said to have been a disciple of the Mahavira who became a disciple of the Buddha after losing a debate with him.&lt;ref name="MN56"/&gt;
The Buddhists have always maintained that by the time the Buddha and Mahavira were alive, Jainism was already an entrenched faith and culture in the region. According to the Pāli Canon, Gautama was aware of Mahavira's existence as well as the communities of [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]]

[[Buddhist]] texts refer to the Mahavira as ''Nigaṇṭha  Jñātaputta''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=21}} Nigaṇṭha means "without knot, tie, or string" and Jñātaputta (son of ''Natas''), referred to his clan of origin ''Jñāta'' or ''Naya'' ([[Prakrit]]).{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}

The five vows (non-violence, [[truth]], non-attachment, non-thieving, [[celibacy]]/[[chastity]]) propounded by the 23rd Jain [[Tirthankara]], [[Pārśva]] (877-777 BCE),{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=21}} may have been the template for the [[Five Precepts]] of Buddhism. Additionally, the Buddhist ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttaranikāya]]'' scripture quotes the independent philosopher [[Purana Kassapa]], a sixth century BCE founder of a now-extinct order, as listing the "Nirgranthas" as one of the six major classifications of humanity.

Buddhist writings reflect that Jains had followers by the time the Buddha lived.  Suggesting close correlations between the teachings of the Jains and the Buddha, the ''Majjhima Nikaya'' relates dialogues between the Buddha and several members of the "Nirgrantha community".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Indian Buddhist tradition categorized all non-Buddhist schools of thought as ''pāsaṇḍa'' "heresy" (''pasanda'' means to throw a noose or ''pasha''—stemming from the doctrine that schools labelled as ''Pasanda'' foster views perceived as wrong because they are seen as having a tendency towards binding and ensnaring rather than freeing the mind). The difference between the schools of thought are outlined.

===Divyavadana===

The ancient text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' (''[[Ashokavadana]]'' is one of its sections)  mention that in one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Mahavira]]. On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, [[Ashoka]], the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya Emperor]], issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ājīvika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 Ājīvikas were executed as a result of this order.&lt;ref name="John1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S. Strong | title=The Legend of King Aśoka: A Study and Translation of the Aśokāvadāna | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp9uaQTQ8h8C&amp;pg=PA232 | accessdate=30 October 2012 | year=1989 | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0616-0 | pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later, another ascetic in [[Pataliputra]] drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house.&lt;ref name="Beni2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Benimadhab Barua]] | title=The Ajivikas | url=https://archive.org/details/ajivikas00barurich | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=5 May 2010 | publisher=General Books | isbn=978-1-152-74433-2 | pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced an award of one [[denarius|dinara]] (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Jain. According to ''Ashokavadana'', as a result of this order, his own brother, [[Vitashoka]],  was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd. Their ministers advised that "this is an example of the suffering that is being inflicted even on those who are free from desire"  and that he "should guarantee the security of all beings". After this, Ashoka stopped giving orders for executions.&lt;ref name="John1989"/&gt;

According to K. T. S. Sarao and [[Benimadhab Barua]], stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be a clear fabrication arising out of sectarian propaganda.&lt;ref name="Beni2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven2010"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steven L.

==Buddhist Texts in Jain Libraries==

According to Padmanabh Jaini, Vasudhara Dharani, a Buddhist work was among the Jainas of Gujarat in 1960s, and a manuscript was copied in 1638 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Vasudhara dharani A Buddhist work in use among the Jainas of Gujarat, Padmanabh S Jaini, Mahavir Jain_Vidyalay Suvarna_Mahotsav Granth Part 1,  2002, p. 30-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharani was recited by non-Jain Brahmin priests in private Jain homes.

==Shared terminology==
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:India, madhya pradesh, jina parshvanatha dalla tempèesta, 600-700.JPG|[[Parshvanatha]] with [[Dharanendra]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The shared terms include [[Sangha]], [[Shramana]] (monk), [[Shravaka]] (Householder in Jainism, Buddha's disciple in Buddhism), [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]] (Tirthankara in Jainism, Buddha in Buddhism), [[Chaitya]], [[Stupa]], [[Pudgala]] (Matter in Jainism, soul in Buddhism) etc. Early Jainism used stupas, although the practice mostly (but not completely) was abandoned later.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism, Johannes Bronkhorst, Brill, 2011, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarities ==

File:Sanchi_8-13.jpg| Buddhist stupa worship, [[Sanchi]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Jainism]], the way of liberation is the ford (tirtha), and Tirthankaras "those making the ford" (from ''[[samsara]]'' to ''moksha'') are supreme teachers.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=474}} Same concept is found in Buddhism which says that through enlightenment (bodhi) an individual crosses the river of ''samsara'' and attain liberation. Both religions deny the existence of a creator god.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=139}} Buddhism and Jainish evince a shared belief in the existence of geographical regions beyond the parameters of ''[[Bharatavarsha]]'', access to which could not be gained by ordinary human beings.{{sfn|Patrick Olivelle|2006|p=396}}

Karakandu, a [[Pratyekabuddha]] in both Jainism and Buddhism, is a rare personality that is shared between Jainism and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha,  Issue 30 of Religion and reason, ISSN 0080-0848, Martin G. Wiltshire,

The [[Jain community]] (or Jain ''[[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]'') consists of [[Jain monasticism|monastics]], ''muni''s (male ascetics) and ''aryika''s (female ascetics) and householders, ''[[Śrāvaka#Jainism|śhrāvak]]''s (laymen) and ''śrāvakī''s (laywomen). Buddhism has a similar organization: the community consists of renunciate [[bhikkhu]]s and [[bhikkhuni]]s and male and female laypersons, or ''śrāvaka''s and ''śrāvika''s, who take limited vows.

==Differences==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Jainism has developed and refined the non-violence ('''Ahimsa'') doctrine to an extraordinary degree where it is an integral part of the Jain culture.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=176–177}}{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}} [[Jain vegetarianism]], for example, is driven by the principle of not harming any animals and both lay and mendicants are predominantly vegetarian.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=260}} In Buddhism, [[Mahayana]] monks in China, Japan (see [[Shojin-ryori]]), Korea and Vietnam are vegetarian; however, vegetarianism is not required for lay Buddhists. In [[Theravada]] monastic tradition, a monk should eat whatever is placed in his bowl when receiving food.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Although both Buddhists and Jain had orders of nuns, Buddhist Pali texts record the Buddha saying that a woman has the ability to obtain [[nirvana]] in the [[dharma]] and [[Vinaya]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} According to [[Digambara]] Jains, women are capable of spiritual progress but must be reborn as a man in order to attain final spiritual liberation. The religious texts of the [[Śvētāmbara]]s mention that liberation is attainable by both men and women.&lt;ref name=Jaini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaini|first1=Padmanabh S.|title=Gender and salvation : Jaina debates on the spiritual liberation of women|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520068209|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft138nb0wk&amp;brand=eschol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe in the existence of an eternal [[Jīva (Jainism)|Jiva (soul)]],{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=140}} whereas Buddhism denies the concept of self ([[jiva]]) or soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]), proposing the concept of no-self ([[anatta]]) instead.&lt;ref&gt;John C.

The ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is another key difference between Jainism and Buddhism. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Mahavira, in contrast, accepted both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}}

Jainism discourages monks and nuns from staying in a single place for a long time, with the exception of 4 months in the rainy season ([[Chaturmas#Jainism|chaturmas]]). Thus most of the time the Jain monks and nuns keep wandering, staying in a place for just a few days. Some [[Theravada]] Buddhist monks also observe [[vassa]] rules, but often they stay in one monastery.&lt;ref name=keown127/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15544">'''''Chaber''''' or '''''Ḥaber''''' ({{lang-he-n|חָבֵר}}) is a [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] term meaning "associate"; "colleague"; "fellow"; "companion"; "friend" ([[Psalms|Ps.]] {{bibleverse-nb||ps|119:63|JP}}).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

The term is ordinarily used in rabbinical lore in its original Biblical sense (''[[Abot]]'' ii. 9, 10).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ביאור:משנה אבות פרק ב|משנה אבות פרק ב]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Talmud]]ic proverb says, "Thy ''chaber'' has a ''chaber'', and thy ''chaber''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''chaber'' has a ''chaber''; thy words will thus circulate and become public" (''[[Baba Batra]]'' 38b;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:בבא בתרא לח ב|בבא בתרא לח ב]] (in Hebrew/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]])&lt;/ref&gt; ''[['Arakin]]'' 16a&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ערכין טז א|ערכין טז א]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Scholar==
The [[Rabbi]]s urgently recommend [[Torah study|study]] in [[Chavrusa|company]], asserting that only in this way can knowledge be acquired (''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 63b;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ברכות סג ב|ברכות סג ב]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]]'' 81a&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:נדרים פא א|נדרים פא א]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt;); therefore, if necessary, one should even expend money for the purpose of acquiring a companion (''[[Abot de-Rabbi Natan]]'' viii. 3).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:אבות דרבי נתן ח#ג|אבות דרבי נתן ח ג]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent teacher of the second century declared that, while he had learned much from his masters, he had learned more from his "''chaberim''" (''[[Ta'anit (tractate)|Ta'anit]]'' 7a).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:תענית ז א|תענית ז א]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term came to mean a "companion in study," a "colleague"; and when preceded or followed by the term "''talmid''" ([[Student|pupil]]) it denotes one who is at once the [[Talmid Haver|pupil and colleague]] of a certain teacher, a [[Torah scholar|scholar]] who from being a pupil has risen to be a colleague or fellow (compare ''Baba Batra'' 158b;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:בבא בתרא קנח ב|בבא בתרא קנח ב]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]] [[Shekalim (Talmud)|Shekalim]]'' iii. 47b&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130704022432/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=222&amp;hilite= ירושלמי שקלים פרק שלישי] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt;). Eventually "''chaber''" assumed the general meaning of "scholar" (''Baba Batra'' 75a),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:בבא בתרא עה א|בבא בתרא עה א]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; and appears as a title subordinate to ''[[Chakam]]'' (compare ''[[Kiddushin (tractate)|Kiddushin]]'' 33b).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:קידושין לג ב|קידושין לג ב]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; The title "''chaber''" was known in comparatively early times (eleventh century), when it probably referred to a member of a [[Beth din|court of justice]]; but in [[Germany]] in later centuries it indicated that its possessor had devoted many years to the study of sacred literature.&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

In congregational life it was conferred as a rule on [[Jewish views on marriage|married]] men, but often also on [[yeshiva]] graduates who were [[Single person|single]]. Rabbi [[Jonathan Eybeschütz]] conferred it on the Christian professor [[Oluf Gerhard Tychsen|Tychsen]].&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

"''Chaber''" also denotes a member of a society or order ("''chaburah''," "''chaburta''," "''k'neset''" = "aggregation," "company," "union"), or of a union of [[Pharisees]] for the purpose of carrying out the observance of the laws of [[Tumah and taharah|"clean" and "unclean"]] to their fullest possible development. In their eyes, any person about whom there was a doubt as to whether he was particular in the observance of these laws or those concerning the [[Tithe#Mosaic law|tithes]] was an ''[[am ha'aretz]]'', whose contact was defiling. But the term "''chaber''" is by no means synonymous with "''Parush''" (Pharisee), since not all Pharisees were ''chaberim'', though sometimes the generic term "''parush''" is used in its stead (''[[Tosefta]]'', ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' i. 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20419&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=140&amp;hilite= תוספתא שבת א 15]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the more specific term "''ne'eman''" (trusty) takes the place of "''chaber''" (''[[Demai (Talmud)|Demai]]'' iv. 5,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה דמאי ד ה|משנה דמאי ד ה]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 6&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה דמאי ד ו|משנה דמאי ד ו]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;). On the Scriptural saying, "He shall . . . cleanse it and hallow it" ([[Lev.]] {{Bibleverse-nb||lev|16:19|JP}}), rabbinical ethics bases the maxim, "[[Cleanliness]] leads to [[Sacred|holiness]]" (''Yerushalmi Shabbat'' i. 3c;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140806000115/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45298&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=135&amp;hilite= ירושלמי שבת פרק ראשון] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt; compare ''[[Sotah]]'' ix. 15&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה סוטה ט טו|משנה סוטה ט טו]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;). But cleanliness was understood to be closely connected with [[Levitical purity]]; of this there were several degrees, there being sections in the community which observed its rules more strictly and extensively than did others. Some even extended all the precautions necessary for the [[Kohen|priest]] in eating holy things to the layman who lived on secular food (''[[Hagigah]]'' ii. 6,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה חגיגה ב ו|משנה חגיגה ב ו]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 7&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה חגיגה ב ז|משנה חגיגה ב ז]] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Levitically pure==
The Bible ({{Bibleverse||Lev.|27:30-32|JP}} ; [[Num.]] {{Bibleverse-nb||num|18:21-28|JP}}; [[Deut.]] {{Bibleverse-nb||deut|14:22-29|JP}}) lays on the products of an Israelite's farm and on his herds certain imposts to be paid respectively to the priest, the [[Levite]], and the poor (compare [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] 1:6-8), but which were not universally paid. The rules governing these imposts, as well as the rules of "clean" and "unclean," were doubtless familiar to the people at large; but not all people found it convenient or possible to comply with them. Particularly difficult must their observance have been in the unsettled state of affairs during the [[Maccabean wars]]. It is suggested by some that it was at this time that the so-called "''am ha'aretz''" (who included the great majority of the people), either driven by circumstances or seduced by temptation, neglected them; and that a certain more rigorous minority, not knowing whom to trust in such matters, formed among themselves associations ("''chaburot''"), the members ("''chaberim''") of which pledged themselves to keep faithfully the rules of Levitical purity and those regarding the tithes. Accordingly, the ''chaber'' is one who strictly observes the laws of "''ma'aserot''" (tithes) and of Levitical cleanness (see ''Gittin.'' v. 9). To be admitted as a chaber the candidate must declare his determination never to present the "''terumah''" or the "''ma'aser''" to a priest or a Levite who is classed as an ''am ha'aretz''; nor to allow his ordinary food to be prepared by an ''am ha'aretz''; nor to eat his ordinary food ("''chullin''," grain and fruit from which ''terumah'' and ''ma'aser'' have been separated) except in a certain state of Levitical cleanness (''Tosefta'', ''Demai'' ii. 2). This declaration must be made before three members of the order, and if they are satisfied that the candidate has lived up to the rules in his private life, he is accepted at once; otherwise he is admitted as a "''ben ha-k'neset''" (son of the union, neophyte; compare ''Bekorot'' v. 5; ''Zabim'' iii. 2) for thirty days. According to Bet Shammai, this period suffices only when membership is sought for the lesser degrees of purity, while for the higher degrees the period of probation must be extended to a year. After this period, if the candidate has proved his constancy, he becomes a ''chaber'' or ''ne'eman''. And in this respect no distinction is made between the learned and the ignorant; all must make this declaration. An exception is made only in favor of a scholar attached to a college, it being presumed that he took the pledge when he first joined the college (''Bekorot'' 30b).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Degrees of ''chaburah''==
As there are several degrees of Levitical cleanness, so there are several classes of ''chaberim'' and ''ne'emanim'', pledging themselves to corresponding observances. The lowest class is that which pledges itself to practise Levitical cleanness of "''k'nafayim''" (literally "wings"). This is a very obscure term, for which no satisfactory explanation has been found. It is generally assumed to mean "hands"; and inasmuch as the Pharisaic maxim is, "Hands are always busy," touching without intention on the part of their owner both clean and unclean things, they are regarded as being in a state of uncertain cleanness; hence one must cleanse them before eating anything Levitically clean (''Tohorot'' vii. 8). This may be legally accomplished by pouring on them one-fourth of a ''log'' of water. But that process suffices only where a person wishes to eat ''chullin'', ''ma'aser'', or ''terumah''. If he desires to eat the sacrificial portions, he must dip his hands into forty ''seah''s of water; and if about to handle the water of lustration, he must first subject his whole body to immersion (''Chagigah'' ii. 5; ''Gemara'' 18b et seq.). As the ordinary Israelite and the Levite are not permitted to handle the most sacred things, it naturally follows that not all men are eligible for the higher degrees; and even of those whose descent does not bar their admission, not all are willing to assume the correspondingly greater precautions incident to the privilege. Provision is therefore made for general admission to the lower degrees, of which most people availed themselves. It is ordained that if one desires to join the order of ''chaberim'', but does not wish to subject himself to the duties devolving upon the members of the higher degrees—the precautions necessary to keep himself Levitically clean, as for the more sacred things—he may be accepted; but where, on the contrary, one seeks admission to the higher degrees while refusing to pledge himself to strict observance of the rules governing the lower degrees, he must be rejected (''Bekorot'' l.c.).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Separation from the ''am ha'aretz''==
Having been admitted as reliable in matters of ''ma'aser'', a ''chaber'' must tithe what he consumes, what he sells of his own producing, and what he buys for the purpose of selling, and must not eat at the board of an ''[[am ha'aretz]]'', lest he be served with victuals that have not been properly tithed. If he would become a full ''chaber'', he must not sell to an ''am ha'aretz'' anything that moisture would render subject to uncleanness (see Lev. 11:38; ''Makshirin'' i.), lest the ''am ha'aretz'' expose the goods to contamination; for rabbinical law forbids the causing of defilement even to things secular in the Land of Israel (''Abodah Zarah'' 55b). Nor must he buy of an ''am ha'aretz'' anything so rendered subject to uncleanness, nor accept invitations to the board of an ''am ha'aretz'', nor entertain one who is in his ordinary garments, which may have been exposed to defilement (''Demai'' ii. 2, 3).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

A ''chaber's'' wife, and his child or servant, are considered, in respect to religious observances, as the ''chaber'' himself (''Abodah Zarah'' 39a); therefore the admission of a candidate into the order embraces all the members of his family. Even after the ''chaber's'' death his family enjoy the confidence previously reposed in them, unless there be reason for impugning their fidelity. The same is the case when one of them joins the family of an ''am ha'aretz''; as long as there is no reasonable suspicion to the contrary, it is presumed that the habits acquired under the influence of the observant head of the family will not be discarded, even under different circumstances. Similarly, the presumption of habit governs the case of members of the family of an ''am ha'aretz'' joining that of a ''chaber''; they are not considered trustworthy unless they pledge themselves to live up to the rules of the ''chaburah''. However, the child or servant of an ''am ha'aretz'' entering the house of a ''chaber'' for the purpose of study is exempt from the operation of that presumption as long as he remains under the ''chaber's'' direction. On the other hand, when the pupil is the son or servant of a ''chaber'' and the teacher is an ''am ha'aretz'', the presumption is extended in the pupil's favor. Again, where a man is recognized as reliable while his wife is not—as when a ''chaber'' marries the widow or daughter of an ''am ha'aretz''—''chaberim'' may unhesitatingly buy of him articles of food, but must not eat at his board if it is presided over by his wife. If, on the contrary, the wife is reliable, being the widow or daughter of a ''chaber'', while the husband is an ''am ha'aretz'', ''chaberim'' may eat at his table, but must not buy from him (''Tosefta'', ''Demai'' ii. 14-18).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

==Suspension from the order==
As to the ''chaber'' himself, once he has been recognized as such, he continues so long as he is not found guilty of backsliding. If suspicion of backsliding is reasonably aroused against him, he is suspended from the ''chaburah'' until he reestablishes his trustworthiness. Similarly, where a ''chaber'' accepts an office that is considered suspicious—as that of tax-collector or publican—he is suspended from the ''chaburah'', but is reinstated upon surrender of the office (''Bekorot'' 31a).&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;

The exact date when the ''chaberim'' first appeared can not be determined. That they existed, however, as a ''chaburah'' in ante-Maccabean days, and are identical with those cited in I Macc. xiv. 28 as the "great congregation of priests" (Geiger, "''Urschrift''," p.&amp;nbsp;124), is not very probable, since in the later period of the Medo-Persian rule over the Land of Israel no great formative events are on record which could account for so great a separation from the body of the people. The precise period of the ''chaburah's'' organization should be sought, therefore, in the last decades of the second century BCE.&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=ḤABER|author=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">Among the historical [[Plains Indians|Amerindian tribes]] of the [[Great Plains]], a  '''Contrary''' was a member of a tribal group who adopted behavior that was deliberately the opposite of other tribal members. 
They were a small number of individuals loosely organized into a cult that was devoted to the practice of contrary behavior.

The Contraries are related, in part, to the clown organizations of the [[Plains Indians]], as well as to Plains military societies that contained ''reverse warriors''.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''The Plains Indian Clowns, their Contraries and related Phenomena.'' Vienna  2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakota word [[heyoka]], which translates as clown or opposites, serves as a collective title for these institutionalized forms of contrary behavior of the Plains Indians. When [[Lakota Indians]] first saw European clowns, they identified them with their own term for clowns, ''[[heyoka]]''. 

== History of concept ==
[[George Bird Grinnell|George B. Grinnell]] introduced the designation Contraries based on his visits to the [[Cheyenne]] around 1898.&lt;ref&gt; John Plant: ''Heyoka. Die Contraries und Clowns der Plainsindianer''. Foehr 1994, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Written accounts of the ''[[heyoka]]'' (i.e., the Contraries and clowns of the Lakota and Santee) were published even earlier. The cultural anthropologist [[Julian Steward]] described various forms of ''contrary behavior'' in his 1930 article ''The Ceremonial Buffoon of the American Indian''.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''The Plains Indian Clowns, their Contraries and related Phenomena''. Vienna  2010, p. 2f.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, [[Verne Ray]]  examined contrary behavior in the ritual dances and ceremonies of North American Indians and differentiated a further characteristic of the contrary complex of the Plains Indians, reverse reaction, which means to do the opposite of what one is asked.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''The Plains Indian Clowns, their Contraries and related Phenomena''. Vienna 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social role ==
The social role of the Plains Indian clowns was ceremonial since they performed primarily during rituals, dances and feasts. Unlike the clowns, the special role of the Contraries was not restricted to brief performances, rituals or the warpath. It was their everyday life. The Contraries of the Plains Indians were unique and historically unprecedented. [[John Plant (ethnologist)|John Plant]] examined the ethnological phenomena of contrary behavior, particularly in the tribes of the North American Plains Indians.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''The Plains Indian Clowns, their Contraries and related Phenomena''. Vienna 2010, p. 15f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Contraries of the Plains Indians were individuals committed to an extraordinary life-style in which they did the opposite of what others normally do. They thus turned all social conventions into their opposites.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''Heyoka. Die Contraries und Clowns der Plainsindianer''. Foehr 1994 , p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Contrary behavior'' means deliberately doing the opposite of what others routinely or conventionally do. It was usually accompanied by ''inverse speech'', in which one says the opposite of what one actually means. For example, "no!" expresses "yes!" And "hello" means "goodbye". To say "Grandfather, go away!" would be an invitation for him to come.&lt;ref&gt; John Plant: ''Heyoka. Die Contraries und Clowns der Plainsindianer''. Foehr 1994, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reverse warriors ==
In addition to the Contraries and the ceremonial clowns, many Plains tribes recognized certain persons having the role of "reverse" warriors. These were usually experienced warriors who in battle purposely abided by contrary, foolish or crazy principles. Generally, they belonged to military organizations that also took part in dance ceremonies. Only the "reverse" warriors used inverse speech, and only they did the opposite of what they were commanded or instructed to do (reverse reaction). The "reverse" warrior charged into battle when ordered to retreat and could only fall back when he was commanded to attack.&lt;ref&gt;John Plant: ''The Plains Clowns, their Contraries and related Phenomena''. Vienna 2010, p. 23f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crypto-Christianity''' is the secret practice of [[Christianity]], usually while attempting to camouflage it as another faith or observing the rituals of another religion publicly. In places and time periods where Christians were persecuted or Christianity was outlawed, instances of crypto-Christianity have surfaced.

==History==
Various time periods and places have seen large crypto-Christian groups and underground movements. This was usually the reaction to either threats of violence or legal action.

===Roman Empire===
During the initial development of the [[Christian Church]] under the [[Roman Empire]] followers often had to practice in secret.{{Citation needed |date=July 2014}}  Official policy under [[Trajan]] was to provide Christians with the choice between recanting and execution.&lt;ref&gt;Trajan in Pliny, ''Letters'' 10.97.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term crypto-Christianity can be applied to that segment of the church population which concealed its Christian beliefs as a means to avoid persecution. In contrast, many Christians, including [[Polycarp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Polycarp | contribution-url = http://www.theopedia.com/Polycarp | title = Theopedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; chose to retain their beliefs and suffer persecution, due to the fact that Christian doctrine forbade public profession of another religion even while holding a mental reservation against it, which made it stricter than Muslim (''[[taqiyya]]'') or Jewish opinions on the manner, but many did so out of weakness:

{{quote|text=All the inhabitants of the empire were required to sacrifice before the magistrates of their community 'for the safety of the empire' by a certain day (the date would vary from place to place and the order may have been that the sacrifice had to be completed within a specified period after a community received the edict). When they sacrificed they would obtain a certificate (libellus) recording the fact that they had complied with the order.&lt;ref name="Decius: 249 - 251 AD"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/en/Decius.html |title=Decius: 249–251 AD |publisher=University of Michigan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330183455/http://www.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/en/Decius.html |archivedate=2011-03-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japan===
Christianity was introduced to [[Japan]] during its [[Feudal Japan|feudal era]] by [[Saint Francis Xavier]] in 1550. From the beginning, Christianity was seen as a threat to the power of the ''[[shōgun]]''.  In 1643, Christianity was banned, all churches were destroyed, all known Christians tortured and demanded to convert to Buddhism or face execution, and all signs of Christian influence were systematically eliminated. The ban was not lifted until 1858.

During this period, faithful converts moved underground into a crypto-Christian group called [[kakure Kirishitan]] or "hidden Christians". Crypto-Christian crosses and graves, cleverly styled during these two centuries to resemble Buddhist imagery, can still be seen in the [[Shimabara Peninsula]], [[Amakusa]] islands and far south in [[Kagoshima]].

[[Shūsaku Endō]]'s acclaimed novel ''[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]'' draws from the oral history of Japanese Catholic communities pertaining to the time of the suppression of the Church.

===Ottoman Empire (Balkans and Asia Minor)===
An early attestation and justification of cryptochristianism is found in an epistle of Patriarch Ioannes 14th (Ιωάννης ΙΔ')(1334-1347) of [[Constantinople]] to the Christians of [[Bithynia]] (Asia Minor). He says that "''those [christians] who by the fear of punishment [by the muslims] want to believe and practice christianity secretly, they will be also saved, provided they study god's orders as far as possible''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=kORq0x-aGQ4C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%CF%84%CF%89+%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%B8%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8udVG0Owvt&amp;sig=NxtgbGQ_jmSNmmhjv7xcmag1Lxw&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCmbz1zPHPAhVGUhQKHSM0AXYQ6AEILjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%CF%84%CF%89%20%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%B8%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B9&amp;f=false Ioannes 14th (patriarch), "Promittit Nicaeensibus reversuris  in sinum ecclesiae remissionem" (Πιττάκιον πατριαρχικόν εις τους ευρισκομένους εις την Νϊκαιαν)], published by Franz Miklosich &amp; Josef Müller in ''Acta et Diplomata Graeca Medii Aevi Sacra et Profana'' (1860), p. 184. Mentioned also in Kitsikis Dimitris, "The importance of bektashism-alewism for hellenism", Athens, "Hekate",  2006, p. 47, in Greek language.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the religious strife that has marked the [[Balkan Peninsula]] and [[Anatolia]], instances of crypto-Christian behavior are reported to this day in Muslim-dominated areas of the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Albania]], and [[Turkey]].{{Efn | These groups names are: Droverstvo (Serbia), Patsaloi or Linovamvakoi (Cyprus), Laramanoi (Albania), Kouroumlides, Stavriotai, Santaoi, Klostoi (Pontus, Anatolia), Kourmoulides (Crete), Crypto Copts (Egypt), Crypto Maronites (Lebanon)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Hristiyan | contribution-url = http://www.karalahana.com/makaleler/tarih/hristiyan.htm | title = Karalahana}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} With the threat of retribution for the religious and ethnic conflicts, many Christian minority groups keep their religion private to protect themselves.  Crypto-Christianity was mostly practiced following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] conquests of the Balkans, but the earliest scholarly record of the phenomenon dates to 1829.  [[Linobamvaki]] in [[Cyprus]] traced their ancestry to both Catholics, Maronites and Greek Orthodox Christians who converted under Ottoman oppression. The [[Laramans]] in southeastern [[Kosovo]] hailed from the northern Albania highlands and converted after settling in the 18th century.

Crypto-Greek Orthodox are reported to many parts of the Ottoman Balkans and Anatolia. A good account of the Crypto-Christians among [[Pontic Greeks]] from northeastern Anatolia and the [[Pontic Alps]] region (often referred to as [[Stavriotes]]), including bibliography on other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], is given by F. W. Hasluck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DJFy16OTW9YC&amp;pg=PA470 F. W. Hasluck (1929) Christianity and Islam Under the Sultans, ed. Clarendon press, Oxford, vol. 2, pp. 469-474. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crypto-Armenians are believed to represent at least two groups of Armenians living in modern Turkey. One has been Islamized under the threat of physical extermination particularly during Armenian pogroms in 1896 and the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. Representatives of a different, much smaller crypto-Armenian group live in separate villages inhabited by Turks and Kurds in Eastern Turkey (on the territories of traditional Armenian homeland). This group differs from the above-mentioned "Islamized" type by the process and depth of Islamization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noravank.am/en/?page=theme&amp;thid=8&amp;nid=91 The Armenian ethnoreligious elements in the Western Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
In the first few centuries the Christian religion spread rapidly around the Mediterranean region with Egypt and Syria becoming especially important centers of the religion. Even as the Roman Empire disintegrated between the 5th and 7th centuries, the Christian faith only deepened in the Eastern Mediterranean. During the 7th century the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] took over what is now called the Middle East. Initially Christianity was well tolerated though preferential treatment was given to [[Muslim]]s. However, often the only actual requirement for being considered a Muslim was to profess a belief in God and proclaim Mohammed as his prophet. As a result, many Egyptians, Syrians, and others in the region officially converted to [[Islam]] while still adhering to Christian practices.

As oppression of Christians arose under the Fatimid [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]], Christian (and Jewish) practices became more hidden. Secretive communities appeared in Egypt during the 11th century and in [[Morocco]] in the 12th century under the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads rule]]. Many Crypto-Christian communities existed in Middle-East till the 19th century, as Muslim authorities continued to tolerate minimal requirements of obedience by converts. From late 19th century onward most of crypto-religious groups disappeared as a result of the rise of nationalism in the new Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/4363/pdf/Reinkowski_Hidden_believers_hidden_apostates.pdf Reinkowski M. (2007)  ''Hidden Believers, Hidden Apostates: The Phenomenon of Crypto-Jews and Crypto-Christians in the Middle-East'', in Washburn u.a. (Hrsg.): Converting cultures : religion, ideology of transformations of modernity. Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2007 pp. 408 -433]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Russia and the Warsaw Pact===
Many Christian communities in the Soviet sphere of influence during the Cold War had to go underground in so-called [[Catacomb]] Churches. After the break-up of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Soviet era in the 1990s, some of these groups re-joined the official above-ground churches, but others continued their independent existence, believing the official churches had been irreconcilably tainted by their cooperation with the previous Soviet-supported regimes.

===People's Republic of China===
[[Chinese house church]]es are unregistered Christian churches in the [[People's Republic of China]] which operate independently of the official government-run religious institutions: the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for [[Protestant]]s, and the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] for [[Roman Catholic]]s.

===Nazi Germany===
In a unique instance of crypto-Christianity occurring in a majority Christian nation, the underground [[Confessing Church]] consisted of German (Protestant) Christians who had separated from the unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] that had been created after Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and condoned fascist policies. While many of their leaders actively opposed Hitler's anti-Semitic policies, the Confessing Church's opposition was directed primarily against the state's meddling in church affairs, such as the persecution of pastors with Jewish ancestry. Many leading figures of the Confessing Church were eventually arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps, most notably [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] who was a co-conspirator in an unsuccessful [[Operation Spark (1940)|assassination attempt]] on Hitler by officers of the [[Abwehr]] in 1943. Bonhoeffer was subsequently imprisoned in [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] and eventually executed.

===Intra-Christian cases===
In addition to crypto-Christianity, where Christians practiced their faith secretly in an anti-Christian society, there have been instances of crypto-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in [[Protestant]] territories where Catholicism was banned and heavily persecuted (such as [[England]] from 1558 - see [[Recusant]]s, and in [[Ireland]] - see [[Recusancy in Ireland]]), as well as in [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] countries (in particular, territories annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] during its expansion), and crypto-Protestants in Catholic territories (such as French [[Huguenot]]s after the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]).

[[Protestantism in Eritrea|Protestants in Eritrea]], a Christian-majority country, number about 2% of the population and often practice in secret to avoid persecution and torture from the authorities.

[[File:Corvus corax arizona.jpg|thumb|250px|Common ravens in the [[Petrified Forest National Park]], [[Arizona]].]]
Many references to [[raven]]s exist in world lore and literature. Most depictions allude to the appearance and behaviour of the wide-ranging [[common raven]] (Corvus corax). Because of its black plumage, croaking call and diet of [[carrion]], the raven is often associated with loss and ill omen. Yet its symbolism is complex. As a talking bird, the raven also represents [[prophecy]] and insight. Ravens in stories often act as [[psychopomp]]s, connecting the material world with the world of [[spirit]]s. 

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] proposed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that suggests the raven (like the [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]]) obtained mythic status because it was a mediator animal between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Structural Anthropology, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; As a carrion bird, ravens became associated with the dead and with lost souls. In Swedish folklore, they are the ghosts of murdered people without Christian burials and, in German stories, damned souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=birds.raven |title=Raven: The Northern Bird of Paradox |accessdate=2007-02-12 |last=Schwan |first=Mark |date=January 1990 |publisher=Alaska Fish and Game |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102055945/http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=birds.raven |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism and mythology by culture==
[[Image:The-Twa-Corbies.jpg|thumb|"[[The Twa Corbies]]", Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''Some British [[Ballad]]s'']]

The Raven has appeared in the mythology of many ancient people. Some of the more common stories are from those of Greek, Celtic, Norse, Pacific Northwest, and Roman mythology.

===Greco-Roman antiquity===
In [[Greek mythology]], ravens are associated with [[Apollo]], the god of prophecy. They are said to be a symbol of bad luck, and were the god's messengers in the mortal world. According to the mythological narration, Apollo sent a white raven, or crow in some versions to spy on his lover, [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]]. When the raven brought back the news that Coronis has been unfaithful to him, Apollo scorched the raven in his fury, turning the animal's feathers black. That's why all ravens are black today.

According to [[Livy]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Marcus Valerius Corvus]] (c. 370-270 BC) had a raven settle on his helmet during a combat with a gigantic Gaul, which distracted the enemy's attention by flying in his face.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]]. [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae006.html ''Periochae.''] Book 7:10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The general, previously known by his surname (''[[cognomen]]'') Calenus, was thus given the ''[[agnomen]]'' Corvus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lendering |first1=Jona |title=Livy: the Periochae of Books 6-7 |url=http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae006.html |website=www.livius.org |accessdate=27 August 2018 |location=Book 7:10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] for "raven"; ''cf:'' [[genus]] ''[[Corvus]]'')}}

===Hebrew Bible and Judaism===
[[Image:Herb Slepowron.jpg|thumb|right|A raven on the coat-of-arms of the [[Poles|Polish]] aristocratic [[Ślepowron coat of arms|Clan Ślepowron]], to which [[Kazimierz Pułaski]] belonged]]

The raven (Hebrew: עֹרֵב; Greek: κόραξ) is the first species of bird to be mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;See H. B. Tristram, [https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00trisuoft Natural History Bible] (9th ed.; London: Society Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1898), 198.&lt;/ref&gt; and ravens are mentioned on numerous occasions thereafter. In the [[Book of Genesis]], Noah releases a raven from the ark after the great flood to test whether the waters have receded (Gen. 8:6-7). According to the Law of Moses, ravens are forbidden for food (Leviticus 11:15; Deuteronomy 14:14), a fact that may have colored the perception of ravens in later sources. In the [[Book of Judges]], one of Kings of the [[Midian]]ites defeated by [[Gideon]] is called "[[Orev]]" (עורב) which means "Raven". In the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] 17:4-6, God commands the ravens to feed the prophet [[Elijah]]. [[King Solomon]] is described as having hair as black as a raven in the [[Song of Songs]] 5:11. Ravens are an example of God's gracious provision for all his creatures in Psalm 147:9 and Job 38:41. (In the [[New Testament]] as well, ravens are used by [[Jesus]] as an illustration of God's provision in [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 12:24.)

[[Philo of Alexandria]] (first century AD), who interpreted the Bible allegorically, stated that Noah's raven was a symbol of vice, whereas the dove was a symbol of virtue (Questions and Answers on Genesis 2:38).

In the [[Talmud]], the raven is described as having been only one of three beings on [[Noah's Ark]] that copulated during the flood and so was punished.&lt;ref name=Sanhedrin&gt;Sanhedrin, 108b&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabbis believed that the male raven was forced to ejaculate his seed into the female raven's mouth as a means of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;b. Sanhedrin 108b. According to the Icelandic ''[[Landnámabók]]''—a story similar to Noah and the Ark -- [[Hrafna-Flóki Vilgerðarson]] used ravens to guide his ship from the Faroe Islands to Iceland.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] (chapter 25) explains that the reason the raven Noah released from the ark did not return to him was that the raven was feeding on the corpses of those who drowned in the flood.&lt;ref&gt;This tradition is also preserved in the Byzantine composition ''Palaea Historica''. See David Flusser, "''Palaea Historica'' An Unknown Source of Biblical Legends," ''Scripta Hieroslymitana'' 22 (1971): 48-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late antiquity and Christian Middle Ages===
[[Image:LSB.png|thumb|The ravens on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]] recall the story of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent]]'s ravens.]]
According to the legend of the fourth-century Iberian Christian [[martyr]] Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]], after St. Vincent was executed, ravens protected his body from being devoured by wild animals, until his followers could recover the body. His body was taken to what is now known as [[Cape St. Vincent]] in southern Portugal. A shrine was erected over his grave, which continued to be guarded by flocks of ravens. The Arab [[geographer]] [[Al-Idrisi]] noted this constant guard by ravens, for which the place was named by him كنيسة الغراب "Kanīsah al-Ghurāb" (Church of the Raven). King  [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139–1185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to [[Lisbon]], still accompanied by the ravens. This transfer of the relics is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Lisbon]].

A raven is also said to have protected [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]] by taking away a loaf of bread poisoned by jealous monks after he blessed it.

In the legends about the German Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], depicting him as [[King in the mountain|sleeping]]  along with his knights in a cave in the [[Kyffhäuser]] mountain in [[Thuringia]] or the [[Untersberg]] in Bavaria, it is told that when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness. According to the story, the Emperor's eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R. A., ''The Origins of Modern Europe'', Boydell Press, 1972, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East / Islamic culture ===
In [[Cain and Abel in Islam|the Qur'an's version of the story of Cain and Abel]], a raven is mentioned as the creature who taught Cain how to bury his murdered brother, in [[Al-Ma'ida]] (The Repast) 5:31. {Surah 5:27-31}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/105271/religion/the_raven_in_bible_and_quran.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Manuscript Odinn.jpg|thumb|An illustration from an 18th-century Icelandic manuscript depicting [[Huginn and Muninn]] sitting on the shoulders of [[Odin]].]]
To the [[Germanic peoples]], [[Odin]] was often associated with ravens. Examples include depictions of figures often identified as Odin appear flanked with two birds on a 6th-century [[bracteate]] and on a 7th-century helmet plate from [[Vendel]], Sweden. In later [[Norse mythology]], Odin is depicted as having two ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]] serving as his eyes and ears &amp;ndash; Huginn being referred to as ''thought'' and Muninn as ''memory''. Each day the ravens fly out from [[Hliðskjálf]] and bring Odin news from [[Midgard]].

The [[Old English language|Old English]] word for a raven was ''hræfn''; in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] it was ''hrafn''; the word was frequently used in combinations as a [[kenning]] for bloodshed and battle.

The raven was a common device used by the [[Viking]]s. [[Ragnar Lothbrok]] had a [[raven banner]] called ''Reafan'', embroidered with the device of a raven. It was said that if this banner fluttered, Lothbrok would carry the day, but if it hung lifeless the battle would be lost. King [[Harald Hardrada]] also had a raven banner, called ''Landeythan'' (land-waster). The bird also appears in the folklore of the [[Isle of Man]], a former [[Viking]] colony, and it is used as a symbol on their [[Coat of arms of the Isle of Man|coat of arms]].

===Insular Celtic traditions===
[[File:Cuchulain_at_GPO.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sheppard]]'s sculpture of Cú Chulainn at the Dublin GPO]]

In [[Irish mythology]] ravens are associated with warfare and the battleground in the figures of [[Badb]] and [[Morrígan]]. The goddess [[Morrígan]] alighted on the hero [[Cú Chulainn]]'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death.&lt;ref&gt;"The Death of Cu Chulainn". [http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/cuchulain3.html Celtic Literature Collective].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ravens were also associated with the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] god [[Bran the Blessed]] (the brother of [[Branwen]]), whose name translates to "raven." According to the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', Bran's head was buried in the White Hill of London as a talisman against invasion.&lt;ref&gt;"Branwen daughter of Llŷr". The ''[[Four Branches of the Mabinogi]]''. Trans. for example by Patrick K. Ford, ''The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He is depicted as giant and the [[King of the Britons]] in tale known as the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Second Branch]] of the ''[[Mabinogi]]''. Several other characters in Welsh mythology share his name, and ravens figure prominently in the 12th or 13th century text ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'', as the army of [[King Arthur]]'s knight [[Owain mab Urien|Owain]].

===England===
According to legend, the [[Kingdom of England]] will fall if [[the ravens of the Tower of London]] are removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/TowerOfLondon.htm |title=The Tower of London |accessdate=2007-03-03 |work=AboutBritain.com |quote=...legend has it that, if they leave, the kingdom will fall.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been thought that there have been at least six ravens in residence at the tower for centuries. It was said that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered their removal following complaints from [[John Flamsteed]], the Royal Astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camelotintl.com/tower_site/ravens/index.html Camelot Village: Tower of London]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not removed because Charles was then told of the legend. Charles, following the time of the [[English Civil War]], superstition or not, was not prepared to take the chance, and instead had the observatory moved to [[Greenwich]].

[[Image:London tower ravens.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ravens of the Tower of London|Ravens in the Tower of London]]]]

The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture in the newspaper ''The Pictorial World'' in 1883 &lt;ref&gt;[[Boria Sax]], "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g403631820626r25/ How Ravens Came to the Tower of London]", ''[[Society and Animals]]'' 15, no. 3 (2007b), pp. 272-274.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a poem and illustration published the same year in the children's book ''London Town''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Felix Leigh |first1=Thomas Crane &amp; Ellen Houghton |title=London Town |date=1883 |publisher=Marcus Ward &amp; Co. |pages=8-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/London_Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and scattered subsequent references, both literary and visual, which appear in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, place them near the monument commemorating those beheaded at the tower, popularly known as the "scaffold." This strongly suggests that the ravens, which are notorious for gathering at gallows, were originally used to dramatize tales of imprisonment and execution at the tower told to tourists by the [[Yeomen Warders]].&lt;ref&gt;Boria Sax, "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g403631820626r25/ How Ravens Came to the Tower of London]", Society and Animals 15, no. 3 (2007b), pp. 270-281.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the original ravens were donated to the tower by the [[Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Earls of Dunraven]],&lt;ref name="GuardianNov2004"&gt;{{cite news |first=Maev |last=Kennedy |title=Tower's Raven Mythology May Be a Victorian Flight of Fantasy |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 15, 2004 |page=1 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/15/britishidentity.artsandhumanities }}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because of their association with the Celtic raven-god Bran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Boria |last=Sax |url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/pom/article/view/3325 |title=Medievalism, Paganism, and the Tower Ravens |journal=The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=71–73 |doi=10.1558/pome.v9i1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; However wild ravens, which were once abundant in London and often seen around meat markets (such as nearby [[Eastcheap]]) foraging for scraps, could have roosted at the Tower in earlier times.&lt;ref name="jerome"&gt;Jerome, Fiona. ''Tales from the Tower'': 2006. pp. 148-9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, most of the Tower's ravens perished through shock during bombing raids, leaving only a mated pair named "Mabel" and "Grip." Shortly before the Tower reopened to the public, Mabel flew away, leaving Grip despondent. A couple of weeks later, Grip also flew away, probably in search of his mate. The incident was reported in several newspapers, and some of the stories contained the first references in print to the legend that the [[British Empire]] would fall if the ravens left the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sax |first=Boria |doi=10.1080/15505340.2010.504413 |title=The Tower Ravens: Invented Tradition, Fakelore, or Modern Myth |journal=Storytelling, Self, and Society |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Empire was dismantled shortly afterward, those who are superstitious might interpret events as a confirmation of the legend. Before the tower reopened to the public on 1 January 1946, care was taken to ensure that a new set of ravens was in place.&lt;ref name="GuardianNov2004" /&gt;

=== Serbian Epic Poetry ===
Ravens appear as stock characters in several traditional [[Serbian epic poems]]. Like in many other cultures, the raven is associated with death - more specifically with an aftermath of a bloody or significant battle. Ravens often appear in pairs and play the role of harbingers of tragic news, usually announcing death of a hero or a group of heroes. They tend to appear in combination with female characters as receivers of the news. Usually, a mother or a wife of a hero will be notified about the hero's death by a visit from a pair of ravens. Sometimes, these are treated as supernatural creatures capable of communicating with humans that report about events directly. Alternatively, these are ordinary birds bringing along scavenged body parts, such as a hand or a finger with a ring, by which the fate of the hero will be recognised. Most notable examples of this pattern can be found in songs "Car Lazar i Carica Milica" (Tsar Lazar and Tsarina Militsa) and "Boj na Mišaru" (Battle of Mishar).

===Hindu / South Asia===
[[File:Dhumavati.JPG|thumb|Goddess [[Dhumavati]] riding a crow.]]
In the ''[[Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasistha#Section Six: On Liberation|Story of Bhusunda]]'', a chapter of the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', a very old sage in the form of a crow, Bhusunda, recalls a succession of epochs in the earth's history, as described in [[Hindu cosmology]]. He survived several destructions, living on a [[Kalpavriksha|wish-fulfilling tree]] on [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref name="cole-hindu-zoro"&gt;Cole, Juan R.I. ''[http://bahaistudies.net/hindu_zoro.html Baha'u'llah on Hinduism and Zoroastrianism: The Tablet to Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Concerning the Questions of Manakji Limji Hataria]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Crows are also considered ancestors in [[Hinduism]] and during [[Śrāddha]] the practice of offering food or [[Pinda (riceball)|pinda]] to crows is still in vogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2001/07/26/stories/13261289.htm |title=It's a crow's day | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=2001-07-26 | accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu]] deity [[Shani]] is often represented as being mounted on a giant black raven or crow.&lt;ref&gt;Mythology of the Hindus By Charles Coleman p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The crow (sometimes a raven or vulture) is Shani's [[Vahana]]. As protector of property, Shani is able to repress the thieving tendencies of these birds.

The raven is the [[national bird]] of [[Bhutan]], and it adorns the royal hat, representing the deity Gonpo Jarodonchen ([[Mahakala]]) with a Raven's head; one of the important guardian deities.

{{main article|Raven Tales}}
[[File:Raven in Cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|A raven in a [[cemetery]]. Because they are [[scavengers]], ravens have been associated with [[death]].]]

The raven also has a prominent role in the mythologies of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], including the [[Tsimishian]]s, [[Haida people|Haida]]s, [[Heiltsuk]]s, [[Tlingit]]s, [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]], [[Koyukon]]s, and [[Inuit]]. The raven in these indigenous peoples' mythology is the [[Creator deity|Creator of the world]], but it is also considered a [[trickster]] god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For instance, in [[Tlingit people|Tlingit culture]], there are two different raven characters which can be identified, although they are not always clearly differentiated. One is the creator raven, responsible for bringing the world into being and who is sometimes considered to be the individual who brought light to the darkness. The other is the childish raven, always selfish, sly, conniving, and hungry. When the Great Spirit created all things he kept them separate and stored in cedar boxes. The Great Spirit gifted these boxes to the animals who existed before humans. When the animals opened the boxes all the things that comprise the world came into being. The boxes held such things as mountains, fire, water, wind and seeds for all the plants. One such box, which was given to Seagull, contained all the light of the world. Seagull coveted his box and refused to open it, clutching it under his wing. All the people asked Raven to persuade Seagull to open it and release the light. Despite begging, demanding, flattering and trying to trick him into opening the box, Seagull still refused. Finally Raven became angry and frustrated, and stuck a thorn in Seagull's foot. Raven pushed the thorn in deeper until the pain caused Seagull to drop the box. Then out of the box came the sun, moon and stars that brought light to the world and allowed the first day to begin.

[[Bill Reid]] created the sculpture of ''The Raven and The First Men'' depicting a scene from a [[Haida people|Haida]] myth that unifies the Raven as both the [[trickster]] and the [[Creator deity|creator]]. According to this myth, the raven who was both bored and well fed, found and freed some creatures trapped in a [[clam]]. These scared and timid beings were the first men of the world, and they were coaxed out of the clam shell by the raven. Soon the raven was bored with these creatures and planned to return them to their shell. Instead, the raven decided to search for the female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a [[chiton]], freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The raven, always known as a [[trickster]], was responsible for the pairing of humans and felt very protective of them. With the Raven perceived as the [[Creator deity|creator]], many [[Haida people|Haida]] myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind.

Another raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.

One ancient story told on [[Haida Gwaii]] tells about how Raven helped to bring the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fresh Water, and Fire to the world:&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ella E.: ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'', [[University of California Press]], 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Long ago, near the beginning of the world, Gray Eagle was the guardian of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of fresh water, and of fire. Gray Eagle hated people so much that he kept these things hidden. People lived in darkness, without fire and without fresh water.

Gray Eagle had a beautiful daughter, and Raven fell in love with her. In the beginning, Raven was a snow-white bird, and as a such, he pleased Gray Eagle's daughter. She invited him to her father's longhouse.

When Raven saw the Sun, Moon and stars, and fresh water hanging on the sides of Eagle's lodge, he knew what he should do. He watched for his chance to seize them when no one was looking. He stole all of them, and a brand of fire also, and flew out of the longhouse through the smoke hole. As soon as Raven got outside he hung the Sun up in the sky. It made so much light that he was able to fly far out to an island in the middle of the ocean. When the Sun set, he fastened the Moon up in the sky and hung the stars around in different places. By this new light he kept on flying, carrying with him the fresh water and the brand of fire he had stolen.

He flew back over the land. When he had reached the right place, he dropped all the water he had stolen. It fell to the ground and there became the source of all the fresh-water streams and lakes in the world. Then Raven flew on, holding the brand of fire in his bill. The smoke from the fire blew back over his white feathers and made them black. When his bill began to burn, he had to drop the firebrand. It struck rocks and hid itself within them. That is why, if you strike two stones together, sparks of fire will drop out.

Raven's feathers never became white again after they were blackened by the smoke from the firebrand. That is why Raven is now a black bird.}}

Other notable stories tell of the Raven stealing and releasing the sun, and of the Raven tempting the first humans out of a clam shell. Another story of the Kwakiutl or [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] of [[British Columbia]] who exposed boys' placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions, thereby associating the raven with prophecy, similar to the traditions of [[Scandinavia]].

In one legend Raven transformed himself into a pine needle which is swallowed by the unmarried daughter of the owner of the box of daylight, who then becomes pregnant and gives birth to Raven in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/singere/fakelore.html|title=Fakelore, Multiculturalism, and the Ethics of Children's Literature|last=Singer|first=Eliot A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article |Kutkh}}

The raven god or spirit [[Kutcha]] (or [[Kutkh]], ({{lang|ru|Кутх}})) is important in the shamanic tradition of the [[Koryaks]] and other indigenous [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] peoples of the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|title=Meeting the New Shamans|last=Mann, PhD|first=Rachel|date=February 26, 2009|work=MettaKnowledge for Peace|publisher=Rachel Mann, PhD|accessdate=14 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305050047/http://www.mettaknowledge.com/archives/meeting-the-new-white-shamans|archivedate=5 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turk|first=Jon|title=The Raven's Gift: A Scientist, a Shaman, and Their Remarkable Journey Through the Siberian Wilderness|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Raven_s_Gift.html?id=O-NOd4Kz1EwC&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=2010|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=1429964707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kutcha is traditionally revered in various forms by various  peoples and appears in many legends: as a key figure in [[Creation myth|creation]], as a fertile [[ancestor]] of mankind, as a mighty [[Shamanism|shaman]] and as a [[trickster]]. He is a popular subject of the [[Animism|animist]] stories of the [[Chukchi people]] and plays a central role in the mythology of the [[Koryaks]] and [[Itelmens]] of [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. Many of the stories regarding Kutkh are similar to those of the Raven among the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], indicating a long history of indirect cultural contact between Asian and North American peoples.

Two ravens or crows, flying over the warrior's head in battle, symbolised in [[Yakut people|Yakut]] mythology the Ilbis Kyyha and Ohol Uola, two evil spirits of war and violence. Some other gods or spirits in yakut [[shamanism]], including Uluu Suorun Toyon and Uluutuar Uluu Toyon, are described as "great raven of cloudy sky".

His kagune (main predatory organ), is in an ukaku configuration, meaning its placement is above the shoulder blades, resembling the wings of a bird. They are also the only kagune revealed in the series to be pitch black, identical to a raven. Lastly, as with all ghouls, Yomo wears a mask to hide his identity. His mask resembles that of a raven's beak, and is colored black.
* In the ''[[On the Fastrack]]'' [[comic strip]], the [[Goth]] woman, Dethany Dendrobia, has a pet raven named "Lenore" in reference to the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] poem.  Lenore is a recurring character and appears quite frequently, interacting with Dethany and other characters in the strip.

'''Dharma-dharmatā-vibhāga'''(Chinese:辩法与法性论） (''Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being'') is a short [[Yogācāra]] work, attributed to [[Maitreya-nātha]], which discusses the distinction and correlation (''vibhāga'') between [[phenomena]] (''[[dharma]]'') and [[reality]] (''[[Dharmata|dharmatā]]''); the work exists in both a prose and a verse version and survives only in [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] translation.  However, the [[Sanskrit]] original was reported to exist in [[Tibet]] during the 1930s by the [[India]]n Buddhologist and explorer, [[Rahul Sankrityayan]].

==In English translation==
The Dharmadharmata-vibhaga was translated into English by Jim Scott in 2004&lt;ref&gt;''Maitreya's Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being: Commentary by Mipham.'' by Jim Scott with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. Snow Lion Publications. Ithica: 2004.  {{ISBN|1-55939-215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6958">'''Dinka mythology''' refers to the traditional religion and folk tales of the [[Dinka people|Dinka]], or Muonyjang, ethnic group of [[South Sudan]].

== Creation ==
The supreme, creator god, [[Nhialic]], is the god of the sky and rain, and the ruler of all the spirits.&lt;ref name="p 29"&gt;Lienhardt,  p 29&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to be present in all of creation, and to control the destiny of every human, plant and animal on Earth. Nhialic is also known as Jaak, Juong or Dyokin by other [[Nilotic people|Nilotic groups]] such as the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Nhialac created [[Ex nihilo|ex-nihilo]] and rarely involves itself with the affairs of humans.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1|last=Leeming|first=David|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=December 18, 2009|isbn=978-1598841749|edition=2nd|location=|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of the Dinka creation myth which mainly concerns itself with the creations of humans. The first humans are Garang and Abuk. In some cases Nhialac created humans by blowing them out of its nose, other accounts say humans originated from the sky and were placed in the river where they came as fully formed adults. Other accounts say that humans were molded as clay figures and placed to mature in pots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Garang and Abuk were made out of the clay of [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion, Volume 1|last=|first=|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|date=November 26, 2008|isbn=978-1412936361|editors=Asante, Molefi Mazama, Ama|edition=1st|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nhialac told them to multiply and that their children would die but would come back to life within 15 days. Garang protested that if nobody dies permanently then there won't be enough food. Nhialac then introduced permanent death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nhialac commanded them to only plant one seed of grain a day or gave them one grain to eat a day.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Being hungry everyday Abuk made a paste with the grain to make it last more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However when Abuk disobeyed and planted more Nhialac cut the rope that connected Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Pantheon==
The Dinka have a pantheon of deities.

[[Dengdit]] or Deng, is the sky god of rain and fertility, empowered by Nhialic.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhardt, p 104&lt;/ref&gt; Deng's mother is [[Abuk]], the patron goddess of gardening and all women, represented by a snake.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhardt, p 90&lt;/ref&gt; Garang, another deity, is believed or assumed by some Dinka to be a god suppressed by Deng whose spirits can cause most Dinka women, and some men, to scream. The term "Jok" refers to a group of ancestral spirits.

== Invocation of Prayer ==
The Dinka address their prayers first to the Supreme Being Nhialic then invoke other deities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paths to the Divine: Ancient and Indian|last=George|first=Vensus|publisher=Council for Research in Values &amp; Philosophy|date=June 15, 2008|isbn=978-1565182486|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dinka offer prayers for receiving mild weather. They also pray for good harvest, protection of people and cattle recovery form illness and good hunting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sacrifices of a bull or ox are offered to Nhialic. The Dinka perform sacrifices along with prayers. The invokes all clan-divinities, free-divinities and ancestral spirits and at times Nhialic. Those who are saying the prayers hold a fishing spear in their hands. Short phrases expressing the need are chanted while the spear is thrusted at the animal to be sacrificed. The participants repeat the words of the leader. At times of crisis or an important occasion the Dinka will continue to pray and sacrifice for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Stages of sacrificial prayer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1.    The Leader describes the issue the people are facing.

2.    The Leader and all present Acknowledge past sins.

3.    Praise is offered singing hymns of honor or ox-songs.

4.    Expulsion of the misfortune to the sacrificial animal.

== Animism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The Dinka are also animists. Dinka inherit a totem from both their parents. The faithful are expected to make offerings to their totem force and maintain positive relations with members. Eating or hurting your totem animal is a bad omen for those who share a totem. Some totems are believed to endow powers. The owl totem, for example, is believed to give the power of providence. Totems are not exclusively animals, although most are; some Dinka are related ores and elements.

In the Dinka language, a totem is known as a ''kuar''. Dinka do not worship their totems but rather speak of being "related" to them. The case of a snake relationship is described below.

=== Snakes ===
Some Dinka people respect [[African puff adder]]s. The most commonly respected snakes are Atemyath, Biar keroor, and Maluang. These snakes are given local made molten cheese to appease them, after which they are released into the forest. Killing these snakes is believed to be a bad omen for the community or the individual, with the assumption that spirits may strike the killer.

'''The Directory for Masses with Children''' implemented the directive of bishops at the [[Second Vatican Council]] to make the Roman [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Eucharistic [[liturgy]] a more [[Sacrosanctum Concilium#Participation of he laity|participatory]] and comprehensible experience for all the faithful. Planning for this directory began at the first [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)#Ordinary General|Synod of Bishops]] in Rome in 1967, which entrusted the work to the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments|Congregation for Divine Worship]]. It was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on November 1, 1973.

==Salient features==
===Introduction=== 
The Directory pertains to preadolescent children,(6) presumably under ten, and explains that since children are profoundly formed by the religious experience of infancy and early childhood. we “may fear spiritual harm if over the years children repeatedly experience in the Church things that are barely comprehensible.”(2)  Also, speaking of today, “the circumstances in which children grow up are not favorable to their spiritual progress” and some parents are not fulfilling the promises made at their child’s baptism.(1)
===Chapter I===
Here are listed human values that children should experience in the Eucharistic celebration according to their stage of development: "community activity, exchange of greetings, capacity to listen and to seek and grant pardon, expression of gratitude, experience of symbolic actions, a meal of friendship, and festive celebration."(9) The objective is the same as for adults, "active, conscious, and authentic participation." There is special emphasis on conveying the meaning of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)#Roman Rite of the Catholic Church|Eucharistic prayer]], with the Directory recommending three times that children take part by acclamations of gratitude and praise, including sung acclamations, during the prayer.(12,30,52) In 1974 the [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy]] produced three Eucharistic prayers especially for children; two of these have acclamations interspersed throughout the prayer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Eucharistic Prayers for Masses with Children| url =http://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/EPC1-3.htm

  | title = Eucharistic Prayers for Masses with Children | publisher = CTS
  | location = London | date = May 1, 2014  | isbn = 9781860829215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter II ===
When some children are present at adult [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]], "great care" should be taken that the children not feel neglected. They should be addressed directly at the beginning and end of Mass and at some point in the homily,(17) perhaps have the whole homily addressed to them in a way that adults may also benefit,(19) or might have their own Liturgy of the Word in a nearby room.(17) Also, where the [[bishop]] permits, some adaptations described in Chapter III may be employed in adult Masses with children present.(19)

===Chapter III===
At children’s Masses in which only a few adults participate, “the principles of active and conscious participation are in a sense even more significant.” Suggestions include involving them in the preparation and in ministries during the Mass as much as possible,(22) freer use of introductory comments,(23) and insertion of motives for giving thanks before the priest begins the dialogue of the preface.(22) A suitable adult may be invited to give the homily, and it is noted that a variety of voices helps keep children from becoming bored.(24)  Singing, of “great importance in all celebrations, (is) especially encouraged in every way for Masses celebrated with children.”(30) Recorded music may also be used in children's Masses.(32) 

The introductory rite should give them a sense of coming together as one community.(40) Introductory comments should precede the readings and help the children to listen better and more fruitfully.(47) In 2013 the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] produced a simplified lectionary covering all Masses with children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =USCCB | first = | title =Lectionary for Masses with Children | publisher =Catholic Book Publishing Company  | date =2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sometimes the homily intended for children should become a dialogue with them."(48) "If only a single reading is chosen, there may be singing after the homily."(46) Consistent with the General Ritual where the union of voices conveys the deeper meaning of the bread,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =General Instruction of the Roman Missal
| url =http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/| accessdate =September 17, 2015|location=86 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; there should be singing during the communion procession.(54) Before being dismissed the children need a brief repetition and application of what they have heard, expressing the connection between the liturgy and life.(54)

A performance of the dance features sixteen masked male dancers and ten musicians. The dancers wear monastic robes and wooden masks with features of animals, both real and mythical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The musicians play "cymbals, trumpets and drums, including the ''bang nga'', a large cylindrical drum, the ''lag nga'', a small hand-held circular flat drum, and the ''nga chen'', a drum beaten with a bent drumstick."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They first perform a prayer dance in the ''soeldep cham'', the main shrine, before appearing one by one in the courtyard of the monastery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dance has two parts: a calm, contemplative part to represent the peaceful deities, and a rapid, athletic part for the wrathful ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Performances of the dance have been conducted for almost five centuries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the late nineteenth century, the dance started spreading to other parts of Bhutan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Today, it is approaching to be something of a national dance for the country, representing the identity of the Bhutanese nation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The dance was inscribed in the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2008, though it was originally proclaimed in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The original proclamation notes "the number of practitioners is dwindling due to the lack of rehearsal time, the absence of a systematic mechanism to train and honour the dancers and musicians and the gradual decrease in interest among young people."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/06apa_uk.htm|title=The Mask Dance of the Drums from Drametse|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Language and Culture Studies (Bhutan)|Institute of Language and Culture Studies]] at the [[Royal University of Bhutan]] coordinated and implemented a project to preserve and promote the dance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilcs.edu.bt/?page_id=172|title=Research at the Institute of Language and Culture Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute of Language and Culture Studies|publisher=|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was funded by the [[Japan]]ese Funds-in-Trust for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, through UNESCO.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.emb-japan.go.jp/htm/d_ich_drametse.htm|title=Japan finances the project "Safeguarding of the Drametse Ngacham"|website=www.unesco.emb-japan.go.jp|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved strengthening the training capacities of the monastery, compiling existing documentation, recording videos of the dance, researching its history, and promotional activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A result of the project was a book about the dance written in English and [[Dzongkha]] and an accompanying film.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=དགྲ་མེད་རྩེ་རྔ་འཆམ། Drametse Ngacham|last=|first=|publisher=Institute of Language and Culture Studies, Semtokha, Royal University of Bhutan|year=2009|isbn=978-99936-771-0-9|location=Semtokha, Bhutan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious [[paradigm]] of 17th-century England, which was [[Roman Catholic]] when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the "vile pop'ry" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of [[Protestant]] liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacCubbin |first1=Robert P. |last2=Hamilton-Phillips |first2=Martha |last3=College of William and Mary|last4=Grolier Club|last5=Folger Shakespeare Library|date=1990 |title=The Age of William III &amp; Mary II: Power, Politics and Patronage, 1688-1702 : A Reference Encyclopedia and Exhibition Catalogue |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |isbn=0962208108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant copies of the ballad are available at [[Magdelene College]] in the [[Pepys Library]].

The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is "seated on the throne": "The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the "[[Whore of Babylon|Babylonian Dame]]" mentioned in these lines, was [[English Reformation|once again no longer the official religion of England]]. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: "May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing."

==Form==
The ballad is broken up into eight [[:wikt:octet|octets]] with varying [[rhyme scheme]]s. For instance, the first stanza has an ''AA BB CCC B'' rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an ''AAA B CCC B'' rhyme scheme.

{{Hinduism by country}}

[[Hinduism]] is a minor religion in [[Croatia]].

There has been a longstanding tradition of interest in Indology among Croatian scholars and also a great interest in Indian culture among the Croats.

The Carmelite monk Paulinus a Sancto Bartolomaeo, a Croat, who was known as Filip Vesdin, stayed at the Court of the Maharaja of [[Travancore]] between 1776 and 1789. He pioneered Indological studies and wrote several books on Indian culture and Indo-European languages, including a book on Sanskrit grammar. This was the first book on Sanskrit grammar to be published in Europe. His books stimulated further interest and research on Indian culture.

The Department of Indology of the University of [[Zagreb]] celebrated its 250th birth anniversary by holding a seminar on 17 December 1998. Croatia established the Centre for Indology at [[Zagreb University]] in 1962, which has been very active and extremely popular. 50-60 students study Indology, which includes learning of Hindi/Sanskrit. Cultural functions/receptions are organized by the Embassy of [[India]] to celebrate "Hindi Day"' each year.

==Hinduism in Croatia==
Hinduism spread to Croatia by [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[Yoga in Daily Life]].

==ISKCON in Croatia==
[[ISKCON]] is officially recognized in Croatia, with nine centres.

Croatian government gave 500 square meters of space in the centre of Zagreb for Hare Krishna humanitarian work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14332&amp;sec=59&amp;con=41 WWRNews]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundredsegu

==Society==
A [[Croat-Indian Society]] set up in June 1994 has been active in organizing social and cultural events including classical dance performances, animation films based on Indian mythology, various documentaries on India and its traditions. An Agreement of Cooperation was signed between the Diplomatic Academy of Croatia and the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi in January 2000. Seven Croatian diplomats have attended the Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats (PCFD) at FSI, New Delhi. Shri Santosh Kumar, Secretary &amp; Dean (FSI) attended the conference of Deans at Dubrovnik, Croatia, on 29–30 September 2003.

==Croatians' interest in Learning Hindi==
Three Croatian students were granted scholarship to study [[Hindi language]] for a year with the Kendriya Hindi Sansthan, [[Agra]], in the academic year 2002–03 and another three in 2003-04. Two Indian students came to Croatia during 2001 and 2002 to study [[Croatian language]]. Indian [[Embassy]] conducted Hindi classes from September 1997 to June 2001. Croatian language is being taught at the [[University of Delhi]]. The Embassy had nominated the Assistant Professor teaching Hindi in the [[Zagreb University]] to attend the Regional Hindi Conference held in [[Budapest]] in 2002 and [[Bucharest]] in July 2004.

==Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Puranas==
As many as 29 leading Sanskrit scholars from all over the world attended the Third Dubrovnik International Conference on the [[Sanskrit]] [[Epic poetry|Epics]] and [[Puranas]] (DICSEP3) at Dubrovnik from 2 to 7 September 2002 under the auspices of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. Earlier, DICSEP 1 &amp; DICSEP 2 were held in August 1997 and August 1999. The next conference is scheduled for 5–10 September 2005.The Fifth Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Puranas is scheduled from 11 to 16 August 2008. The common theme of the year 2008 will be "Exchanges between the Sanskrit epic and Purànic traditions and non-Brahmanical texts and traditions". It will include comparative studies on Brahmanism / Hinduism and [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]], studies on intertextual relationships between these traditions and their texts, and will offer yet another, less investigated framework for understanding the Sanskrit epics and Purànas and their impact on the whole of the Indian culture: literatures, religions and textual traditions. So far the Proceedings of the first 3 conferences have been published in [[English language|English]] by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the 1st conference proceedings alone being brought out in India by [[Munshiram Manoharlal]].
It is curious that not a single scholar from India has attended any of these conferences.

==Indian Community in Croatia==
The Indian Community in Croatia is small in size. There are around thirteen families in Croatia.

{{Calvinism}}
'''Huguenots''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|ɡ|ə|n|ɒ|t|,_|-|n|oʊ|}}; {{lang-fr|Les huguenots}} {{IPA-fr|yɡ(ə)no|}}) are an [[ethnoreligious group]] of [[French people|French]] [[Protestants]] who follow the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]].

The term has its origin in [[Early modern France|early 16th century France]]. It was frequently used in reference to those of the [[Reformed Church of France]] from the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Huguenots were French Protestants who held to the Reformed tradition of Protestantism, while the populations of [[Alsace]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] and [[Montbéliard]] were mainly [[German people|German]] [[Lutheran|Lutherans]]. In his ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Hans Hillerbrand claimed that on the eve of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572, the Huguenot community included as much as 10% of the French population, but it declined to 7–8% by around 1600 and even further after the return of [[Persecution of Protestants|heavy persecution]] in 1685 with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].

Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and western parts of the [[Kingdom of France]]. As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, [[Catholic]] hostility grew. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The Huguenots were led by [[Jeanne d'Albret]], her son, the future [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (who would later convert to Catholicism to become king) and the princes of Condé. The wars ended with the [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.

[[Huguenot rebellions]] in the 1620s prompted the abolition of their political and military privileges. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who gradually increased persecution of Protestantism until he issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (1685), ultimately ending any legal recognition of [[Protestantism in France]] and forcing the Huguenots to either convert or flee in a wave of violent [[dragonnades]]. Louis XIV laid claim that the French Huguenot population was reduced from about 800,000 to 900,000 adherents down to just 1,000 to 1,500; although he overexaggerated the reduction, the dragonnades certainly were devastating for the French Protestant community. Nevertheless, the remaining Huguenots faced [[Persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV|continued persecution under Louis XV]]. At the time of Louis XV's death in 1774, Calvinism had been nearly eliminated from France. Persecution of Protestants officially ended with the [[Edict of Versailles]], signed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1787. Two years later, with the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789, Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.&lt;ref name="Aston, 2000 pp 245-50"&gt;Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780–1804'' (2000) pp 245–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Huguenot émigrés relocated to Protestant states such as [[England and Wales]], the [[Channel Islands]], [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] and [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Duchy of Prussia]], as well as majority Catholic but Protestant-controlled [[Ireland]]. They also fled to the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] in [[South Africa]], the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Caribbean]], [[New Netherland]] and several of the [[13 colonies|English colonies]] in North America. A few families also went to [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Russia]] and Catholic [[Quebec]].

By now, most Huguenots have been assimilated into various societies and cultures, but remnant communities of [[Camisards]] in the [[Cévennes]], most Reformed members of the [[United Protestant Church of France]], French members of the largely German [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] and the Huguenot [[diaspora]] in England and [[French Australian|Australia]] all still retain their beliefs and Huguenot designation.

==Etymology==
[[File:Huguenot cross.svg|thumb|[[Huguenot cross]]]]
A term used originally in derision, ''Huguenot'' has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician [[Besançon Hugues]] (died 1532) and the [[Reformation in Switzerland|religiously conflicted]] nature of [[Early Modern Switzerland|Swiss republicanism]] in his time, using a clever derogatory [[pun]] on the name ''Hugues'' by way of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''Huisgenoten'' (literally ''housemates''), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German ''[[Eidgenosse]]'' (''Confederates'' as in "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy").&lt;ref name="EB11"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed, Frank Puaux, ''Huguenot''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geneva]] was [[John Calvin]]'s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In [[Geneva]], Hugues, though [[Catholic]], was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the [[Duke of Savoy]] through an [[Military alliance|alliance]] between the city-state of [[Geneva]] and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]]. The label ''Huguenot'' was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the [[Amboise plot]] of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential and [[Catholic League (French)|zealously Catholic]] [[House of Guise]]. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, ''Hugues'' plus ''Eidgenosse'' by way of ''Huisgenoten'' supposedly became ''Huguenot,'' a nickname associating the [[Protestant]] cause with politics unpopular in France.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A version of this complex hypothesis is promoted by O.I.A. Roche, who writes in his book, ''The Days of the Upright, A History of the Huguenots'' (1965), that "Huguenot" is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a combination of a Dutch and a German word. In the [[French Flanders|Dutch-speaking North of France]], Bible students who [[House church|gathered in each other's houses to study secretly]] were called ''Huis Genooten'' ('housemates') while on the Swiss and German borders they were termed ''Eid Genossen,'' or 'oath fellows,' that is, persons bound to each other by an [[oath]]. Gallicised into 'Huguenot', often used deprecatingly, the word became, during two and a half centuries of terror and triumph, a badge of enduring honour and courage."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The "Hugues hypothesis" argues that the name was derived by association with [[Hugh Capet|Hugues Capet, king of France]],&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite book |first=Janet G. |last=Gray |title=The Origin of the Word Huguenot |journal=[[Sixteenth Century Journal]] |volume=14 |year=1983 |issue=3 |pages=349–359 |jstor=2540193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicans as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name ''huguenote'' would be roughly equivalent to ''little Hugos'', or ''those who want Hugo''.&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt;

In this last connection, the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship; popular fancy held that ''Huguon,'' the gate of [[King Hugo]], was haunted by the ghost of ''le roi Huguet'' (regarded by Roman Catholics as an infamous scoundrel) and other spirits, who instead of being in [[purgatory]] came back to harm the living at night.&lt;ref name="CathEnc_Huguenot"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07527b.htm Antoine Dégert, "Huguenots"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this place in [[Tours]] that the ''prétendus réformés'' ("these supposedly 'reformed'") habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing [[psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huguenot.netnation.com/general/huguenot.htm "Who Were the Huguenots?"], The National Huguenot Society&lt;/ref&gt; Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in ''De l'Estat de France'' offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by ''The Cape Monthly'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The origin of the name is curious; it is not from the German ''Eidegenossen'' as has been supposed. Reguier de la Plancha accounts for it as follows: — "The name ''huguenand'' was given to those of the religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retail it ever since. I'll say a word about it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called ''le moine bourré''; at Orleans, ''le mulet odet''; at Blois ''le loup garon''; at Tours, ''le Roy Huguet''; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical ''huguenands'' in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise."&lt;ref name="capemonthly"&gt;''De l'Estat de France'' 1560, by Reguier de la Plancha, quoted by ''The Cape Monthly'' (February 1877) No. 82 Vol. XIV on page 126|{{Internet Archive|id=capemonthlymagaz00cape|name=The Cape Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have suggested the name was derived, with similar intended scorn, from ''les guenon de Hus'' (the ''monkeys'' or ''apes of [[Jan Hus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliothèque d'humanisme et Renaissance'', by Association d'humanisme et renaissance, 1958, p 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Gilmore Simms, ''The Huguenots in Florida; Or, The Lily and the Totem'', 1854, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; While this and the many other theories offer their own measure of plausibility, attesting at least to the wit of later partisans and historians, "no one of the several theories advanced has afforded satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?vid=OCLC05203528&amp;id=KKAR2MEwKRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA241&amp;lpg=RA1-PA241&amp;dq=Origin+Huguenot#PRA1-PA241,M1 George Lunt, "Huguenot – The origin and meaning of the name"], ''New England Historical &amp; Genealogical Register'', Boston, 1908/1911, 241–246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol==
[[File:Croix huguenote.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|right|The Huguenot Cross]]
The [[Huguenot cross]] is the distinctive emblem of the Huguenots (''croix huguenote'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Croix huguenote|croix huguenote]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now an official symbol of the ''Église des Protestants réformés'' (French Protestant church). Huguenot descendants sometimes display this symbol as a sign of ''reconnaissance'' (recognition) between them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Demographics==
[[File:Protestant France.svg|thumb|Areas controlled and contested by Huguenots are marked purple and livid on this map of modern France.]]
The issue of demographic strength and geographical spread of the [[Reformed tradition]] in France has been covered in a variety of sources. Most of them agree that the Huguenot population reached as many as 10% of the total population, or roughly 2 million people, on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hans J. Hillerbrand, ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set'', paragraphs "France" and "Huguenots"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Huguenot Population of France, 1600-1685: The Demographic Fate and Customs of a Religious Minority by Philip Benedict; American Philosophical Society, 1991 - 164&lt;/ref&gt;

The new teaching of John Calvin attracted sizeable portions of the [[French nobility|nobility]] and urban [[bourgeoisie]]. After John Calvin introduced the [[Reformation]] in France, the number of [[Protestantism in France|French Protestants]] steadily swelled to ten percent of the population, or roughly 1.8 million people, in the decade between 1560 and 1570.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the same period there were some 1,400 Reformed churches operating in France.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Hans J. Hillerbrand, an expert on the subject, in his ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set'' claims the Huguenot community reached as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], declining to 7-8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again with the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1685.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among the nobles, Calvinism peaked on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Since then it has been sharply decreasing as the Huguenots were no more tolerated by both the French royalty and the Catholic mass. By the end of the sixteenth century Huguenots constituted 7-8% of the whole population, or 1.2 million people. By the time Louis XIV revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, Huguenots accounted for 800,000 to 1 million people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Huguenots controlled sizeable areas in southern and western France. In addition, many areas, especially in the central part of the country, were also contested between the French Reformed and Catholic nobles. Demographically, there were some areas in which the whole populations had been Reformed. These included villages in and around the [[Massif Central]], as well as the area around [[Dordogne]], which used to be almost entirely Reformed too. John Calvin was a Frenchman and himself largely responsible for the introduction and spread of the Reformed tradition in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenot.netnation.com/general/huguenot.htm|title=The National Huguenot Society - Who Were the Huguenots?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in French, but unlike the [[Protestantism in Germany|Protestant development in Germany]], where [[Lutheran]] writings were [[Printing press|widely distributed]] and [[Literacy|could be read]] by the common man, it was not the case in France, where only nobles adopted the new faith and the folk remained Catholic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is true for many areas in the west and south controlled by the Huguenot nobility. Although relatively large portions of the peasant population became Reformed there, the people, altogether, still remained majority Catholic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Huguenots: Or, Reformed French Church. Their Principles Delineated; Their Character Illustrated; Their Sufferings and Successes Recorded by William Henry Foote; Presbyterian Committee of Publication, 1870 - 627&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Huguenot presence was heavily concentrated in the western and southern portions of the French kingdom, as nobles there secured practise of the new faith. These included [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], [[Gascony]] and even a strip of land that stretched into the [[Dauphiné]]. Huguenots lived on the Atlantic coast in [[La Rochelle]], and also spread across provinces of [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]]. In the south, towns like [[Castres]], [[Montauban]], [[Montpellier]] and [[Nimes]] were Huguenot strongholds. In addition, a dense network of Protestant villages permeated the rural mountainous region of the [[Cevennes]]. Inhabited by [[Camisards]], it continues to be the backbone of [[Protestantism in France|French Protestantism]]. Historians estimate that roughly 80% of all Huguenots lived in the western and southern areas of France.

Today, there are some Reformed communities around the world that still retain their Huguenot identity. In France, Calvinists in the [[United Protestant Church of France]] and also some in the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] consider themselves Huguenots. A rural Huguenot community in the [[Cevennes]] that rebelled in 1702 is still being called ''[[Camisard]]s'', especially in historical contexts. Huguenot exiles in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and a number of other countries still retain their identity.&lt;ref&gt;The Huguenots: History and Memory in Transnational Context: Essays in Honour and Memory of by Walter C.

===Origins===
[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|upright|Persecution of the [[Waldensians]] in the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545]]
The availability of the Bible in [[vernacular]] languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy (see the [[Avignon Papacy]], for example) by the time the [[Protestant Reformation]] finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, [[Guyart des Moulins|Guyard des Moulins]]. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darling|first=Charles William|title=Historical account of some of the more important versions and editions of the Bible|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|year=1894|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WHVbAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bullen|first=G.|publisher=N.

The first known translation of the Bible into one of France's regional languages, [[Franco-Provençal language|Arpitan or Franco-Provençal]], had been prepared by the 12th-century pre-Protestant reformer [[Peter Waldo]] (Pierre de Vaux).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512214216/http://www.foucachon.com/Huguenots_Waldensians.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=12 May 2014|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldensians became more militant, creating fortified areas, as in [[Cabrières-d'Avignon|Cabrières]], perhaps attacking an abbey.&lt;ref name="Lambert 389"&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=m76JkwMZjgcC&amp;pg=PA389 Malcolm D. Lambert, ''Medieval Heresy: Popular Movements from the Gregorian Reform to the Reformation''], p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; They were suppressed by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1545 in the [[Massacre of Mérindol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|title=The wars of the Huguenots|publisher=Robert Carter &amp; Brothers|location=New York|year=1872|page=27|url=https://archive.org/details/warsofhuguenots00hannuoft|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and [[Gallicanism|Gallican]] Roman Catholics, such as [[Jacques Lefevre]] (c. 1455–1536). The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Ruth Miles, ''The Word Made Flesh: A History of Christian Thought,'' Blackwell Publishing, 2005, pg 381&lt;/ref&gt; During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the [[University of Paris]], published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 130–135&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Farel]] was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the [[Swiss Reformation]], establishing a Protestant republican government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin ([[John Calvin]]), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French [[Waldensians]], then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join [[William Farel]], Calvin and the Reformation, and [[Pierre Robert Olivétan|Olivetan]] published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly [[Calvinism|Calvinistic influence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Calvin, tr. Emily O. Butler |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/frconf.htm |title=The French Confession of Faith of 1559 |publisher=Creeds.net |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually Huguenots are lumped into one group, there were actually two types of Huguenots that emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tylor |first1=Charles |title=The Huguenots in the seventeenth century : including the history of the Edict of Nantes, from its enactment in 1598 to its revocation in 1685 |date=1892 |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent |location=London |page=3 |url=https://archive.org/stream/huguenotsinseven00tylo#page/n17/search/political+freedom |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Huguenots had political and religious goals, it was commonplace to refer to the Calvinists as "Huguenots of religion" and those who opposed the monarchy as "Huguenots of the state", who were mostly nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Renaissance Spell: The Huguenots http://www.renaissance-spell.com/Huguenots.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Huguenots of religion were influenced by John Calvin's works and established Calvinist synods. They were determined to end religious oppression.
* The Huguenots of the state opposed the monopoly of power the Guise family had and wanted to attack the authority of the crown. This group of Huguenots from southern France had frequent issues with the strict Calvinist tenets that are outlined in many of John Calvin's letters to the synods of the Languedoc.

===Criticism and conflict with the Catholic Church===
{{See also|Criticism of the Catholic Church}}
Like other religious reformers of the time, Huguenots felt that the Catholic Church needed a radical cleansing of its impurities, and that the Pope represented a worldly kingdom, which sat in mocking tyranny over the things of God, and was ultimately doomed. Rhetoric like this became fiercer as events unfolded, and eventually stirred up a reaction in the Catholic establishment.

Fanatically opposed to the Catholic Church, the Huguenots attacked priests, monks, nuns, monasticism, images, and church buildings. Most of the cities in which the Huguenots gained a hold saw [[iconoclast]] [[riot]]s in which altars and images in churches, and sometimes the buildings themselves were torn down. Ancient relics and texts were destroyed; the bodies of saints exhumed and burned. The cities of Bourges, Montauban and Orléans saw substantial activity in this regard.

The Huguenots transformed themselves into a definitive political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied a considerable army and a formidable cavalry, which came under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Henry of Navarre and the House of Bourbon allied themselves to the Huguenots, adding wealth and aerial holdings to the Protestant strength, which at its height grew to sixty fortified cities, and posed a serious and continuous threat to the Catholic crown and Paris over the next three decades.

The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots. Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=margaret kilner |url=http://www.orange-street-church.org/text/huguenot.htm |title=Huguenots |publisher=Orange-street-church.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of this persecution was the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in August, 1572, when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centres of power in southern France. Retaliating against the French Catholics, the Huguenots had their own militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|page=48|isbn=9782877475631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation and growth===
Huguenots faced persecution from the outset of the Reformation, but [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (reign 1515–1547) initially protected the dissidents from [[Parlement]]ary measures seeking to exterminate them. After the 1534 [[Affair of the Placards]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renaissance-amboise.com/dossier_renaissance/ses_evenements/affaire_des_placards/affaire_des_placards.htm L'affaire des placards, la fin de la belle Renaissance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318035222/http://www.renaissance-amboise.com/dossier_renaissance/ses_evenements/affaire_des_placards/affaire_des_placards.htm |date=18 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=15341018 |title=18 octobre 1534 : l'affaire des placards |publisher=Herodote.net |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he distanced himself from Huguenots and their protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Earlier, Francis I persecuted the old, pre-Protestant movement of [[Waldensians]] in southeastern France.

Huguenot numbers grew rapidly between 1555 and 1561, chiefly amongst nobles and city dwellers. During this time, their opponents first dubbed the Protestants ''Huguenots''; but they called themselves ''reformés'', or "Reformed". They organised their first national synod in 1558 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07527b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Huguenots |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1562, the estimated number of Huguenots peaked at approximately two million, concentrated mainly in the western, southern, and some central parts of France, compared to approximately sixteen million Catholics during the same period. Persecution diminished the number of Huguenots who remained in France.

===Wars of religion===
{{Main|French Wars of Religion}}
As the Huguenots gained influence and displayed their faith more openly, Roman Catholic hostility towards them grew, even though the French crown offered increasingly liberal [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] and edicts of toleration.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accidental death of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559, his son succeeded as King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] along with his wife, the Queen Consort, also known as [[Mary Queen of Scots]]. During the eighteen months of the reign of Francis II, Mary encouraged a policy of rounding up French Huguenots on charges of heresy and putting them in front of Catholic judges, and employing torture and burning as punishments for dissenters. Mary returned to Scotland a widow, in the summer of 1561.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, David Hackett, "Champlain's Dream", 2008, Alfred A. Knopf Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1561, the Edict of Orléans declared an end to the persecution, and the [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] of January 1562 formally recognised the Huguenots for the first time. However, these measures disguised the growing tensions between Protestants and Catholics.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Civil wars===
[[File:Michelade.jpeg|right|thumb|Huguenots massacring Catholics in the [[Michelade]] in [[Nîmes]].]]
These tensions spurred eight civil wars, interrupted by periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598. With each break in peace, the Huguenots' trust in the Catholic throne diminished, and the violence became more severe, and Protestant demands became grander, until a lasting cessation of open hostility finally occurred in 1598.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The wars gradually took on a dynastic character, developing into an extended feud between the Houses of [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] and [[House of Guise|Guise]], both of which—in addition to holding rival religious views—staked a claim to the French throne. The crown, occupied by the [[House of Valois]], generally supported the Catholic side, but on occasion switched over to the Protestant cause when politically expedient.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

[[File:Huguenot lovers on St. Bartholomew's Day.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[John Everett Millais|Millais]]' painting, ''[[A Huguenot|Huguenot Lovers on St. Bartholomew's Day]].]]
The [[French Wars of Religion]] began with the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, when dozens&lt;ref name="CathEnc_Huguenot" /&gt; (some sources say hundreds&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Martin Lindsay, ''A History of the Reformation,'' 1907, p 190: "six or seven hundred Protestants were slain"&lt;/ref&gt;) of Huguenots were killed, and about 200 were wounded. It was in this year that some Huguenots destroyed the tomb and remains of Saint [[Irenaeus]] (d. 202), an early Church father and bishop who was a disciple of [[Polycarp]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The [[Michelade]] by Huguenotes against Catholics was later on 29 September 1567.

===St. Bartholomew's Day massacre===

{{Main|St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre}}
In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris and similar massacres took place in other towns in the following weeks. The main provincial towns and cities experiencing [[List of events named massacres|massacres]] were [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Bourges]], [[Lyons]], [[Meaux]], [[Orleans]], [[Rouen]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Troyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Parker, G.]]}} (ed.)

===Edict of Nantes===
{{main|Edict of Nantes}}
[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], as [[Hercules]] vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e., the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], circa 1600]]
The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having [[Henry IV of France's succession|succeeded to the French throne]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism in order to obtain the French crown, issued the [[Edict of Nantes]]. The Edict reaffirmed Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

With the proclamation of the Edict of Nantes, and the subsequent protection of Huguenot rights, pressures to leave France abated. However, enforcement of the Edict grew increasingly irregular over time, making life so intolerable that many fled the country. The Huguenot population of France dropped to 856,000 by the mid-1660s, of which a plurality lived in rural areas.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The greatest concentrations of Huguenots at this time resided in the regions of [[Guienne]], Saintonge-[[Aunis]]-[[Angoumois]] and [[Poitou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Huguenot Population of France, 1600–1685: The Demographic Fate and Customs of a Religious Minority |last=Benedict |first=Philip |isbn=0-87169-815-3 |year=1991 |publisher=The American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montpellier]] was among the most important of the 66 "villes de sûreté" (''cities of protection/protected cities'') that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Expulsion from La Rochelle of 300 Protestant famillies Nov 1661 Jan Luiken 1649 1712.jpg|thumb|Expulsion from [[La Rochelle]] of 300 Protestant families in November 1661]]
By 1620, the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the [[Huguenot rebellions]] broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629 in which the Reformed areas revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], a Huguenot before converting to Roman Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the [[Edict of Nantes]]. His successor [[Louis XIII]], under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother [[Marie de' Medici]], was more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots responded by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French crown.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Edict of Fontainebleau===
[[Louis XIV]] gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent [[missionaries]], backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Roman Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favoured professions. Escalating, he instituted [[dragonnades]], which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, in an effort to forcibly convert them. In 1685, he issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.&lt;ref&gt;see article: – [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France.  It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants many of whom were intellectuals, doctors and business leaders whose skills were transferred to Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, South Africa and other places they fled to. 4,000 emigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]], where they settled, especially in New York and Virginia. The English authorities welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation.  Those Huguenots who stayed in France were subsequently forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism and were called "new converts".&lt;ref&gt;John Wolf, ''Louis XIV'', ch 24; Bertrand Van Ruymbeke, "Escape from Babylon", ''Christian History'' 2001 20(3): 38–42. {{ISSN|0891-9666}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;) fled to Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia – whose Calvinist Great Elector [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country.  Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged [[Cévennes]] region in the south. There were also some Calvinists in the Alsace region, which then belonged to the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the [[Camisard]]s (who were Huguenots of the mountainous [[Massif Central]] region) rioted against the Catholic Church, burning churches and killing the clergy. It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Jean Ruff, 2008. ''Le temple du Rouve, lieu de mémoire des Camisards''.

===End of persecution===
{{See also|Persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV|French Revolution}}
[[File:CalasChapbook.jpg|thumb|The death of [[Jean Calas]], who was [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] at Toulouse, 9 March 1762]]
By the 1760s, Protestants numbered about 700,000 in France, or 3% of the population.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Protestantism was no longer a favourite religion of the elite. By then, most Protestants were Cevennes peasants. It was still illegal, and, although the law was seldom enforced, it could be a threat or a nuisance to Protestants. Calvinists lived primarily in the [[Le Midi|Midi]]; about 200,000 Lutherans accompanied by some Calvinists lived in the newly acquired [[Alsace]], where the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]] effectively protected them.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780–1804'' (2000) pp 61–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Protestants diminished in France after 1724, finally ending with the [[Edict of Versailles]], commonly called the [[Edict of Tolerance]], signed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1787. Two years later, with the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]], Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.&lt;ref name="Aston, 2000 pp 245-50"/&gt;

=== Right of return to France in the 19th and 20th centuries ===
The government encouraged descendants of exiles to return, offering them French citizenship in a 15 December 1790 Law: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All persons born in a foreign country and descending in any degree of a French man or woman expatriated for religious reason are declared French nationals (''naturels français'') and will benefit from rights attached to that quality if they come back to France, establish their domicile there and take the civic oath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Thomas Barclay|title=Nationality, domicile and residence in France: Decree of October 2, 1888 concerning foreigners, with notes and instructions and the laws of France relating to nationality, admission to domicile, naturalization and the sojourn in France of foreigners generally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99QNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=1888|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 4 of 26 June 1889 Nationality Law stated: "Descendants of families proscribed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes will continue to benefit from the benefit of 15 December 1790 Law, but on the condition that a nominal decree should be issued for every petitioner. That decree will only produce its effects for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

Stationery Office|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign descendants of Huguenots lost the automatic right to French citizenship in 1945 (by force of the ''Ordonnance du 19 octobre 1945'', which revoked the 1889 Nationality Law). It states in article 3: "This application does not, however, affect the validity of past acts by the person or rights acquired by third parties on the basis of previous laws."{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Modern times===
In the 1920s and 1930s, members of the extreme-right [[Action Française]] movement expressed strong animus against Huguenots and other [[Protestant]]s in general, as well as against [[Jews]] and [[Freemasons]]. They were regarded as groups supporting the French Republic, which Action Française sought to overthrow.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In [[World War II]], Huguenots led by André Trocmé in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]] in [[Cévennes]] helped save many [[Jews]]. They hid them in secret places or helped them get out of [[Vichy|Vichy France]]. [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]] preached against discrimination as the [[Nazis]] were gaining power in neighbouring Germany and urged his Protestant Huguenot congregation to hide [[Jewish]] refugees from the [[Holocaust]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the early 21st century, there were approximately one million Protestants in France, representing some 2% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35454.htm |title=France |publisher=State.gov |date=1 January 2004 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are concentrated in [[Alsace]] in northeast France and the [[Cévennes]] mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Surveys suggest that Protestantism has grown in recent years, though this is due primarily to the expansion of [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical Protestant]] churches which particularly have adherents among immigrant groups that are generally considered distinct from the French Huguenot population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/7710/rise-of-neo-protestantism-under-macron-challenges-traditional-catholic-secular-approach-to-politics&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[diaspora]] of [[French Australian]]s still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huguenotsaustralia.org.au/|title=Welcome to The Huguenot Society of Australia Website|author=The Huguenot Society of Australia|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there are several Huguenot worship groups and societies.  The Huguenot Society of America has headquarters in New York City and has a broad national membership.  One of the most active Huguenot groups is in Charleston, South Carolina.  While many American Huguenot groups worship in borrowed churches, the congregation in Charleston has its own church.  Although services are conducted largely in English, every year the church holds an Annual French Service, which is conducted entirely in French using an adaptation of the Liturgies of Neufchatel (1737) and Vallangin (1772).  Typically the Annual French Service takes place on the first or second Sunday after Easter in commemoration of the signing of the Edict of Nantes.

==Exodus==
Most French Huguenots were either unable or unwilling to emigrate to avoid forced conversion to Roman Catholicism. As a result, more than three-quarters of the Protestant population of 2 million converted, 1 million, and 500,000 fled in exodus.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

===Early emigration and French colonialism===

[[File:Fort caroline.jpg|thumb|Etching of Fort Caroline]]
The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found ''[[France Antarctique]]''. A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]], and settled on a small island. A fort, named [[Fort Coligny]], was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian natives. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured some of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened their Protestant prisoners with death if they did not convert to Roman Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to explain their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence. This document, the [[Guanabara Confession of Faith]] became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1564, a group of [[Normandy|Norman]] Huguenots under the leadership of [[Jean Ribault]] established the small colony of [[Fort Caroline]] on the banks of the [[St. Johns River]] in what is today [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. This was the first French attempt at any permanent European settlement in the present-day [[continental United States]], although previous Spanish attempts had been made as early as 1526 ([[San Miguel de Gualdape]]). A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas. Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez. Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless Huguenots, who were among the French contingent. Afterwards, he wiped out the [[Fort Caroline#History|Fort Caroline]] garrison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/timu/historyculture/foca_end_colony.htm "The End of the Colony"], National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Huguenots in South Africa}}

Individual Huguenots settled at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] from as early as 1671 with the arrival of [[Viljoen|François Villion (Viljoen)]]. The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however [[Maria de la Quellerie]], wife of commander [[Jan van Riebeeck]] (and daughter of a [[Walloon church]] minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today [[Cape Town]]. The couple left for the [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the [[Dutch East India Company]] post at the Cape of Good Hope.&lt;ref name="FRC-7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botha|first=Colin Graham|title=The French refugees at the Cape|page=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/frenchrefugeesat00both#page/7/mode/1up|accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.&lt;ref name="FRC-10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botha|first=Colin Graham|title=The French refugees at the Cape|page=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/frenchrefugeesat00both#page/10/mode/1up|accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HuguenotMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|The [[Huguenot Monument]] of [[Franschhoek]] in [[Western Cape]] province, [[South Africa]]]]

Many of these settlers were settled in an area that was later called [[Franschhoek]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "French Corner"), in the present-day [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa. A large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 7 April 1948 at [[Franschhoek, Western Cape|Franschhoek]], where the Huguenot Memorial Museum was erected in 1957.

The official policy of the [[Dutch East India]] governors was to integrate the Huguenot and the [[Cape Dutch|Dutch communities]]. When Paul Roux, a pastor who arrived with the main group of Huguenots, died in 1724, the Dutch administration, as a special concession, permitted another French cleric to take his place "for the benefit of the elderly who spoke only French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric|last=Walker|title=A History of Southern Africa|publisher=Longmans|year=1968|chapter=Chapter IV – The Diaspora}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within three generations French was replaced by Dutch as the home language of most of the Huguenot descendants due to [[Language shift|assimilation]].

Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names. Many families, today mostly [[Afrikaans]]-speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers,  de Klerk (Le Clercq), [[De Villiers (disambiguation)|de Villiers]], du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouché, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), [[Joubert]], Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), [[Leroux (surname)|le Roux]], Lombard, [[Malan (disambiguation)|Malan]], [[Malherbe (surname)|Malherbe]], Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell), Naudé, Nortjé (Nortier), [[Pienaar]] (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw ([[Rousseau (surname)|Rousseau]]), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, [[Viljoen]] (Villion) and Visagie (Visage).&lt;ref&gt;''Ces Francais Qui Ont Fait L'Afrique Du Sud''.

===North America===
{{details|Fort Caroline}}
[[File:WalloonMonumentNYC.gif|thumb|right|Walloon Monument in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]], [[Manhattan]], New York City]]
French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America. In 1562, naval officer [[Jean Ribault]] led an expedition that explored [[Florida]] and the present-day [[Southeastern US]], and founded the outpost of [[Charlesfort]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]]. The French Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established [[Fort Caroline]] in what is now [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'', and sent [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], who established the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] near Fort Caroline. Menéndez' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives.

Barred by the government from settling in [[New France]], Huguenots led by [[Jessé de Forest]], sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including [[Nova Scotia]]. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as ''L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam'' (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as ''L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit'', now a part of the [[Episcopal Church USA]] (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbour at the end of [[Newtown Creek]], becoming the first Europeans to live in [[Brooklyn]], then known as Boschwick, in the neighbourhood now known as [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]].

[[File:Jean Hasbrouck House.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Hasbrouck House]] (1721) on [[Huguenot Street]] in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]]]]

Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], and a third further upstate in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]]. The "[[Huguenot Street Historic District]]" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America. A small group of Huguenots also settled on the [[Rossville, Staten Island|south shore]] of [[Staten Island]] along the [[New York Harbor]], for which the current neighbourhood of [[Huguenot, Staten Island|Huguenot]] was named.

[[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], located in the county of [[Westchester, New York|Westchester]] on the north shore of [[Long Island Sound]], seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York. It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called "Bauffet's Point" after travelling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]], a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of [[Jacob Leisler]]. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that was built of stone.  Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, [[Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church (New Rochelle, New York)|Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church]], which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church "Eglise du St. Esperit" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or the "Huguenot Burial Ground", has since been recognised as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.

Some Huguenot immigrants settled in central and eastern Pennsylvania. They assimilated with the predominantly [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German]] settlers of the area.

In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in [[Lower Norfolk County]]. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned [[Monacan people|Monacan]] village known as [[Manakin-Sabot, Virginia|Manakin Town]], now in [[Goochland County, Virginia|Goochland County]]. Some settlers landed in present-day [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]. On 12 May 1705, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwehave/notes/rn9_natural1657.pdf |title=Huguenots in Manakintown |publisher=Library of Virginia |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217223209/http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwehave/notes/rn9_natural1657.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the [[Huguenot Memorial Bridge]] across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including [[Huguenot High School]].

[[File:FrenchProtestantChurch.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huguenot Church|French Huguenot Church]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]]]

In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]] in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, several Huguenots including [[Edmund Bohun]] of Suffolk, England, [[Jean Postell]] of Dieppe France, [[Alexander Pepin]], [[Antoine Poitevin]] of Orsement France, and [[Jacques de Bordeaux]] of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave [[Edmund Bellinger]]. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.

The [[French Huguenot Church]] of Charleston, which remains independent, is the oldest continuously active Huguenot congregation in the United States. ''L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit'' in New York, founded in 1628, is older, but it left the French Reformed movement in 1804 to become part of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].

Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Gevinson, Alan. "[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23448 Protestant Immigration to Louisiana]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org], accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont|E.I. du Pont]], a former student of [[Lavoisier]], established the [[Eleutherian Mills|Eleutherian gunpowder mills]].&lt;ref&gt;article on EIDupont says he did not even emigrate to the US and establish the mills until after the French Revolution, so the mills were not operating for theAmerican revolution&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hughes]], famed investor, pilot, film director, and philanthropist, was also of Huguenot descent and descendant from Rev. [[John Gano]].

[[Paul Revere]] was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was [[Henry Laurens]], who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina; [[Jack Jouett]], who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; Reverend [[John Gano]] was a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] chaplain and spiritual advisor to [[George Washington]]; [[Francis Marion]], and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen. The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston, South Carolina, at a church that dates to 1844. The Huguenot Society of America maintains the [[Manakin Episcopal Church]] in Virginia as a historic shrine with occasional services. The Society has chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest.

===Netherlands===
Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the "Apologie" of [[William the Silent]], [[Historical revision of the Inquisition|condemning the Spanish Inquisition]], which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. [[Louise de Coligny]], daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the [[Prinsenhof]] in [[Delft]] held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active [[Walloon church]]es of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (now of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]]). The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in South Africa and [[New Netherland]] in North America.

Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of king [[Louis XIV]] after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the [[League of Augsburg]] as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist-controlled Dutch Republic, which also happened to lead the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there (which were called the "[[Walloon church]]es").

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 pastors. Many came from the region of the [[Cévennes]], for instance, the village of [[Fraissinet-de-Lozère]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghislain Baury,[http://sites.google.com/site/dynastierouviere/ ''La dynastie Rouvière de Fraissinet-de-Lozère. Les élites villageoises dans les Cévennes protestantes d'après un fonds d'archives inédit (1403–1908)'', t. 1: ''La chronique'', t. 2: ''L'inventaire''], Sète, Les Nouvelles Presses du Languedoc, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2&amp;nbsp;million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the whole Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.

One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was [[Pierre Bayle]]. He started teaching in [[Rotterdam]], where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, ''[[Historical and Critical Dictionary]]''. It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US [[Library of Congress]]. Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch [[List of Dutch patrician families|patriciate]] are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron ''[[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicolas]]'', similar to the Dutch ''[[Sint Nicolaas]]'' ([[Sinterklaas]]) feast.

===Wales===
A number of French Huguenots settled in Wales, in the upper [[Rhymney]] valley of the current [[Caerphilly County Borough]]. The community they created there is still known as ''Fleur de Lys'' (the symbol of France), an unusual French village name in the heart of the valleys of Wales. Nearby villages are [[Hengoed]], and [[Ystrad Mynach]]. Apart from the French village name and that of the local rugby team, [[Fleur De Lys RFC]], little remains of the French heritage.

===England===
[[File:huguenot canterbury.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Huguenot weavers' houses at [[Canterbury]]]]
Both before and after the 1708 passage of the [[Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708|Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act]], an estimated 50,000 Protestant [[Walloons]] and French Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere. In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12010095 |title=The Huguenots in England |work=The Economist|date= 28 August 2008|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Lortie]] (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] during Mass.

Of the refugees who arrived on the [[Kent]] coast, many gravitated towards [[Canterbury]], then the county's [[Calvinist]] hub. Many Walloon and Huguenot families were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] there. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] granted them the whole of the western crypt of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] for worship. In 1825, this privilege was reduced to the south aisle and in 1895 to the former [[chantry]] chapel of the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]. Services are still held there in French according to the Reformed tradition every Sunday at 3&amp;nbsp;pm.

Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where [[weavers' windows]] survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Other refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the city.&lt;!-- dead link&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digiserve.com/peter/weavers.htm "Huguenot Weavers"], Digiserve&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Faversham, Kent|Faversham]] and [[Maidstone]]—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.

The [[French Protestant Church of London]] was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1550. It is now located at [[Soho Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egliseprotestantelondres.org |title=French Protestant Church of London |publisher=Egliseprotestantelondres.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517081120/http://www.egliseprotestantelondres.org/ |archivedate=17 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Huguenot refugees flocked to [[Shoreditch]], London. They established a major [[weaving]] industry in and around [[Spitalfields]] (see [[Petticoat Lane]] and the [[Tenterground]]) in East London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 ''Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 91–95] Date accessed: 21 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wandsworth]], their gardening skills benefited the [[Battersea]] market gardens. The flight of Huguenot refugees from [[Tours]], France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Some of these immigrants moved to [[Norwich]], which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.

Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time. Although 19th-century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry,&lt;ref name="palliser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palliser|first=Mrs. Bury|authorlink=Fanny Bury Palliser|title=History of Lace|year=1865|publisher=Sampson Low, Son and Marston|location=London|page=299|quote=A nest of refugee lace-makers, "who came out of France by reason of the late 'troubles' yet continuing," were congregated at Dover (1621–22).

Many Huguenots from the [[Lorraine]] region also eventually settled in the area around [[Stourbridge]] in [[Worcestershire]] where they found the raw materials and fuel to continue their glassmaking tradition. Anglicised names such as Tyzack, Henzey and Tittery are regularly found amongst the early glassmakers, and the region went on to become one of the most important glass regions in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Jason|title=Glassmakers of Stourbridge and Dudley 1612–2002|year=2002|publisher=Jason Ellis|location=Harrogate|isbn=1-4010-6799-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] was probably one of the most prominent people of Huguenot descent, deriving from his American grandfather [[Leonard Jerome]].

===Ireland===
[[File:Huguenot Cemetery, Cork.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to [[Huguenot Cemetery, Cork]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Munster]]]]
Following the French crown's revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Lawless Lee (2009), ''The Huguenot Settlements in Ireland,'' Page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Hylton (2005), ''Ireland's Huguenots and Their Refuge, 1662–1745: An Unlikely Haven,'' p. 194, Quote:  "The Bishop of Kildare did come to Portarlington to consecrate the churches, backed by two prominent Huguenot Deans of ...

Smaller settlements, which included [[Killeshandra]] in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the [[Irish linen]] industry.

For over 150 years, Huguenots were allowed to hold their services in Lady Chapel in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. A [[Huguenot cemetery, Dublin|Huguenot cemetery]] is located in the centre of Dublin, off St. Stephen's Green. Prior to its establishment, Huguenots used the [[The Cabbage Garden, Dublin|Cabbage Garden]] near the Cathedral. Another [[Huguenot Cemetery, Cork|Huguenot Cemetery]] is located off French Church street in Cork.

A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in [[Cork City]]; and [[D'Olier Street]] in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~offaly/stpauls.htm ''300 years of the French Church''], St. Paul's Church, Portarlington.&lt;/ref&gt; and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grantonline.com/grant-family-individuals/blong-george-1790/portarlington/portarlington.htm Portarlington], Grant Family Onliine&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable Huguenot descendants in Ireland was [[Seán Lemass]] (1899–1971), who was appointed as ''[[Taoiseach]],'' serving from 1959 until 1966.

===Germany and Scandinavia===
[[File:Huguenot obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|Obelisk commemorating the Huguenots in [[Fredericia|Fredericia, Denmark]]]]

Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], where they were granted special privileges ([[Edict of Potsdam]]) and churches in which to worship (such as the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde]] and the [[French Cathedral, Berlin]]) by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] and [[Duke of Prussia]]. The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich).
Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of [[Baden]], [[Franconia]] ([[Principality of Bayreuth]], [[Principality of Ansbach]]), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]], [[Duchy of Württemberg]], in the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]], in [[Electorate of the Palatinate|the Palatinate]] and [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]], in the Rhine-Main-Area ([[Frankfurt]]), in modern-day [[Saarland]]; and 1,500 found refuge in [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] in [[Celle]].

[[File:Relief 1885.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|left|Relief by [[Johannes Boese]], 1885: The Great [[Prince-elector]] of Brandenburg-Prussia welcomes arriving Huguenots]]
In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: [[Dorotheenstadt]] and [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]]. By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1806–07. Many of their descendants rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded throughout Germany and Scandinavia, such as those of [[Fredericia]] (Denmark), Berlin, [[Stockholm]], Hamburg, [[Frankfurt]], Helsinki, and [[Emden]].

Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day [[Saarland]] in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region. Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.

In [[Bad Karlshafen]], Hessen, Germany is the Huguenot Museum and Huguenot archive. The collection includes family histories, a library, and a picture archive.

==Effects of the exodus==
{{See also|Brain drain}}
The exodus of Huguenots from France created a [[brain drain]], as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in [[New France]] may help to explain that colony's low population compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the time of the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]]), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759–60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-5876486_ITM |title=Cooperative religion in Quebec |work=Journal of Ecumenical Studies |publisher=Goliath |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia. Several prominent German military, cultural, and political figures were ethnic Huguenot, including poet [[Theodor Fontane]],&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Harry. ''Twelve German Novellas'', p. 315. University of California Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-520-03002-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Hermann von François]],&lt;ref&gt;Pawly, Ronald. ''The Kaiser's Warlords'', p.44. Osprey Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|1-84176-558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hero of the First World War [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], [[Luftwaffe]] General and [[fighter ace]] [[Adolf Galland]],&lt;ref name="Galland 1954, p. vii"&gt;Galland 1954, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luftwaffe]] flying ace [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], and famed U-boat captain [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David.

''The Unification of Germany, 1989–1990'', p. 109. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-29969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also a descendant of a Huguenot family, as is the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]], [[Thomas de Maizière]].

The persecution and flight of the Huguenots greatly damaged the reputation of Louis XIV abroad, particularly in England. The two kingdoms, which had enjoyed peaceful relations prior to 1685, became bitter enemies and fought against each other in a series of wars (called the "[[Second Hundred Years' War]]" by some historians) from 1689 onward.

==1985 apology==
[[File:Reagan Mitterrand 1984 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[François Mitterrand]] issued a formal apology to the Huguenots and their descendants on behalf of the French state in 1985]]
In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], President [[François Mitterrand]] of France announced a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html|title=Allocution de M. François Mitterrand, Président de la République, aux cérémonies du tricentenaire de la Révocation de l'Edit de Nantes, sur la tolérance en matière politique et religieuse et l'histoire du protestantisme en France, Paris, Palais de l'UNESCO, vendredi 11 octobre 1985. – vie-publique.fr|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the government released a special postage stamp in their honour reading "France ''is'' the home of the Huguenots" (''Accueil des Huguenots'').

==Legacy==
Huguenot legacy persists both in France and abroad.

===France===
Several [[Protestantism in France|French Protestant churches]] are descended from or tied to the Huguenots, including:
* [[Reformed Church of France]] (''l'Église Réformée de France''), founded in 1559, the historical and principal Reformed church in France since the Protestant Reformation until its 2013 merger into the [[United Protestant Church of France]]
* [[National Union of Independent Reformed Evangelical Churches of France|Evangelical Reformed Church of France]] (''Union nationale des églises protestantes réformées évangéliques de France''), founded in 1938

* [[New Rochelle, New York]], named for the city of [[La Rochelle]], a known former Huguenot stronghold in France. The Huguenot and Historical Association of New Rochelle was organised in 1885 for the purpose of perpetuating the history of its original Huguenot settlers.  The mascot of [[New Rochelle High School]] is the Huguenot; and one of the main streets in the city is called Huguenot Street.
* [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayonneonline.com/bayonne/history.htm/&lt;nowiki/&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121648/http://www.bayonneonline.com/bayonne/history.htm/ |date=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
* There is a Huguenot society in London, as well as a [[French Protestant Church of London]], founded in 1550 in [[Soho Square]], which is still active, and also is a registered charity since 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsofspitalfields.org|title=Huguenots of Spitalfields heritage tours &amp; events in Spitalfields – Huguenot Public Art Trust|author=Super User|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egliseprotestantelondres.org.uk|title=Eglise Protestante Française de Londres|work=Eglise Protestante Française de Londres|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Huguenots of Spitalfields is a registered charity promoting public understanding of the Huguenot heritage and culture in Spitalfields, the City of London and beyond. They arrange tours, talks, events and schools programmes to raise the Huguenot profile in Spitalfields and raise funds for a permanent memorial to the Huguenots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsofspitalfields.org/|title=Huguenots of Spitalfields heritage tours &amp; events in Spitalfields – Huguenot Public Art Trust|author=Super User|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Canterbury Cathedral]] retains a Huguenot Chapel in the ‘Black Prince’s Chantry’, part of the Crypt which is accessible from the exterior of the cathedral. The chapel was granted to Huguenot refugees on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I in 1575.

===Prussia===
*Huguenot refugees in [[Prussia]] are thought to have contributed significantly to the development of the textile industry in that country. One notable example was [[Marthe de Roucoulle]], governess of [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] and [[Frederick the Great]].

===Ireland===
* [[Sean Francis Lemass]], [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland from 1959–1966, was of Huguenot descent.

=== South Africa ===
{{Main|Huguenots in South Africa}}
* Most South African Huguenots settled in the [[Cape Colony]], where they became assimilated into the [[Afrikaner]] and [[Afrikaans]] population. Many modern Afrikaners have French surnames, which are given Afrikaans pronunciation and orthography. The early immigrants settled in ''[[Franschhoek]]'' ("French Corner") near [[Cape Town]]. The Huguenots contributed greatly to the [[South African wine|wine industry in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingapartheid.msu.edu/unit.php?id=11|title=Paths to Pluralism: South Africa's Early History|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|French Australian}}
* The majority of Australians with French ancestry are descended from Huguenots.  Some of the earliest to arrive in Australia held prominent positions in English society, notably [[Jane Franklin]] and [[Charles La Trobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsaustralia.org.au/famous.html|title=Famous people|author=The Huguenot Society of Australia|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Others who came later were from poorer families, migrating from England in the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape the poverty of London's East End Huguenot enclaves of [[Spitalfields]] and [[Bethnal Green]]. Their impoverishment had been brought on by the Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry. Many [[French Australian]] descendants of Huguenots still consider themselves very much Huguenots or French, even in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsaustralia.org.au/who.html|title=Who were the Huguenots?|author=The Huguenot Society of Australia|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imogiri''' (also '''Imagiri''') is a royal graveyard complex in [[Yogyakarta]], in south-central [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]], as well as a modern village located near the graveyard in [[Bantul Regency]]. Imogiri is a traditional resting place for the royalty of central Java, including many rulers of the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] and of the current houses of [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]]. The name '''Imagiri''' is derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''Himagiri'', which means 'mountain of snow'. The latter is another name for ''[[Himalaya]]''.

==Role and importance==
The Royal Graveyard that preceded was [[Kota Gede]]. The graveyard was constructed by [[Sultan Agung of Mataram]] in the later years of his reign, probably in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Mandoyokusumo Kanjeng Raden Tumenggung | title=The history of graves of the kings at Imogiri | publication-date=1976 | publisher=s.n | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/7277105 | accessdate=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graveyard is a significant pilgrimage [[ziarah]] site, particularly on significant dates in the [[Javanese calendar]] (such as [[Satu Suro]], New Year's Day), and the [[Islamic calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kamajaya | title=1 Suro tahun baru Jawa perpaduan Jawa-Islam | publication-date=1992 | publisher=UP. Indonesia | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/23758488 | accessdate=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also belongs to a larger network of significant locations in Javanese pilgrimage traditions. It is possibly the only major location remaining in Java where the Palaces of [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]] have personnel manning a jointly administered royal graveyard.

Among the site's most prominent graves are that of early Mataram ruler Sultan Agung, and Sultan of Yogyakarta [[Hamengkubuwono IX]], a leader during Indonesia's war for independence. The most recent is that of [[Pakubuwana XII]] of Surakarta who was buried in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Paku Buwono XII Sunan of Surakarta, 1925- | author2=Mutholi'in, A | author3=Pawiyatan Kraton Surakarta | title=Karaton Surakarta | publication-date=2004 | publisher=Yayasan Pawiyatan Kebudayaan Karaton Surakarta | edition=1st | isbn=978-979-98586-0-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore collected by Pranata in the 1970s, suggest that unusual stones in the steps preceding Sultan Agung's section of the graveyard cover the remains of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]], which were allegedly stolen from the grave of 1629 in Batavia during the [[Siege of Batavia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pranata Ssp | title=Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo, raja terbesar Kerajaan Mataram abad ke-17 : catatan dari Imogiri | publication-date=1977 | publisher=Yudha Gama | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/24906374 | accessdate=20 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; See [[Wayang Museum]] for a photograph of the location of the gravesite where he had been interred in Jakarta &lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De ingang van het graf van Sultan Agung op de begraafplaats Imogiri TMnr 60004750.jpg|left|thumb|Upper entrance to Sultan Agungan in 1890]]
The Imogiri complex is separated into three parts, named [[Giriloyo]], [[Banyusumurup]] and Imogiri. Traditionally it is accepted that Giriloyo was the earliest of the three graveyards. In some local folklore, Sultan Agung had commenced work on his own graveyard at Giriloyo - but because his uncle Juminah died at the graveyard, Agung was guided by various portents to choose his graveyard on a hill some three kilometres to the southwest, at Imogiri.&lt;ref&gt;Moertjipto,(1992) p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  A later ruler, needing to bury outcasts in a graveyard separate from Giriloyo and Imogiri, chose Banyusumurup as an appropriate site. However it is possible to find rivals and enemies within Javanese royal families buried within metres of each other inside the walls of Imogiri.

==Renovations==
[[File:JogjaEarthquake27Mei2006-6.jpg|thumb|right|240px|After the [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|earthquake of 2006]]]]

The Imogiri complex has had ongoing renovations since initial construction, due to exposure to tropical rain and weather, most materials at the graveyard have requires continual upkeep. [[Pakubuwono X]] during his reign spent a large amount of money on upgrading the Juru Kunci administration buildings in Imogiri village, the Mosque at the foot of the stairs, the stairs and the Graveyard in general. He also constructed the  Girimulya section as well. [[Hamengkubuwana VIII]] in the process of constructing Saptorenggo in the 1920s also conducted repairs on the earlier structures that required repairs. Various [[Suharto]]-era bureaucrats and army personnel with connections with branches of earlier rulers contributed to a number of roof renewals and other renovations. The Indonesian Government contributed to a project that rehabilitated the yard known by its split gate - the Supit Urang - under the auspices of the archaeology service and appropriate agencies in the 1980s. In the 1990s the main gate into Sultan Agungan also required repairs.

The 2006 earthquake in the region saw considerable damage to the complex. It is not known yet to what extent repairs and renovations are possible again, and from where the funds will emanate.

==Layout==
[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Imogiri nabij Yogyakarta de vorstelijke begraafplaats waar de familiegraven van de Midden Javaanse vorsten zijn. TMnr 60004749.jpg|thumb|left| View from adjacent hill of Imogiri in the 1890s]]

Many travel accounts, tourist guides and references to Imogiri imply a simple single whole. On closer examination the graveyard has more complexity within its structure. The complex is divided in two ways. First, there are separate Yogyakartan and Surakartan sections. Second, the whole graveyard is divided into eight sections which constitute three generations of ruler in each section.  Some are jointly governed by custodians (''[[Juru Kunci]]'') from Surakarta and Yogyakarta, while some are governed by representatives of one of these palaces only. The original area within the Imogiri graveyard is that area with Sultan Agung's grave - it is jointly governed.  The western wing of the graveyard is the Surakartan section, while the eastern wing is the Yogyakartan section.

Not all rulers of the Sultanate of Mataram are buried in the Imogiri complex; there are a number of rulers who are buried elsewhere in Java. Some immediate families of rulers were also buried in Imogiri, but not all; this was dependent upon each ruler's preferences. Printed lists of the burial plots within the royal graveyard complex are maintained for Imogiri to provide guidance for researchers looking for a specific grave site. This process is sometimes complicated by the multiple names some individuals were known by during their lives.

==Sections==
Each section is a walled compound with three internal sections - variation may occur in transcription for these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Riwayat pasarean Imogiri Mataram | publication-date=2003 | publisher=[s.n.] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/24550682 | accessdate=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Timothy Behrend | title=Kraton and Cosmos in Traditional Java | publication-date=1989 | publisher=PERSEE | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16185970 | accessdate=20 April 2012 }} - Behrend provides the most thorough explanation of kraton structure and meaning in english to date - and it is clear that the sections of the Imogiri graveyard are replicating the terminology and meaning of the Yogyakarta and Surakarta palaces&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Top section is named 'Prabayasa.'
* Middle section is named 'Kemangdhungan.'
* Entrance yard is called 'Srimanganti.'

Note that dates after rulers name are supposed dates of interment, variant dates are possible in some sources. They are given in [[Gregorian calendar]] years. Dates after construction are arbitrary and may vary up to 10 years.  In most cases the new walled compounds have been built prior to the death of the first ruler interred.  However it is possible that the grave precedes the walls, as is probably the case in [[Sultan Agungan]], and those that follow. Most names listed have abbreviated forms, for Javanese royalty there are usually extra titles when written, any abbreviation here is for purposes of the list and not out of disrespect for the deceased or their status.

==Chronological sequence==
The following list is in the assumed order of construction of the walled areas at Imogiri. The first two are in the shared parts; afterwards, as the kingdom split, the sections are for the Yogyakartan and Surakartan rulers are separate.
*Kasultan Agungan (constructed in the 1640s)
** [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung]]   1645
** [[Amangkurat II]]  1703
** [[Amangkurat III]] 1734
*Paku Buwanan (constructed in the 18th century)
** [[Pakubuwono I|Pakubuwana I]]  1719
** [[Amangkurat IV of Mataram|Amangkurat IV]]  1726
** [[Pakubuwana II]]  1749
*Kasuwargan Surakarta (constructed in the 1770s)
** [[Pakubuwana III]] 1788
** [[Pakubuwana IV]]  1820
** [[Pakubuwana V]]   1823
*Kasuwargan Yogyakarta (constructed in the 1780s)
** [[Hamengkubuwana I]]   1792
** [[Hamengkubuwana III]] 1814
*Besiyaran Yogyakarta (constructed in the 1820s)
** [[Hamengkubuwana IV]]  1826
** [[Hamengkubuwana V]]   1855
** [[Hamengkubuwana VI]]  1877
*Kapingsangan Surakarta (constructed in the 1840s)
** [[Pakubuwana VI]]    1846
** [[Pakubuwana VII]]   1858
** [[Pakubuwana VIII]]  1861
** [[Pakubuwana IX]]    1893
*Saptorenggo Yogyakarta (constructed in the 1920s)
** [[Hamengkubuwana VII]]   1921
** [[Hamengkubuwana VIII]]  1939
** [[Hamengkubuwana IX]]   1988
*[[Girimulya Surakarta]] (constructed in the 1930s)
** [[Pakubuwana X]]    1939
** [[Pakubuwana XI]]   1945
** [[Pakubuwana XII]]  2004

==Understanding the structure and details of the graveyard==
Most sections have a sequence of three generations - 'Ego' or Father, Son and grandson, where the succession is that simple. The ones that don't are: Kasuwargan Yogyakarta has a missing person ([[Hamengkubuwana II]] is buried at [[Kota Gede]]); Kapingsangan Surakarta has four due to family dynamics. Much earlier, [[Amangkurat I]] was buried at [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]] on the north coast of Java, and as a consequence is not in Paku Buwanan.
[[Juru Kunci]] Surakarta and Yogyakarta share the tending of the graves and courtyards in Sultan Agungan and Paku Buwanan.
International [[tourist]]s are usually encouraged to enter the yard prior to Sultan Agungan, pay a registration, put on appropriate clothing, and visit Sultan Agungan.
Imogiri is now 'full up', both the Girimulya and Saptorenggo sections have three generations interred, unless the traditional practice is changed for any reason, the current living rulers in Surakarta and Yogyakarta would now need to prepare a new section each on each 'side' of the graveyard to continue the practice of the last 400 years. The construction works of the new section of the Yogyakarta side has been started.

==Sources==
* At Imogiri over the decades, various small publications have listed the main names of rulers buried in the graveyard.  In some cases they have had maps as well.
* Some websites have appropriated lists of royalty, and have reprinted the names of rulers, with dates.
* In the Yogyakarta and Paku Alam palaces there are 'silsilah' lists showing the successions.

'''''In the Beginning''''' is an American [[sitcom]] originally created by [[Norman Lear]], [[Jim Mulligan (writer)|Jim Mulligan]] and [[Norman Steinberg]] and produced by Lear's [[Tandem Productions]] company that aired on [[CBS]] from September 20 to October 18, 1978.

==Premise==
The series, a semi-update of the film ''[[Going My Way]]'', featured conservative priest Father Cleary and liberal, streetwise nun Sister Agnes (known as "Aggie") running a ghetto mission together in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/in-the-beginning/cast/202206|title=In the Beginning Cast and Details|publisher=TV Guide|accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While Aggie was from the area and enjoyed the assignment, Father Cleary had difficulty dealing with her (frequently referring to her as "Attila the Nun"), as well as the neighborhood prostitutes, hustlers and winos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sitcomsonline|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/41283|title=In the Beginning - McLean Stevenson and Priscilla Lopez|publisher=Sitcomsonline|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled after its first five episodes aired.

==Production==
First developed by Lear in 1977, the series was originally intended as a starring vehicle for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress Priscilla Lopez, and was to have been titled ''Aggie'', after her character. However, McLean Stevenson was later added to the cast, and in addition to the title change, it also moved the show's focus from its original premise of Aggie against the establishment to Aggie and her battles with Father Cleary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sitcomsonline |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/41283 |title=In the Beginning - McLean Stevenson and Priscilla Lopez|publisher=Sitcomsonline |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In the Beginning'' also marked McLean Stevenson's second attempt at a successful post-''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' vehicle. However, the series fared even worse than his short-lived 1976 sitcom ''[[The McLean Stevenson Show]]''. A long-forgotten flop, ''In the Beginning'' was cancelled by CBS after only 5 of its 9 episodes had aired, due to poor ratings and the departures of co-creators Jim Mulligan and Norman Steinberg after the pilot, as a result of conflicts with the network.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''janu'' (जानु, jānu) meaning "knee", ''shirsha'' (शीर्ष, śīrṣa) meaning "head", and ''āsana'' (आसन) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://de.ashtangayoga.info/praxis/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/janu-shirshasana-a/| title = Janu Shirshasana A - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it bears a similar name, Janu Sirsanana bears little resemblance to [[Sirsasana]] ([[Headstand]]).

==Description==
In a seated position, one leg is extended with toes pointing upward, and the other leg is bent with knee pointing away from the straight leg and the sole of the foot in by the groin. The torso turns and folds over the extended leg.

Janu Sirsasana is a spinal twist, as well as a forward fold. The potential is to free up constriction in different parts of the back and to loosen the hamstrings.

Janu Sirsasana differs from [[Paschimottanasana]] in its asymmetry in the legs and hips, and in the twisting action this asana imparts to the spine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4000">'''Joseph Wheless''' ([[Montgomery County, Tennessee]] 1868-1950) was an American lawyer who wrote promoting the [[Jesus myth theory]] during the early years of the 20th century.

He was son of Joseph Wheless Sr. (1830–1899), grandson of Aquilla Wheless. His mother Myra McCall, died when he was young, and his brothers and sisters were by his father's second wife.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery County, Tn - Page 336 Turner Publishing Company - 2000 Joseph Wheless (b. 1830. d. 1899). son of Aquilla Wheless, married in 1853. Myra McCall and had one son. Joseph Wheless. attorney, of St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/ref&gt; Wheless was raised Southern Methodist but later questioned the verity of the scriptures, studying their sources in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Wheless, ''Is It God's Word'' (1926), Forward.&lt;/ref&gt; As a lawyer he defended American [[free-thinking]] and [[atheist]] organizations, was instructor in military jurisprudence at the [[University of Arkansas]] and held the rank of major in the department of the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]].&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett In search of Jesus: insider and outsider images - Page 210 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Also self-taught, Wheless was a successful lawyer and a very outspoken Jesus-was-a-myth writer. He studied for the bar while articled in his uncle's firm. Wheless served as counsel for several American free-thinking organizations and defended many cases involving issues of atheism. A specialist in South American law, he was also for some time an instructor in military jurisprudence at the University of Arkansas and a major in the Judge Advocate General's Department. For his writing on religious topics, he received the honorary DD from the University of Denver. According to Wheless not only had no one called Jesus ever lived, but Christianity and the Bible are based on deliberate fraud, Christianity's continued existence is a conspiracy using persecution and oppression to perpetuate its myths, to enslave people.

The '''Keetoowah Nighthawk Society''' was a [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] Native American organisation formed ''ca.'' 1900 that pledged itself and its followers to return to the traditional "old ways" of Indian life, led by [[Redbird Smith]], a Cherokee National Council and original [[Original Keetoowah Society|Keetoowah Society]] member, and forming in the Indian Territories of present-day Oklahoma.&lt;ref name = WeberOHS2009&gt;{{cite book | author = Weber, Michael Lee | year=2009 | chapter=Redbird Smith Movement | title=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture | location =  | publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society | url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=RE015 | access-date = March 9, 2017 | quote = &lt;!--FOLLOWING QUOTE IS PRESENTED FOR TIME BEING, IN FULL, SO IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NEW LEDE TEXT PRESENTED CLOSELY FOLLOWS WEBER'S PUBLISHED SUMMARY.--&gt;&lt;small&gt;[Temporary Appearing Quote:] In 1887 Congress approved the Dawes Severalty Act (General Allotment Act), which began the forced transfer of Indian tribal lands to individual ownership. The Dawes Commission brought that legislation to Indian Territory during the 1890s, and, backed by the 1898 Curtis Act, concluded a Cherokee allotment agreement in 1900. Resistance to allotment in the Cherokee Nation was led by the Keetoowah Society, a political organization formed by full bloods in 1859. / Redbird Smith (1850–1918), a Keetoowah and a Cherokee National Council member, believed that acculturation represented the greatest threat to his people. When Keetoowah Society leaders softened their antiallotment stance circa 1900, Smith formed the more traditional Nighthawk Keetoowah, a party that soon had approximately fifty-five hundred members. He vowed a return to the old ways and located the sacred wampum belts, which recorded Cherokee and Keetoowah history. In March 1902 he was arrested in Muskogee and compelled to register for allotment. Most Nighthawks, however, refused to comply. Consequently, the Dawes Commission enrolled Smith's defiant followers without their consent. / In 1907 the Cherokees became citizens of the state of Oklahoma. The Nighthawks hid in the eastern hills where, centered near Blackgum Mountain in Sequoyah County, they strove to preserve the ancient Cherokee culture and refused to acknowledge their tribal enrollment and allotments. They elected Smith their chief for life in 1908, but his movement had already declined. Redbird Smith, "the moving spirit" of the Nighthawk Keetoowah, died in November 1918.&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nighthawks arose in response to weakening resolve on the part of Cherokee leaders—including the original Keetoowah Society ([[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]: ᎩᏚᏩ ᎤᎾᏙᏢᎯ{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}), a political organization created by Cherokee Native American full bloods, in or about 1859—to continue their resistance on behalf of the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] after the [[Dawes Commission]] began forcing the transfer of Oklahoma tribal lands in the Indian Territory to individual ownership in the 1890s (a process termed ''allotment'').&lt;ref&gt;This was done on the basis of recent federal legislative acts that included the Dawes Severalty Act (General Allotment Act, 1887) and the Curtis Act (1898).

}}
The word "Keetoowah" is the name of an ancient Cherokee Township in the Eastern Homeland of the Cherokee, where all Cherokee originated after the migration and integration of various groups from the Great Lakes and Ozark Plateau Regions of the United States 3,000 years ago, based upon cultural and archaeological evidence.  There is also evidence in the modern culture to suggest that the ancient Keetoowah developed an ancient hereditary priesthood called the ''[[Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni]]'', who were a religious ruling class of the Keetoowah people and Cherokee Society for thousands of years.

According to Cherokee legend, when the population grew too large to sustain the Mother city, groups moved to new areas and created new Cherokee Communities and Mound Cities.  The residents of the city of Keetoowah called themselves "the Keetoowah People".  The ancient site of the Mother City of Keetoowah is still visible in Western North Carolina in the same general area as the [[Qualla Boundary]]. Keetoowah was an ancient "Mound" city and the central [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]] is still visible at the ancient townsite.  Moundbuilding was not confined to the Cherokee, but was a common construction method of various Mississippian cultures and earlier peoples for thousands of years throughout the Mississippi Basin.

Some Cherokee traditionalists refer to themselves as ''Ah-ni-ki-tu-wa-gi'' (spelled variously in local Oklahoma dialects as ''Ki-tu-wa'' or ''Gi-du-wa''), Keetoowah People.   The addition of the verb stem modifier "gi" indicates the word ''Ki-tu'-wa-gi'' means, "a gathering or putting together of the ''Ki-tu'-wa'' people", since "gi" means "to combine" in the Cherokee Language.  Most modern Cherokee speakers can no longer translate the word "Ki-tu-wa," as the meaning of the word has been lost. Ki-tu-wa means "the mother city" or "the center (spiritual center)" in the ancient [[Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni]] dialect.  The word ''Ki-tu'-wa-gi'', implies a religious or social gathering of the people.  Honoring the mother city was analogous to honoring ''[[Cherokee mythology|Selu]]'', the Cherokee Corn Mother of the ancient [[Green Corn Ceremony]], a concept that pervades Cherokee culture.

During the [[Green Corn Ceremony]] as practiced by the Cherokee, one of the two social dances performed is of ancient origin, and originated from the mother city of Keetoowah.  The dance is called ''ye-lu-le'' which means "to the center".  During this dance, all of the dancers shout ''ye-lu-le'' and move towards the fire in the center of the sacred dance circle . The dance symbolizes the dispersal of the sacred fire given to the Keetoowah people by the Creator and the Thunder Beings in their ancient legends.  During traditional Green Corn ceremonies, the Cherokee carried the coals of the central fire in Keetoowah to all the Cherokee communities; the coals were used to kindle the ceremonial fires for the dances in each Cherokee City or township.  The home fires in outlying Cherokee communities were extinguished before the ceremonies and re-lit from the coals of the fire kindled during the Green Corn dances.

The [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] was divided by the [[Dawes Commission]] in the 1890s.  The Dawes commission was tasked to force assimilation and breakup of tribal governments within Oklahoma by instilling the concept of land ownership among individual households of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].  The commission divided large sections of land into household allotments to eliminate the traditional governments of the Cherokee and other tribes, which were based on communal holding of land. As a consequence of the Dawes Commission programs, the Cherokee culture and society was destabilized and strictly controlled.  The federal government appointed chiefs of the tribe, who were reduced to administrators and carried out government programs intended to force assimilation of the Cherokee.

As part of assimilation, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government sponsored Indian boarding schools, where Cherokee and other Native American children attended away from their families.  They were prohibited from speaking their own languages or practicing their own religions and cultures. Over time, much of the Cherokee culture was lost. The remaining Cherokee during this period in history begin to adopt and integrate cultural practices of other tribes who were being forcibly removed into Oklahoma Territory.

===Redbird Smith===
[[File:Redbirdsmithphoto.png|thumb|right|150px|Photograph of Redbird Smith, from Starr (1921).&lt;ref name=Starr1921/&gt;]]
To resist the cultural erosion, [[Redbird Smith]] and other Cherokee leaders and elders formed a secret society, the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society, where they secretly practiced the traditional ceremonies and gatherings.  This group aimed to preserve much of the pre-removal culture, ceremonies, and beliefs of the Cherokee.

[[Redbird Smith]] was an influential Nighthawk member who revitalized traditional spirituality among Cherokees, beginning in the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He was born July 19, 1850, near the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas to parents traveling with other Cherokee to the Indian Territory from Georgia.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} His father, Pig Redbird Smith, was a devoted supporter of the Long House's group of eastern Indians' ancient rituals, customs and practices.  His mother, Lizzie Hildebrand Smith, was from a prominent Cherokee family.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During Redbird's childhood, his father committed him to the service of the Cherokee people in harmony with the ancient customs, and eventually he became chairman of the council.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1889 the Redbird Movement began, splitting from Keetoowah to create Keetoowah Nighthawk, a renewed and modernized Keetoowah Society that was more political, holding meetings at the ceremonial areas known as ''gatiyo'' (stomp grounds).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Descendants of the late chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] reintroduced Cherokee [[wampum]] belts to the Keetoowah.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although the Keetoowah Nighthawks were unsuccessful in forestalling the allotment of communal lands, they strongly opposed the program of allotment of the Cherokee tribal lands that the government had agreed to do, with much passion.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1908, the Keetoowah Nighthawk Council held an election.  As a result, Redbird Smith was chosen as chief and was known as the leader of the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society. Redbird Smith, great-grandfather of former Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chadwick "Corntassel" Smith, stated in the early 1900s:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
{{quote|I have always believed that the Great Creator had a great design for my people, the Cherokees. I have been taught that from my childhood up and now in my mature manhood I recognize it as a great truth. Our forces have been dissipated by the external forces, perhaps it has been just a training, but we must now get together as a race and render our contribution to mankind.

We are endowed with intelligence, we are industrious, we are loyal, and we are spiritual but we are overlooking the Cherokee mission on earth, for no man nor race is endowed with these qualifications without a designed purpose. Work and right training is the solution of my following. We as a group are still groping in darkness in many things, but this we know, we must work. A kindly man cannot help his neighbor in need unless he have a surplus and he cannot have a surplus unless he works. It is so simple and yet we have to continually remind our people of this.

Our Mixed-bloods should not be overlooked in this program of a racial awakening. Our pride in our ancestral heritage is our great incentive for handing something worth while to our posterity. It is this pride in ancestry that makes men strong and loyal for their principle in life. It is this same pride that makes men give up their all for their Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Mankiller, Wilma  &amp; Wallis, Michael | year = 2000 | orig-year = 1993 | title = Mankiller: A Chief and Her People | page = 170 | location = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 0312206623 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0312206623 | access-date = March 9, 2017}} No source appears to be given within the book for this primary source material.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Keetoowah Nighthawk Society has been revived by the Cherokee in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt;{{verification needed|date=March 2017}} In Redbird Smith's time, there were more than 20 Cherokee Stomp Grounds;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} the seven ceremonial dance grounds in Oklahoma today belong either to the Keetoowah tradition or the [[Four Mothers Society]].{{verification needed|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The society is fractured and is not affiliated with any particular Cherokee Nation, Band, or Tribe.  Members of the fragments of the original society are affiliated with many Cherokee communities in Oklahoma.  Some of the modern groups claiming to represent the original Keetoowah culture have integrated Christianity and various new age beliefs into their religious practices.

==In popular culture and media==
The KJRH-TV [[television documentary|documentary]], ''Spirit of the Fire'' (1984) documented the history of the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society,  recounting their preservation of traditional ceremonies and rituals practiced and by the early Oklahoma Cherokee people.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10990">{{see also|Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Latin Cathedral, Lviv}}
The '''Latin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archdiocese of Lviv]]''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Leopolitanus Latinorum}}) was erected on August 28, 1412 in the city of Lwow (today [[Lviv]]). It serves as a metropolitan see of the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. The principal patron of the Archdiocese is the [[Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy]].

Archdiocese of Lviv today is divided between Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church and Armenian Catholic Church. Armenian Catholic Church has only one diocese in Ukraine and vacant since 1954.

==History==
In 1909 [[Pope Pius X]] proclaimed the [[Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland]] and Blessed [[Jakub Strzemię]] to be the patrons of the Lviv archdiocese. In 1910 the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland became the principal patron. Nowadays the principal patron is the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy (NMP Łaskawa). The patron's day is celebrated on 1 April, the day when King of Poland [[Jan II Kazimierz Waza]] took an oath at the Lwów Cathedral in 1655, during "[[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]]," took vows of loyalty to God and declared the Mother of God to be the Queen of [[Poland]].

[[File:Eugène_Delacroix_-_Lycurgus_Consulting_the_Pythia_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|''Lycurgus Consulting the Pythia'' (1835/1845), as imagined by [[Eugène Delacroix]].]]

[[Pythia]] was the priestess presiding over the [[Oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]]. There are more than 500 supposed Oracular statements which have survived from various sources referring to the oracle at Delphi.  Many are anecdotal, and have survived as proverbs.  Several are ambiguously phrased, apparently in order to show the oracle in a good light regardless of the outcome.  Such prophecies were admired for their dexterity of phrasing. One such famous prediction was the answer to an unknown person who was inquiring as to whether it would be safe for him to join a military campaign; the answer was: "Go, return not die in war", which can have two entirely opposite meanings, depending on where a missing [[comma]] is supposed to be&amp;nbsp;– before or after the word "not".  Nevertheless, the Oracle seems consistently to have advocated peaceful, not violent courses generally.
The following list presents some of the most prominent and historically significant prophecies of Delphi.

==Early period==

===Lycurgus===
Some early oracular statements from Delphi may have been delivered to [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], the semi-legendary [[Sparta]]n lawgiver (fl. 8th century BC).

According to the report by [[Herodotus]] ([[Herodotus|Histories]] A.65, 2-4), Lycurgus visited and consulted the oracle before he applied his new laws to Sparta,
{{bq|quote=''Lycurgus, a man of reputation among the Spartans, went to the oracle at Delphi. As soon as he entered the hall, the priestess said in hexameter: [3] 'You have come to my rich temple, Lycurgus,/ A man dear to Zeus and to all who have Olympian homes./ I am in doubt whether to pronounce you man or god,/ But I think rather you are a god, Lycurgus.' [4] Some say that the Pythia also declared to him the constitution that now exists at Sparta, but the Lacedaemonians themselves say that Lycurgus brought it from Crete when he was guardian of his nephew Leobetes, the Spartan king.''&lt;ref&gt;''Herodotus'', with an English translation by A. D. Godley. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1920 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=65]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lycurgus built a constitution for the Spartans that combined features of a [[monarchy]] with two kings, a free population that owned equal shares of land&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Live of Lycurgus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Spartan State&lt;/ref&gt; and of a [[democracy]].

Both Xenophon and Plutarch also attribute to Lycurgus the introduction of a very cumbersome coinage made from iron (in order to prevent attachment to wealth). In the account of Plutarch and [[Diodorus]], this was also based on an oracular statement,
{{bq|quote=''Love of money and nothing else will ruin Sparta.''&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus VII.12.5, also Plutarch ''Moralia'' 239 ff&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The supposed oracular statement [[Postdiction|in retrospect was interpreted]] as being fulfilled as the gold and silver Sparta's soldiers sent home after the [[Peloponnesian War]] were to prove to be Sparta's undoing, according to Plutarch. It is not likely that this oracle was delivered, if it is at all historical, to Lycurgus himself, as [[coin]]age had not been introduced in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Royce Moore, [http://www.rosetta.bham.ac.uk/issue6/pythagoras-sparta/ Was Pythagoras Ever Really in Sparta?], Rosetta Journal Issue #06, Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===630 BC===
In 630 BC, the king of the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] went to Delphi to offer a gift on behalf of his native city, and was told by the oracle:
{{bq|quote=''that he should found a city in [[Libya]].''}}

Because the king did not know where Libya was, he did nothing. Later it did not rain on Thera for a considerable period, and to find out what could be done, the Therans again approached the oracle. She said:
{{bq|quote=''if they ... would make a settlement at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya, things would go better with them.''}}

To relieve the pressure from the drought, and following the advice of the oracle, the Therans sought advice from the [[Crete|Cretans]] as to where Libya was and a colony of Thera was established at [[Platea (Island)|Platea]]. But bad luck still followed them for another two years, so they visited the oracle a third time. She said:
{{bq|quote=''Know you better than I, fair Libya abounding in fleeces? Better the stranger than he who has trod it? Oh! Clever Therans!''&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;Arthur Stanley Pease, ''Notes on the Delphic Oracle and Greek Colonization'' (Classical Philology, Vol. 12, No. 1 (January, 1917), pp. 1-20)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Therans sought advice from the local Libyans who gave them a new site, and the colony prospered.

===595 BC===
In 595 BC, the affairs of the Oracle were felt too important to be left to the Delphians alone, and the sanctity of the site came to be protected by the [[Amphictyonic League]], a league of 12 cities in existence since 1100 BC. (The league had been named after [[Amphictyon]] of [[Thermopylae]], brother of [[Hellen]], the first Greek (or non-[[Pelasgian]]) King of [[Athens]].) In that year, nearby [[Kirra, Phocis|Kirra]] levied a toll on pilgrims, which ushered in the [[First Sacred War]]. After 5 years of struggle, the Oracle decreed that the site of Kirra be left fallow, sacred to [[Apollo]]. This ushered in a period of great prosperity.

===594 BC===
In 594 BC, [[Solon]], the Athenian lawgiver, seeking to capture the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] from [[Megara]] and [[Kirra, Phocis|Cirrha]] was told by the oracle:
{{bq|quote=''First sacrifice to the warriors who once had their home in this island,''&lt;br&gt;
''Whom now the rolling plain of fair Asopia covers,''&lt;br&gt;
''Laid in the tombs of heroes with their faces turned to the sunset,''}}

He did, and taking as volunteers 500 young Athenians whose ancestors came from [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], was successful in capturing the island that was to prove so important in later Athenian history. Solon never ceased to support and give credit to the oracle for its support in declaring the island was originally Ionian.

In framing his famous constitutional reforms for Athens, Solon again sought the advice of the oracle who told him:
{{bq|quote=''Seat yourself now amidships, for you are the pilot of Athens. Grasp the helm fast in your hands; you have many allies in your city.''}}

As a result, Solon refused the opportunity to become a revolutionary [[tyrant]], and created a constitution for which he, and Athens, were justly honoured. Through trial by [[jury]], a [[graduated tax]] system and the forgiveness of debts he prevented a growing gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots". But he refused to accept the [[confiscation]]s of the [[property]] of the rich, so creating an Athenian [[middle class]]. He secured an Oath from the Athenian Council of [[Magistrates]] that if they violated these laws they would dedicate a gold statue to the Oracle of Delphi of equal weight to themselves.&lt;ref name=fontenrose&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fontenrose |first=Joseph |title=The Delphic Oracle, Its Responses and Operations, with a Catalogue of Responses |publisher=University of California Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===560 BC===
In 560 BC, [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], in a trial of oracles, consulted all the famous oracles as to what he was doing on an appointed day. According to Herodotus, the oracle proclaimed:
{{bq|quote=''οἶδα δ'ἐγὼ ψάμμου τ᾽ ἀριθμὸν καὶ μέτρα θαλάσσης, καὶ κωφοῦ συνίημι, καὶ οὐ φωνεῦντος ἀκούω. ὀδμή μ᾽ ἐς φρένας ἦλθε κραταιρίνοιο χελώνης ἑψομένης ἐν χαλκῷ ἅμ᾽ ἀρνείοισι κρέεσσιν, ᾗ χαλκὸς μὲν ὑπέστρωται, χαλκὸν δ᾽ ἐπιέσται.''

[Translation: I count the grains of sand on the beach and measure the sea; I understand the speech of the dumb and hear the voiceless. The smell has come to my sense of a hard shelled tortoise boiling and bubbling with a lamb's flesh in a bronze pot: the cauldron underneath it is of bronze, and bronze is the lid.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1131&amp;pageno=18 |title=The history of Herodotus — Volume 1 by Herodotus |publisher=Project Gutenberg |access-date=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Delphi was declared the winner. Croesus then asked if he should make war on the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and if he should take to himself any allied force. The oracles to whom he sent this question included those at Delphi and Thebes. Both oracles gave the same response, that if Croesus made war on the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire. They further advised him to seek out the most powerful Greek peoples and make alliance with them.

Croesus paid a high fee to the Delphians and then sent to the oracle asking "Would his monarchy last long?" The Pythia answered:
{{bq|quote=''ἀλλ᾽ ὅταν ἡμίονος βασιλεὺς Μήδοισι γένηται, καὶ τότε, Λυδὲ ποδαβρέ, πολυψήφιδα παρ᾽ Ἕρμον φεύγειν μηδὲ μένειν μηδ᾽ αἰδεῖσθαι κακὸς εἶναι.''

[Translation: Whenever a [[mule]] shall become sovereign king of the Medians, then, Lydian Delicate-Foot, flee by the stone-strewn [[Hermus]], flee, and think not to stand fast, nor shame to be chicken-hearted.]&lt;ref name=grene&gt;Herodotus, "The History" trans. David Grene, The University of Chicago Press, 1988, I.55&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Croesus thought it impossible that a [[mule]] should be king of the [[Medes]] and thus believed that he and his issue would never be out of power. He thus decided to make common cause with certain Greek city-states and attack Persia.&lt;ref name=grene/&gt;

However, it was his empire, not that of the Persians, that was defeated, fulfilling the prophecy but not his interpretation of it. He apparently forgot that [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the victor, was half Mede (by his mother), half [[Persian people|Persian]] (by his father) and therefore could be considered a "mule".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, "Histories" (Penguin Classics, Harmondsworth&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bacchylides' ode,&lt;ref&gt;Bacchylides Ode 3.23-62.&lt;/ref&gt; composed for Hiero of Syracuse, who won the chariot race at Olympia in 468, Croesus with his wife and family mounted the funeral pyre, but before the flames could envelop the king, he was snatched up by [[Apollo]] and spirited away to the [[Hyperborea]]ns. Herodotus' version includes Apollo in more "realistic" mode: Cyrus, repenting of the immolation of Croesus, could not put out the flames until Apollo intervened.{{efn|Just such an intervention in extinguishing a funeral pyre was adapted by [[Hagiography|Christian hagiographers]] as a conventional [[literary topos|literary ''topos'']] in the martyrdom of saints.}}

===circa 550 BC===
In his biography of Pythagoras in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes Laërtius]] (3rd century AD) cites the statement of [[Aristoxenus]] (4th century BC) that [[Themistoclea]] taught Pythagoras his [[moral]] doctrines:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea|title=Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, BOOK VIII, Chapter 1. PYTHAGORAS (c. 582-500 B.C.)|work=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bq|quote=''Aristoxenus says that Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea.''}}

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (233-305 AD) calls her Aristoclea (''Aristokleia''), although there is little doubt that he is referring to the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Ménage, (1984), ''The history of women philosophers'', p. 48. University Press of America. "The person who is referred to as Themistoclea in Laertius and Theoclea in Suidas, Porphyry calls Aristoclea."&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry repeats the claim that she was the teacher of Pythagoras:&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bq|quote=''He (Pythagoras) taught much else, which he claimed to have learned from Aristoclea at Delphi.''}}

===about 525===
[[Herodotus]]  states &lt;ref&gt;Herodotus – [https://books.google.com/books?id=ijENAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA376 The history of Herodotus: A new English version, ed. with copious notes and appendices, illustrating the history and geography of Herodotus, from the most recent sources of information; and embodying the chief results, historical and ethnographical, which have been obtained in the progress of cuneiform and hieroglyphical discovery, Volume 2] from (...and, [[George Rawlinson|G Rawlinson]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YTCrx1KB3HQC&amp;dq=treasury%20Siphnos&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks The Histories]) [Retrieved 2015-3-19]&lt;/ref&gt; that during the time of the founding of the [[Siphnian Treasury]], the Siphnians were told:

{{bq|quote= "... When the Prytanies' seat shines white in the island of Siphnos, White-browed all the forum – need then of a true seer's wisdom – Danger will threat from a wooden boat, and a herald in scarlet ...''}}

==Classical Period==

===480 BC===
In 480 BC, when [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], the son of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]] of Persia, returned to finish the job of conquering the Greeks in which his father had failed, the Athenians consulted the oracle. They were told:
{{bq|quote=''Now your statues are standing and pouring sweat. They shiver with dread. The black blood drips from the highest rooftops. They have seen the necessity of evil. Get out, get out of my sanctum and drown your spirits in woe.''&lt;ref name=fontenrose/&gt;}}

It was unambiguous.  When persuaded to seek advice a second time, the oracle gave a way for the Athenians to escape their doom. When Athena approached her father to help her city,  Zeus responded that he would grant that "''a wall of wood alone shall be uncaptured, a boon to you and your children''."&lt;ref name=fontenrose/&gt;

The oracle again advised the Athenians to flee:
{{bq|quote=''Await not in quiet the coming of the horses, the marching feet, the armed host upon the land. Slip away. Turn your back. You will meet in battle anyway. O holy [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], you will be the death of many a woman's son between the seedtime and the harvest of the grain.''&lt;ref name=fontenrose/&gt;}}

Meanwhile, the Spartans also consulted the oracle and were told:
{{bq|quote=''The strength of bulls or lions cannot stop the foe.  No, he will not leave off, I say, until he tears the city or the king limb from limb.''&lt;ref name=fontenrose/&gt;}}

or in a version according to Herodotus:
{{bq|quote=''Hear your fate, O dwellers in Sparta of the wide spaces;&lt;br&gt;
''Either your famed, great town must be sacked by Perseus' sons,''&lt;br&gt;
''Or, if that be not, the whole land of Lacedaemon''&lt;br&gt;
''Shall mourn the death of a king of the house of Heracles,''&lt;br&gt;
''For not the strength of lions or of bulls shall hold him,''&lt;br&gt;
''Strength against strength; for he has the power of Zeus,''&lt;br&gt;
''And will not be checked until one of these two he has consumed.''&lt;ref&gt;[[George Campbell Macaulay|Macaulay, G. C.]] "Section on Delphi and the Pythian oracle from Herodotus Book VII 140-3."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Spartans withdrew in consternation, wondering which fate was worse. The Delphians themselves then asked how Persia could  be defeated.  The oracle replied:

{{bq|quote=''Pray to the Winds. They will prove to be mighty allies of Greece.''&lt;ref&gt;[[George Campbell Macaulay|Macaulay, G. C.]] "Section on Delphi and the Pythian oracle from Herodotus Book VII 140-3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Events overtook the prophecy when the Persian [[Battle of Thermopylae|army assaulted]] [[Thermopylae]], where a Spartan-led coalition (popularly called the "300" after the number of Spartans sent (who were, excepting one man with an eye infection, killed to a man)) and allies held the pass against them. The Spartans under King [[Leonidas]] (The Lion) resisted the Persian advance at Thermopylae until betrayed.  Refusing to retreat, the entire Spartan contingent, including their King (as foretold), lost their lives, but in so doing gained immortal fame.  The Persian armada then sailed to nearby Cape [[Artemisium]], where they were met by the Athenian fleet. The Athenian ships fought against great odds, but in three battles managed to hold their own.

A tremendous storm then arose at Artemesium, with the most violent winds attacking the ships for three days. The Persians lost about 20% of their warships and perhaps the same number of transport vessels to the storm. The stormy winds and huge waves did not harm the Athenian ships.

Back in Athens [[Themistocles]] argued that the wall of wood referred to the Athenian navy and persuaded the Athenians to pursue their policy of using wealth from their Attic silver mines at [[Laurium]] to continue building their fleet.  On the grounds that the oracle referred to the nearby island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] as "holy", he claimed that those slain would be Greece's enemies, not the Athenians.  For these the oracle would have said "O cruel Salamis".  His voice carried the day, Athens was evacuated to Salamis and in a following naval battle the Athenian fleet and its allies destroyed the Persian fleet at Salamis, while watched by Xerxes. Despite the fact that Athens was burned by the Persians, her occupants were saved, the Persian threat was ended and the authority of the Oracle was never higher.

===440 BC===
{{Anchor|Meden_agan|Gnothi_seauton|Know_thyself}} ''Circa'' 440 BC the Oracle is also said to have said that there was no one wiser than [[Socrates]], to which Socrates said that either all were equally ignorant, or that he was wiser in that he alone was aware of his own ignorance ("[[I know that I know nothing|what I do not know I do not think I know]]"). This claim is related to one of the most famous mottos of Delphi, which Socrates said he learned there, ''[[Know thyself|Gnothi Seauton]]'' (γνῶθι σεαυτόν): "know thyself!". Another famous motto of Delphi is ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Meden agan}}'' ({{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}}): "nothing in excess" (literally, "nothing excessively").  Socrates was perhaps only about 30 years old at the time, his fame as a philosopher was yet to come.

One version of the claim stated that a friend of Socrates, Chaerephon, went before Pythia asking, "Is there any man alive wiser than Socrates?" The answer that he received was simply, "None." Another version is:&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, R Geuss - (professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge), R Speirs - [https://books.google.com/books?id=26IfImiDrJ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nietzsche:+The+Birth+of+Tragedy+and+Other+Writings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YSoxVdbCNc7faujQgagO&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nietzsche%3A%20The%20Birth%20of%20Tragedy%20and%20Other%20Writings&amp;f=false Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy and Other Writings (p.65, note 105)] Cambridge University Press, 22 Apr 1999 (reprint, revised) {{ISBN|0521639875}} [Retrieved 2015-04-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Sophocles is wise, Euripides is wiser, but of all men Socrates is wisest|}}

===431 BC===
At the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War the Spartans sent a delegation to Delphi to inquire whether it would be wise to go to war against Athens.  According to Thucydides, "It is said that the god replied that if they fought with all their might, victory would be theirs, and that he himself would be on their side, whether they invoked him or not."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, trans. Rex Warner, Penguin, 1954, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===403 BC===
In 403 BC, [[Lysander]], the Spartan victor of the [[Peloponnesian War]] was warned to beware:
{{bq|quote=''Also the dragon (serpent), earthborn, in craftiness coming behind thee.''&lt;ref name="Plutarch: On the Pythian Responses"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plutarch: On the Pythian Responses |url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/misctracts/plutarchVerses.html |accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was slain from behind in 395 BC by [[Neachorus]], who had a serpent painted upon his shield.

===401 BC===
In 401 BC, Sparta was warned:
{{bq|quote=''Sure though thy feet, proud Sparta, have a care,&lt;br&gt;
''A lame king's reign may see thee trip — Beware!''&lt;br&gt;
''Troubles unlooked for long shall vex thy shore,''&lt;br&gt;
''And rolling Time his tide of carnage pour.''&lt;ref name="Plutarch: On the Pythian Responses"/&gt;}}

[[Agesilaus II|Agesilaus]], the lame king of Sparta, who acceded to the Spartan throne at the time of Lysander, through attacking enemies in every quarter, lost control of the seas to the Persians who attacked Spartan coastal locations. In his obsession with Thebes, he incited the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] under [[Epaminondas]] to fight back. The Spartans were defeated for the first time by the Thebans in the [[battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC; this led to the invasion of Sparta itself and its defeat at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|battle of Mantinea]] in 362 BC.

===359 BC===
In 359 BC, [[Philip II of Macedon]] consulted the Oracle and was told:
{{bq|quote=''With silver spears you may conquer the world''}}

The king then sought to control the silver mines in the neighbouring Thracian and [[Illyrian kingdom]], and using them to bribe his way to early victories, playing one Greek state off against the others, and isolating his enemies by bribes to potential allies.

Philip also had a highly spirited black colt that no one could ride.  The Oracle of Delphi stated whoever could ride this horse would conquer the world, but despite many attempts neither Philip nor any of his generals could mount the horse.  His son, Alexander, later to be called the Great, succeeded as he realized that the horse was afraid of his own shadow.  Philip gave the horse [[Bucephalus]] to Alexander, who took the steed on his conquest of Asia.

In 353 BC, a third [[Third Sacred War|Sacred War]] broke out when Thebes had placed a fine upon [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]], and Phocis, to pay for the war, heavily taxed the people of nearby Delphi and seized the Treasury of Delphi.  The Amphictyonic League led by Philip declared war against Phocis.  Philip sought to unite all Greece with [[Macedon]] in the Amphictyonic League to attack Persia.

In 339 BC, Philip interfered once again against the Amphictyonic alliance when the [[Krissa]]ns trespassed on Apollo's sacred grounds. Philip punished the Krissans, and consequently in 338 BC. defeated the combined armies of the Athenians and the Spartans, thus becoming the dominant force in Greek affairs.  Eventually, at the Battle of [[Chaeronea]] he was successful against the Athenians and Thebans but he was assassinated before he could lead the invasion of Persia.

===336 BC=== 
Alexander the Great visited the Delphic Oracle wishing to hear a prophecy that he would soon conquer the entire ancient world. To his surprise the oracle refused a direct comment and asked him to come later. Furious, Alexander dragged Pythia by the hair out of the chamber until she screamed "You are invincible, my son!"

{{bq| quote=''ἀνίκητος εἶ ὦ παῖ.''&lt;ref&gt;Plut. ''Vit. Alex.'' 14.6-7, ed. B. Perrin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The moment he heard these words he dropped her, saying, "Now I have my answer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delphic-oracle.info/delphic-oracle.asp|title=Delphic Oracle - Oracle of Delphic region|work=delphic-oracle.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===about 300 BC===
[[Diogenes Laertius]] recorded that when [[Zeno of Citium]] "consulted the oracle, as to what he ought to do to live in the most excellent manner, the God answered him that he ought to become of the same complexion as the dead, on which he inferred that he ought to apply himself to the reading of the books of the ancients. Accordingly, he attached himself to [[Crates of Thebes]]...."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes7a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Period==

===279 BC===
In 279 BC, plundered by a [[Celt]]ic invasion, the oracle declared:
{{bq|quote=''Care for these things fall on me!''}}

The Celts were met by [[earthquakes]], [[avalanches]], and a massive snow storm, forcing them to retreat.  But the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were a different matter. In 191 BC, the sanctuary of Delphi fell into the Roman sphere of influence, and the oracle generally supported the rise of Rome henceforth.

===83 BC===
In 83 BC, Delphi was razed by an attack from the [[Thrace|Thracian]] tribe of [[Maedi]] who extinguished the sacred fire which had been burning uninterrupted for centuries. At the time of [[Pompey the Great]], [[Cicero]], Pompey's ally, consulted the Oracle as to how he should find greatest fame and was told:
{{bq|quote=''Make your own nature, not the advice of others, your guide in life''.}}

Pompey was subsequently defeated by [[Julius Caesar]].  Cicero cultivated his oratory and his skills in the courts in preserving Rome from the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catilinarian conspiracy]], earning undying fame.

===67 AD===
In 67 AD, [[Emperor]] [[Nero]], who was just 30 years old and had killed his own mother in 59 AD, when visiting the Oracle was told:
{{bq|quote=''Your presence here outrages the god you seek. Go back, [[matricide]]! The number 73 marks the hour of your downfall!''}}

He was angered and had the Pythia burned alive.  Nero thought he would have a long reign and die at 73.  Instead his reign came to a short end after a revolt by [[Galba]] who was 73 years of age at the time.

===Before 117 AD===
Before 117 AD the Emperor [[Hadrian]] visited Delphi before he reached the throne.  After drinking of the [[Kassotis]], his destiny as Emperor was proclaimed.  When he had acceded to the throne, he ordered it blocked up so no one else could get the same idea in the same way.

===302 AD===

===362 AD===
Hagiography has it that in 362, on behalf of his emperor Julian the Apostate, Oribasius visited the Delphic oracle, now in a rather desolate state, offering his emperor's services to the temple and, in return, receiving one of the last prophecies by the Delphic Pythia
{{bq|quote=''Tell the emperor that my hall has fallen to the ground. Phoibos no longer has his house, nor his mantic bay, nor his prophetic spring; the water has dried up.''}}
Fontenrose doubts the authenticity of this oracle, characterizing it a "Christian oracle, devised to show that the Delphic Apollo foresaw the mission of Christ and the end of Oracles."&lt;ref name="fontenrose"/&gt;

===393 AD===
The last recorded oracle was in 393 AD when by order of Emperor [[Theodosius I]] the temple was closed and never reopened.   The Oracle declared ''all is ended''.  Within 5 years the Emperor was dead and 15 years later [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and the Visigoths captured Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Grindle, Gilbert (1892) The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire, pp.29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logos Foundation''' was an influential and controversial [[Christian]] ministry that flourished in [[Australia]] in the 1970s and 1980s, under the leadership of [[Howard Carter (Evangelist)|Howard Carter]], originally a Baptist pastor from Auckland, New Zealand. Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry, and primarily [[Protestant]] but with some ties with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] lay groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Logos Foundation was [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]], Restorationist, and [[Dominionism|Dominionist]] in its theology and works.

==Early history==
It was established by Paul Collins c.1966 in New Zealand as a trans-denominational teaching ministry serving the [[Charismatic Renewal]] through publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins  moved it to Sydney, Australia, c.1969, where it also facilitated  large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook, lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales for a few years, and in the mid-1970s to Blackheath, upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like-minded fellowships and home groups into loose association with it.

Publishing became a significant operation, distributing  charismatic themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre-eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine, USA). It held annual weeklong conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including [[Derek Prince]], [[Ern Baxter]], [[Don Basham]], [[Charlie Simpson (pastor)|Charles Simpson]], Bob Mumford, [[Kevin Conner]] (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others.

A Bible College was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, [[Mountains Christian Academy]] was established which was a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the [[Old Covenant]] practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this.

Theologically it taught orthodox Christian core beliefs - however in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged.  Those who questioned this teaching tended to leave the movement eventually.  Over time, a strong cult-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question were quickly brought into line by other members with automated responses shrouded in spiritualised expression.  In some instances the leadership engaged in bullying-type behavior to enforce unquestioning compliance.  The group viewed itself as separate from 'the world' and any alternative views and even other expressions, deonominations or interpretations of Christianity were regarded at best as suspect but mostly as false.

From the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the [[Shepherding Movement]]'s whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their "cell group" leader), who in turn were accountable also to their personal pastors.  Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, USA (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak c.1985). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with [[Ern Baxter]], a pioneer of the [[Healing Revival]] of the 1950s and the [[Charismatic Renewal]] of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time.

In 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name, Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the Covenant Evangelical Church (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the USA). The Logos Foundation brand name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the [[Covenant Evangelical Church]].

It moved for the final time in 1986 to [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]] where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements.  This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/cb4cc218-5145-a604-f5ec-180d9177971d/1/Hey_2011_02Thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1980s move to Queensland==
The move to [[Toowoomba]] involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in [[New South Wales]] and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the [[Darling Downs]].

In the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, it absorbed a number of other small [[Christian]] Churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations.  Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals.

Carter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature.  More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more authoritarian and cultish. Colin Shaw was a key member at this time, who believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an "anointed man of God" and Shaw later became the "right-hand" man of Carter in his "outreach and missionary works" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used this Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored under the Christian Renewal Centre's name, conferences featuring Carter.   Many poorly educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches were influenced to support the wider Logos movement and to tithe from their limited funds into it. However, soon after the revelation of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to abandon the Shepherding movement at this time and engaged in soul searching and self exile for a time, fueled by severe guilt over the way these Filipino Christians were manipulated.

In 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the [[Queensland]] State election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]].  Published advertisements in the Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty.  Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, "Sex Scandal - Bible Belt", p.74&lt;/ref&gt; This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream Churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing them.&lt;ref&gt;https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law.&lt;ref&gt;https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sex Scandal - Bible Belt", Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when they published, "Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, "The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching.  Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also".  These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated "the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, J., God Remains an Issue in Queensland, Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar behaviours existed prior, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation develop cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power.  Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of 'spiritual covering' became a dominant theme in their teaching.  This idea of spiritual covering soon perverted into a system of overt abuse of power over people's lives. This occurred despite opposition to the [[Shepherding Movement|Shepherding movement]] from respected evangelical and Pentecostal leaders in the United States beginning as early as 1975.  However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time that it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America.  Followers in Australia, were effectively quarantined by Carter from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A.

==Other connections==
The movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), California; Christian Growth Ministries, [[Fort Lauderdale]]; and [[Rousas Rushdoony]], the father of [[Christian Reconstructionism]] in the United States. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home schooling and ministry training.  Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word "University".  Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree in 1987 which was apparently issued by the ''Pacific College Theological'',{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} an institution whose existence has been unable to be verified when investigated by journalists.  Visiting preachers from the United States were frequently gifted such 'qualifications' by Carter including a PhD purportedly issued by the ''University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus''.  The recipient thereafter used the title of ''Doctor'' in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America.

==Demise, dissolution and ongoing influence today==
The Shepherding movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements.   It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people, to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of  traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix.  Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position.

The Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not survive long the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of  adultery in 1990.  Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis, "Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability".&lt;ref&gt;https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/cb4cc218-5145-a604-f5ec-180d9177971d/1/Hey_2011_02Thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Like many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, he was placed on a pedestal by the movement's followers.  This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability, allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years.  In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed.  Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first class flights and five-star hotels.  The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive.  Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were being channelled nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds were being managed.

A significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba.

'''Love Jihad''' or '''Romeo Jihad''' is a term used to describe alleged campaigns under which Muslim men target women belonging to non-Muslim communities for [[conversion to Islam]] by feigning love.&lt;ref name="Common" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth" /&gt; There is no official evidence supporting these claims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muzaffarnagar-love-jihad-beef-bogey-sparked-riot-flames/article1-1120889.aspx |title=Muzaffarnagar: 'Love jihad', beef bogey sparked riot flames |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Common"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ananthakrishnan G |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Love-Jihad-racket-VHP-Christian-groups-find-common-cause/articleshow/5117548.cms |title='Love Jihad' racket: VHP, Christian groups find common cause |publisher=Times of India |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/hadiya-case-myth-love-jihad-india-170823181612279.html|title=The Hadiya case and the myth of 'Love Jihad' in India|last=Khalid|first=Saif|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept rose to national attention in India in 2009 with alleged conversions in [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]].

In November 2009, [[Director general of police|DGP]] [[Jacob Punnoose]] stated there was no organisation whose members lured girls in [[Kerala]] by feigning love with the intention of converting. He told the [[Kerala High Court]] that 3 out of 18 reports he received expressed some doubts about the tendency. However, in absence of solid proof the investigations were still continuing.&lt;ref name="deccanherald_2009-11-11"/&gt; In December 2009, Justice [[K.T. Sankaran]] who refused to accept Punnoose's report concluded from a case diary that there were indications of forceful conversions and stated it was clear from police reports there was a "concerted effort" to convert women with "blessings of some outfits". The court while hearing bail plea of two accused in "love jihad" cases stated that there had been 3,000-4,000 such conversions in past four years.&lt;ref name="Stop"/&gt; The Kerala High Court in December 2009 stayed investigations in the case, granting relief to the two accused though it criticised police investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-love-jihad-kerala-high-court-stays-police-investigation-1324828 'Love jihad': Kerala high court stays police investigation] DNA News&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was closed by Justice M. Sasidharan Nambiar following Punnoose's statements that no conclusive evidence could be found for existence of "love jihad".&lt;ref name="Myth"/&gt;

The Karnataka government stated in 2010 that although a large number of women had converted to Islam, there was no organized attempt to convince them to do so.&lt;ref name="thehindu_2010-04-23"/&gt; In 2012, after two years of investigation into the alleged ''love jihad'', Kerala Police declared it as a "campaign with no substance". Subsequently, a case was initiated against the website where fake posters of Muslim organisations offering money to Muslim youths for luring and trapping women were found.&lt;ref name="Myth"/&gt; [[Uttar Pradesh Police]] in September 2014 found no evidence of attempted or forced conversion in five of six reported cases" of ''love jihad'' reported to them in past three months. Police said sporadic cases of trickery by unscrupulous men are not evidence of a broader conspiracy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2017, after the Kerala High Court ruled that a marriage of a Hindu woman to a Muslim man was invalid on the basis of ''love jihad'', and an appeal was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] by the Muslim husband where court, based on the "unbiased and independent" evidence requested by the court from [[National Investigation Agency|NIA]], instructed NIA to investigate all similar cases for establishing the pattern of love jihad. It allowed NIA to explore all similar suspicious incidences to find whether banned organisations, such as [[Students Islamic Movement of India|SIMI]], are preying on vulnerable Hindu women to recruit them as terrorists.&lt;ref name=lovewar1&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-nia-to-examine-kerala-love-jihad-cites-blue-whale-1738417 "Top Counter-Terror Agency, NIA, To Probe Kerala 'Love Jihad' Marriage."], [[NDTV]], 16 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lovewar2&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/60089937.cms "NIA probe on 'love jihad' may cover all suspicious cases."], [[The Economic Times|Economic Times]], 16 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lovewar3&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-hears-its-1st-love-jihad-case-demands-proof-from-nia/articleshow/59923249.cms "Supreme Court hears its 1st 'love jihad' case, demands proof from NIA"], [[The Times of India]], 5 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lovewar4&gt;[https://in.news.yahoo.com/kerala-apos-love-jihad-apos-100217357.html "Kerala 'Love Jihad' Case: NIA to Assess Ramifications on National Security."], CNN News18, 10 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; NIA had earlier submitted before the court that the case was not an "isolated" incident and it had detected a pattern emerging in the state, stating that another case involved the same people who acted as instigators.&lt;ref name=ordersprobe/&gt;

The concept first rose to national attention in India in 2009, with claims of widespread conversions in [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]], but claims have subsequently spread throughout India and beyond, into Pakistan and the United Kingdom. With waves of publicity in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014, the allegations of Love Jihad in India have raised concerns in various [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] and Christian organizations, while Muslim organisations have denied the allegations. The concept has remained a source of political contention and social concern for many, although as of 2014 the idea of an organized Love Jihad was still widely regarded as a [[conspiracy theory]] by the Indian mainstream, according to ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

In August 2017, the [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA) stated that it had found a common mentor in some love jihad cases in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 2017 |title=NIA finds a common mentor in Kerala 'love jihad' cases |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-finds-a-common-mentor-in-kerala-love-jihad-cases/articleshow/60250975.cms | newspaper=Times of India |location=New Delhi |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp;amp; Co.Ltd. |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a later article in ''[[The Economist]]'', "Repeated police investigations have failed to find evidence of any organised plan of conversion. Reporters have repeatedly exposed claims of "love jihad" as at best fevered fantasies and at worst, deliberate election-time inventions."&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=India is working itself into a frenzy about interfaith marriages|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21729806-hindu-nationalists-warn-muslim-plot-seduce-hindu-women-india-working-itself-frenzy|work=[[The Economist]]|date=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same report, the common theme regarding many claims of "love jihad" have been the frenzy objection to an interfaith marriage while "Indian law erects no barriers to marriages between faiths, or against conversion by willing and informed consent. Yet the idea still sticks, even when the supposed “victims” dismiss it as nonsense."&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt; The Government of India has banned [[talaaq|triple talaaq]] in India to avoid Muslim men from abusing it and giving their wives, irrespective of the wife's religion, instant divorce{{snd}} it is being seen as a mechanism to avoid Muslim men from abusing it for "love jihad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 January 2018 |title=Triple talaq in times of love jihad: Banning instant triple talaq’s a good idea but won’t build bridges between Muslims and BJP |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/triple-talaq-in-times-of-love-jihad-banning-instant-triple-talaqs-a-good-idea-but-wont-build-bridges-between-muslims-and-bjp | newspaper=Times of India |location=New Delhi |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp;amp; Co.Ltd. |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious conversion through emotional appeal ===
''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Conversion'' notes that the effectiveness of emotional appeals in converting people from one faith to another is well known and often exploited by religious leaders.&lt;ref name="RamboFarhadian2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rambo|first1=Lewis R.|last2=Farhadian|first2=Charles E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Conversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U03gAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|date=18 February 2014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], [[United States|US]]|isbn=978-0-19-971354-7|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious groups have utilized techniques like [[love bombing]] and [[Flirty Fishing]] to interest potential recruits.&lt;ref name="RamboFarhadian2014" /&gt; Love Jihad is an alleged activity wherein Muslim youth utilize such emotional appeals, using charm to entice girls into conversion by feigning love{{snd}} in some reports, as an organized, funded behavior.&lt;ref name="Common" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Piqued"&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Love jihad' piqued US interest | date = 6 September 2011 | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Love-jihad-piqued-US-interest/articleshow/9877883.cms?referral=PM| work = The Times of India | accessdate = 8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handsome"&gt;{{cite news | first = Dean | last = Nelson | title = Handsome Muslim men accused of waging 'love jihad' in India | date = 13 October 2009 | publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/6316966/Handsome-Muslim-men-accused-of-waging-love-jihad-in-India.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional historical tensions ===
In a piece picked up by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' correspondent Siddhartha Mahanta reports that the modern Love Jihad conspiracy has roots in the 1947 [[partition of India]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This partition led to the creation of the [[sovereign state]]s of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] (it later split into the [[Pakistan|Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] and the [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]]) and the [[Union of India]] (later [[India|Republic of India]]). The creation of two countries with different majority religions led to large-scale migration, with millions of people moving between the countries and rampant reports of sexual predation and forced conversions of women by men of both faiths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BHAVNANI2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhavnani|first=Nandita|title=The Making of Exile: Sindhi Hindus and the Partition of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_8aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT253|date=29 July 2014|publisher=Westland|isbn=978-93-84030-33-9|pages=253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuynhD'Costa2015"/&gt; Women on both sides of the conflict were impacted, leading to "recovery operations" by both the Indian and Pakistani governments of these women, with over 20,000 Muslim and 9,000 non-Muslim women being recovered between 1947 and 1956.&lt;ref name="HuynhD'Costa2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huynh|first1=Kim|author2=Bina D'Costa|author3=Katrina Lee-Koo|title=Children and Global Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAS7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|date=30 April 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-29876-3|pages=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tense history caused repeated clashes between the faiths in the decades that followed as well, according to Mahanta, as cultural pressure against interfaith marriage for either side.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As of 2014, Hindus were the leading religious majority in India, at 81%, with Muslims at 13%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://online.wsj.com/articles/hindu-activists-in-india-warn-women-to-beware-of-love-jihad-1409874089|title = Hindu Activists in India Warn Women to Beware of 'Love Jihad'|last = Mandhana|first = Niharika|date = 4 September 2014|work = The Wall Street Journal|accessdate = 6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage traditions and customs ===
{{See also|Interfaith marriage in Islam|Interfaith marriage#Views of Hinduism}}
India has a long tradition of [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged marriages]], wherein the bride and groom do not self-select their partners. Through the 2000s and 2010s, India witnessed a rise in [[love marriages]], although tensions continue around interfaith marriages, along with other traditionally discouraged unions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.voanews.com/content/indian-laws-culture-boost-inter-faith-marriages-147373205/180237.html|title = Indian Laws, Culture Boost Inter-Faith Marriages|last = |first = |date = 12 August 2002|work = Voice of America|accessdate = 7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.mumbaimirror.com/others/sunday-read/Jihad-in-the-time-of-love/articleshow/41290908.cms|title = Jihad in the time of love|last = |first = |date = 31 August 2014|work = Mumbai Mirror|accessdate = 7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[The Hindu]]'' reported that illegal intimidation against consenting couples engaging in such discouraged unions, including inter-religious marriage, had surged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/law-commissions-new-draft-wants-khap-panchayats-on-marriages-declared-illegal/article2829231.ece|title = Law Commission's new draft wants khap panchayats on marriages declared illegal|last = Dhar|first = Aarti|date = 24 January 2012|work = The Hindu|accessdate = 7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Uttar Pradesh saw the proposal of an amendment to remove the requirement to declare religion from the marriage law in hopes of encouraging those who were hiding their interfaith marriage due to social norms to register.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

One of the tensions surrounding interfaith marriage relates to concerns of required, even [[Forced conversion|forced]], [[marital conversion]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two booked for forcing wives to embrace Islam in Madhya Pradesh|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Two-booked-for-forcing-wives-to-embrace-Islam-in-Madhya-Pradesh/articleshow/41251910.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marriage in Islam]] is a legal contract with requirements around the religions of the participants. While Muslim women are only permitted within the contract to marry Muslim men, Muslim men may marry "[[People of the Book]]", interpreted by most to include [[Jews]] and [[Christians]], with the inclusion of [[Hindus]] disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Voices of Islam: Voices of life : family, home, and society|last = Cornell|first = Vincent J.|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2007|isbn = 9780275987350|location = |page = 61|quote = This includes Jew, Christians and Sabeans (a sect that most Muslims believe no longer exists).

The Sikh Council received reports in 2014 that girls from British Sikh families were becoming victims of Love Jihad.

According to the Takht jathedar, "The Sikh council has rescued some of the victims (girls) and brought them back to their parents."&lt;ref name="HT Correspondent"/&gt;

Various organisations have joined together against this perceived conduct. Christian groups, such as the [[Christian Association for Social Action]], and the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) banded against it, with the VHP establishing the [[Hindu Helpline]] that it indicates answered 1,500 calls in three months related to "Love Jihad".&lt;ref name="Common" /&gt; The [[Union of Catholic Asian News]] (UCAN) has reported that the [[Catholic Church]] is concerned about this alleged phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Concerned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/2009/10/13/church-state-concerned-about-love-jihad |title=Church, state concerned about ´love jihad´ |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018162826/http://www.ucanews.com/2009/10/13/church-state-concerned-about-love-jihad |archivedate=18 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vigilance Council of the [[Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council]] (KCBC) raised an alert for the Catholic community against the practice.&lt;ref name="beware" /&gt; In September, posters appeared in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]] under the name of right-wing group [[Shri Ram Sena]] warning against "Love Jihad".&lt;ref name="Poster"&gt;{{cite web |author=Babu Thomas |title= Poster campaign against 'Love Jihad'|url= http://newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/article157178.ece|publisher= expressbuzz.com |date= 26 September 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group announced in December that it would launch a nationwide "Save our daughters, save India" campaign to combat "Love Jihad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Rama-Sene-to-launch-Save-our-daughters-Save-India/articleshow/5181924.cms?referral=PM |title='Rama Sene to launch 'Save our daughters Save India' |publisher=times of India |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the "Love Jihad" controversy resurfaced in the press when Kerala Chief Minister [[V. S.

In December 2011, the controversy erupted again in Karnataka legislative assembly, when [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|member]] Mallika Prasad of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] asserted that the problem was ongoing and unaddressed{{snd}} with, according to her, 69 of 84 Hindu girls who had gone missing between January and November of that year confessing after their recovery that "they'd been lured by Muslim youths who professed love."&lt;ref name="hate" /&gt; According to ''The Times of India'', response was divided, with Deputy Speaker N.

That same month, the alleged phenomenon was raised by [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] leader during a protest organized by [[Hindu Hitarakshana Vedike]] about the arrest and reported mistreatment of 15 people on an unrelated matter, when Sangh suggested that police feared to interfere with Muslim youth who practice "Love Jihad" and cautioned young Hindu women against using cell phones, suggesting these play a major role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=124942 | title = Sullia: Prabhakara Bhat Resents Injustices Inflicted on Hindu Society | work = [[Daijiworld Media|Daijiworld.com]] | date = 17 December 2011 | accessdate  = 22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also raised by filmmaker [[Paromita Vohra]], who labeled the phenemonen as VHP [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/love-sting-aur-dhoka/888514/1 | title = Love, Sting Aur Dhoka | date = 18 December 2011 | first = Paromita | last = Vohra | accessdate = 22 December 2011 | work = The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, controversial BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj claimed that Muslim boys in madrasas are being motivated for Love Jihad with proposals of rewards of, "Rs 11 lakh for an "affair" with a Sikh girl, Rs 10 lakh for a Hindu girl and Rs 7 lakh for a Jain girl."

On 13 October, ''[[India Today]]'' reported that the woman who claimed in Love-Jihad case that she had been gang-raped and forcefully converted into Islam, changed her statement and said to the Police that she had in fact eloped with the accused.

===2016-18===

{{main|Hadiya court case}}

In May 2017, the [[Kerala High Court]] annulled a marriage of a converted Hindu woman Akhila alias Hadia to a Muslim man Shafeen Jahan on the grounds that the bride's parents were not present, nor gave consent for the marriage, after allegations by her father of conversion and marriage at the behest of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]]. It ordered the [[Director general of police|DGP]] of Kerala to investigate cases of "love jihad" and probe incidents of forced conversion, emphasising "the existence of an organisational setup functioning behind the scenes of such cases of 'love jihad' and conversions." The decision was apparently taken based on large number of radicalised youths from Kerala joining ISIS. It also observed, "Are there any radical organisations involved, are questions that plague an inquisitive mind. But sadly, there are no answers available in this case."&lt;ref name=ITangle/&gt; The father had claimed that his daughter had been radicalised and influenced to marry a Muslim man by some organisations so she no longer remained in her parents' custody.&lt;ref name=ITchallenge/&gt;

The woman's father, Ashokan Mani, had earlier filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in January 2016 after she disappeared from the campus where she studied. He alleged his daughter was forcefully converted to Islam, and his family were reportedly told by her that she was being held against her will by two of her classmates Jaseena Aboobacker and her sister Faseena. However, after she was found, Akhila claimed that she was following Islam since 2012 and left her home out of her own will. She also stated that she was not under any confinement against her free will. She stated that she had come under the religion's influence after hearing its teachings from her roommates. She said that she had joined a course run by Tharibathul Islam Sabha, [[Kottakkal]] to learn Islam. In her affidavit, she stated she lived with Aboobacker for a brief period and then shifted to Satyasarani's hostel in [[Manjeri]], an institution allegedly promoting conversion to Islam and reported to be closely connected with the [[Popular Front of India]]. The institution introduced her to Sainaba in [[Ernakulam]] with whom she lived after her father filed the petition. The court allowed her to stay with Sainaba and later dismissed Ashokan's petition in June 2016, after she produced records of her admission to Satyasarani. Two months later, he filed another petition and alleged that his daughter was converted at the behest of ISIS and feared she may be taken to join it in Afghanistan, citing cases of two Kerala women joining the group after conversion and marriage to Muslim men. By December, Akhila had married Shafeen and Ashokan's petition came up for hearing in January 2017. Akhila showed the marriage certificate and marriage registration certificate, but it was annulled.&lt;ref name=ITangle&gt;{{cite web |title=Kerala High Court nullifies woman's marriage with Muslim man after bride's father raises Islamic State angle|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kerala-high-court-hindu-muslim-islamic-state/1/962622.html|publisher=[[India Today]] |date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITchallenge/&gt;

V. Raveendran]] on 16 August while the NIA had earlier submitted that the woman's conversion and marriage was not "isolated" and it had detected a pattern emerging in the state, stating they came across another case involving the same people.&lt;ref name=ordersprobe&gt;{{cite web |title=Supreme Court orders NIA probe into Kerala woman's conversion and marriage case |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/supreme-court-orders-nia-probe-into-kerala-womans-conversion-and-marriage/article19501689.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIA has stated that the husband in this case was allegedly in touch with two individuals charged in another [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-related case and that one of these individuals may have coordinated the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 December 2017  |title=Hadiya's 'husband' was in touch with IS men before their marriage: NIA |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hadiyas-husband-was-in-touch-with-is-men/articleshow/61908549.cms | newspaper=Times of India |location=New Delhi |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp;amp; Co.Ltd. |accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court on 8 March 2018 overturned the annulment of Hadiya's marriage by the Kerala High Court and held that the she had married out of her own free will. However, it allowed NIA to continue investigation into the allegations of a terror angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/hadiya-s-marriage-to-shefin-stays-supreme-court-overturns-kerala-high-court-order-1184561-2018-03-08|title=Hadiya's marriage restored, Supreme Court says no love jihad|work=India Today|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the Karnataka government announced its intentions to counter "Love Jihad", which "appeared to be a serious issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Karnataka to take steps to counter 'Love Jihad' movement |url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/31814/karnataka-take-steps-counter-love.html |publisher = Deccan Herald|date = 22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the announcement, the government ordered a probe into the situation by the [[Criminal Investigation Department (India)|CID]] to determine if an organised effort existed to convert these girls and, if so, by whom it was being funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Govt-directs-CID-to-probe-love-jihad/articleshow/5166639.cms?referral=PM |title=Govt directs CID to probe 'love jihad' |publisher=Times of India |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One woman whose [[conversion to Islam]] came under scrutiny as a result of the probe was temporarily ordered to the custody of her parents, but eventually permitted to return to her new husband after she appeared in court, denying pressure to convert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Love-jihad-HC-orders-thorough-probe-by-DGP/articleshow/5146769.cms?referral=PM |title=Love jihad: HC orders thorough probe by DGP |publisher=Times of India |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/woman-denies-love-jihad-court-lets-her-to-go-with-lover_100274297.html |title=Woman denies 'love jihad', court lets her to go with lover |publisher=Thaindian News |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, police used the term to characterize the alleged kidnapping, forced conversion and marriage of a 17-year-old college girl in [[Mysore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysore/Love-Jihad-girl-rescued/articleshow/5767968.cms?referral=PM |title=Love Jihad: girl rescued |publisher=Times of India |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launching of a poster campaign in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, purportedly by organisation Shri Ram Sena, state police began investigating the presence of that organisation in the area.&lt;ref name=Poster/&gt; In late October 2009, police addressed the question of "Love Jihad" itself, indicating that while they had not located an organisation called "Love Jihad", "there are reasons to suspect 'concentrated attempts' to persuade girls to convert to Islam after they fall in love with Muslim boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/31958/no-love-jihad-kerala.html |title=No 'Love Jihad' in Kerala |publisher=Deccan Herald |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian Express"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/kerala-hc-wants-probe-into-love-jihad/523630/2|title= Kerala HC wants probe into 'love jihad'|publisher=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; They documented unconfirmed reports of a foreign-funded network of groups encouraging conversion through the subterfuge, but noted that no organisations conducting such campaigns had been confirmed and no evidence had been located to support foreign financial aid.&lt;ref name="mathrubhumi"&gt;{{cite news|title=DGP suspects presence of 'Love Jihad' in Kerala |url=http://www.mathrubhumi.org/news.php?id=25130 |publisher=Mathrubhumi }}{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, The Karnataka [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CID]] (Criminal Investigation Department) reported that although it was continuing to investigate, it had found no evidence that a "Love Jihad" existed.&lt;ref name="thehindu_2009-11-13"&gt;

On 9 December 2009, Justice K T Sankaran for the Kerala High Court weighed in on the matter while hearing bail for Muslim youth arrested for allegedly forcibly converting two campus girls. According to Sankaran, police reports revealed the "blessings of some outfits" for a "concerted" effort for religious conversions, some 3,000 to 4,000 incidences of which had taken place after love affairs in a four-year period.&lt;ref name="Stop"&gt;{{cite news |title = Kerala HC asks govt to frame laws to stop 'love jihad' |url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-12-10/news/28410696_1_love-jihad-religious-conversions-religions |publisher = The Economic Times|date = 10 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankaran "found indications of 'forceful' religious conversions under the garb of 'love'", suggesting that "such 'deceptive' acts" might require legislative intervention to prevent.&lt;ref name="Stop" /&gt;

According to ''[[The Indian Express]]'', Sankaran's conclusion that "such incidents under the pretext of love were rampant in certain parts of the state" ran contrary to Central and state government reports.&lt;ref name="check"&gt;{{cite news |title = HC calls for law to check 'love jehad' |url =  http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/hc-calls-for-law-to-check--love-jehad-/552275 |publisher = The Indian Express|date = 10 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2010, the State Government reported to the Karnataka High Court that although a large number of young Hindu women had converted to Islam, there was no organized attempt to convince them to do so.&lt;ref name="thehindu_2010-04-23"/&gt;

In January 2012, Kerala police declared that Love Jihad was "[a] campaign with no substance", bringing legal proceedings instead against the website hindujagruti.org for "spreading religious hatred and false propaganda.".&lt;ref name="Myth" /&gt; 

In September 2014, following the resurgence of national attention,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Reuters'' reported that police in Uttar Pradesh had found no credence in the five or six recent allegations of Love Jihad that had been brought before them, with state police chief [[A.L. Banerjee]] stating that, "In most cases we found that a Hindu girl and Muslim boy were in love and had married against their parents' will."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They reportedly indicated that "sporadic cases of trickery by unscrupulous men are not evidence of a broader conspiracy."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

That same month, the [[Allahabad High Court]] gave the government and election commission of Uttar Pradesh 10 days to respond to a petition to restrain the use of the word "Love Jihad" and to take action against [[Yogi Adityanath]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/04/indias-fake-love-jihad/|title = India's Fake 'Love Jihad'|first = Siddhartha|last=Mahanta|date = 5 September 2014|work = [[Foreign Policy]]|accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/love-jihad-high-court-up-govt-ec-pil-yogi-adityanath-41383.html?ref=veng|title = Love Jihad: High Court asks UP govt, EC to file response|last = |first = |date = 4 September 2014|work = India TV|accessdate = 6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-love-jihad-row-allahabad-high-court-issues-notice-to-centre-uttar-pradesh-government-2016143|title = 'Love-jihad' row: Allahabad High Court issues notice to Centre, Uttar Pradesh government|last = |first = |date = 4 September 2014|work = [[Daily News and Analysis|DNA]]|accessdate = 6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
In general, MDMA users report feeling the onset of subjective effects within 30–60 minutes of MDMA consumption and reaching the peak effect at 75–120 minutes, which then plateaus for about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="mcn"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liechti ME, Gamma A, Vollenweider FX | title = Gender differences in the subjective effects of MDMA | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11314678 | doi = 10.1007/s002130000648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The desired short-term psychoactive effects of MDMA have been reported to include:
* [[Euphoria]] – a sense of general [[well-being]] and happiness&lt;ref name=Current2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;
* Increased self-confidence, sociability and feelings of communication being easy or simple&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Current2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;
* [[Entactogen]]ic effects – increased [[empathy]] or feelings of closeness with others&lt;ref name=Current2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt; and oneself&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;
* Relaxation and reduced anxiety&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;
* Increased emotionality&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;
* A sense of inner peace&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;
* Mild hallucination&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;
* Enhanced sensation, perception, or sexuality&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Current2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;
* Altered sense of time&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

The experience elicited by MDMA depends on the dose, setting, and user.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt; The variability of the induced altered state by MDMA is lower compared to other psychedelics. For example, MDMA used at parties is associated with high motor activity, reduced sense of self-identity as well as poor awareness of the background surroundings. Use of MDMA individually or in a small groups in a quiet environment and when concentrating, is associated with increased lucidity, capability of concentration, sensitivity of aesthetic aspects of the background and emotions, as well as greater capability of communication with others.&lt;ref name="pmid22392347" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landriscina"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landriscina F |title=MDMA and the states of Consciousness|journal=Eleusis|date=1995|volume=2|pages=3–9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychotherapeutic settings MDMA effects have been described by infantile ideas, alternating phases of mood, sometimes memories and moods connected with childhood experiences.&lt;ref name="Landriscina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baggott"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggott MJ, Kirkpatrick MG, Bedi G, de Wit H | title = Intimate insight: MDMA changes how people talk about significant others | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 669–77 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25922420 | pmc = 4698152 | doi = 10.1177/0269881115581962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

===Recreational===

MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the [[rave]] culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and [[house party|house parties]].&lt;ref name="pmid22392347" /&gt; In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly [[Synergy|synergistic]] with the drug. The psychedelic [[amphetamine]] quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon | name-list-format = vanc |title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-92373-6|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&amp;q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDMA is used less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.&lt;ref name=Epstein2013/&gt;

MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and [[ketamine]], an act called "candy-flipping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Capuzzi|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Gross|editor2-first=Douglas R.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Youth at Risk: A Prevention Resource for Counselors, Teachers, and Parents|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-02694-5|page=379 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=s7iTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=mdma+flipping#v=onepage&amp;q=flipping&amp;f=false |date=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!--Users sometimes use [[menthol]]ated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}--&gt;

===Forms===

MDMA has become widely known as ecstasy (shortened "E", "X", or "XTC"), usually referring to its tablet form, although this term may also include the presence of possible [[adulterant]]s or dilutants. The UK term "mandy" and the US term "molly" colloquially refer to MDMA in a crystalline powder form that is thought to be free of adulterants.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DrugFacts/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEA 2015 assessment" /&gt; MDMA is also sold in the form of the hydrochloride salt, either as loose crystals or in [[Capsule (pharmacy)|gelcaps]].&lt;ref name="Molly S05E07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Molly S06E05" /&gt;

In part due to the global supply shortage of [[sassafras oil]], substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain [[methylone]], [[ethylone]], [[MDPV]], [[mephedrone]], or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]].&lt;ref name=DrugFacts /&gt;&lt;ref name="DEA 2015 assessment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Molly S05E07"&gt;{{cite AV media |date=13 August 2014 |title=Molly Madness |medium=TV documentary |url= &lt;!--Link for WP:V - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-0Zw05A1Y0 --&gt;|publisher=National Geographic Channel | work = [[Drugs, Inc.]] |asin=B00LIC368M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molly S06E05"&gt;{{cite AV media |date=10 December 2014 |title=Manic Molly |medium=TV documentary |url= &lt;!--Link for WP:V - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd1-triBJFw --&gt;|publisher=National Geographic Channel | work = [[Drugs, Inc.]] |asin=B00LIC368M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity.&lt;ref name=EU2015 /&gt; MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents.&lt;ref name=EU2015 /&gt; Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA), [[3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine]] (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt; Some tablets contain little or no MDMA.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /&gt; The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country.&lt;ref name=EU2015 /&gt; The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120&amp;nbsp;mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;

MDMA is usually consumed by mouth. It is also sometimes [[insufflation (medicine)|snorted]].&lt;ref name=Drugs2014/&gt;

==Adverse effects==

===Short-term===
Acute adverse effects are usually the result of high or multiple doses, although single dose toxicity can occur in susceptible individuals.&lt;ref name="Current2013" /&gt; The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are [[hyperthermia]] and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyponatremia" /&gt; Cases of life-threatening or fatal [[hyponatremia]] (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attempting to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amounts of water without replenishing [[electrolytes]].&lt;ref name="Acute amph toxicity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyponatremia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hyperpyrexia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White CM | title = How MDMA's pharmacology and pharmacokinetics drive desired effects and harms | journal = Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–52 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24431106 | doi = 10.1002/jcph.266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinforcement disorders===
&lt;!--Dependence--&gt;
Approximately 60% of MDMA users experience [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms when they stop taking MDMA.&lt;ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /&gt; Some of these symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, and trouble concentrating.&lt;ref name="Toxnet MDMA"/&gt; [[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to some of the desired&lt;!-- (e.g., euphoria) - need ref--&gt; and adverse&lt;!-- (e.g., loss of appetite) - need ref--&gt; effects of MDMA is expected to occur with consistent MDMA use.&lt;ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /&gt; A 2007 analysis estimated MDMA to have a psychological dependence and physical dependence potential roughly three fourths and four fifths that of cannabis.&lt;ref name="pmid17382831"/&gt;

&lt;!--Addiction--&gt;
MDMA has been shown to induce [[ΔFosB]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]].&lt;ref name="MDMA ΔFosB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olausson P, Jentsch JD, Tronson N, Neve RL, Nestler EJ, Taylor JR | title = DeltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens regulates food-reinforced instrumental behavior and motivation | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 36 | pages = 9196–204 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957076 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1124-06.2006 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/36/9196.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because MDMA releases dopamine in the [[striatum]], the mechanisms by which it induces ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens are analogous to other dopaminergic psychostimulants.&lt;ref name="MDMA ΔFosB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction | journal = Nature Reviews.

===Harm assessment===
A 2007 UK study ranked MDMA 18th in harmfulness out of 20 recreational drugs. Rankings for each drug were based on the risk for acute physical harm, the propensity for physical and psychological dependency on the drug, and the negative familial and societal impacts of the drug. The authors did not evaluate or rate the negative impact of ecstasy on the cognitive health of ecstasy users (e.g. impaired memory and concentration).&lt;ref name="pmid17382831"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nutt D, King LA, Saulsbury W, Blakemore C | title = Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9566 | pages = 1047–53 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17382831 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4 | laydate = 23 March 2007 | laysource = Scientists want new drug rankings, BBC News | authorlink4 = Colin Blakemore | layurl = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6474053.stm | authorlink1 = David Nutt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overdose==
MDMA overdose symptoms vary widely due to the involvement of multiple organ systems. Some of the more overt overdose symptoms are listed in the table below. The number of instances of fatal MDMA intoxication is low relative to its usage rates. In most fatalities MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by [[serotonin syndrome]] and [[sympathomimetic]] effects.&lt;ref name=Steinkellner2011/&gt;  MDMA's toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut (mixed with to increase volume).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanattou-Saïfoudine N, McNamara R, Harkin A | title = Caffeine provokes adverse interactions with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') and related psychostimulants: mechanisms and mediators | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 167 | issue = 5 | pages = 946–59 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22671762 | pmc = 3492978 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02065.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme for management of acute MDMA toxicity has been published focusing on treatment of hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, serotonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall AP, Henry JA | title = Acute toxic effects of 'Ecstasy' (MDMA) and related compounds: overview of pathophysiology and clinical management | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 678–85 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16595612 | doi = 10.1093/bja/ael078 | url = https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/96/6/678/326917/Acute-toxic-effects-of-Ecstasy-MDMA-and-related#4457537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDMA acts primarily as a presynaptic [[releasing agent]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]], which arises from its activity at [[TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1]] (TAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2).&lt;ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller GM | title = The emerging role of trace amine-associated receptor 1 in the functional regulation of monoamine transporters and dopaminergic activity | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–76 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21073468 | pmc = 3005101 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.07109.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugbank MDMA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Midomafetamine| url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01454 | work=DrugBank | publisher= University of Alberta | access-date=15 May 2018 | date=2 May 2018 | quote = It enters neurons via carriage by the monoamine transporters.

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:MDMA en.pdf|thumb|Diagram showing the sequence of MDMA metabolization]]
MDMA reaches maximal [[concentration]]s in the [[blood stream]] between 1.5 and 3 hours after [[ingestion]].&lt;ref name="TORRE1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrie LE, Donald F | title = A 26-gauge pencil-point needle for combined-epidural anaesthesia for caesarean section | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–1 | date = March 1991 | pmc = 2014905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00121.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then slowly [[metabolism|metabolized]] and [[excretion|excreted]], with levels of MDMA and its metabolites decreasing to half their peak concentration over the next several hours.&lt;ref name="TORRE2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de la Torre R, Farré M, Roset PN, Lopez CH, Mas M, Ortuño J, Menoyo E, Pizarro N, Segura J, Cami J | title = Pharmacology of MDMA in humans | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 914 | issue = 1 | pages = 225–37 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11085324 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05199.x | bibcode = 2000NYASA.914..225D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of action of MDMA is usually four to six hours, after which serotonin levels in the brain are depleted.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt; Serotonin levels typically return to normal within 24–48 hours.&lt;ref name=Betzler2017/&gt;

[[Metabolite]]s of MDMA that have been identified in humans include [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA), [[4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine]] (HMMA), [[4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine|4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine]]&lt;!--File:HMA2.png--&gt; (HMA), [[Alpha-Methyldopamine|3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine]] (DHA) (also called alpha-methyldopamine (α-Me-DA)), [[MDP2P|3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone]] (MDP2P), and [[Methylenedioxyhydroxyamphetamine|3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine]] (MDOH). The contributions of these metabolites to the psychoactive and [[toxic]] effects of MDMA are an area of active research. 80% of MDMA is metabolised in the liver, and about 20% is excreted unchanged in the [[urine]].&lt;ref name="pmid22392347"/&gt;

MDMA is known to be metabolized by two main [[metabolic pathway]]s: (1) ''O''-demethylenation followed by [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyltransferase]] (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) ''N''-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding [[benzoic acid]] derivatives conjugated with [[glycine]].&lt;ref name=pmid15228154&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de la Torre R, Farré M, Roset PN, Pizarro N, Abanades S, Segura M, Segura J, Camí J | title = Human pharmacology of MDMA: pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and disposition | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–44 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15228154 | doi = 10.1097/00007691-200404000-00009 | quote = It is known that some recreational drugs (e.g., MDMA or GHB) may hamper the potential to ejaculate or maintain an erection. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolism may be primarily by [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] (CYP450) [[enzyme]]s [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]] and COMT. Complex, nonlinear [[pharmacokinetics]] arise via autoinhibition of [[CYP2D6]] and CYP2D8, resulting in [[rate equation|zeroth order kinetics]] at higher doses.

===Detection in body fluids===
MDMA and MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDMA or its major metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.&lt;ref&gt;Kolbrich EA, Goodwin RS, Gorelick DA, Hayes RJ, Stein EA, Huestis MA.

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] chemist [[Anton Köllisch]]. At the time, Merck was interested in developing substances that stopped abnormal bleeding. Merck wanted to avoid an existing patent held by [[Bayer]] for one such compound: [[hydrastinine]]. Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine [[chemical analogue|analogue]], methylhydrastinine, at the request of fellow lab members, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes. MDMA (called methylsafrylamin, safrylmethylamin or N-Methyl-a-Methylhomopiperonylamin in Merck laboratory reports) was an [[reaction intermediate|intermediate compound]] in the synthesis of methylhydrastinine.

Merck records indicate its researchers returned to the compound sporadically. A 1920 Merck patent describes a chemical modification to MDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shulgin |first1=Alexander T. |editor1-last=Peroutka |editor1-first=Stephen J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ecstasy : the clinical, pharmacological, and neurotoxicological effects of the drug MDMA|date=1990|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-7923-0305-3|pages=2, 14|chapter=1. History of MDMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to [[adrenaline]] or [[ephedrine]], the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on [[vascular smooth muscle]] tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no "local effect at the eye". MDMA was also found to have effects on [[blood sugar]] levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Research was stopped "particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid17152992"/&gt;

Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA. In 1953 and 1954, the [[United States Army]] commissioned a study of [[toxicity]] and behavioral effects in animals injected with [[mescaline]] and several analogues, including MDMA. Conducted at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], these investigations were declassified in October 1969 and published in 1973.&lt;ref name="pmid4197635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardman HF, Haavik CO, Seevers MH | title = Relationship of the structure of mescaline and seven analogs to toxicity and behavior in five species of laboratory animals | journal = Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 299–309 | date = June 1973 | pmid = 4197635 | doi = 10.1016/S0041-008X(73)80016-X | url = http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&amp;ID=639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulgin/&gt; A 1960 Polish paper by Biniecki and Krajewski describing the synthesis of MDMA as an intermediate was the first published scientific paper on the substance.&lt;ref name="pmid17152992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shulgin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biniecki S, Krajewski E |title=Production of d,1-N-methyl-beta-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-isopropylamine and d,1-N-methyl-beta-(3,4-dimthoxyphenyl)-isopropylamine.|journal=Acta Polon Pharm|date=1960|volume=17|pages=421–5|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shulgin's research ===
[[File:Shulgin sasha 2011 hanna jon.jpg|thumb|Alexander and Ann Shulgin in December 2011]]

American chemist and [[psychopharmacologist]] [[Alexander Shulgin]] reported he synthesized MDMA in 1965 while researching methylenedioxy compounds at [[Dow Chemical Company]], but did not test the psychoactivity of the compound at this time. Around 1970, Shulgin sent instructions for N-methylated MDA (MDMA) synthesis to the founder of a Los Angeles chemical company who had requested them. This individual later provided these instructions to a client in the Midwest. Shulgin may have suspected he played a role in the emergence of MDMA in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Shulgin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzenhöfer U, Passie T | title = Rediscovering MDMA (ecstasy): the role of the American chemist Alexander T. Shulgin | journal = Addiction | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 1355–61 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20653618 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02948.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shulgin first heard of the psychoactive effects of N-methylated MDA around 1975 from a young student who reported "amphetamine-like content".&lt;ref name="Shulgin"/&gt; Around 30 May 1976, Shulgin again heard about the effects of N-methylated MDA,&lt;ref name="Shulgin"/&gt; this time from a graduate student in a medicinal chemistry group he advised at [[San Francisco State University]]&lt;ref name="Professor X"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander ‘Sasha’ Shulgin|url=http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/about/alexander-sasha-shulgin/|publisher=Alexander Shulgin Research Institute|access-date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who directed him to the University of Michigan study.&lt;ref name=PiHKAL/&gt; She and two close friends had consumed 100&amp;nbsp;mg of MDMA and reported positive emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=Shulgin/&gt; Following the self-trials of a colleague at the [[University of San Francisco]], Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in September and October 1976.&lt;ref name="Shulgin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Professor X"/&gt; Shulgin first reported on MDMA in a presentation at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland in December 1976.&lt;ref name="Shulgin"/&gt; In 1978, he and [[David E. Nichols]] published a report on the drug's psychoactive effect in humans. They described MDMA as inducing "an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones" comparable "to marijuana, to [[psilocybin]] devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA".&lt;ref name="isbn0-08-021938-1"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Shulgin AT, Nichols DE |editor1=Willette, Robert E. |editor2=Stillman, Richard Joseph |title = The Psychopharmacology of Hallucinogens.|publisher = Pergamon Press|location = New York|year = 1978|pages = 74–83|chapter = Characterization of Three New Psychotomimetics|isbn = 978-0-08-021938-7 |url = http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=961&amp;DocPartID=832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not finding his own experiences with MDMA particularly powerful,&lt;ref name=PiHKAL/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"/&gt; Shulgin was impressed with the drug's disinhibiting effects and thought it could be useful in therapy.&lt;ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"/&gt; Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug "window".&lt;ref name=PiHKAL/&gt;&lt;ref name="rising"/&gt; Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as "my low-calorie martini", and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it.&lt;ref name=PiHKAL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shulgin|first1=Alexander|last2=Shulgin|first2=Ann | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=Alexander Shulgin|authorlink2=Ann Shulgin|title=[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL : A Chemical Love Story]]|date=1991|publisher=Transform Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-9630096-0-9|edition=7th printing, 1st|chapter= Chapters 12, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such person was [[Leo Zeff]], a psychotherapist who had been known to use psychedelic substances in his practice. When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff was impressed with the effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the United States and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA.&lt;ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"&gt;{{cite news|first = Drake|last = Bennett|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html|title = Dr. Ecstasy.|work = New York Times Magazine |date = 30 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shulgin|first1=Ann|author1-link=Ann Shulgin|editor1-last=Doblin|editor1-first=Rick|editor1-link=Rick Doblin | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Secret Chief Revealed|date=2004|publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|location=Sarasota, Fl|isbn=978-0-9660019-6-9 |pages=17–18|edition=2nd|url=http://maps.org/images/pdf/books/scr/scr.pdf|access-date=7 January 2015|chapter=Tribute to Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeff named the drug "'''Adam'''", believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.&lt;ref name="Professor X"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ethan| name-list-format = vanc |title=Professor X|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/professorx.html?pg=3&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=|publisher=Wired|access-date=4 January 2015|date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychotherapists who used MDMA believed the drug eliminated the typical fear response and increased communication. Sessions were usually held in the home of the patient or the therapist. The role therapist was minimized in favor of patient self-discovery accompanied by MDMA induced feelings of empathy. Depression, substance abuse, relationship problems, premenstrual syndrome, and autism were among several psychiatric disorders MDMA assisted therapy was reported to treat.&lt;ref name=exploration/&gt; According to psychiatrist George Greer, therapists who used MDMA in their practice were impressed by the results. Anecdotally, MDMA was said to greatly accelerate therapy.&lt;ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"/&gt; According to [[David Nutt]], MDMA was widely used in the western US in couples counseling, and was called "empathy". Only later was the term "ecstasy" used for it, coinciding with rising opposition to its use.&lt;ref name=Nutt/&gt;

===Rising recreational use===

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, "Adam" spread through personal networks of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, users of psychedelics, and [[yuppies]]. Hoping MDMA could avoid criminalization like LSD and mescaline, psychotherapists and experimenters attempted to limit the spread of MDMA and information about it while conducting informal research.&lt;ref name="exploration"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pentney AR | title = An exploration of the history and controversies surrounding MDMA and MDA | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 213–21 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11718314 | doi = 10.1080/02791072.2001.10400568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisner/&gt; Early MDMA distributors were deterred from large scale operations by the threat of possible legislation.&lt;ref name="Beck &amp; Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Jerome|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Marsha| name-list-format = vanc |title=Pursuit of Ecstasy : The MDMA Experience|date=1994|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-1817-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwdedK36bVMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=The Distribution of Ecstasy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, this network of MDMA users consumed an estimated 500,000 doses.&lt;ref name=Current2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0803936788"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doblin|first1=Rick|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Marsha|editor1-last=Inciardi|editor1-first=James A.| name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=Rick Doblin|title=The Drug Legalization Debate|date=1991|publisher=[[Sage Publications]], Inc.|location=London|isbn=978-0-8039-3678-2 |edition=2nd|url=http://www.drugtext.org/pdf/Dance/party-drugs-clubbing/why-mdma-should-not-have-been-made-illegal.pdf|access-date=10 August 2015|chapter=Chapter 6: Why MDMA Should Not Have Been Made Illegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media attention and scheduling===

====United States====
[[File:Federal Register notice of planned MDMA scheduling.pdf|thumb|27 July 1984 Federal Register notice of the proposed MDMA scheduling]]

In an early media report on MDMA published in 1982, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) spokesman stated the agency would ban the drug if enough evidence for abuse could be found.&lt;ref name="Beck &amp; Rosenbaum"/&gt; By mid-1984, MDMA use was becoming more noticed. Bill Mandel reported on "Adam" in a 10 June [[San Francisco Chronicle]] article, but misidentified the drug as [[MMDA (drug)|methyloxymethylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MMDA). In the next month, the World Health Organization identified MDMA as the only substance out of twenty phenethylamines to be seized a significant number of times.&lt;ref name="Eisner" /&gt;

After a year of planning and data collection, MDMA was proposed for [[Controlled Substances Act|scheduling]] by the DEA on 27 July 1984 with a request for comments and objections.&lt;ref name=Eisner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances Proposed Placement of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine in Schedule I|journal=Federal Register|date=27 July 1984|volume=49|issue=146|page=30210|url=http://maps.org/research-archive/dea-mdma/pdf/0194.PDF|access-date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing.&lt;ref name="exploration"/&gt; In a [[Newsweek]] article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adler |first1=Jerry |last2=Abramson |first2=Pamela |last3=Katz |first3=Susan |last4=Hager |first4=Mary | name-list-format = vanc |title=Getting High on 'Ecstasy' |url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/hmma/Newsweek4.85.pdf |access-date=1 February 2015 |work=Newsweek Magazine |date=15 April 1985|location=Life/Style|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C. with administrative law judge Francis L.

Sensational media attention was given to the proposed criminalization and the reaction of MDMA proponents, effectively advertising the drug.&lt;ref name=exploration/&gt; In response to the proposed scheduling, the Texas Group increased production from 1985 estimates of 30,000 tablets a month to as many as 8,000 per day, potentially making two million ecstasy tablets in the months before MDMA was made illegal.&lt;ref name=comprehensive&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holland|first1=Julie|editor1-last=Holland|editor1-first=Julie| name-list-format = vanc |title=Ecstasy: the complete guide; a comprehensive look at the risks and benefits of MDMA|date=2001|publisher=Park Street Press|location=Rochester, VT|isbn=978-0-89281-857-0 |chapter=The History of MDMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some estimates the Texas Group distributed 500,000 tablets per month in Dallas alone.&lt;ref name=rising/&gt; According to one participant in an [[ethnographic]] study, the Texas Group produced more MDMA in eighteen months than all other distribution networks combined across their entire histories.&lt;ref name="Beck &amp; Rosenbaum"/&gt; By May 1985, MDMA use was widespread in California, Texas, southern Florida, and the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name="Siegel 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; According to the DEA there was evidence of use in twenty-eight states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDMA – FDA REPORT, 1985|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_law3.shtml|website=Erowid|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=11 August 2015|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref name="Siegel 1986"/&gt; Urged by Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]], the DEA announced an [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984|emergency Schedule I classification]] of MDMA on 31 May 1985.

As a result of several expert witnesses testifying that MDMA had an accepted medical usage, the administrative law judge presiding over the hearings recommended that MDMA be classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] substance.

Lawn]] overruled and classified the drug as Schedule I.&lt;ref name=exploration/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harpers&gt;{{cite news|title= Ecstasy has its pros and cons|newspaper= Kokomo Tribune| location = Kokomo, Indiana| date = 23 November 1985 | page=6| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Robert_Thomas/clipnumber/34618/ |agency=Harper's Bazaar |via=newspaperarchive.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Harvard psychiatrist [[Lester Grinspoon]] sued the DEA, claiming that the DEA had ignored the medical uses of MDMA, and the federal court sided with Grinspoon, calling Lawn's argument "strained" and "unpersuasive", and vacated MDMA's Schedule I status. Despite this, less than a month later Lawn reviewed the evidence and reclassified MDMA as Schedule I again, claiming that the expert testimony of several psychiatrists claiming over 200 cases where MDMA had been used in a therapeutic context with positive results could be dismissed because they weren't published in medical journals.&lt;ref name=exploration/&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} No double blind studies had yet been conducted as to the efficacy of MDMA for therapy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====United Nations====
While engaged in scheduling debates in the United States, the DEA also pushed for international scheduling.&lt;ref name=comprehensive/&gt; In 1985 the [[World Health Organization]]'s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 United Nations [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The committee made this recommendation on the basis of the pharmacological similarity of MDMA to previously scheduled drugs, reports of illicit trafficking in Canada, drug seizures in the United States, and lack of well-defined therapeutic use. While intrigued by reports of psychotherapeutic uses for the drug, the committee viewed the studies as lacking appropriate methodological design and encouraged further research. Committee chairman [[Paul Grof]] dissented, believing  international control was not warranted at the time and a recommendation should await further therapeutic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Twenty-second Report.|date=1985|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241207299|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_729.pdf|access-date=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019192225/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_729.pdf|format=PDF|archive-date= 19 October 2014|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] added MDMA to Schedule I of the convention on 11 February 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/Drug_Resolutions/1980-1989/1986/CND_Decision-1986-07_S-IX.pdf |title=Decision to place MDMA into Schedule I |publisher=Commission on Narcotic Drugs |date=11 February 1986 |website=UNODC |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After MDMA was criminalized, most medical use stopped, although some therapists continued to prescribe the drug illegally. Later,{{when|date=January 2015}} Charles Grob initiated an ascending-dose safety study in healthy volunteers. Subsequent legally-approved MDMA studies in humans have taken place in the US. in Detroit ([[Wayne State University]]), Chicago ([[University of Chicago]]), San Francisco (UCSF and [[California Pacific Medical Center]]), [[Baltimore]] ([[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]]–[[NIH]] Intramural Program), and [[South Carolina]], as well as in Switzerland (University Hospital of Psychiatry, [[Zürich]]), the Netherlands ([[Maastricht University]]), and Spain ([[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.org/research/ Bibliography of Psychedelic Research Studies.] collected by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011733/http://www.maps.org/research/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the BBC reported that use of MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years. This may be due to increased seizures during use and decreased production of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture MDMA. Unwitting substitution with other drugs, such as [[mephedrone]] and [[methamphetamine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scientopia.org/blogs/drugmonkey/2010/09/19/mephedrone-4-methylmethcathinone-appearing-in-ecstasy-in-the-netherlands/|title=Mephedrone (4-Methylmethcathinone) appearing in "Ecstasy" in the Netherlands |date=19 September 2010|access-date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as legal alternatives to MDMA, such as [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[Methylenedioxypyrovalerone|MDPV]], and [[methylone]], are also thought to have contributed to its decrease in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8468372.stm|title=Why ecstasy is 'vanishing' from UK nightclubs |date=19 January 2010|publisher=BBC News|access-date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 it was found that some pills being sold as MDMA contained [[pentylone]], which can cause very unpleasant agitation and paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Joe | last1 = Bish | name-list-format = vanc |title=Watch Out for Pentylone, the Horrible New MDMA Additive |journal=Vice |date=Aug 4, 2017 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/pagjxg/watch-out-for-pentylone-the-horrible-new-mdma-additive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Nutt]], when [[safrole]] was restricted by the United Nations in order to reduce the supply of MDMA, producers in China began using [[anethole]] instead, but this gives [[para-methoxyamphetamine]] (PMA, also known as "Dr Death"), which is much more toxic than MDMA and can cause overheating, muscle spasms, seizures, unconsciousness, and death. People wanting MDMA are sometimes sold PMA instead.&lt;ref name=Nutt&gt;[http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-low/proto/http/vpid/p0687kzh.mp3 Ecstasy on Prescription], BBC Business Daily, May 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{Global estimates of illicit drug users}}

===Legal status===
MDMA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.

====Australia====
In Australia, MDMA was declared an illegal substance in 1986 because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is classed as a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance]] in the country, meaning it is available for scientific research purposes only. Any other type of sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized [[National Health and Medical Research Council|ethics committee]] on human research.

In [[Western Australia]] under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]] 4.0g of MDMA is the amount required determining a court of trial, 2.0g is considered a presumption with intent to sell or supply and 28.0g is considered trafficking under Australian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1981|url=https://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_4607_homepage.html|publisher=The Government of Western Australia|agency=Department of the Premier and Cabinet|date=23 October 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, MDMA was made illegal in 1977 by a modification order to the existing [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. Although MDMA was not named explicitly in this legislation, the order extended the definition of Class A drugs to include various ring-substituted phenethylamines.&lt;ref name="Drugs 2.0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Power|first1=Mike| name-list-format = vanc |title=Drugs 2.0 : the web revolution that's changing how the world gets high|date=2013|publisher=Portobello|location=London|isbn=978-1-84627-459-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gj6zMQEACAAJ&amp;dq=Drugs+2.0|format=epub file}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK legality"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=57&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1367412&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1367472&amp;filesize=411 Misuse of Drugs Act 1971].

Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.

Some researchers such as [[David Nutt]] have criticized the current scheduling of MDMA, which he determines to be a relatively harmless drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ecstasy 'no more dangerous than horse riding'|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/4537874/Ecstasy-no-more-dangerous-than-horse-riding.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nutt DJ | title = Equasy-- an overlooked addiction with implications for the current debate on drug harms | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19158127 | doi = 10.1177/0269881108099672 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881108099672?ssource=mfr&amp;rss=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An editorial he wrote in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, where he compared the risk of harm for horse riding (1 adverse event in 350) to that of ecstasy (1 in 10,000) resulted in his dismissal as well as the resignation of his colleagues from the ACMD.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/02/drug-policy-alan-johnson-nutt|title=Why Professor David Nutt was shown the door|last=Johnson|first=Alan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2 November 2009|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=3 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reg. 5,156 (DEA 22 February 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 federal court hearing, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] successfully argued that the sentencing guideline for MDMA/ecstasy is based on outdated science, leading to excessive prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/court-rejects-harsh-federal-drug-sentencing-guideline-scientifically-unjustified Court Rejects Harsh Federal Drug Sentencing Guideline as Scientifically Unjustified | American Civil Liberties Union].

In terms of purity data for Australian MDMA, the average is around 34%, ranging from less than 1% to about 85%. The majority of tablets contain 70–85&amp;nbsp;mg of MDMA. Most MDMA enters Australia from the Netherlands, the UK, Asia, and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/dillon.htm Drugtext – 10 years of ecstasy and other party drug use in Australia: What have we done and what is there left to do?].

'''María Sabina''' (July 22, 1894 – November 22, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Jerome, with Alvaro Estrada. 2003. The Life" in María Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. 2003. p.3 "I don't know what year I was born, but my mother, Maria Concepción, told me that it was the morning of the day that they celebrate the Virgin Magdalene there in Río Santiago, an ''agencia'' of Huautla. None of my ancestors knew their age."&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[curandera]]'' who lived in the [[Sierra Mazateca]] of southern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. "Editor's Preface" in María Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. X&lt;/ref&gt; Her practice was based on the use of psilocybin mushrooms, such as ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''.

== Life ==
María Sabina was born outside of [[Huautla de Jimenez]] in the Sierra Mazateca toward the end of the 19th century. Though Sabina herself was not sure, she believed it to be 1894. Her parents were both humble ''[[Peasant|campesinos]]'', mother María Concepcion and Crisanto Feliciano, her father, who died from an illness when she was three years old. She also had a younger sister, María Ana. Her grandfather and great-grandfather on her father's side were also shamans, skilled in using the mushrooms to communicate with God. After the death of her father, her mother moved the family into town, and Sabina grew up in the house of her maternal grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Jerome, with Alvaro Estrada. 2003. The Life" in María Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

María Sabina was the first contemporary Mexican ''curandera'', or [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|native shaman]], to allow Westerners to participate in the healing vigil that is known as the ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In Spanish, the noun ''la velada'' refers to a vigil or watch, and is uniformly a nocturnal one. [http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=velada "Acción y efecto de velar"], as defined in the Real Academia Española's ''Diccionario de la lengua española'' (RAE 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It was [[R. Gordon Wasson]] who used the term by which it has since become generally known when he first wrote about the ritual in ''María Sabina and Her Mazatec Mushroom Velada'' (1974). See Karttunen 1994: 225.&lt;/ref&gt; All participants in the ritual ingested psilocybin mushroom as a sacrament to open the gates of the mind. The ''velada'' is seen as a purification and a communion with the sacred.

In 1955, the US [[Ethnomycology|ethnomycologist]] and banker [[R. Gordon Wasson]] visited María Sabina's hometown and participated in a ''velada'' with her. He collected spores of the fungus, which he identified as ''Psilocybe mexicana'', and took them to Paris. The fungus was cultivated in Europe and its primary ingredient, psilocybin, was isolated in the laboratory by Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] in 1958.

Youth from the United States began seeking out María Sabina and the "magic" mushrooms as early as 1962. In the years that followed, thousands of [[counterculture]] mushroom seekers, scientists, and others arrived in the Sierra Mazateca to seek an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada 1996 ''passim''; Monaghan &amp; Cohen 2000: 165&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967 more than 70 people from the US, Canada, and Western Europe were renting cabins in neighboring villages. Many of them went there directly after reading "[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]", a 1957 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article written by Wasson about his experiences.

María Sabina received several of them, including Wasson, who became a friend. Many 1960s celebrities were rumored to have visited Sabina, including rock stars such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Lennon]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0asAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=bob+dylan+visits+mar%C3%ADa+sabrina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=114DhuKnBz&amp;sig=dXsOEavcDiNk83ieaCpOogmLNaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA54OPxq3PAhWBu5QKHcLsAIUQ6AEIMjAI&lt;/ref&gt; 
While she was initially hospitable to the first of the arrivals, their lack of respect for the sacred and traditional purposes caused María Sabina to remark: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Before Wasson, nobody took ''the children'' simply to find God. They were always taken to cure the sick."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations, Sabina attracted attention from the Mexican police who believed her to be a drug dealer. The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom. The community blamed Sabina,  she was ostracized from her community and her house was razed. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.&lt;ref name=Letcher&gt;{{cite book|last=Letcher|first=Andy|title=Shroom: A Cultural History of the Magic Mushroom|year=2006|publisher=Faber and Faber Ltd.|location=England|isbn=0-571-22770-8|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Estrada"&gt;Estrada, Álvaro, (1976) ''Vida de María Sabina: la sabia de los hongos'' ({{ISBN|968-23-0513-6}})
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. "Editor's Preface" in María Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life, María Sabina became bitter about her many misfortunes, and how others had profited from her name.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. "Editor's Preface" in María Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. XIV-XVI&lt;/ref&gt;  She also felt that the ceremony of the ''velada'' had been irredeemably desecrated and polluted by the [[hedonist]]ic use of the mushrooms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the moment the foreigners arrived, the 'holy children' lost their purity. They lost their force, they ruined them. Henceforth they will no longer work. There is no remedy for it."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Use of synthetic entheogens ==
In 1962, R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann went to Mexico to visit María Sabina. They brought a bottle of psilocybin pills, Hofmann's latest invention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagewisdom.org/ott2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandoz]] was marketing them under the brand name Indocybin—"indo" for both Indian and [[indole]] (the nucleus of their chemical structures) and "cybin" for the main molecular constituent, psilocybin. Hofmann gave his synthesized [[entheogen]] to the ''curandera''. "Of course, Wasson recalled, Albert Hofmann is so conservative he always gives too little a dose, and it didn't have any effect." Hofmann had a different interpretation: "activation of the pills, which must dissolve in the stomach, takes place after 30 to 45 minutes. In contrast, the mushrooms when chewed, work faster as the drug is absorbed immediately". To settle her doubts about the pills, more were distributed. In total, for Maria, her daughter, and the shaman Don Aurelio up to 30&amp;nbsp;mg. each was ingested, a moderately high dose by current standards but not perhaps by the more experienced practitioners. At dawn, their Mazatec interpreter reported that Maria Sabina felt there was little difference between the pills and the mushrooms. She thanked Hofmann for the bottle of pills, saying that she would now be able to serve people even when no mushrooms were available.&lt;ref&gt;Psychedelics Encyclopedia, p 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chants ==
Álvaro Estrada, a fellow Mazatec, recorded her life and work and translated her [[chant]]s. Estrada's American brother-in-law, Henry Munn, translated many of the chants from Spanish to English, and wrote about the significance of her language. According to Munn, María Sabina brilliantly used themes common to Mazatec and Mesoamerican spiritual traditions, but at the same time was a unique talent, a masterful oral poet, and craftsperson with a profound literary and personal charisma.

It is sung in a shamanic trance in which, as she recounted, the "saint children" [[Channelling (mediumistic)|speak through her]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Because I can swim in the immense
Because I can swim in all forms
Because I am the launch woman
Because I am the sacred opposum
Because I am the Lord opposum

I am the woman Book that is beneath the water, says
I am the woman of the populous town, says
I am the shepherdess who is beneath the water, says
I am the woman who shepherds the immense, says
I am a shepherdess and I come with my shepherd, says

Because everything has its origin
And I come going from place to place from the origin...&lt;ref&gt;Estrada, ''María Sabina: her Life and Chants''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
Sabina is regarded as a sacred figure in [[Huautla de Jiménez|Huautla]]. At the same time, her image is used to market various local commercial ventures, from restaurants to taxi companies.

The Mexican counterculture has an affinity for Sabina. The [[Mexican rock]] group [[Santa Sabina (band)|Santa Sabina]] is named for her, and [[El Tri]], one of the first and most successful rock groups in Mexico, dedicated the song "María Sabina" to her, proclaiming her "''un símbolo de la sabiduría y el amor''" ("a symbol of wisdom and love").

Mexican musician, [[Jorge Reyes (musician)|Jorge Reyes]], included prerecorded chants of Maria Sabina in the track "The Goddess of the Eagles", in his album ''Comala''. Reyes also used more of the recording in his collaboration with "Deep Forest" on the track, "Tres Marias", in the Album "Comparsa".

Bolivian singer [[Luzmila Carpio]] has made a song in honor of Maria Sabina.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_R4oeniDxW4|Luzmila Carpio - Homenaje a María Sabina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">{{Zoroastrianism}}
The '''''Mēnōg-ī Khrad''''' ({{IPA|ˈmeːnoːgiː xrad}}) or ''Spirit of Wisdom'' is one of the most important secondary texts in [[Zoroastrianism]] written in [[Middle Persian]].

Also transcribed in [[Pazend]] as '''Minuy-e X(e/a)rad''' and [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian]] ''Minu-ye Xeræd'', the text is a Zoroastrian Pahlavi book in sixty-three chapters (a preamble and sixty-two questions and answers), in which a symbolic character called Dānāg (lit., “knowing, wise”) poses questions to the personified Spirit of Wisdom, who is extolled in the preamble and identified in two places (2.95, 57.4) with innate wisdom (''āsn xrad''). The book, like most Middle Persian books, is based on oral tradition and has no known author. According to the preamble, Dānāg, searching for truth, traveled to many countries, associated himself with many savants, and learned about various opinions and beliefs. When he discovered the virtue of ''xrad'' (1.51), the Spirit of Wisdom appeared to him to answer his questions.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{iranica|dadestan-i-menog|Dadestan ī Menog ī Xrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book belongs to the genre of ''andarz'' ("advices") literature, containing mostly practical wisdom on the benefits of drinking wine moderately and the harmful effects of overindulging in it (20, 33, 39, 50, 51, 54, 55, 59, 60), although advice on religious questions is by no means lacking. For example, there are passages on keeping quiet while eating (2.33-34); on not walking without wearing the sacred girdle ([[kushti|kostī]]) and undershirt (''sodra''; 2.35-36); on not walking with only one shoe on (2.37-38); on not urinating in a standing position (2.39-40); on [[Zoroastrian festivals#Gahambars|''gāhānbār'']] and ''hamāg-dēn'' ceremonies (4.5); on libation (''zōhr'') and the [[yasna]] ceremony (''yazišn''; 5.13); on not burying the dead (6.9); on marriage with next of kin (''xwēdōdah'') and trusteeship (''stūrīh''; 36); on belief in dualism (42); on praying three times a day and repentance before the sun, the moon, and fire (53); on belief in [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] as the creator and in the destructiveness of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahreman]] and belief in *''stōš'' (the fourth morning after death), resurrection, and the Final Body (tan ī pasēn; 63). The first chapter, which is also the longest (110 pars.), deals in detail with the question of what happens to people after death and the separation of soul from body.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;

It is believed by some scholars that this text has been first written in Pazend and latter, using the Pazend text, it was rewritten in Middle Persian, but others believe that this text was originally written in Middle Persian and later written in Pazend, [[Sanskrit]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and Persian. The oldest surviving manuscripts there are L19, found in the [[British Library]], written in Pazend and Gujarati, which is believed to date back to 1520. One of the characteristics of L19 text is that the word ''Xrad'' "wisdom" is spelled as ''Xard'' throughout the text. The oldest surviving Pahlavi version of this text is K43 found in [[Royal Library, Denmark]].

The ''Mēnōg-ī Khrad'' was first translated into [[English language|English]] as {{cite book|last=West|first=Edward William|authorlink=Edward William West|title=Sacred Books of the East: Pahlavi texts, pt. 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SixHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP4|year=1885|publisher=Clarendon Press}}.

{{God}}
'''National gods''' are a class of guardian divinities or [[deities]] whose special concern is the safety and well-being of an ethnic group (''[[nation]]''), and of that group's leaders. This is contrasted with other guardian figures such as family gods responsible for the well-being of individual clans or professions, or personal gods who are responsible for the well-being of individuals. These guardian roles augment the functions that a divinity might otherwise have (wisdom, health, war, and so on).

==National gods==
In antiquity (and to some extent continuing today), religion was a characteristic of regional culture, together with language, customs, traditions, etc. Many of these ethnic religions included national god(s) in their pantheons, such as &lt;!-- in alphabetical order --&gt;

==In antiquity==
In antiquity, each ethnic group (''[[nation]]'') had its own pantheon, which may or may not have [[Religious syncretism|overlapped]] with that of neighbouring groups. Many of these religions had guardian figures, which then sometimes included national gods, who were considered responsible for the safety and well-being of the nation and of its people, with a special concern for the nation's ruler and guardian. These national gods stood alongside the personal gods, that is, the patron gods who took a special interest in an individual's personal well-being. Additionally, there were the family gods associated with the care of a clan or profession, as well as gods associated with specific situations or the protection thereof (fertility, health, war, contracts and so on).

This perception of divinity was common in the ancient world. Deities were often geographically localized by association to their main cult centers, and in the Ancient Near East were often [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of their respective [[cities of the Ancient Near East|city-states]]. Many of the individual ethnic groups also considered itself the progeny of its national gods. For example, in the region that is now Yemen, the [[Sabaeans]], the [[Minaeans]] and the [[Himyar]] each perceived themselves to be the children of respectively [[Almaqah]], [[Wadd]] and [[Shamash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Doniger|editor-first=Wendy|chapter=Arabian religions|title=Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of World Religions|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]], [[Milcom]] held that role for the [[Ammon|Ammonites]], while [[Chemosh]] did so for the [[Moab]].

[[Yahweh]]'s role as the national god of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judaeans]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samarians]] is a key reason for that figure's adoption as the [[monism|monist]] figure by the [[Deuteronomic reform|Yahweh-only movement]] of the 7th-century BC. Yahweh's subsequent exaltation as a supreme figure occurred not because national gods were necessarily heads of their pantheons (this was certainly not the case for the national gods of the peoples surrounding Israel),&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt; but as a reaction to the changing political landscape, in which other national gods had previously become exalted in that fashion.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; Because peoples were perceived to effectively worship the same gods, merely by different names (Smith (2008)&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; terms this "translatability"), Yahweh's function as a national god had previously automatically equated him with other national gods. Thus, with the rise of the multi-cultural [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] in the 10th century BC, the concomitant rise of the Assyrian's nation god Assur to inter-cultural prominence influenced how national gods were generally perceived. Moreover, the political unification of the fractured nation-states under a single supreme head of state encouraged the idea of a multi-national "one-god" worldview as well.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; By the 7th-century BC however, Assyria was in decline and the smaller nation-states began to reassert their independence. In this context, the development of a "one-god" worldview in 7th century BC [[Kingdom of Judah]] can be perceived as a response to the diminishing claims to cultural hegemony of the Assyrian "one-god" ideology of the time.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008"&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=God in Translation: Deities in Cross-cultural Discourse in the Biblical World|series=Forschungen zum Alten Testament, vol. 57|location=Tübingen|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=978-3-16-149543-4|page=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process is evident in some parts of the [[Torah]] which predate the 6th century BC and thus preserve vestiges of the theology centered on a national god during the 10th-century BC [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchic period]].&lt;ref name="Smith_2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-516768-9|pages=155–163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The OT {{bracket|{{=}}[[Old Testament]]}} is still conscious of the fact that Yhwh, the national god of Israel, originally was one of the gods in the council of El." (''Deut'' 32:8-9*)&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;{{citation|editor-last=van der Toorn|editor-first=K.|editor2-last=Becking|editor2-first=Bob|editor3-last=van der Horst|editor3-first=Pieter Willem|chapter=King|title=Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible|year=1999|isbn=978-90-04-11119-6|page=485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern period==
[[Christian missionaries]] have repeatedly re-interpreted national gods in terms of the Christian God. This fact is reflected in the [[names of God]] in various languages of Christianized peoples, such as [[Shangdi]] or [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]] among Chinese Christians, [[Ngai]] among a number of tribes of [[Kenya]], [[Bathala|Bathalang Maykapal]] for the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] in the Philippines, etc.

In a modern context, the term of a "national god" addresses the emergence of [[national church]]es within Christianity. This tendency was of "nationalizing" the Christian God, especially in the context of national churches sanctioning warfare against other Christian nations during [[World War I]], was denounced as heretical by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Ethnics'', ed. Braun, transl. Bromiley, New York, 1981, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] in his essay ''Wotan'' (1936) identifies the Germanic god of the storm (leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]), [[Wōden|Wotan]], as the national god of the [[German people]], and warns of the rise of [[German nationalism]] and ultimately the then-impending catastrophe of [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]] in terms of the re-awakening of this god:
:"But what is more than curious &amp;mdash; indeed, piquant to a degree &amp;mdash; is that an ancient god of storm and frenzy, the long quiescent Wotan, should awake, like an extinct volcano, to new activity, in a civilized country that had long been supposed to have outgrown the Middle Ages. [...] I venture the heretical suggestion that the unfathomable depths of Wotan's character explain more of National Socialism than all three reasonable factors [viz. economic, political, and psychological] put together. [...] This is a tragic experience and no disgrace. It has always been terrible to fall into the hands of a living god. [[Yahweh]] was no exception to this rule, and the Philistines, Edomites, Amorites and the rest, who were outside the Yahweh experience, must certainly have found it [[Biblical Canaanites|exceedingly disagreeable]]. The [[Arabs|Semitic]] experience of [[God in Islam|Allah]] was for a long time an extremely [[Islamic conquests|painful affair]] for the whole of Christendom. We who stand outside judge the Germans far too much, as if they were responsible agents, but perhaps it would be nearer the truth to regard them, also, as victims."&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (Zurich)  (March, 1936), 657-69. Republished in ''Aufsätze zur Zeitgeschichte'' (Zurich, 1946), 1-23. English translation by Barbara Hannah, ''Essays on Contemporary Events'' (London, 1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Omphaloskepsis''''' or '''navel-gazing''' is contemplation of one's [[navel]] as an aid to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|omphaloskepsis|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὀμφαλός|ὀμφᾰλός]]}} ({{transl|grc|[[Omphalos|omphalós]]}}, {{Literal translation|'navel'|lk=on}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σκέψις|σκέψῐς]]}} ({{transl|grc|sképsis}}, {{Literal translation|'viewing, examination, speculation'}}).&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

Actual use of the practice as an aid to contemplation of basic principles of the cosmos and [[human nature]] is found in the practice of [[yoga]] of [[Hinduism]] and sometimes in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Symbols| first=Udo| last=Becker| publisher=[[Continuum International]]| year=2000| page=210| isbn=978-0-8264-1221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yoga, the navel is the site of the manipura (also called nabhi) [[chakra]], which yogis consider "a powerful chakra of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Whispers beyond the Edge| first=Royal L.| last=Craig| publisher=[[Xlibris]]| year=2010| page=99| isbn=978-1-4500-7972-3}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Yantra Yoga| first=Chogyal Namkhai| last=Norbu| publisher=Snow Lion| year=2008| page=15| isbn=978-1-55939-308-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monks of [[Mount Athos]], Greece, were described as ''Omphalopsychians'' by J.G. Minningen, writing in the 1830s, who says they "...pretended or fancied that they experienced celestial joys when gazing on their umbilical region, in converse with the Deity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39074/39074-h/39074-h.htm#Page_40 |title=Curiosities of Medical Experience |publisher=Richard Bentley |edition=2nd |date=1839 |location=London |first=J.G. |last=Millingen |page=40 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, phrases such as "contemplating one's navel" or "[[wikt:navel-gazing|navel-gazing]]" are frequently used, usually in [[jocular]] fashion, to refer to self-absorbed pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Abbreviations Acronyms Glossary for American Readers| first=E.R.| last=Lyn

The [[Theology|theological]] curriculum of the Qawmi madrasahs predominantly follow the [[Islam]]ic [[Deobandi]] model.

Qawmi educational practices originate from the traditional Muslim educational system of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=dstar25jan2009&gt;Hasan, Zeeshan. ''[http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=72723 Market solutions for Qawmi madrasas]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[British Empire|British colonial period]], these types of madrasahs were called "Khariji," or outside of government.&lt;ref name=abdallajuly2004/&gt; Later, the term "Qawmi" emerged from the word "qom" (meaning "the public")—stemming from the fact that Qawmi madrasahs reject state funding and instead rely on donations from the public.&lt;ref name="bano2008"/&gt;

After 1971, some Qawmi madrasahs began to modernize their teaching, such as by switching the [[Medium of instruction|language of instruction]] from [[Urdu]] to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and adding some English language and mathematics lessons.&lt;ref name=dstar25jan2009/&gt; In 1978, a government body called the "Non-government Education Board" was established in an attempt to co-ordinate these madrasahs, of which 2,043 registered with that board by 1998.&lt;ref name=hossain2010/&gt;

The later part of the 20th century saw a major largely unregulated growth in the whole madrasah sector, which expanded from roughly 4,100 schools in 1986 to potentially as many as 64,000 schools by 2005.&lt;ref name=saminaahmed2005/&gt;

The Befaqul Mudarressin of Bangladesh Qawmi Madrasah Education Board was formed in 2004.&lt;ref name=abdallajuly2004/&gt; Soon afterwards, from August 2006, the Bangladeshi government began recognizing and supporting the Qawmi system through recognizing the 'Dawra degree' of the Qaumi madrasas as equivalent to master's degree in Islamic Studies or Arabic literature.&lt;ref name="IPCS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Supriya|title=Recognizing Qaumi Madrasas in Bangladesh: Boon or a Bane?|url=http://www.ipcs.org/article/bangladesh/recognizing-qaumi-madrasas-in-bangladesh-boon-or-a-bane-2114.html|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ellis2007/&gt; By this time, approximately 15,000 madrasahs had registered with the Befaqul Mudarressin.&lt;ref name=dstar1/&gt;
In April 2017, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reiterated her commitment to the earlier recognition of certificates of Dawrae Hadith under Qawmi Madrasa Education Boards as equivalent to master's degree in Islamic Studies and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qawmi Madrasa Dawrae Hadith gets recognition|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/qawmi-madrasa-dawrae-hadith-gets-recognition-1389823|accessdate=17 April 2017|agency=Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qawmi education systems==
There are two major Qawmi educational systems: those that use the old [[Dars-i-Nizami]] curriculum and those that have a modified Nizami curriculum&lt;ref name=hossain2010/&gt; (such as by including the English language and the subject of mathematics).&lt;ref name=dstar25jan2009/&gt;

The Dars-i-Nizami system originated from early eighteenth century India.&lt;ref name=dmuslims3jan2010&gt;Sikand, Yoginder ''[http://www.dailymuslims.com/Education/Madrasah/614.html Maulana Tariq Rashid Firangi Mahali on Dars-e Nizami and Madrasa Reform in South Asia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106052423/http://www.dailymuslims.com/Education/Madrasah/614.html |date=6 January 2009 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; There is some controversy regarding movements to "reform" the system, with some calling the move "an 'anti-Islamic' conspiracy, alleging that these are a means to secularise madrasas and rob them of their Islamic identity"—though reformers generally contest that they do not want secularization and that they are not a conspiracy.&lt;ref name=dmuslims3jan2010/&gt;

In general, Qawmi primary education lasts six years, though it does not differentiate students by progressive [[Educational stage|grade levels]].&lt;ref name=abdallajuly2004/&gt; While the Qawmi primary level covers all subjects found in other madrasah systems, there is no specific time-sequence or order by which subjects are taught as would be expected in grade-based systems. Thus, imposing class-graduated terminology on the Qawmi system may not be meaningful.&lt;ref name=abdallajuly2004/&gt;

==Befaqul Mudarressin of Bangladesh Qawmi Madrasah Education Board==
In 2004, many Qawmi madrasahs began organizing together under an umbrella organization called the '''Befaqul Mudarressin''' (also transliterated as Wafaq ul Madaris) '''of [[Bangladesh Qawmi Madrasah Education Board]]''', based in [[Dhaka]], including seven smaller private Madrasah education boards.&lt;ref name=abdallajuly2004/&gt; It is an extension of the process that formed the [[Wafaq ul Madaris Al-Arabia, Pakistan]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="bano2008"/&gt;

The board was founded to assure a [[standardized]] curriculum and to provide centralized examination. Membership with the board is voluntary, though required for degree accreditation by the Befaqul Mudarressin.&lt;ref name="bano2008"/&gt;

It is organized under a three-tiered representative system led an executive body. The second tier committee comprises senior madrasahs, followed a third tier of ordinary member schools.&lt;ref name="bano2008"/&gt;

===Statistics===
As of 2008, the board oversees almost 9000 madrasahs at the following levels:&lt;ref name="bano2008"/&gt;

* [[Jamia Islamia Yunusia, Brahmanbaria]] 
* [[Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah]] in [[Sylhet]]
* [[Jamiatul Uloom Al-Islamia Lalkhan Bazar]] — also known as "Lalkhan Bazar Madrasah"

==Footnotes==
*{{note|A|a}} Bano (2008) seems to somewhat misquote Ahmed (2005), which is cited just before this note.
*{{note|B|b}} While two sources cited say there are about 4000 Qawmi madrasas, my editorial judgement based upon research is that the 4000 school figure is far too conservative; moreover, the 15,000 madrasah figure is 4 years newer.

'''Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram''' (sometimes called '''Ram Dhun''') 
is a notable [[bhajan]] ([[Hindu]] devotional song) that was widely popularized by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalton |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Dalton |page=109|title=Mahatma Gandhi: Nonviolent Power in Action |year=1993 |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6AUDU_54PwC&amp;pg=PA109 |isbn=0-231-12237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pete Seeger]] included it on his album "Strangers and Cousins" (1964). The song is an important [[Motif (literature)|motif]] in the 2006 [[Bollywood]] film, ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'', and is featured in the movie ''[[Gandhi, My Father]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51943">Three [[major religious groups]] (i.e. the two largest religions in the world: [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], plus [[Judaism]]) originated in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East (region, Asia)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381192/Middle-East|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller [[minority religion]]s, such as the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Druze]], [[Alawites|Nusairism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Sabianism]], [[Bábism]], [[Yazidis]]m, [[Mandaeism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Yarsanism]], [[Samaritans|Samaritanism]], [[Shabak people#Religious beliefs|Shabakism]], [[Ishikism]], [[Ali-Illahism]], [[Alevism]], [[Yazdânism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] are also present in the Middle East.

The smaller, religiously [[Irreligion|unaffiliated]] population is forecast to grow 56%, from about 2 million to more than 3 million. [[Hindus]], adherents of [[folk religions]] and [[Buddhists]] are expected to experience the greatest growth as a percentage of their modest 2010 counts, with each group more than doubling in size by 2050.

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has noteworthy representation in Iran, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Israel and Turkey. Its international headquarters are located on the northern slope of Mount Carmel at Haifa, Israel. Founded in Iran in 1863,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahai Faith|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48930/Bahai-faith|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bahá'í Faith is one of the youngest world major religions.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; According to most encyclopedias, in the early 21st century there are an estimated 6 to 8 million Bahá'ís across the globe.

==Christianity==
{{See also|Christianity in the Middle East}}
Christianity [[Origins of Christianity|originated]] in the region in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the mid-to-late 7th century AD. Christianity in the Middle East is characterized with its diverse beliefs and traditions compared to other parts of the old world.

Christians now make up 5% of the population, down from 20% in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=rometalks&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11509256 | title = Rome 'crisis' talks on Middle East Christians | last = Willey | first = David |date = 10 October 2010 |work=BBC | accessdate =1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Middle Eastern Christians is dropping in some regions in the Middle East due to such factors as forced acceptance of Islam, low birth rates compared with Muslims, extensive emigration (usually to escape religious persecution), and the religious persecution itself. In addition, political turmoil has been and continues to be a major contributor pressing indigenous Near Eastern Christians of various ethnicities towards seeking security and stability outside their homelands. Christian Palestinians face the same oppression as their Muslim compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/04/201242517713418510.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recent spread of [[Jihadist]] and [[Salafist]] ideology, foreign to the tolerant values of the local communities in Greater Syria and Egypt has also played a role in unsettling Christians' decades-long peaceful existence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/violent-salafists-threaten-arab-spring-democracies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copts===
The largest Christian group in the Middle East is the originally [[Coptic language|Coptic]]-speaking, but now [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking (due to a forced language change) Coptic Orthodox Christian population. This Egyptian [[ethnoreligious]] community of [[Copts]], is cited by the census as consisting of 6–11 million people in past decade,&lt;ref name=EgyptCoptNumbers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/coptic_1.shtml|title=Coptic Orthodox Church|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 February 2011}} "estimates [for the Coptic Orthodox Church] ranged from 6 to 11 million; 6% (official estimate) to 20% (Church estimate)"&lt;/ref&gt; although Coptic sources cite the figure as being closer to 15–18 million.&lt;ref name=unitedcopts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedcopts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3073&amp;Itemid=71 |title=? |date=29 October 2008 |publisher=United Copts of Great Britain |accessdate=27 August 2010}} "In 2008, [[Pope Shenouda III]] and Bishop Morkos, bishop of [[Shubra]], declared that the number of Copts in Egypt is more than 12 million" (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alarabiya2808&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/08/28/55639.html |title=? |publisher=العربية.نت  الصفحة الرئيسية |accessdate=27 August 2010}} "In 2008, father Morkos Aziz the prominent priest in Cairo declared that the number of Copts (inside Egypt) exceeds 16&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/281789/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Sisi-meets-world-Evangelical-churches-deleg.aspx|title=Egypt's Sisi meets world Evangelical churches delegation in Cairo  - Politics  - Egypt - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/03/02/Egypt-s-Coptic-Bishop-Morcos-We-need-to-build-4-000-churches-in-next-10-years.html#|title=Egypt’s Coptic Bishop Morcos: We need to build 4,000 churches in next 10 years|website=english.alarabiya.net|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copts reside in mainly Egypt, but also in [[Sudan]] and [[Libya]], with tiny communities in [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Jordan]].

===Maronites===
[[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Maronites]] number some 1.1–1.2 million across the Middle East, and often avoid an Arabic identity in favour of a pre-Arab [[Phoenicia]]n-[[Canaan]]ite heritage.

===Syriacs and Assyrians===
[[Syriac Christians]] of various non-Arab [[ethnoreligious]] heritages number roughly 2 to 3 million. The indigenous [[Eastern Aramaic]] speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of [[Iraq]], south eastern [[Turkey]], north western [[Iran]] and north eastern [[Syria]] have suffered both [[ethnic]] and [[religious]] persecution over the last few centuries such as the [[Assyrian Genocide]], leading to many fleeing to the west or congregating in areas in the north of Iraq and Syria. In Iraq numbers of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] has declined to somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 (from 0.8–1.4 million before 2003 US invasion) or 6% of the population of 23 million.&lt;ref name=alarabiya031011&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/03/169930.html |title=With Arab revolts, region’s Christians mull fate |publisher=English.alarabiya.net |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the largest community of Syriac Christians in the Middle East resides in [[Syria]], numbering 877,000–1,139,000. These are a mix of [[Neo-Aramaic]] speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and largely Arabic-speaking Christians (originally speakers of the almost extinct [[Western Aramaic]] language) who ethnically identify as [[Syriac people|Syriacs]].

===Armenians===
In the Middle Eastern states, there is a large community of [[Armenians]]. The [[Armenians in the Middle East]] number around 350,000-400,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =C. Held | first = Colbert | title = Middle East Patterns: Places, Peoples, and Politics, fourth edition | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2006 | isbn =0-8133-4170-1 | page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are mostly concentrated in [[Armenians in Iran|Iran]], [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Armenians in Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Armenians in Syria|Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], although well-established communities exist in [[Armenians in Iraq|Iraq]], [[Armenians in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkey]], and other countries of the area. Some other sources claim that the Armenians number around half a million, with their largest community in [[Iran]] with 200,000 - 300,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ripaBLQ9tskC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=200,000+armenians+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bTmFa4PS44&amp;sig=FLVXez7Ep3UqEkmdbiea09ZD2s0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jVnvVKuhJ8auU8bGgZgP&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAw|title=Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia: Political Developments and Implications ...|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Armenians in [[Turkey]] is disputed having a wide range of estimations. More Armenian communities reside in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and to lesser degree in other Middle Eastern countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Israel]]. The [[Armenian Genocide]] during and after World War I drastically reduced the once sizeable Armenian population.

===Other Christian groups===
In the [[Persian Gulf]] states, [[Bahrain]] has 1,000 Christian citizens&lt;ref name=bah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/162361/reftab/36/t/Jew-Christian-in-Bahrain-Chamber/Default.aspx|title=Jew, Christian In Bahrain Chamber|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kuwait]] has 400 native Christian citizens,&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to 450,000 Christian foreign residents in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=208398#wrapper |title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 |work=[[US State Department]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab Christians]], and those who tend to identify as Arabs, are mostly adherents of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. In 2010 they numbered 1.1 million in Syria, 250,000 in Lebanon, 250-300,000 in Jordan, 150,000 in Israel and Palestine and smaller numbers in Iraq. [[Protestant]] converts number around 400,000. [[Melkites|Melkite Christians]] who are Catholic Christians of the Greek Rite compose almost 600,000. Syrian Orthodox number about 1 million in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, with the great majority being in Syria.

The ethnic [[Greeks]], who had once inhabited large parts of the western Middle East and Asia Minor, have declined since the Arab conquests and recently severely reduced in Turkey, as a result of the [[Asia Minor Catastrophe]], which followed World War I. Today the biggest Middle Eastern Greek community resides in Cyprus numbering around 793,000 (2008).&lt;ref name="Cyprus"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html
|title=2008 estimate|publisher=cia.gov |accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cypriot Greeks constitute the only Christian majority state in the Middle East, although [[Lebanon]] was founded with a Christian majority in the first half of the 20th century.

Smaller Christian groups include; [[Georgians]], [[Messianic Jews]], [[Russians]] and others, such as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Shabak people|Shabak]], [[Azeri]], [[Circassians|Circassian]] and Arab converts exist in small numbers. There are currently several million Christian foreign workers in the Gulf area, mostly from the [[Philippines]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Indonesia]]. Middle Eastern Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-belt/pope-to-arab-christians-k_b_203943.html Pope to Arab Christians: Keep the Faith.&lt;/ref&gt; as they have today an active role in various social, economical, sporting and political aspects in the Middle East.

==Druze faith==
[[Druze]], or Druse, is a monotheistic religion found in Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. Representation ranges from 100,000 in Israel, to 700,000 in Syria. Developing from [[Isma'ilite]] teachings, Druze incorporates Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic and Iranian elements.&lt;ref name=DruzeReal&gt;{{cite web|title=Druze|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172195/Druze|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ishikism==
[[Ishikism]] (also known as Chinarism or Ishik Alevism), a religious movement within [[Alevism]] that rejects its Islamic roots,  is found in Turkey. Ishikīs consider themselves to be esotericists, claiming that Alevism is [[esotericism]] itself, meaning that they identify themselves with every type of esotericism in history. They claim that Alevism is the oldest religion in the world, that has changed shapes throughout time. This "First and True Religion" of the world, is claimed by Ishikís to have been a main source for all other religions and beliefs in the world.

==Islam==
[[Islam]] is the most widely followed religion in the Middle East. About 20% of the world's Muslims live in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=Islam1&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam|url=http://religions.findthedata.org/compare/15-31/Sunni-Islam-vs-Islam-General|publisher=FindTheBest.com|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is monotheistic believing in [[Allah]] and follows the teaching of the written sacred text, the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=Islam1 /&gt; Islam is believed to be an extension of Judaism and Christianity with the belief that Muhammad is the final prophet of God, in a long chain of prophets, from Adam on down to John the Baptist, Jesus, and finally Muhammad. The majority of the Muslims are Sunni, followed by Shi'a. Smaller sects include the [[Ahmadiyya]].&lt;ref name="ahmadi"&gt;See, for example:
*{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=The Arabs in Israel

A major source of conflict in the Muslim Middle East is the divisive nature between the two main sects of Islam: [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]]. Though these two sects agree on the fundamentals of Islam and the teachings of the Qur'an, they are in conflict about who would lead the Muslim community after the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s death.&lt;ref name=Druze1&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion: Religions|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Siffin]] was a significant schism between the two sects. Throughout the years, other differences have arisen between practices, beliefs and culture. Many conflicts between the two communities have occurred.

===Sunnism===
Sunni is the largest branch of Islam and dominates most countries in the Middle East.

===Twelver Shia===
{{further|Shia}}
Although there are many [[Islamic schools and branches#Shia Islam|Shia subsects]], modern Shia Islam has been divided into three main groupings: [[Twelvers]], [[Ismailism|Ismaili]]s and [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]]s, with Twelver Shia being the largest and most influential group among Shia, making up perhaps 88 percent of Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guidère|first=Mathieu|title=Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCvhzGiDMYsC|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7965-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tCvhzGiDMYsC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22twelvers+constitute+85+percent%22 319]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tabataba'i (1979), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''God's rule: the politics of world religions'', p. 146, Jacob Neusner, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John. ''What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam'', Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;
Twelver Shia have their largest populations in the Middle East in Iran (90–95%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Martin|title=Kingdom of the Cults, The|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yra4KhlMBYQC&amp;pg=PA421|accessdate=24 June 2013|quote=Ninety-five percent of Iran's Muslims are Shi'ites.|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-0-7642-2821-6|page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhabani Sen Gupta|title=The Persian Gulf and South Asia: prospects and problems of inter-regional cooperation|quote=Shias constitute seventy-five percent of the population of the Gulf.

===Zaydi===

Zaydi make up about 35-40% of the population of Yemen.&lt;ref name="Stephen W. Day 2012 31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen W.

===Alawites===
{{further|Alawites}}
Alawis, also rendered as Alawites, ''Alawīyyah'' or Nusạyriyya, are a [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] sect of the [[Twelver]] branch of [[Shia Islam]], primarily centered in [[Syria]]. The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called '''Nusayris''' ({{lang-ar|نصيرية}} ''Nuṣayrīyyah''), though the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era. Another name, "'''Ansari'''" ({{lang-ar|انصارية}} ''Anṣāriyyah''), is believed to be a mistransliteration of "Nusayri". Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which are also inhabited by [[Sunni]]s, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]].

Alawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites.&lt;ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68&gt;[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nuṣayrī-ʿAlawīs'', 2010]]: p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67&gt;[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nuṣayrī-ʿAlawīs'', 2010]]: p.67&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God.

Alawites have traditionally lived in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains]] along the Mediterranean coast of Syria. Latakia and [[Tartus]] are the region's principal cities. They are also concentrated in the plains around [[Hama]] and [[Homs]]. Alawites also live in Syria's major cities, and are estimated at about 12 percent of the country's population&lt;ref name="Reuters-secret"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/02/us-syria-alawites-sect-idUSTRE8110Q720120202 |title=Syria's Alawites, a secretive and persecuted sect |agency=Reuters |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/afp/2012/02/20/332152/Turbulent-history.htm |title=Turbulent history colors Syria's ruling Alawite Muslims' fight to keep power |work=China Post |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrians flee their homes amid fears of ethnic cleansing |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syrians-flee-their-homes-amid-fears-of-ethnic-cleansing-7079802.html | work=The Independent | first=Charlotte | last=McDonald-Gibson | date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2.6&amp;nbsp;million, out of a total population of 22&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="al-monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/battle-for-syria-just-getting-st.html |title=It's Time to Engage Iran, Russia on Syria |publisher=al-monitor.com |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
For over 2,000 years a large portion of world Jewry lived the Muslim world. They are colloquially knows as [[Mizrahi Jews]]. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Yemen. Since the 1950s because of growing antisemitism most of these Jews fled to Israel where they make up the majority of Israel's Jewish population and roughly a third of total world Jewry. While they no longer live among a Muslim majority, they continue to follow many customs with strong Muslim and Middle Eastern influences making them distinct from European Jewry.
Today [[Judaism]] in the Middle East is mostly practiced in Israel. Israel’s population is 75.3% Jewish, with the remainder made up of Muslims (20.6%), [[Christians]], [[Druze]], [[Bahá'í]] and various other minorities (4.1%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/?MIval=cw_usr_view_SHTML&amp;ID=705&lt;/ref&gt; There are few other countries in the Middle East with significant Jewish populations, but the communities are small and scattered.

==Mandaeism==
There are between 60,000 and 70,000 [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]]s worldwide&lt;ref name="Yale Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thaler|first=Kai|title=Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention|newspaper=Yale Daily News|date=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Middle East they are found in Iraq and Iran.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Deutsch|first=Nathanial|title=Save the Gnostics|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They revere [[Adam]], [[Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enosh]] and [[Noah]]. [[Mandaeans]] are an ethnoreligious community, which doesn't allow conversion.

==Samaritanism==
[[Samaritanism]] is a closely affiliated religion with [[Judaism]], practiced by the ethnoreligious [[Samaritan]] community, largely residing in Israel. In the past, Samaritans used to populate also Egypt and Syria, but their community had almost collapsed by the late 19th century due to religious persecution by radical Islamists. Today the Samaritan community has grown to about 800 persons from as few as 150 in the early 20th century.

==Shabakism==
There are about 60,000 [[Shabak people]] living today all in northern Iraq.&lt;ref name=Shabak&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabak|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Orient}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an ethnic group with a religion similar to orthodox Islam and Christianity. The Shabak have much in common with the Yazidis.

==Yazīdī==
[[Yazidis]] ( Yezīdī, Azīdī, Zedī, or Izdī ) are found in Iraq, Syria, and Iran.&lt;ref name=Yazidi&gt;{{cite web|title=Yazidi|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652325/Yazidi|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fusion of Zoroastrian, [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], Jewish, Nestorian Christian and Islamic elements.&lt;ref name=Yazidi /&gt; They do not see themselves as descendent from Adam and maintain complete segregation from the rest of the population (5). They number between 200,000 and one million worldwide and worship a main divinity called Yazīdī is Malak Ṭāʾūs (“Peacock Angel”).&lt;ref name=Yazidi /&gt; Most live in Iraq but also 70,000 in Syria.

==Zoroastrianism==
In the Middle East, [[Zoroastrianism]] is found in central Iran.&lt;ref name=Zoro&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoroastrianism|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/ataglance/glance.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are estimated to be under 20,000 Zoroastrians in Iran.&lt;ref name=Zoro3&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Richard Foltz]]|title=Zoroastrians in Iran: What Future in the Homeland?|journal=Middle East Journal|year=2011|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the oldest monotheistic religions as it was founded 3500 years ago.&lt;ref name=Zoro /&gt;  It was also one of the most powerful religions in the world for about 1000 years.&lt;ref name=Zoro /&gt; Now, however, it is considered one of the smallest religions with only 190,000 followers worldwide.&lt;ref name=Zoro /&gt; There are two deities: Azhura Mazda, who fights for a person’s goodness, and [[Ahriman]], who fights for a person’s evil.&lt;ref name=Zoro2&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoroastrianism|url=http://religions.findthedata.org/l/53/Zoroastrianism|publisher=FindTheBest.com|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ultimately up to the individual to decide which deity they will follow. Zoroastreans follow the [[Avesta]] which is their primary sacred text.&lt;ref name=Zoro2 /&gt;

==Unbelief==
According to a 2012 WIN-Gallup International ‘Religiosity and Atheism Index’, atheists are a small minority in the Middle East with only 2% of those surveyed in the Arab World identifying themselves as "committed atheists".&lt;ref name="WINGIA-2012-17"&gt;{{cite web |title=WIN-Gallup International ‘Religiosity and Atheism Index’ reveals atheists are a small minority in the early years of 21st century |url=http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14/ |website=WINGIA.com |accessdate=15 August 2017 |page=17 |date=6 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825005955/http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah]], the branch of the Egyptian government that issues [[Fatwa|fatawa]] (religious edicts), gives lower (if less reliable) numbers, stating that there are 866 atheists in Egypt – "roughly 0.001% of the population"—325 in Morocco, and 32 in Yemen (defined as not only unbelievers, but secularists and "Muslims who convert to other religions").&lt;ref name="Kingsley-12-12-14"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|title=Egypt’s atheists number 866 – precisely|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/egypt-highest-number-atheists-arab-world-866|accessdate=15 August 2017|agency=The Guardian|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries (Iraq, Tunisia) surveyed had 0% of respondents identifying as atheists.&lt;ref name="WINGIA-2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=WIN-Gallup International ‘Religiosity and Atheism Index’ reveals atheists are a small minority in the early years of 21st century |url=http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14/ |website=WINGIA.com |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=6 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825005955/http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries indicated low percentages (Palestinian Territories 4%, Turkey, Uzbekistan 2%). However 18% of those surveyed in the Arab world identified themselves as "not a religious person" (Iraq 9%, Saudi Arabia 19%, West Bank and Gaza 29%, Tunisia 22%),&lt;ref name="WINGIA-2012-15-6"&gt;{{cite web |title=WIN-Gallup International ‘Religiosity and Atheism Index’ reveals atheists are a small minority in the early years of 21st century |url=http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14/ |website=WINGIA.com |accessdate=15 August 2017 |pages=15–6 |date=6 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825005955/http://www.wingia.com/en/news/win_gallup_international_ae_religiosity_and_atheism_index_ao_reveals_atheists_are_a_small_minority_in_the_early_years_of_21st_century/14 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a higher percentage than in Africa, Latin America, or South Asia.&lt;ref name="WINGIA-2012-17"/&gt;

According to unbelievers in the Arab world their numbers are growing but they suffer from persecution.&lt;ref name="nyt-DEVJI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keddie-aljazeera"/&gt;
Author and historian [[Faisal Devji]] notes that despite the fact that Saudi Arabia punishes unbelief with death, 5% of those surveyed identified themselves as atheists (a slightly higher percent than did in the United States) and 19 percent did not consider themselves religious.&lt;ref name="nyt-DEVJI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DEVJI|first1=FAISAL|title=Conversions From Islam in Europe and Beyond|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/islam-conversions.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region|accessdate=15 August 2017|agency=New York Times|date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devji states there is "a new movement of atheists in countries such as Saudi Arabia ... which takes the form of secret societies",  meeting "in internet chat rooms and unnamed physical locations, like the mystics of old".&lt;ref name="nyt-DEVJI"/&gt;

In Egypt, [[Al Jazeera]] reported a clandestine atheist group of over 100 in [[Alexandria]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Keddie-aljazeera"/&gt; The group complained of mistreatment of atheists by society and government. A Pew survey found 63% of Egyptian Muslims favored the death penalty for those who leave the religion of Islam. The Egyptian penal code punishes "contempt of heavenly religions", and as of 2013 Egyptians had been arrested and/or imprisoned for activities such as setting up a Facebook page calling for atheism, writing a book entitled ''Where is God?'', and "defamation of religion".&lt;ref name="Keddie-aljazeera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keddie|first1=Patrick|title=Egypt's embattled atheists|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/egypt-embattled-atheists-20131114184645790660.html|accessdate=15 August 2017|agency=Al Jazeera|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
{{Main|Hinduism in Arab states|Buddhism in the Middle East}}
There are many Hindus in Arab states, many due to the migration of Indians, Nepalese, Pakistanis and small numbers of Afghans to the oil-rich states around the Persian Gulf. Hindu temples have been built in [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]].

Though Buddhism has had a [[Buddhism in Iran|presence]] in the Middle East for over 1000 years, it has recently{{When|date=March 2015}} experienced a revival with an estimated 900,000 people (perhaps more) who profess [[Buddhism]] as their religion. Buddhist adherents make up just over 0.3% of the total population of the Middle East. Many of these Buddhists are workers who have migrated from other parts of Asia to the Middle East in the last 20 years,{{When|date=March 2015}} many from countries and regions that have large Buddhist populations, such as [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]. A small number of engineers, company directors, and managers from [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Korea]] have also moved to the Middle East.

[[Sikhism]], the fifth-largest organized religion in the world after Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, having over 25 million [[Sikhs]] worldwide, has a small presence in the Middle East too, mainly in the U.A.E, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iran.  Most of them are Punjabi-speaking Indian expatriates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adherents.com/misc/rel_by_adh_CSM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Egypt===
[[Religion in Egypt]] consists of Islam (mostly Sunni Muslim) 90%, Coptic Christians 9% and Other Christians 1%.&lt;ref name=Percents&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Religions|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0855613.html|publisher=InfoPlease|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Egypt has modernized with new forms of media and the Egyptian press was liberalized in the 2000s, Coptic Christianity has become a main topic of religious controversy.&lt;ref name="Elasser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsasser|first=Sebastian|title=Press Liberalization, the New Media, and the 'Coptic Question': Muslim-Coptic Relations in Egypt in a Changing Media Landscape|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=12 February 2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=131–150|doi=10.1080/00263200903432308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much tension between the Muslims and Copts of Egypt as Copts argue for more representation in government and less legal and administrative discrimination; they also feel underprotected from religious hate-crimes . With this greater freedom of press, the Coptic issue has just begun to break into public awareness, but also due to rises in extremism in both communities, media may also be exacerbating the sectarian tension by only publicizing examples of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Elasser"/&gt;

Another current religious tension in Egypt is the role of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], founded by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt. Many countries have now developed their own branches. Many are violent and most Arab governments actively try to restrain the group by arresting and killing members. Currently, as the new government of Egypt is trying to establish itself, many are concerned that a member of the Muslim Brotherhood will again step in and claim leadership. For the current candidates for presidency, more than one is likely to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood is however unpopular among the majority of Egyptians on account of its fundamentalist views, its clampdown on tourism and its desire to impose [[Sharia]] law on the nation.

===Iran===
[[Religion in Iran]] is made up of 98% Islam (Shi'a 89%, Sunni 9%) and 2% Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Bahá'í.&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt; There was much religious oppression and executions of members of the Bahá'í faith. Religious minorities are now beginning to hold a larger presence and significance in Iran and are being acknowledged as such.

The [[Islamic Revolution]] replaced an old world monarchy with a theocracy based on the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist ([[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Velayat-e Faqih]]) where a Shia cleric (faqih) is the ruler, though there are also competitive elections of candidates approved by another clerical body.&lt;ref name=Iran&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rad|first=Anahita Motazed|title=The Relation Between Religion and Government in Iran After the Islamic Revolution (1979)|date=2 May 2011|pages=261|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/2020|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mix of republicanism and religion where that would use religion to rule for elective and democratic institutions; it was to be a blend of liberalism and religious injunctions (abs). Islam would be protected under this Islamic Republic and unelected positions like the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council would have unlimited power over the nation. With the nuclear program developing in Iran and much conflict after September 22, 2001, Iran and the [[Islamic Republic]] are at a crossroads.&lt;ref name=Iran /&gt;

===Iraq===
[[Religion in Iraq]] is represented by 97% Islam (Shiite 60%–65%, Sunni 32%–37%), and 3% Christian or other.&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt; Because of this large majority of Shia over Sunni Muslim, there is much tension between the two groups.

===Israel===
[[Religion in Israel]] is represented by the following religious make-up: Judaism 77%, Islam 16%, Christian 2%, Druze 2% (2003).&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt; As of 2013, the Israeli "[[Government - Christians Forum]]" was formed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Public Security, by Dr. Mordehcai Zaken, head of the Minorities Affairs Desk, to address and promote the concerns of Christian leaders and representative in their interactions with the State. Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community. The majority of displaced and upset Palestinians are Muslim and the majority of current Israeli citizens are Jewish so establishing the state borders is highly influenced by religion.

One of the main difficulties in establishing peace between the two countries is because of [[Jerusalem]]. Each of the three main religions is incredibly attached to this city and claim it as their own. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether Palestinian Territories or Israel will encompass this region. Maps produced within the territories actually represent Jerusalem differently. Palestinian maps draw Jerusalem as divided and Israeli maps show it as a part of Israeli territory.&lt;ref name=Israel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins-Kreiner|first=Y|author2=Mansfeld, Kliot |title=The Reflection of a Political Conflict in Mapping: The Case of Israel's borders and Frontiers|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=11 August 2006|volume=42|issue=3|pages=381–408|doi=10.1080/00263200500521230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
[[Religion in Jordan]] is represented by 92% Muslim (Sunni), 6% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and 2% other.&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt;

===Lebanon===
[[File:ChurchMosque.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Maronite Cathedral]] and the [[Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque]], Beirut. 41% in [[Lebanon]] are [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] representing the mosaic of the Middle East, and contributing heavily in the Media, Politics, Entertainment, Banking... sectors in Lebanon and the World.]]

[[Religion in Lebanon]] is the most unique{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=March 2015}} in the Middle East, and a mix of religions make up [[Lebanon]], represented by 59% [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] ([[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi'a]], [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]], [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], [[Ismailis in Lebanon|Isma'ilite]], [[Alawites in Lebanon|Alawite/Nusayri]]), 41% [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] ([[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite]], [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant]], and Christian churches non-native to Lebanon like [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Armenian Catholic Church]], [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]).Lebanon has a confessional political system in which, regardless of political parties, the [[President]] is always [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christian]], the Prime Minister a [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]], and the Speaker of the Parliament a [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi’ite Muslim]], and the Deputy Prime Minister [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox Christian]]. Also, the [[Army]] General has to be Christian and the [[Bank]] Governor has to be always Christian as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In addition, 50% of the [[Parliament]] is represented by Christian Members, according to the law in Lebanon since the end of the war until today. This is the foundation of uniqueness of Lebanon and the source of much of its conflicts; and while changes have been made to attempt to make parliamentary representation more even, many are still urging for reform and change.&lt;ref name=Lebanon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makhzoumi|first=Fouad|title=Lebanon's Crisis in Sovereignty|journal=Survival: Global Politics and Strategy|date=25 March 2010|volume=52|issue=2|pages=5–12|doi=10.1080/00396331003764298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some would like the confessionalist government to be abolished.&lt;ref name=Lebanon /&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
[[Religion in Saudi Arabia]]  is allegedly 100% Muslim.&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt; It is illegal to practice any other religion than Islam in Saudi Arabia. There is still tension, however, between the Sunnis and the Shiias. Shiite Islamist revolution has never been a huge threat to the Saudi Arabian government, though, because it is such a small population.&lt;ref name=Violence&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hegghammer|first=Thomas|title=Jihad, Yes, But Not Revolution: Explaining the Extraversion of Islamist Violence in Saudi Arabia|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|date=15 December 2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=395–416|doi=10.1080/13530190903338938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni Islamists, though, present a larger threat to the government because of their large Saudi Arabian population. These Sunni groups often dissent through violence targeted at government, Western or non-Muslims that threat the Muslim nation, Shiites, and sometimes generally directed against moral corruption.&lt;ref name=Violence /&gt;

===Syria===
[[Religion in Syria]] is represented by 70% Islam (Sunni), 12% Alawite, 5% Druze, and other Islamic sects, 10% Christian (various sects), and there is some Jewish representation (tiny communities in Damascus, Al Qamishli, and Aleppo).&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt;

===Turkey===
[[Religion in Turkey]] is represented by 99.8% Muslim (mostly Sunni and approximately 20% are [[Alevi]]), and 0.2% other (mostly Christians and Jews).&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt; Originally a militarily secularized government, under the relatively new president Erdogan, religious freedom for Muslims has become much more accessible in Turkey. There has been a growing religious resurgence in Turkey and more and more citizens find significance in their religious identities. The previous laws disallowing the [[Hijab]], religious headscarf, in schools and public places has been a huge source of contention. Now, it is a matter of civil rights in courts. The case of [[Sahin 2004]] was one that really exemplified the tension between religious secularism, civil rights and the government’s power in Turkey.&lt;ref name=Turkey&gt;{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Cole|title=Islam, Europe and Emerging Legal Issues|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case revolved around a student at university being allowed to wear the Hijab in class.&lt;ref name=Turkey /&gt; Religious education is also a topic of debate in Turkey. Before 1980, private religious education was banned and then it was changed to be required. As it is currently being reevaluated, the question is whether religious education should be banned again, optional or if it should be obligatory and plural.

===Yemen===
[[Religion in Yemen]] is represented by a majority Islam (including Sunni and Shiite), small numbers of Jewish, Baha'i, Christian, and Hindu.&lt;ref name=Percents /&gt;

==Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia==
{{Main|Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia}}
In April 2007, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled against Russia for repeatedly refusing to consider the Moscow Church of Scientology's application for the status of a legally valid religious association. [[Church of Scientology Moscow versus Russia|The court found]] that the reasons given to deny re-registration of the church by the justice department and endorsed by the Moscow courts had no legal basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=815108&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR, Church of Scientology Moscow v.

In July 2007, the [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] City Court ordered that the city's Scientology center be closed for violating its charter by engaging in unlicensed health care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Russian court shuts down Scientology center in St. Petersburg: prosecutors | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/12/europe/EU-GEN-Russia-Scientology.php | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | date = 2007-07-12 | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] came to a similar decision in November 2008, closing down the activities of the local center for practicing without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  | title =Hubbard Center closed up in Samara  | work =[[Interfax]]  | publisher =www.interfax-religion.com  | date =November 20, 2008  | url =http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=5395  | accessdate =2008-11-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the European Court of Human Rights issued a binding ruling in favor of two Scientology branches in [[Surgut]] and [[Nizhnekamsk]], which had been denied registration as "religious organizations."&lt;ref name="AP20091002"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iJ_Lp6ZG3jVlOzswrzbOGf08SdkgD9B2BUGG0|title=Scientologists win rights case against Russia|date=2009-10-02|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two organizations were awarded 20,000 € in costs and damages.&lt;ref name="AP20091002" /&gt; The ruling, which cannot be appealed, said that Russia could not ban the Church of Scientology simply because it did not have a long history in the country.&lt;ref name="AP20091002" /&gt;

In December 2009, the court closed the Dianetics Center in [[Naberezhnye Chelny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Interfax]] | title = Суд закрыл Центр дианетики в Набережных Челнах | url=http://www.interfax.ru/society/news.asp?id=114579 | publisher=[[Interfax]] | date=2009-12-11 | accessdate = 2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the activities of the Church of Scientology Moscow were banned by the Moscow city court, an action which was supported by the Supreme Court in June 2016. Two reasons stand for this lengthened struggle between the Church of Scientology and the Russian ministry of justice, first is that the Russian Orthodox Church views CoS as a “destructive organization.” The ROC is split between two contradicting opinions, first that “Scientology is a dangerous heretical sect,” and the others say it is not a religion and is “purely commercial.” One reason for this position is that the Church of Scientology’s name is a United States Trademark and therefore cannot be religious. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2017/falikov.htm |title=The Provisions Against Religious Extremism as an Instrument of Outlawing Religious Minorities in Russia (the Cases of Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Church of Scientology)|last=Fallikov|first=Boris
|work=CESNUR Library |publisher=Center for New Studies on Religions |accessdate=2017-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PierLuigi Zoccatelli argues that the Trademark argument is indicative of the difference between the American and Russian understanding of religion. Even religious bodies need trademarks, because should there be “schism” within the church, the government must be able to identify who can use the original name.  Also, he writes that hundreds of trademarks are owned in the US by religious groups. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2017/plz_kaunas.htm |title=What Is Really Happening in Russia? A Response to Prof. Introvigne and Prof. Falikov |last=Zoccatelli |first=PierLuigi |work=CESNUR Library |publisher=Center for Studies on New Religions |accessdate=2017-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, this position is not accepted by “practically all Russian experts in the field of religious studies,” scholar Boris Falikov writes. Some arguments behind this acceptance is that “the world scientific community recognizes the religious status of Scientology.” Falikov argues that “the rebirth of religion goes side by side with the process of secularization.” Based on this notion, “the border between secular and religious is not rigid anymore,” he writes. He notes that Scientology is “one of the best examples of such New Religious Movements.”

In June 2017, leaders of the Church of Scientology in St. Petersburg were arrested, charged with “participation in an ‘extremist’ community, incitement of hatred, and illegal business activities.” According to Falikov, the accusations have no real basis. As for the accusations of illegal business activities, the Church of Scientology is made up of two branches, one a religious community “with no right to carry on a commercial activity, and the other a commercial branch, which sells books.” Falikov writes. He calls the accusations an “instrument of suppression.” He also mentioned that those arrested won a case against the European Court when their church branch was banned.

In September 2018, the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] adopted the case of imprisoned Russian Scientologist Ivan Matsitsky, calling him a "[[prisoner of conscience]]." Matsitsky had been imprisoned on June 5 2017 after a raid on a Church of Scientology in St. Petersburg. Matsitsky's case was adopted along with that of another religious worker imprisoned in Russia, [[Jehovah's Witness]] Dennis Christensen. On their imprisonment, Vice Chair of the USCIRF Kristina Arriaga stated "These two cases are examples of the Russian government ‘securitizing’ religion—targeting religious communities it considers illegitimate on the pretext that they pose a national security threat”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vice Chair Arriaga Adopts Two Religious Prisoners of Conscience |url=https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases-statements/vice-chair-arriaga-adopts-two-religious-prisoners-conscience |publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64638">{{Quotefarm|date=August 2016}}'''Søren Kierkegaard's theology''' has been a major influence in the development of 20th century theology.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been generally considered the "Father of [[Existentialism]]".  During his later years (1848–1855), most of his writings shifted from philosophical in nature to religious. 

Kierkegaard's theology focuses on the single individual in relation to a known [[God]] based on a subjective truth.  Many of his writings were a directed assault against all of [[Christendom]], [[Christianity]] as a [[political]] and [[social]] entity.  His target was the [[Church of Denmark|Danish State Church]], which represented [[Christendom]] in [[Denmark]].  Christendom, in Kierkegaard's view, made individuals lazy in their religion.  Many of the citizens were officially "Christians", without having any idea of what it meant to be a Christian.  Kierkegaard attempted to awaken Christians to the need for unconditional religious commitment. However he was also against party spirit in religion as well as other areas of study and system building.

==Religious background==
===Kierkegaard===
Søren Kierkegaard was born to a [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] family.  His father, Michael Pederson Kierkegaard, was a Lutheran [[Pietist]], but questioned [[Problem of evil|how God could let him suffer so much]].  One day, he climbed a mountain and cursed God.  For this [[sin]], Michael believed that a family curse was placed upon him, that none of his children would live a full life.  And indeed, Kierkegaard's family suffered with early deaths of Søren's siblings, ranging from childbirth to the age of 25.  Only Søren and his brother Peter survived past 25.  His father died in 1838 but before his death, he asked Søren to become a [[pastor]].  Søren was deeply influenced by his father's religious experience and life, and felt obligated to fulfill his wish.  In 1840, Søren was awarded his theology degree and although Søren was eligible to become a pastor, he decided to pursue a degree in philosophy instead.

He decided not to become a pastor or a professor either because if he had he would have had to write under the authority of the State or the Church. He craved freedom and for that reason he wrote "without authority". He also believed in Christ as the ultimate authority in matters of personal faith. He was against beginning a "new religion", unlike [[German Idealism#Hegel|Hegel]], the religion of reason, and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling#Quotations|Schelling]], the religion of nature. He always wrote to students of religion as a student of religion. J. Loewenberg of Harvard University described Hegel's God in the following terms in 1913:  &lt;blockquote&gt;as Hegel puts his fundamental idea, “the truth is the whole.” Neither things nor categories, neither histories nor religion, neither sciences nor arts, express or exhaust by themselves the whole essence of the universe. The essence of the universe is the ''life'' of the totality of all things, not their ''sum''. As the life of man is not the sum of his bodily and mental functions, the whole man being present in each and all of these, so must the universe be conceived as omnipresent in each of its parts and expressions. This is the significance of Hegel’s conception of the universe as an organism. The [[World-Spirit]]-Hegel’s God-constitutes, thinks, lives, wills, and is ''all'' in unity. The evolution of the universe is thus the evolution of God himself. The task of philosophy, then, as Hegel conceives it, is to portray in systematic form the evolution of the World-Spirit in all its necessary ramifications.''The Life of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,'' p. 13-14&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/germanclassicsof07franuoft#page/12/mode/2up ''THE GERMAN CLASSICS OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES, Volume 7''], published 1913, edited by Kuno Francke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Søren Kierkegaard questioned this evolution of God because if God is evolving in a systematic way then the awe and wonder of religion is replaced with speculations about where God is in relation to the system about God.&lt;blockquote&gt;What does the task look like in everyday life, for I continually have my favorite theme in mind: whether everything is indeed all right with the craving of our theocentric nineteenth century to go beyond Christianity, the craving to speculate, the craving for continued development, the craving for a new religion or for the abolition of Christianity. As for my own insignificant person, the reader will please recall that I am the one who finds the issue and the task so very difficult, which seems to suggest that I have not carried it out, I, who do not even pretend to be a Christian by going beyond it. But it is always something to point out that it is difficult, even if it is done, as it is here, only in an upbuilding divertissement, which is carried out essentially with the aid of a spy whom I have go out among people on weekdays, and with the support of a few dilettantes who against their will come to join in the game." Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846) p. 466, Hong&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "going beyond faith" for Kierkegaard means the same as going beyond oneself. Philosophers, theologians, historians, and anthropologists tend to go beyond themselves and apply what they learn to the course of world history or national history. In this view we come to a Christian nation or a Christian world but Søren Kierkegaard felt that God comes into the single individual and that's where the place of God is. It's not "out there" somewhere. This point was brought home by Kierkegaard in his 1845 book, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'' and in 1960 by Ronald Gregor Smith in his book, ''[[Johann Georg Hamann|J G Hamann]] 1730-1788 A Study In Christian Existence'', {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;A poet has indeed said that a sigh without words ascending Godward, is the best prayer, and so one might also believe that the rarest of visits to the sacred place, when one comes from afar, is the best worship, because both help to create an illusion. A sigh without words is the best prayer when the thought of God only sheds a faint glow over existence, like the blue mountains far distant on the horizon; when the lack of clarity in the soul is satisfied by the greatest possible ambiguity in the thought. But if God is present in the soul, then the sigh will find the thought and the thought will find the word-but also the difficulty, which is not dreamed of when God is at a distance. In our day we hear it proclaimed, to the verge of nonsense, that the highest task is not in living in the stillness, where there is no danger-, because the danger exists there quite as much as in the confusion of life, and the great thing, in short, is neither to live in solitude nor amidst the confusion, but the great thing is to overcome the danger. And the most mediocre things is to work oneself weary in considering which is the most difficult; such labor is useless trouble and has no relevance, like the laborer himself who is neither in the solitude nor the confusion, but in the busy absent-mindedness of reflection. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'', Swenson translation p. 10-11 (also called ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It would, I believe, be possible to detect in the writings of Hamann, in embryonic or sibylline form at least, almost all the major concerns of Kierkegaard. The connections between the two will be apparent to any student of Kierkegaard. A typical appraisal of the relative positions of the two men is that of Karlfried Grunder, in the first volume of the splendidly planned commentaries on Hamann’s main works. He writes: "That God in [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incomprehensible incomprehensible] [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciling]] [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] lowers himself (has entered into human life, [[Dasein]], as Kierkegaard says) is central alike for Kierkegaard and for Hamann. For Hamann it is also, and precisely, the [[world]] which God enters, but for Kierkegaard the place of this event is solely the [[individual]], who in the decision of his faith, effected by grace, rises above the world, with which the “humorist” [in this case Hamann] continues to identify the “idea of God.” Kierkegaard, in other words, reaches a point beyond the world, the point of religious passion, in which the individual faces God, God alone, in the decision of inwardness, of pure subjectivity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/jghamann17301788013654mbp Ronald Gregor Smith, ''J G Hamann 1730-1788 A Study In Christian Existence'' (1960) p. 18-19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===Denmark and Europe===
Kierkegaard accused Christian religious institutions of not being genuinely religious.  Intellectual scholarship in Christianity was becoming more and more like [[Hegelianism]], which he called Christian "evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Postscript, Hong p, 559&lt;/ref&gt; rather than Christianity.  This made the scholars of religion and philosophy examine the [[Gospel]]s from a supposedly higher objective standpoint in order to demonstrate how correct reasoning can reveal an objective truth.  This was outrageous to Kierkegaard because this presupposed that an infinite God and his infinite wisdom could be grasped by finite human understanding.  Kierkegaard believed that Christianity was not a doctrine to be taught, but rather a life to be lived. He considered that many Christians who were relying totally on external proofs of God were missing out a true Christian experience, which is precisely the relationship one individual can have with God. 

{{Quotation |…it should immediately be borne in mind that the issue is not about the truth of Christianity but about the individual’s relation to Christianity, consequently not about the indifferent individual’s systematic eagerness to arrange the truths of Christianity in paragraphs but rather about the concern of the infinitely interested individual with regard to his own relation to such a doctrine. To state it as simply as possible (using myself in an imaginatively constructing way): “I, [[Philosophical Fragments|Johannes Climacus]], born and bred in this city and now thirty years old, an ordinary human being like most folk, assume that a highest good, called an [[Salvation|eternal happiness]], awaits me just as it awaits a housemaid and a professor. I have heard that Christianity is one’s prerequisite for this good. I now ask how I may enter into relation to this doctrine. “What matchless audacity,” I hear a thinker say, “what horrendous vanity, to presume to attach such importance to one’s own little self in this [[World History|world-historical]]ly concerned, this theocentric, this [[Speculative reason|speculatively]] insignificant nineteenth century.” I shudder; if I had not hardened myself against various terrors, I would probably stick my tail between my legs. But in that respect I find myself free of all guilt, because it is not I who of my own accord have become so audacious; it is Christianity itself that compels me. It attaches an entirely different sort of importance to my own little self and to every-so-little [[self]], since it wants to make him eternally happy and that precisely within this single individual it [[Presupposition|presupposes]] this infinite interest in his own happiness as condition ''sin qua non'' [the indispensable condition], an interest with which he hates father and mother and thus probably also makes light of systems and world-historical surveys. Søren Kierkegaard|''Concluding Unscientific Postscript Vol I'' Hong 1992(1846) p. 15-17}}

==Kierkegaard's audience==
Kierkegaard's primary religious audience was Christian readers, especially those who did not fully grasp what Christianity was all about.  It was not his intention to convert non-Christians to Christianity, although much of Kierkegaard's religious writings do appeal to some non-Christian readers.   For example, [[Martin Buber]] was a [[Jew]]ish existentialist theologian who critiqued many of Kierkegaard's ideas.

Kierkegaard delivered religious [[discourse]]s because he didn't become a [[theologian]] or a [[Philosophy of Religion|philosopher of religion]]. His audience was any single individual who is laboring to become what God wants him to become.  {{Quotation|The invitation to a religious address is quite simply this: Come here, all you who labor and are burdened&lt;ref&gt;Come unto me, all you who labor and are burdened and I will give you rest. Matthew 28:11&lt;/ref&gt;-and the address presupposes that all are sufferers-indeed that they all should be. .... The speaker is not to go down among the listeners and single one out, if there is such a one, and say, “No you are much too happy to need my discourse," because if this is heard from the lips of a religious speaker, it must sound like the most scathing irony. The distinction between fortunate and unfortunate is only jest, and therefore the speaker ought to say, “We are all sufferers, but joyful in our suffering-this is what we strive for.” ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong P. 437-438}}

Striving can be done for the individual goal of becoming famous or just striving to make a living and the hope to have a future. Kierkegaard writes about the "divinely appointed teachers" of what it means to be a human being. And Christ is the prototype for what it means to be a human being from Kierkegaard's point of view. He put it this way in his ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' (1847): {{Quotation|Why does the bird not have worry about making a living? Because it lives only in the moment, because there is nothing eternal in the bird. But is this indeed a perfection! On the other hand, how does the possibility of [[worry]] about making a living arise-because the eternal and the temporal touch each other in a consciousness or, more correctly, because the human being has a [[consciousness]]. In his consciousness he is eternally far, far beyond the moment; no bird flew so far away, and yet for this very reason he becomes aware of the danger the bird does not suspect-when eternity comes into existence for him, so also did tomorrow. This is why the human being has a dangerous enemy that the bird does not know-time, an enemy, yes, an enemy or a friend whose pursuits and whose association he cannot avoid because he has the eternal in his consciousness and therefore has to measure it. The temporal and the eternal can in many ways touch each other painfully in the human consciousness, but one of the especially painful contacts is worry about making a living. 

This worry seems infinitely remote from the eternal. God lifted the human being high above the bird by means of the eternal in his consciousness; then in turn he pressed him down, so to speak, below the bird by his acquaintance with care, the lowly, earthly care of which the bird is ignorant. Oh how noble it seems for the bird not to have worry about making a living-and yet how much more glorious it is to be able to have it! Therefore the human being can certainly learn from the bird, can in fact call the bird his teacher, yet not in the highest sense.  …. When it is said that the birds have nests and the foxes have holes,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 8:19-20, Luke 9:57-58 As they were going along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” ESV&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Christ|Son of man]] has no place to lay his head, this is about a state that is more helpless than the bird’s and is also conscious of this. But then, with the consciousness of being without a nest, without a place of resort, in that situation to be free from care-indeed, this is the divine prototype of the lofty creation, of the human being. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong, p. 195-197}}

He wrote for individuals who struggle with sin and forgiveness and he began this in ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843) and continued through 1851 with a repetition of his theme from his [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843|three discourse of 1843]] ''Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins''. He sees the spiritual connection between God and the single individual much akin to Luther's idea of the priesthood of all believers. {{Quotation|In the brief moments prescribed, let us than speak about these words: ''Love (Christ’s love) hides a multitude of sins.'' Is it not true that you have felt the need of this and on this very day you feel the need of a love that can cover sins, your sins-and this is why you are going to the [[Eucharist|Lord’s table]] today? While it is only all too true, as Luther says, that every human being has a preacher within him-he eats with him, drinks with him, awakens with him, sleeps with him, in short, is always around him, always with him, wherever he is and whatever he does, a preacher who is called flesh and blood, lusts and passions, habits and inclination-so it is also certain that deep within every human being there is a secret-sharer who is present just as scrupulously everywhere-the [[conscience]]. A person can perhaps succeed in hiding his sins from the world, he can perhaps be foolishly happy that he succeeds, or yet, a little more honest, admit that it is a deplorable weakness and cowardliness that he does not have the courage to become open-but a person cannot hide his sins from himself. This is impossible, because the sin that was absolutely unconditionally hidden from himself would, of course, not be sin, any more than if it were hidden from God, which is not the case of either, since a person, as soon as he is aware of himself and in everything in which he is aware of himself, is also aware of God and God is aware of him. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Two Discourses at Friday Communion'', (''Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins'' 1 Peter 4:7:12 The Bible) from ''Without Authority'', Hong translation 1997 p. 182}}

==Themes in his theology==
===Faith===
[[Faith]] is a hallmark of Kierkegaardian philosophical and religious thought.  Two of his key ideas are based on faith: the [[leap to faith]] and the [[knight of faith]]. Some regard Kierkegaard as a [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalist]],&lt;ref name="universalism"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ludlow |first=Morwenna |editor1-last=Parry |editor1-first=Robin A. |editor2-last=Partridge |editor2-first=Christopher Hugh |editor-link=Robin Parry |title=Universal Salvation?: The Current Debate |format=Hardback |edition=1st |year=2004 |publisher=[[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing]] |isbn=0-8028-2764-0 |chapter=Universalism in the History of Christianity |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in his journals, "If others go to [[Hell]], I will go too. But I do not believe that; on the contrary, I believe that all will be saved, myself with them—something which arouses my deepest amazement." However, this view is not always supported by  Kierkegaard's own writings. He presupposes the individual who has decided to become a Christian has an interest in becoming that, is interested enough to attempt to develop a relationship with Christ, and has enough faith to believe that the [[Logical possibility|possibility]] extends to all individuals equally. Faith is what makes each individual equal before God. He put it this way in his ''Four Upbuilding Discourses 1844 (Against Cowardliness)''. {{Quotation|Now it is certainly true that the good, the truly great and noble, is different for different people, but [[leap of faith|resolution]], which is the true acknowledgment, is still the same. This is a very upbuilding thought. Someone who wants to erect a tower sits down and roughly estimates how high he can [[Counting the cost|erect the tower]]. Alas, how different it appears at the time of the rough estimate, but how similar in the moment of resolution, and if there is no resolution there will be no tower, however imaginary or however really splendid the estimate was! The good resolution is to will to do everything in one’s power, so serve it to the utmost of one’s capability. To do everything one is capable of doing-what blessed equality, since every human being is indeed capable of that. Only in the moment of the rough estimate is there difference. 

Or consider someone who wants to do an act of mercy-can he do more than give all that he possesses-and did not the widow give infinitely more than the rich man gave out of his abundance! At times the circumstances can determine that a penny signifies little more than it usually signifies, but if someone wants to do something marvelous, he can make the one penny signify just as much as all the world’s gold put together if he gives it out of compassion and the penny is the only one he has. Indeed, someone who has an ear for judging how large the gift is detects the difference just by hearing the jingle of the coins, but compassion and the temple box understand it differently. 

When someone who enjoys health and strength and who possesses the best gifts of the spirit enters the service of the good with all that he has, with the range of years that seem to stretch out before him, with expectancy’s every demand upon life, every claim expected and demanded only for the sake of the good-and when, on the other hand, someone who sadly sees his earthly frailty and the day of disintegration so close that he is tempted to speak of the time granted him as the pastor speaks of it, when in the hour of resolution a person like that promises with the pastor’s words “to dedicate these moments” to the service to the good-whose tower then becomes higher? Do they not both reach heaven? Or when one person, a stranger to internal enemies, aggressively directs his mind and thoughts toward humankind in the service of the good and wins thousands, and when another, retreating in internal battles, in the moment of resolution saves himself, whose tower then becomes higher? &lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Four Upbuilding Discourses 1844'' Against Cowardliness from Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses 1843-1844 p 361-362  tower Luke 14.28-30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He wrote the following in his 1846 book, [[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although an outsider, I have at least understood this much, that the only unforgivable high treason against Christianity is the single individual’s taking his relation to it for granted. I must therefore most respectfully refuse all theocentric helpers and the assistance of helper’s helpers to help me into Christianity in that way. So I prefer to remain where I am, with my infinite interest, with the issue, with the possibility. In other words, it is not impossible that the individual who is infinitely interested in his own eternal happiness can some day become eternally happy; on the other hand, it is certainly impossible that the person who has lost a sense for it (and such a sense can scarcely be anything but an infinite concern) can become eternally happy. Indeed, once lost, it is perhaps impossible to regain it. Page 16&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And reinforced the same idea in his 1850 book, ''[[Practice in Christianity]]'': {{Quotation|When in sickness I go to a physician, he may find it necessary to prescribe a very painful treatment-there is no self-contradiction in my submitting to it. No, but if on the other hand I suddenly find myself in trouble, an object of persecution, because, because I have gone to that physician: well, then there is a self-contradiction. The physician has perhaps announced that he can help me with regard to the illness from which I suffer, and perhaps he can really do that-but there is an "''aber''" [but] that I had not thought of at all. The fact that I get involved with this physician, attach myself to him-that is what makes me an object of persecution; here is the possibility of offense. So also with Christianity. Now the issue is: will you be offended or will you believe. If you will believe, then you push through the possibility of offense and accept Christianity on any terms. So it goes; then forget the understanding; then you say: Whether it is a help or a torment, I want only one thing, I want to belong to Christ, I want to be a Christian. Hong p. 115}}

Faith, for Kierkegaard, was more than intellectual understanding. He began his great book ''Either/Or'' with a quotation from [[Edward Young]], "Is reason then alone baptized, are the passions pagans?"&lt;ref&gt;Title page Either/Or, Hong&lt;/ref&gt; and later explained what he meant in his ''Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', which [[Rollo May]] called "the declaration of independence for [[existentialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rollo May, ''[[The Discovery of Being]]'', 1983 p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Intellect is important but not all inclusive in the realm of religion. "A" in ''Either/Or'' wanted to use the arts to teach Christianity. "B" wanted to use the science of ethics to teach Christianity. Both can lead to an intellectual understanding devoid of passionate involvement in the act of becoming a Christian. 

[[Richard McKeon]] (1900-1985) thought the imitators of [[Plato]] had misapplied his ideas and left the passions out of philosophy in favor of intellectualism. He wrote the following in his 1953 book ''Thought, Action, and Passion'': {{Quotation|The fact that Plato applied the term “Ideas” to the realities which are imitated by things and by thoughts, has led many of his interpreters and admirers to conceive his philosophy in purely, or in fundamentally, intellectual terms. This is the more surprising, since few philosophers, and even Augustine and Ambrose, or Rousseau and Kierkegaard, whose arguments reflect Plato’s dialectic and whose inquiries echo Socrates’ ironic questions, have devoted more thought than Plato to nonrational springs of human action and to nonintellectual insights into transcendent values-to love, poetry, intoxication, and the mystical perceptions of intuition and religion. The theme of love, rather than the Idea of the Good, or the One, or the Beautiful, is suited to the focus in human action on motivation and inspiration instead of on the rational analysis of means and ends; and the techniques of poetry, religion, rhetoric, and drinking, which find their perfection in dialectic and philosophy, are appropriate to focus attention on the persuasion of men to action instead of on analysis of truths by which love operates and by which it finds its ultimate justification. 
*Richard Mckeon, ''Thought, Action, and Passion'' 1953 P. 15&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thoughtactionand010036mbp ''Thought, Action, and Passion'', Mckeon]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Young Man in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' was mediated by his [[psychologist]], Constantin Constantius, as he tried to solve his problem. They represent the intellectual side of the human being and Abraham in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' represented the passion of inwardness because he was alone with God. Abraham believed in the actuality of God and could say nothing either artistically or ethically about it. Yet neither the Young Man nor Abraham is the prototype for the Christian, because the Christian is to follow Christ as the example. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Even greater than these is the knight of faith who dares to say to the noble one who wants to weep for him: “Do not weep for me, but weep for yourself.” Luke 23:28  Sweet sentimental longing leads us to the goal of our desire, to see Christ walking about in the promised land. We forget the anxiety the distress, the paradox. Was it such a simple thing not to make a mistake? Was it not terrifying that this man walking around among the others was God? Was it not terrifying to sit down to eat with him? Was it such an easy matter to become an apostle? But the result, the eighteen centuries-that helps, that contributes to this mean deception whereby we deceive ourselves and others. I do not wish to be brave enough to be contemporary with events like that, but I do not for that reason severely condemn those who made a mistake, nor do I depreciate those who saw what was right. But I come back to Abraham. During the time before the result, either Abraham was a murderer every minute or we stand before a paradox that is higher than all mediation. The story of Abraham contains, then, a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the single individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox, which cannot be mediated. How he entered into it is just as inexplicable as how he remains in it. Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that which unites all human life is passion, and faith is a passion. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Fear and Trembling'' 1843, Hong p. 66-67&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The object of faith is the actuality of another person; its relation is an infinite interestedness. The object of faith is not a doctrine, for then the relation is intellectual, and the point is not to bungle it but to reach the maximum of the intellectual relation. The object of faith is not a teacher who has a doctrine, for when the teacher has a doctrine, then the doctrine is ''eo ipso'' more important than the teacher, and the relation is intellectual, in which the point is not to bungle it but to reach the maximum of the intellectual relation. But the object of faith is the actuality of the teacher, that the teacher actually exists. Therefore [[Either/Or|faith’s answer is absolutely either yes or no.]] Faith’s answer is not in relation to a doctrine, whether it is true or not, not in relation to a teacher, whether his doctrine is true or not, but is the answer to the question about a fact: Do you accept as fact that he actually existed? Please note that the answer is with infinite passion. In other words, in connection with a human being it is thoughtless to lay so infinitely much weight upon whether he has existed or not. Therefore, if the object of faith is a human being, the whole thing is a prank by a foolish person who has not even grasped the esthetic and the intellectual. The object of faith is therefore the god’s actuality in the sense of existence. But to exist signifies first and foremost to be a particular individual, and this is why thinking must disregard existence, because the particular cannot be thought, but only the universal. The object of faith, then, is the actuality of the god in existence, that is, as a particular individual, that is that the god has existed as an individual human being. Christianity is not a doctrine about the unity of the divine and the human, about subject-object, not to mention the rest of the logical paraphrases of Christianity. In other words, if Christianity were a doctrine, then the relation to it would not be one of faith, since there is only an intellectual relation to a doctrine. Christianity, therefore, is not a doctrine but the fact that the god has existed. Faith, then, is not a lesson for slow learners in the sphere of intellectuality, an asylum for dullards. But faith is a sphere of its own, and the immediate identifying mark of every misunderstanding of Christianity is that it changes it into a doctrine and draws it into the range of intellectuality. What holds as the maximum in the sphere of intellectuality, to remain completely indifferent to the actuality of the teacher, holds in just the opposite way in the sphere of faith-its maximum is the ''quam maxime'' [in the greatest degree possible] infinite interestedness of the actuality of the teacher. The individual’s own ethical actuality is the only actuality. That this seems strange to many does not surprise me. To me it seems odd that one has finished with the system and systems without asking about the ethical. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol 1'', p. 326-327 Hong&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===Paradox===
Briefly stated, a [[paradox]] is an apparently true statement or group of statements that seems to lead to a contradiction or to a situation that defies [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].  It is said to be resolved when we show that the contradiction is only apparent.  Kierkegaard's story of [[Abraham]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' exhibits such a paradox.  Abraham could not prove he had heard the voice of God, yet he believes, and risked his only son based on this belief.  The paradox of Abraham is that the believer acts and risks much on less than complete knowledge (incomplete knowledge is not sufficient for faith for Kierkegaard; one must believe by virtue of the absurd, that is to say because something is a contradiction). The god in time is a paradox just as much as the statement that "God is love" is a parody for an individual existing in time. Was it so easy for Abraham, Job, and the Apostle Paul to continue to believe that God is love? Kierkegaard continually stresses the tension between the inner and outer self before God. &lt;blockquote&gt;What a human being knows by himself about love is very superficial; he must come to know the deeper love from God-that is, in self-denial he must become what every human being can become (since self-denial is related to the universally human and thus is distinguished from the particular call and election), an instrument for God. Thus every human being can come to know everything about love, just as every human being can come to know that he, like every human being, is loved by God. Some find this thought adequate for the longest life (which doesn’t seem surprising to me); so even at the age of seventy they do not think that they have marveled over it enough, whereas others find this thought so insignificant (which seems to me very strange and deplorable), since to be loved by God is no more than every human being is-as if it were therefore less significant. 

The work of praising love must be done outwardly in self-sacrificing unselfishness. Through self-denial a human being gains the ability to be an instrument by inwardly making himself into nothing before God. Through self-sacrificing unselfishness he outwardly makes himself into nothing, an unworthy servant. Inwardly he does not become self-important, since he is nothing, and outwardly he does not become self-important either, since he is nothing before God – and he does not forget that right where he is he is before God. 

Alas, it can happen that a person makes a mistake at the last moment, in that he, though truly humble before God, becomes proud of what he is able to do as he turns toward people. It is then a temptation of comparison that becomes his downfall. He understood that he could not compare himself to God; before him he became conscious of himself as a nothing; but in comparison with people he still thought himself to be something. That is, he forgot the self-denial; he is trapped in an illusion, as if he were before God only during specific hours, just as one has an audience with His Royal Majesty at a specific hour. 
Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' 1847, Hong 1995 p. 364-365&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Isaac was "the whole world" to Abraham and God had just introduced Abraham to the notion of "the soul". Was Abraham willing to give up the whole world in order to save his soul? Kierkegaard dealt with this question in ''Either/Or'' in this way: "The Bible says: For what would it profit a person if he gained the whole world but damaged his own soul; what would he have in return? Scripture does not state the antithesis to this, but it is implicit in the sentence. The antitheses would read something like this: What damage would there be to a person if he lost the whole world and yet did not damage his soul; what would he need in return?" This question brings Abraham to despair.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Either/Or Part II'', 217-227&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham was used as a prototype in ''Fear and Trembling'' and The Young Man was his counterpoint in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''. Abraham followed the inner voice without mediation from his wife, Sarah, his servant, or Isaac. He just heard and obeyed. The Young Man made a promise and wanted to change his mind. He consulted with a psychologist who was engaged in trying to prove the theory of [[eternal return]]. Then he appealed to Job and complained not only to the world but also to God himself. Abraham's love of God never changed but The Young Man's love for his fiancé was ever changing. Change was the theme of Kierkegaard's ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses|Three Upbuilding Discourses of 1843]]''. These three books were published on the same day and should be considered together.
{{Quotation|In order to stress the element of self-determination in thinking, philosophy declares: The absolute is because I think it. But since philosophy itself perceives that free thinking is thereby designated, not the necessary thinking it usually celebrates, it substitutes another expression: namely, that my thinking of the absolute is the absolute’s thinking-itself in me. This expression is by no means identical with the one preceding; it is, however, very suggestive. That is to say, my thinking is an element of the absolute, and therein lies the necessity of my thinking, therein lies the necessity with which I think it. It is otherwise with the good. The good is because I will it, and otherwise it is not at all. This is the expression of freedom, and the same is also the case with evil-it is only inasmuch as I will it. This in no way reduces or lowers the categories of good and evil to merely subjective categories. On the contrary, the absolute validity of these categories is declared. The good is the [[being-in-and-for-itself]], posited by the being-in-and-for-itself, and this is freedom. It might seem dubious for me to use the expression “to choose oneself absolutely,” because this might seem to imply that I chose both the good and the evil just as absolutely and that both the good and evil belonged to me just as essentially. It was to prevent this misunderstanding that I used the expression “I repent myself out of the whole existence.” [[Repentance]] specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute  but only a product. ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 224}}

{{Quotation|Most people probably have an idea, sometimes a vivid idea, at specific times a fervent feeling, that God is love; and yet there perhaps are many people who live in such a way that it vaguely seems to them that if this or that horrible thing, which they especially dread, were to befall them they would have to give up their faith, let go of God, lose him. But is anything more indefensible than to go on living this way: to vitiate the highest passion in a semidrowsiness between doubt and trust, so that the individual never faces the insidious enemy that sucks the blood of his innermost being, so that, thinking he is not in despair, he never comes to shutter at this condition-because he has dozed off in despair! Alas, God is not the one who loses anything by this, but the sleeper, he who truly is sinning by sleeping, he loses everything, loses that without which life is really nothing. Just as Scripture speaks of suffering the shipwreck of faith, so also it must be said of the person who gave up his faith in God’s love that he is suffering the shipwreck of eternity’s joy of living. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p 269}}

The paradox and the absurd are ultimately related to the Christian relationship with Christ, the God-Man. That God became a single individual and wants to be in a relationship with single individuals, not to the masses, was Kierkegaard's main conflict with the nineteenth century church. The single individual can make and keep a resolution. Those who aren't interested in becoming a Christian claim they can't understand Christianity and quite often they will point to historical events to justify their position. Kierkegaard is against basing Christian belief solely on external events because it leads to doubt since externals are in constant flux. Doubt leads to speculation and this detracts from the single individual making a decision to imitate Christ. He wanted to be known as the philosopher of the internal and was against [[Relationship between religion and science|scientific proofs]] of Christianity through history, anthropology, and philosophy and the creation of [[systematic theology]]. Becoming a Christian is a decision to be made in time, just like becoming good is a decision/resolution made in time, and not just for consideration because the individual offers the "self" to God. 

Kierkegaard said [[Socrates]] was his teacher and that Christ was his Teacher. (See ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'') {{Quotation|When Socrates believed that God is, he held fast the objective uncertainty with the entire passion of inwardness, and faith is precisely in this contradiction, in this risk. Now it is otherwise. Instead of the objective uncertainty, there is here the certainty that, viewed objectively, it is the absurd, and this absurdity, held fast in the passion of inwardness, is faith. … What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up, has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being. [[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]], Hong p. 210}}

This Christian belief in the absurd notion that God became man separates one from the world in such a way that the Christian is [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/estranged estranged] from the world. The world believes that reason guides all our actions, or should, and can't accept Christianity and is therefore offended and the Christian can't accept the reason of the world and is therefore offended by the world. Kierkegaard put it this way in his [[Attack Upon Christendom]]: {{Quotation|A Christian in the New Testament sense is literally a stranger and a pilgrim, he feels himself a stranger, and everyone involuntarily feels that this man is a stranger to him.&lt;ref&gt;Attack Upon Christendom, The Instant, No. 7, Søren Kierkegaard, 1854-1855, Walter Lowrie 1944, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Despair and sin===
According to Kierkegaard, the self is [[Free will|freedom]]. Not simply the freedom to choose, but the freedom to create choices for oneself. Therefore, human beings are fundamentally neither their thoughts nor their feelings but rather they are themselves. The self relates directly to itself and is subject to no one and everyone at the same time. Yet this self is in relation to body and mind and spirit in Kierkegaard's view. The spirit constitutes the relationship of the self to God. In effect, when a person does not come to a full [[consciousness]] of himself or herself, then he or she is said to be in [[wiktionary:despair|despair]]. Just like a [[physician]] might say that no one is completely healthy, it follows that human beings must despair at certain moments in their lives. To be in despair is to reflect upon the self. If someone does not engage in the art of despair, then he or she shall become stuck in a state of [[inertia]] with no effective [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/progress progression] or [[wikt:regression|regression]] and that is the worst state of all. 

Kierkegaard calls sickness, the sickness of the spirit. He wrote the following in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' in 1846.  {{Quotation|We left the religious person in the crisis of sickness; but this [[The Sickness Unto Death|sickness is not unto death]].&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11&amp;version=KJV ''John Chapter 11''] The Bible&lt;/ref&gt; We shall now let him be strengthened by the very same conception that destroyed him, by the conception of God. First and foremost, in each generation there certainly are not many who suffer through even the beginning of the absolute religious relationship; and next, that a beginning in the existence-medium is anything but something that is decided once and for all, because it is only on paper that one is finished with the first phase, and then has nothing more to do with it. The absolute decision in the existence-medium still is and remains only an approximation because the eternal aims from above at the existing person, who by existing is in motion and thus at the moment the eternal touches is already a little moment away from there. The beginning of the absolute decision in the existence-medium is least of all once and for all, something accomplished, because the existing person is not and abstract X who accomplishes something and then goes further, goes through life, if I may put it this way, undigested; but the existing person becomes concrete in what has been experienced, and as he proceeds he has it with him and can lose it at any moment. He has it with him, not the way one has something in a pocket, but through this, this specific thing, he is what he is more specifically defined and loses his own more specific definition by losing it. 

Through the decision in existence, an existing person, more specifically defined, has become what he is. If he sets it aside, it is not he who has lost something, so that he does not have himself and has lost something, but then he has lost himself and must start from the beginning. The religious person has recovered from his sickness (tomorrow there may be a relapse due to a little unjudiciousness). He perhaps fortifies himself with the upbuilding reflection that God, who created man, certainly knows best all the numerous things that to a human being appear to be incapable of being joined together with the thought of God-all the earthly desires, all the confusion in which he can be trapped, and the necessity of diversion, of rest, as well as a night’s sleep. It is obvious that the discussion here is not about the indulgence that is preached in the world, where one human being consoles himself through another, consoles himself reciprocally and leaves God out. Every human being is gloriously structured, but what destroys so many is this confounded talkativeness between man and man about what must be suffered but also be matured in silence, the confession before human beings instead of before God, this candid communication to this one and that one of what ought to be a secret and be before God in secret, this impatient hankering for makeshift consolation. No, in the pain of annihilation, the religious person has learned that human indulgence is of no benefit; therefore he listens to nothing from that corner, but he is before God and suffers through what it means to be a human being and then to be before God. Therefore he cannot be comforted by what the human crowd mutually knows, people who have a market-town idea of what it means to be a human being, and a fluent, talkative idea at seventeenth hand of what it means to be before God. From God he must draw his comfort, lest his entire religiousness become a rumor. P. 488-490}}

Kierkegaard asked sharp questions that can only be answered by the "single individual" him or her self. This is an example from his 1847 book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' where he speaks of the third person and the crowd.:

{{Quotation|"Custom and use change, and any comparison limps or is only half truth; but eternity’s custom, which never becomes obsolete, is that you are a single individual, that even in the intimate relationship of marriage you should have been aware of this. …. Eternity does not ask whether you brought up your children the way you saw others doing it but asks you as an individual how you brought up your children. …. In eternity you are a single individual, and conscience, when it speaks with you, is no third person, no more than you are a third person when you are speaking with the conscience, because you and the conscience are one; it knows everything you know, and it knows that you know it. .... If you do not live in an out-of-the-way spot in the world, if you live in a heavily populated city and you then turn your attention outward, sympathetically give heed to people and events, do you bear in mind, every time you relate yourself in this way to the outside world, that in this relation you are relating yourself to yourself as a single individual with eternal responsibility? Or do you filter yourself into the crowd, where the one blames another, where one moment there are, as they say, a ''great many'', and where at the next moment, every time responsibility is mentioned, there is ''no one''? Do you judge as the crowd judges, in the capacity of the crowd?  You are not obligated to have an opinion about something that you do not understand. No, on the contrary, you are eternally exempted, but as an individual you are eternally obligated to make an accounting of your opinion, of your judgment. And in eternity you will not be pryingly and busily asked, as by a journalist, whether there were a great many who had the same – wrong opinion, but only whether you had it; whether you have pamperingly accustomed your soul to judge light-mindedly and unthinkingly along with the others because the crowd judged unthinkingly; whether you perhaps have corrupted the better part in you by boasting along with the crowd that you were many and that you were justified because you were many, that is, you were many who were wrong. In eternity you will be asked whether you perhaps have harmed a good cause because you also judged along with those who did not understand how to judge but who had the crowd’s considerable power in a temporal sense, negligible power in eternity’s sense."

Sin is separation from God but despair over sin is separation again. Kierkegaard said, "The consciousness of sin definitely belongs to the [[consciousness]] of the [[forgiveness]] of sin."&lt;ref&gt; ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' Hong p. 524
&lt;/ref&gt; Why would someone sit and reflect on sin to such an extent that an eternal happiness is exchanged for an eternal unhappiness or even a temporal unhappiness? This reflection is done in time but the consequence of the reflection leads one to lose hope in the possibility of any good coming from oneself. Kierkegaard says Christianity invites the single individual to become a partaker not only of the consciousness of sin but also of the consciousness of forgiveness but we seem to concentrate on the former to a remarkable degree. He said the following in ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' (1845) and ''Practice in Christianity'' (1850): {{Quotation|People see God in great things, in the raging of the elements and in the course of world history; they entirely forget what the child understood, that when it shut its eyes it sees God. When the child shuts its eyes and smiles, it becomes an angel; alas, when the adult comes to be alone before the Holy One and is silent-he becomes a sinner! First of all, be alone; then you will indeed learn the proper worship of God, to think highly of God and lowly of yourself-not more lowly than your neighbor, as if you were the distinguished one- (but remember that you are before God)-not more lowly than your enemy, as if you were the better one (for remember that you are before God); but lowly of yourself. Anyone who thinks of sin in this way and wishes in this stillness to learn an art-something you, my listener, do not disdain, the art of sorrowing over your sins-will certainly discover that the confession of sin is not merely a counting of all the particular sins but is a comprehension before God that sin has a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coherence coherence] in itself. ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' p. 31-32}} {{Quotation|Accept the invitation so that the inviter may save you from what is so hard and dangerous to be saved from, so that, saved, you may be with him who is the Savior of all, of innocence also. For even if it were possible that utterly pure innocence was to be found somewhere, why should it not also need a Savior who could keep it safe from evil! –The invitation stands at the crossroad, there where the way of sin turns more deeply into sin. Come here, all you who are lost and gone astray, whatever your error and sin, be it to human eyes more excusable and yet perhaps more terrible, or be it to human eyes more terrible and yet perhaps more excusable, be it disclosed here on earth or be it hidden and yet known in heaven-and even if you found forgiveness on earth but no peace within, or found no forgiveness because you did not seek it, or because you sought it in vain: oh, turn around and come here, here is rest! The invitation stands at the crossroad, there where the way of sin turns off for the last time and disappears from view in-perdition. Oh, turn around, turn around, come here; do not shrink from the difficulty of retreat, no matter how hard it is; do not be afraid of the laborious pace of conversion, however toilsomely it leads to salvation, whereas sin leads onward with winged speed, with mounting haste-or leads downward so easily, so indescribably easily, indeed, as easily as when the horse, completely relieved of pulling, cannot, not even with all its strength, stop the wagon, which runs it into the abyss. Do not [[depression (mood)|despair]] over every [[relapse]], which the God of [[patience]] has the patience to forgive and under which a sinner certainly should have the patience to humble himself. No, fear nothing and do not despair; he who says “Come here” is with you on the way; from him there is help and forgiveness on the way of [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] that leads to him, and with him is rest.  Søren Kierkegaard, ''Practice in Christianity'' p. 18-19}}

===Christian doctrine===
Kierkegaard believed that Christ was the originator of Christian doctrine and he had discussed some of the doctrinal points in his ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]''. In these he discussed love, patience, equality, hope, and faith. It's easy to think you have faith but tougher to think your "neighbor" has faith. Kierkegaard made that point in his first ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, faith is qualitatively different. It is not only the highest good, but it is a good in which all are able to share, and the person who rejoices in the possession of it also rejoices in the countless human race, “because what I possess.” He says, “every human being has or could possess.” The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all. It was that kind of wish the perplexed man was seeking, one he could wish for another person with all his heart, with all his might, and with his whole soul, a wish he would dare to go on wishing, ever more fervently, even as his love became ever more fervent. –That was the wish that he would wish. 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 10&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christianity has two parts, law and gospel, and Kierkegaard emphasized that Christ put an end to law with his law of love. "Just make the attempt, whether you find the sum that way no matter how long you go on counting, and you will see that it is useless labor, because the concept of the Law is to be inexhaustible, limitless, endless in its provisions; every provision begets of itself an even more precise provision, and in turn a still more precise provision by reference and in relation to the new provision, and so on infinitely. The relation of love to the Law is here like the relation of faith to understanding. The understanding counts and counts, calculates and calculates, but it never arrives at the certainty that faith possesses; in the same way the Law defines and defines but never arrives at the sum, which is love."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' Published in 1847 Edited and Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong 1995 Princeton University Press p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Loving the neighbor has a "double danger." The same with faith and hope. We not only wish that we could have love and peace but that our neighbor can have the same because its a free gift from God. He nicely summed up the idea he had in his 1847 book ''Works of Love''.  {{Quotation|The times are past when only the powerful and the prominent were human beings – and the others were bond servants and slaves. This is due to Christianity but from this it does follow that prominence or power can no longer become a snare for a person so that he becomes enamored of this dissimilarity, damages his soul, and forgets what it is to love the neighbor. If this happens now, it certainly must happen in a more hidden and secret way, but basically it remains the same. Whether someone savoring his arrogance and his pride openly gives other people to understand that they do not exist for him and, for the nourishment of his arrogance, wants them to feel it as he demands expression of slavish submission from them, or whether he slyly and secretly expresses that they do not exist for him simply by avoiding any contact with them (perhaps also out of fear that openness would incite people and endanger him personally)-these are basically one and the same. The inhumanity and the un-Christianness of this consists not in the way in which it is done but in independently wanting to deny kinship with all people, with unconditionally every person. Ah, to keep oneself unstained by this world is the task and doctrine of Christianity-would to God that we all did it-but to cling to that in a worldly way as if it were the most glorious of dissimilarities-that is plain defilement. Distinguished corruption will teach the distinguished person that he exists only for the distinguished, that he is to live only in the alliance of their circles, that he must not exist for other people, just as they must not exist for him. 

When you go with God, you need to see only one single miserable person and you will be unable to escape what Christianity wants you to understand – human similarity. When you go with God, hold only to him, and understand under God everything you understand, then you will discover … the neighbor; then God will constrain you to love him – shall I say to your own detriment – because to love the neighbor is a thankless task. It is one thing to let ideas compete with ideas, and it is one thing to argue and win in a dispute; it is something else to be victorious over one’s own mind when one battles in the actuality of life. However hard one contending idea presses upon another, however hard one contender presses upon another in a dispute, all this contending is still at a distance and is like shadowboxing. On the other hand, the measure of a person’s disposition is this: how far is he from what he understands to what he does, how great is the distance between his understanding and his actions. A child, the simplest person, and the wisest all understand the highest and all understand the very same thing, because it is, if I dare to say so, one lesson we are all assigned. But what makes the difference is whether we understand it at a distance-so that we do not act accordingly, or close at hand-so that we act accordingly and “cannot do otherwise,” cannot refrain from doing it, like Luther, who understood very close at hand what he had to do when he said, “I cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.” 

Let us now consider the dissimilarity of lowliness. The times are past when those called the more lowly had no conception of themselves or only the conception of being slaves, of not merely being lowly human beings but of not being human beings at all. The fierce rebellion, the horror that followed upon that horror, are perhaps also over, but I wonder if the corruption may not still dwell hidden in a person. In that case the corrupted lowliness will lead the lowly person to believe that he must see his enemy in the powerful and the prominent, in everyone who is favored by some advantage. But be cautious, as the saying goes, because these enemies still have so much power that it could be dangerous to break with them. Therefore the corruption will not teach the lowly one to rise in rebellion or to repress entirely every expression of deference or to allow the secret to be disclosed, but it will teach that something should be done and yet not done, should be done and yet in such a way that the powerful person will derive no pleasure from it, although he will be unable to say that something has been withheld from him.  Thus even in homage there will be a crafty defiance that, hidden, can exasperate, a reluctance that, hidden, says no to what the mouth professes, a tonelessness, as it were. Of suppressed envy in the acclaim that honors the powerful. No force is to be used-that could become dangerous; it must not come to a break-that could become dangerous; but a secret of hidden exasperation, a remotely intimated painful dejection will transform the power and honor and eminence into an affliction for the powerful, the honored, and the eminent, who still would not be able to find anything specific to complain about-because here lie the art and the secret.  Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847 Hong 1995 p. 74-81 (See pages 198ff also)}}

'''Umbanda''' ({{IPA-pt|ũˈbɐ̃dɐ}}) is a [[syncretism|syncretic]] [[Afro-Brazilian religions|Afro-Brazilian religion]] that blends African traditions with [[Catholicism|Roman Catholicism]], [[Spiritism]], and Indigenous American beliefs. Although some of its beliefs and most of its practices existed in the late 19th century in almost all Brazil, it is assumed that Umbanda originated in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and surrounding areas in the early 20th century, mainly due to the work of a psychic (medium), [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes]], who practiced Umbanda among the poor [[Afro-Brazilians]] slave descendants. Since then, Umbanda has spread across mainly southern Brazil and neighboring countries like [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. 
 
Umbanda has many branches, each one with a different set of beliefs and practices. Some common beliefs are the existence of a [[Supreme Creator]] known as [[Olodumare]]. Other common beliefs are the existence of deities called [[Orisha|Orixás]], most of them syncretized with [[Saints|Catholic saints]] that act as divine energy and forces of nature; spirits of deceased people that counsel and guide practitioners through troubles in the material world; psychics, or ''mediums'', who have a natural ability that can be perfected to bring messages from the spiritual world of Orixás and the guiding spirits; reincarnation and spiritual evolution through many material lives ([[Karma|karmic law]]) and the practice of charity and social fraternity.

== Basic beliefs and practices ==
{{Orisa-Ifá sidebar| Variants}}
Umbanda practitioners believe in a supreme creator god; the use of a medium to contact the spirits of deceased people; reincarnation and spiritual evolution through many physical existences; and the practice of charity.

The opposite side of the ''Umbanda ''(white magic), i.e., black magic – the practices that intended to cause evil doings, became known as ''[[Quimbanda]]''. Umbanda is juxtaposed with Quimbanda which now reclaims its identity as a separate religion and distinct from Umbanda.

One hundred years after its establishment, Umbanda divided itself into several branches with different beliefs, creeds, and practices. Some of these branches are ''Umbanda d'Angola'', ''Umbanda Jejê'', ''Umbanda Ketu'', and ''Umbanda Esotérica''.

==Three principal items ==

The three major beliefs claimed by Umbandists are: The Pantheon, the Spirits' World, and the Reincarnation.&lt;ref name="Dann"&gt;Dann, Graham M.S. ''Religion and Cultural Identity: The Case of Umbanda.'' Sociological Analysis, Vol. 30, No.3, pp. 208–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pantheon===

Umbanda has one supreme god known as ''[[Olorun|Olorum]]'' (or ''Zambi'' in ''Umbanda d'Angola'') and many divine intermediary deities called Orixás. Orixàs and spirits are organized in a complex hierarchy of legions, phalanges, sub-phalanges, guides, and protectors.&lt;ref name="Dann"/&gt; The exact order of the hierarchy varies by region and practitioner, but a generally agreed upon structure are the Seven Lines, or Sete Linhas da Umbanda. The first line is the top, usually associated with [[Obatala|Oxalà]], and the bottom is always the Linha das Almas, or Line of Dead Souls.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The other patrons associated with the lines are listed in 2-6 below. The lines are often divided up even further into a multitude of spiritual beings.

===World of the Spirits ===

Most followers of Umbanda believe that there are three distinct levels of spirits.
:1. Pure Spirits
::This level includes the spirits known as the angels, archangels, cherubim, and seraphim, spirits that reached spiritual perfection.&lt;ref name="Dann"/&gt;
:2. Good Spirits
::This level includes the spirits that possess mediums (psychics) or initiates during the Umbanda ceremonies and act as ''Guias'' (guides) advising and helping the believers.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Diana De G.; Mario Bick. Religion, Class, and Context: Continuities and Discontinuities in Brazilian Umbanda. American Ethnologist, Vol. 14, No. 1, Frontiers of Christian Evangelism. (Feb., 1987), pp. 73–93&lt;/ref&gt; These are the following spirits:
::''Caboclos'' (Indigenous Americans)
::: Those are spirits of deceased Indigenous Brazilians or Mestizos. They are highly knowledgeable about medical herbs, often prescribing inexpensive remedies to ill people. Their speech is always based in truth and courage, and are widely sought after in cases you need strength, and counsel. When a caboclo speaks, you listen. When the medium incorporates a Caboclo, he/she, begins to walk around heavily, and the feature becomes more severe. They frequently smoke cigars and drink a mix of herbs the mediums make.
[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Preto-velho spirits]]
::''Preto Velho'' (Old Black Man)
::: Those are spirits of old slaves who died enslaved. They are wise, peaceful, and kind spirits that know all about suffering, compassion, forgiveness, and hope. Some of them are considered to be the old Yoruba priests that were first brought to Brazil. They also often prescribe herbal remedies. The female counterpart of this spirit is the ''Preta Velha'' ("Old Black Woman") who demonstrates maternal compassion and concern.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;Hale, Lindsay Lauren. ''Preto Velho: Resistance, Redemption, and Engendered Representations of Slavery in a Brazilian Possession-Trance Religion''. American Ethnologist, Vol. 24, No. 2 (May, 1997), pp. 392–414.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of Umbanda, ''Preto Velho'' introduced himself as an old slave who died after being flogged for some unjust accusation; today, ''Pretos Velhos'' introduce themselves as old slaves who died in persecution after they run away from the plantation. They are frequently the most loved entities in Umbanda and is very common to see a person consulting with the same preto velho year after year, and develop a love for them. When the medium incorporates a Preto Velho, he can not stand straight, has difficulty walking, and has to make consultations sitting down. They frequently drink coffee and smoke pipes.
::''Crianças/Erês'' (Children)
::: Those are spirits of great evolution, appearing as children, to reveal the pure side of life. They are not children who died at an early age. They speak of joy and hope. When they talk, they always intend to cheer you up and make you look at the bright side of things. They are generally characterized as being pure and joyful. Most people make the mistake that, since the medium (psychics) speaks funny, uses candies, lollypops, and ribbons in his head, that he is to be taken lightly. The Erês are evolved spirits who say very serious things, although in a funny way. When the medium incorporates an Erê, he laughs very much, dances, frequently appears with stuffed animals, and speaks with a child's voice. They frequently drink Guaraná and eat candy.
::''Baianos'' (People from Bahia State)
::: The spirits of people who were practitioners of Umbanda, also considered as the spirits of deceased ancestors. Since they are closest to our time (in comparison to the deceased slaves and the Indigenous Americans), they have a different manner in speaking. They are slow talking with the accent of Bahia. They talk about the need to know how to interpret and overcome the difficulties of life. They frequently drink coconut water, eat farofa, and smoke cigarettes.
::''Boiadeiros''
::: The spirits of deceased gauchos who lived a hard life in the ''sertão'', the arid hinterlands of Brazil. They speak of love, but are frequently harsh in their speech. They work in the spiritual cleaning of the person who is being attended, the medium, and the terreiro (the place where the Umbanda encounters, "gira" is held).
::''Marujos'' or ''Marinheiros'' (Sailors)
::: Spirits of deceased sailors or fishermen that use the power of the ocean to protect people from evil. The water (especially salty water) has its manner of protecting people, cleaning and cleansing. The Marinheiros work in the energy of Yemanjá. They are happy, funny, and easy going. When a Marinheiro talks, he sometimes appears to be drunk, but that's just his way. They can't stand straight and— frequently stumble as if they were in a ship, at high seas. They drink a lot of rum.
::''[[Zé Pilintra]]''
::: He is widely reputed, as the patron spirit of the barrooms, gambling dens, and gutters (while not aligned with "evil" entities, however). The Zé Pilintra spirit is famed by its extreme bohemianism and wild partying persona, being a kind of trickster spirit.
::''Exu''
::: Exu is a phalanx of spirits that are adjusted to Karma. Offerings are made in the Small Kalunga (cemetery) or at crossroads. The offerings are done only when required by the spirits, never intending to harm anyone. They never use black magic or any animal sacrifice. They protect people while they are on the streets, roads, nightclubs, etc., and also protect them from evil spirits (called obsessing spirits which are spirits that weren't touched by the light yet and use people to feed their bad habits such as addictions to drugs or low emotional states like anger, rage, sadness, guilt, revenge, etc.) and help people opening paths full of learning and success. The female Exus are the [[Pomba Gira]]s. Their action field is love, but under no circumstances will they perform black magic. Pomba Giras, like all Exus, undo black magic that exists in Quiumbanda.

: 3. Bad Spirits/Kiumbas
:: Some Umbanda believers avoid the spirits of this level, considered dark incarnations. Sometimes impure spirits can possess some psychics and cause many annoyances in a cult. So, priests and priestesses should know how to treat and send them to the correspondent evolved spiritual level which is connected to the Umbanda house, where they'll be cleansed by higher spirits, taught to find the light and evolve. So, the spirits of the city help during the process as much as the guides of the Umbanda psychics also help. The guides are responsible, in this case, for taking the darker spirits to the spiritual city and rebalancing the psychic.

===Reincarnation===

Reincarnation in Umbanda is different from in Hinduism. 
The Law of the Reincarnation is the central point of the Karmic Law. It states that Olodumare creates spirits with Self Will all the time. The spirits universally pass through many stages of evolution, in many planets. It also states that there are parallel dimensions in this world where the obsessive spirits are, since they can't evolve. They have the choice of being good or bad, through ordinary acts and the love that they display towards other people. When they "die", the good ones advance to a superior stage of spiritual evolution, in other planets. Those that do not succeed should reincarnate until learning what they were supposed to.&lt;ref name="Dann"/&gt;

== Umbanda temples, priests and priestesses ==

Umbanda temples are autonomous organizations that focus around a leader, mediums (psychics who are able to intermediate communications between the physical and the spiritual worlds), initiates (people with psychic abilities who are being taught in the ways of Umbanda) and lay members.

During its first years, the Umbanda rituals were performed in poor suburban houses because the followers had no resources, and also to avoid police persecution, since not being catholic was cause for arrest. Most often, the leader's own house was used as a place for religious meetings. The rituals were performed in the backyard. Sometimes, a tent was pitched to protect the meeting from rain. Today, the Umbanda religious buildings are still called ''Terreiro'' (backyard) or ''Tenda'' (tent). When the religion flourished, buildings were specially constructed for ritual use.

''Tendas'' or ''Terreiros'' usually look like ordinary houses when seen from the street. Some religious artifacts like African styled ceramic vases can be put on the walls or ceilings to give a touch of religious appearance to the house. A wood board with the name of the temple usually is placed over the main entrance. Larger Umbanda houses often are laid out in a fashion similar to a humble Catholic church. Even when the ''Tenda'' or ''Terreiro'' is specially built to be used in Umbanda rituals, a separated part is used as the home of the leader and his or her family. The areas for residence and rituals are close enough to be considered a single unit.

If a building is not available, rituals are still performed in a private backyard as well.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
 
Generally the ''Terreiro'' – the actual room used for rituals – is a large area covered by a simple roof of ceramic singles, with an altar at the back.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Also, the ''Tendas'' or ''Terreiros'' is used directly or in a support capacity for charitable works to provide child care, medical clinics, assistance to orphanages, and distribution of medicines and/or food.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The ''Terreiros'' have as their main leader a priest or priestess called "[[pai-de-santo]]" ("father-of-saint", if he is a male, referred to as "bàbálóòrìsà") or "[[mãe-de-santo]]" ("mother-of-saint", if she is female, referred to as "yálóòrìsà").{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The initiates, men or women, are usually called "[[filhos-de-santo]]" ("children-of-saint", masculine plural form), to show the structure within the religion. This does not imply sainthood on the part of the priest or priestess, but responsibility for certain rituals related to each saint they serve, (also called [[Orisha|Orixás]]), as well as the saints of the filhos-de-santo under his or her responsibility.

Umbanda developed with almost no sexual discrimination. The leader could be male or female, [[pai-de-santo]] or [[mãe-de-santo]], and his or her prestige depends only on their psychic powers and the wisdom shown within their pieces of advice. Its main difference when compared to the Catholic Church is that in Umbanda, homosexuals face no prejudice, for Umbanda does not judge believers by sex, race or sexual orientation. 

Each Umbanda [[Terreiro]] practices the same religion with variations, according to the policies of the [[pai-de-santo]]'s or the [[mãe-de-santo]]'s spiritual mentor, as well as in accordance with the teachings and philosophies of the various traditions within Umbanda. During these ceremonies, the priests, priestesses, and initiates wear white costumes and pay homage to the spirits and [[Orisha|Orixás]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

==Rituals &amp; ceremonies==

One hundred years after its establishment, Umbanda is divided into several branches with different rituals and ceremonies. As the ''Terreiros de'' Umbanda are loosely united by the Umbanda federations, there is not a strong adherence to a single code of rite, ceremonies and creeds.

The ''Umbanda Branca'', the original form created by [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes|Zélio de Moraes]] and his group, adopts the worship of [[Orisha|Orixás]] but rejects the black witchcraft, the colorful costumes, and the animal sacrifices practiced in the [[Macumba]] and [[Quimbanda]] rituals.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt; The [[pai-de-santo|babalorixá]]s (Pais-de-Santo) and the [[mãe-de-santo|yalorixá]]s (Mães-de-Santo) always wear white outfits during the ceremonies of the ''Umbanda Branca''. On the other hand, ''Umbanda d'Angola ''and'' Umbanda Jejê'' are newer sects with a body of rituals, ceremonies and philosophies that equate themselves with other religions such as [[Candomblé]], Jurema, and Catimbó. Another recent branch, called ''Umbanda Esotérica'', is heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies. The older ''Terreiros de '' Umbanda, those established before 1940, have not integrated these new trends and still practice the original rites and ceremonies in a simpler way, specially dedicating themselves to charity works, as preached by [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes|Zélio de Moraes]] and his group.

[[File:Sessão de umbanda.jpg|thumb| The gira or "work"]]

Umbanda ceremonies are generally open to the public and may take place several times a week.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; [[Atabaques|Atabaque]] (conga drums) and [[chanting]] play a central role in some Umbanda congregations, but are almost non-existent in others. The ceremonies may include offers to the spirits comprising fruits, wine, [[farofa]], [[cachaça]], [[popcorn]], [[cigarette]]s, [[hard cider]] and other types of food or beverages. Each Orixá or spirit receives a proper offering, and [[initiation rite]]s that range from the simple to complex.

During the ceremonies the priests and priestesses ([[pai-de-santo]], [[mãe-de-santo]], [[filhos-de-santo]], initiates) and the public attending the meeting sing together, dance, drink beverages and smoke cigars under the spirit's influence. However, the use of such elements by these spirits aren't due to any addictions - they are used as sacred elements that help the spirits to nullify any negative energies surrounding the assisted person. The priests and priestesses are separated from the attending public, usually by a small fence. The priests, priestesses and some of the public gradually get immersed in the singing and dancing, and suddenly get possessed by deities and spirits, starting to act and speak with their personas.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Those in the public attending who become possessed are recognized as owners of special psychic power and, usually, after the ceremony, are invited to become initiates in the ''Terreiro''. Sometimes, an experienced [[pai-de-santo]] or [[mãe-de-santo]] can dance and sing all night without, for mysterious reasons, being possessed by deities or spirits.

There is also a rite leader called [[Ogã]]. His job is to organize the "gira" in a logistic way. He does not incorporate and he is respected by the entities who possess the medium.

Intervention by spiritual beings in followers' daily lives is a central belief, so participation in Umbanda rites is important to appease deities and spirits.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Music and dancing are always present in the Umbanda rituals. The public sing together the "''pontos''", religious songs intended to improve the psychics' concentration level. These songs often are taught by the spirits themselves, and their lyrics tell about charity, faith, and the Orixás' deeds. The ''pontos ''should be sung or said in Portuguese for religious use. A ''ponto'' example is translated below:

::''Ponto de Mamãe [[Oshun|Oxúm]] (Umbanda Song of Mommy Oxúm)''

:Water streams like crystal
::Through Father Olorúm's feet
::Father Olorúm created Nature
::And made the Waterfalls
::Which Xangô blessed
::I am going to ask the permission of [[Obatala|Oxalá]]
::To bath in the waterfall
::To clean all evil&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temploetxaury.com/tema_o_ritual.html Umbanda Ritual]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Historical background ===
[[File:Zelio de moraes.jpg|thumb|Zélio de Moraes]]
Umbanda originated in [[South America]] and developed in the [[Portuguese Empire]]. In the late-19th century, many Brazilian scholars criticized the African-Brazilian religions, claiming they were primitive and hindered modernization.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; At the same time, [[Allan Kardec]]'s [[Spiritism]], a development of [[spiritualism]] creeds, was increasingly accepted by the Brazilian urban middle/upper-class with followers since 1865.
Since that Spiritism came from Paris, with the upper classes, there was no integration with the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Beraba"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mais/fs3003200804.htm Beraba, Marcelo. ''O Terreiro da Contradição''. Folha de S.Paulo; March 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The kardecists – followers of the Spiritism – were mainly middle-class people of European descent, many of them pursuing military and professional careers. They were deeply influenced by [[Auguste Comte]]'s philosophy, [[Positivism]], that aimed to join religion and science and to help the development of society to a higher level.

=== Beginning ===

On November 15, 1908, a group of kardecists met at a séance in the neighborhood of Neves, [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] city, near the Federal Capital, [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Among them was [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes]], a 17-year-old boy who was studying to join the Naval Academy and later became an officer. During the séance, [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes|Zélio de Moraes]] incorporated a spirit who identified himself as the ''Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas'' (Half-Indian Peasant of the Seven Crossroads). After that, [[Zélio Fernandino de Moraes|Zélio de Moraes]] incorporated another spirit who identified himself as ''Pai Antônio'' (Father Anthony), a wise old slave that had died after being savagely flogged by his master.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, J. Alves; Umbanda Cristã e Brasileira; 1985; apud Beraba&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First years and the development ===

The first ''Terreiro de'' Umbanda was founded by Zélio de Moraes in an uncertain date of the 1920s and named ''Centro Espírita Nossa Senhora da Piedade'' (Spiritism Center of Our Lady of Mercy). In 1940 Zélio de Moraes made a statute for this first ''Terreiro'' that was used as reference by the most of Terreiros that followed.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

The Umbanda religion started in a time when the Brazilian society was passing through a strong transformation process. The predominance of agriculture in Brazilian economy was decreasing and the first steps of a late industrial revolution was expanding the working class.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

The American anthropologist Diana Brown, that pioneered the studies of Umbanda in the 1960s, verified that the Umbanda founders were most middle-class people.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Diana; "Uma História da Umbanda no Rio", 1985; apud Beraba&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Umbanda followers felt that the [[Macumba]] rituals were more stimulating and dramatic than the Spiritism séances, but they rejected the animal sacrifices and the incorporation of malevolent spirits, often called Kiumbas (Obsessing Spirits).&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

According to the anthropologist Diana Brown, Zélio de Moraes had just a symbolic participation in the creation of the Umbanda, acting like the speaker of a group that previously participated in Macumba cults. A collective effort was made by Zélio de Moraes and his group to promote the ''Umbanda Branca'', developing practices acceptable by the middle class.&lt;ref name="BerabaBrown"&gt;
[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mais/fs3003200805.htm ''Novo Preto Velho''. Interview of Diana Brown in Folha de S.Paulo; March 30, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion during Vargas dictatorship ===

The first stage of the Umbanda expansion coincides with the social and political changes that occurred in the 1930s and with the dictatorship of [[Getúlio Vargas]] (1930—1945).

Getúlio Vargas became known as "pai dos pobres" (Father of the Poor) and, also, as "pai da Umbanda" (Father of the Umbanda) among the emergent urban and working class. Until 1966 many Umbanda ''Terreiros'' had a Getúlio Vargas picture in a place of honor.&lt;ref name="BerabaBrown"/&gt;

Despite the identification with the objectives of the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship, the Umbanda followers were persecuted. The police repression interrupted religious meetings, beat the psychics and followers and confiscated their instruments of Umbanda. An entire collection of icons, costumes, garbs, amulets, instruments, and objects of traditional religions confiscated by policemen is still kept in the ''Museu da Polícia'' (Museum of Police) in Rio de Janeiro city.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

A notable victim of the police repression was [[Euclydes Barbosa]] (1909—88). He was a great soccer back player known by the nickname Jaú, that played with the Corinthians team from 1932 to 1937 and with the Brazil's national team in 1938 World Cup in France. Jaú was also a pai-de-santo or babalorixá, priest of Umbanda, the founder of the Umbanda religion in São Paulo city and one of the first organizers in the 1950s of the Yemanjá feast in the São Paulo State beaches. Jaú was illegally imprisoned, beaten, tortured, and publicly humiliated by the police because of his religious activities. Some Umbanda leaders call him the great martyr of their religion.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

=== Prime years after the Vargas dictatorship ===

In the latter half of the 20th century Umbanda grew rapidly among transformation of Candomblé that was first noticed in Bahia.&lt;ref name="LieveTroch"&gt;Troch, Lieve. Ecclesiogenesis: the patchwork of new religious communities in Brazil. Exchange 33, No. 1, 2004, pp. 54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent ''Terreiros'' of Umbanda started to unite themselves in federations to strengthen its position against social discrimination and police repression. The first federation was founded by Zélio Fernandino in 1939.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

The end of the Getúlio Vargas Dictatorship and the reestablishment of democracy in 1945 advanced the religion freedom environment. In 1953, two Umbanda federations were founded in São Paulo. However, the Umbanda cults were still looked with suspicion by the Police Departments that demanded a compulsory registration of the ''Terreiros''. Only in 1964, this obligation was released and just a civil registration in a public notary is required.

The populist character of the politics in Brazil between 1945 (the end of Getúlio Vargas Dictatorship) and 1964 (the start of the Military Dictatorship) supported the expansion of Umbanda. Then politicians became usual attendants of the Terreiros, especially before the elections.&lt;ref name="BerabaBrown"/&gt;

Research conducted by the anthropologists Lísias Nogueira Negrão and Maria Helena Concone revealed that in the 1940s in São Paulo, just 58 religious organizations were registered as Umbanda ''Terreiros'', but 803 organizations declared themselves as Spiritism Centers. In the 1950s, positions inverted: 1,025 organizations declared themselves as Umbanda ''Terreiros'', 845 as Spiritism Centers and only one Candomblé ''Terreiro''. The apex was during the 1970s, with 7,627 Umbanda ''Terreiros'', 856 Candomblé ''Terreiros'' and 202 Spiritism Centers.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

The period from the 1950s to the 1970s was the prime of the Umbanda religion. Police repression decreased, the number of followers soared, but the Catholic Church opposition increased. An intense religious campaign against the Umbanda cults was conducted in the pulpits and the press. Umbanda received criticism from the Catholic Church, which disagreed with the worship of spirits and the comparison that many Umbandistas made between Catholic Saints and Orixás.&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt; Despite the criticism, even today, many Umbanda members also claim to be devout Catholics as well.&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt; After the Vatican Council II (1962–65), the Catholic Church sought an ecumenical or tolerant relation with traditional religions.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

=== Opposition ===

In 1974 Umbanda practitioners (Including declared and undeclared) were estimated to be about 30 million in a population of 120 million Brazilians.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

After the 1970s the Umbanda cults begun to be opposed by [[Pentecostal]]s. [[Evangelical]] Pentecostal Churches have begun attempting to evangelize and, in some cases, persecute practitioners of Umbanda and other traditional religions.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Umbanda practitioners have taken cases to national courts and achieved a high measure of success. In 2005 the ''Superior Órgão de Umbanda do Estado de São Paulo'' (Superior Organization of Umbanda in São Paulo State) won a judicial case in the Federal Court against the television broadcasting systems Rede Record and Rede Mulher, that belong to the ''[[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God|Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus]]'', a Neo Pentecostal Church. The Public Attorney (Ministério Público) denounced television programs that treated the traditional religions in a derogatory and discriminating way.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

=== Today ===

In the 2000 Brazilian census, 432,000 Brazilians declared themselves Umbandistas, a 20% drop in relation to the 1991 census. Many people attend the ''Terreiros'' of Umbanda seeking counseling or healing, but they do not consider themselves Umbandistas.&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt;

Despite all the troubles in the past or present, the Umbanda remains strong and renovated in Brazilian main cities like Rio de Janeiro (the greatest concentration of Umbandists) and São Paulo (the second greatest concentration of Umbandistas).&lt;ref name="Beraba"/&gt; After the 1970s, [[Porto Alegre]], the capital of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the southernmost [[States of Brazil|Brazilian state]], became the base of expansion of the Umbanda to Argentina and Uruguay. Today, Umbanda followers can be found in the United States of America as well.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The syncretic religious practice known as [[Santo Daime]], founded in the 1930s by Raimundo Irineu Serra, has been incorporating elements of Umbanda in its rituals, especially in the line called “Umbandaime.” The use of [[ayahuasca]] is an important aspect of their ceremonies.

'''Valheim Hof''' is a [[hof (Germanic temple)|hof]] in Korinth in the [[Faaborg-Midtfyn Municipality]], Denmark. This is the first building of its kind in Denmark since the time of the Middle Ages. The temple was dedicated to the Nordic gods: [[Odin]], Frigg and [[Thor]]. The building is 12 meters high and was built at the instigation of Danish designer, Jim Lyngvild.&lt;ref name=tv2 /&gt; The design is modeled on the excavations of the [[Uppåkra temple]] from the 7th century.&lt;ref name=fyens /&gt;

=== Victory Monument in Netanya ===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20616 Victory Monument in Netanya.JPG|thumb|Victory Monument in Netanya]]
WFRJ acted as the main partner of the Israeli National Fund named "[[Keren Hayesod]]" and the Israeli government in creating the [[Victory Monument in Netanya]] (Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfrj.org/services-view/commemorating-the-victory-of-the-red-army-over-nazi-germany/|title=Commemorating the Victory of the Red Army Over Nazi Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial consists of two sculptures.

Inauguration of the memorial was held on the June 25, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/vladimir-putin-coming-to-netanya-monday/2012/06/21/|title=Vladimir Putin Coming to Netanya.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Help for the Jewish communities ===

WFRJ provides large families and children in need of Jewish communities in Israel with the food support. It is possible due to the cooperation agreements with the supermarkets of redeeming the coupons of different denominations, prepaid by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfrj.org/services-view/the-development-of-jewish-communities/|title=The Development of Jewish Communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of the WFRJ the Jewish community of [[Kiev]] laid the cornerstone of the future Jewish community center, which is to become the largest in [[Ukraine]] on the April 25, 2012. The stone was brought from very [[Jerusalem]], and into the foundation of the building a capsule with a message for posterity was placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bigmir.net/capital/558597-V-Kieve-nachali-stroitelstvo-krypneishego-v-Ykraine-obshinnogo-centra|title=In Kiev, began the construction of the largest Ukrainian Community Center.}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFRJ headed by Alexander Levin has initiated the construction of a synagogue in the Lubavitcher center in Kensington ([[Brooklyn]]). The first stone was solemnly laid in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aen.ru/?page=brief&amp;article_id=63280|title=The first stone of a new synagogue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Help for the soldiers ===

The project entitled "Our warm house" created by the WFRJ and fully funded by it, involves the provision of comprehensive care for the lone soldiers repatriated from the former USSR and serving in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). Thanks to the project those soldiers can spend their own free time at "home" because the WFRJ provides apartments with full comfort. Each apartment is served by the woman who takes care of the order, erases and cooks. A manager also the helps the in solving his routine problems.

During the "[[Pillar of Cloud|cloud pillar]]" operation (14–21 November 2012) WFRJ donated 140,000 dollars to assist lonely soldiers who was repatriated from the former [[USSR]]. Another 30 thousand dollars has been allocated by the organization to install the necessary equipment and shelters in areas where there are not enough shelters from rocket attacks. The WFRJ charity events were coordinated by the Israeli National Fund named "[[Keren Hayesod]]" and the Israeli government.&lt;ref name="itog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izrus.co.il/diasporaIL/article/2013-01-01/20048.html|title=The WFRJ summed up the year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year 2012 the organization collected over 50 thousand dollars among New Yorkers to repair shelters located in southern Israel.&lt;ref name="itog"/&gt;

On the March 25, 2012 in the United States was established the "Children's Self-Defense" project aimed to educate Jewish children self-advocacy skills and the ability to rebut the anti-Semites. Presentation of the athletic program was held in [[New York City]] ‘KingsBay Y’ Jewish center.&lt;ref name="itog"/&gt; On the June 3, 2012 within the framework of the nationwide "Salute to Israel"  march in the United States WFRJ organized a column of 1500 Russian-speaking Jews.&lt;ref name="itog"/&gt; In January 2012 the European division of the WFRJ started funding the project of "Ir David" archaeological excavations in [[Jerusalem]] and the restoration project on Mount [[Masada]].

'''Wu''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 悟) is a concept of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]], or [[enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]] in the [[Chinese folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lizhu, Na. 2013. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholarly studies, many practitioners recently{{when|date=November 2018}} "reverted" to the Chinese traditional religion speak of a "new awareness" (''kāi wù'' 開悟 or ''jué wù'' 覺悟) of the interconnectedness of reality in terms of the cosmic-moral harmony—[[mìng yùn]], [[bào yìng]], [[yuán fèn]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lizhu, Na. 2013. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; This spiritual awareness works as an engine that moves these themes from being mere ideas to be motivating forces in one's life:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; awareness of ''mìng yùn'' ignites responsibility towards life; awareness of ''yuan fen'' stirs to respond to events rather than resigning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Awareness is a dynamic factor and appears in two guises: a realisation that arrives as a gift, often unbidden; then it evolves into a practice that the person intentionally follows.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In Latin alphabetical transliteration of the Chinese, it's a [[homograph]] of the [[wu (shaman)|wu-shaman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23940">The '''Yolmo''' people are an [[indigenous group|indigenous]] people of the [[Eastern Himalaya|Eastern Himalayan Region]] in Nepal. They refer to themselves as the "Yolmopa",&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indigenousvoice.com/indigenous-peoples/5/Yolmo.html|title= is Yolmopa/publisher=Indigenous Voice|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are native residents of the [[Helambu]] valleys  (situated over 43.4 kilometres/27 miles and 44.1 kilometres/27.4 miles to the north of [[Kathmandu]] respectively) and the surrounding regions of northeastern [[Nepal]]. The combined population of Yolmos in these regions is close to 10,000. They also have sizeable communities in [[Bhutan]] [[Darjeeling]] and [[Sikkim]]. They are among the 59 indigenous groups officially recognized by the [[Government of Nepal]] as having a distinct [[cultural identity]]&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice" /&gt; and are also listed as one of the 645 [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]

The Yolmo people speak the [[Yolmo language]] of the [[Kyirong-Kagate language|Kyirong-Kagate]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family. Accordingly, it has a high lexical similarity to [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], although the two languages are not completely mutually intelligible.

==History==

=== Origin ===
Yolmos&lt;ref name="Clarke 1980 79–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Lama in Yolmo|last = Clarke|first = Graham E.|date = 1980|journal = Tibetan Studies in honor of Hugh Richardson|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 79–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have migrated from the [[Gyirong County|Gyirong]] Valleys of southwestern [[Tibet]] between 200 and 300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Helambu History|last = Clarke|first = Graham E.|date = 1980|journal = Journal of the Nepal Research Centre|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|pages = 1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in the valleys of [[Helambu]], and gradually, intermarriages between the male Yolmo [[lama]]s and the [[Tamang]] women local to the region became common.&lt;ref name="Clarke 1980 79–86" /&gt;

==== Identity Clash with the Sherpas ====

In the 1980s, an increasing number of Yolmos began identifying themselves as the [[Helambu Sherpa language|''Helambu Sherpa'']], even using the appellation as a surname to align themselves with the more prominent [[Sherpas|Sherpa people]] of the [[Solukhumbu District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=G. E.|title=Tibetan Studies in honor of Hugh Richardson|year=1980|publisher=Aris and Phillips|location=Warminster|page=79|editor=M. Aris and A. S. S. Kyi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this name is still used to refer to the Yolmo people and their language in certain instances, including the [[ISO 639-3]] language codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=M. Paul|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=scp|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; very few members of the Yolmo community would likely identify themselves as a subsection of the Sherpas in the current date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desjarlais|first=Robert|title=Sensory biographies : lives and deaths among Nepal's Hyolmo Buddhists|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=California|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Kagate" ===
An ethnic group related to the Yolmos are the '''Kagate''' (or ''Kagatay'') who stem from the original Yolmo inhabitants of the [[Helambu]] and [[Melamchi]] valleys. What distinguishes them is that the Kagate began migrating southeast from Helambu, and eventually, into the [[Ramechhap District]] over 100 years ago,&lt;ref name="Gawne" /&gt; and that they practiced the craft of paper-making during their peregrinations in order to make a living — thereby earning themselves the moniker "Kagate" (which is Nepali for "paper-maker"). They have since developed certain characteristics in their speech that are distinct from traditional Yolmo. The Yolmo speaking groups in the [[Lamjung District]] and [[Ilam District]] have also historically been called "Kagate" although both groups claim a clear distinction between themselves and the Kagate of [[Ramechhap, Ramechhap|Ramechhap]].&lt;ref name="Gawne" /&gt; However, "Yolmo" and "Kagate" are often used as terms for both the ethnic group and their dialect interchangeably.

==Culture==

=== Society ===
The Yolmo tribe is organised into several [[clan]]s, viz. Dhongba, Dangsong, Sharma-Lama, Lhalungpa, Chyaba, Chujang and Yeba, all of which follow the [[patrilineal]] system of descent. "Bride-stealing" used to be a staple among their customs but it is no longer practiced or encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Seika|date=1997|title=Crossing 'capture' out: On the marginality of the capture marriage tactics in Hyolmo, Nepal|url=|journal=帝京社会学第|edition=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Their primary religion is [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Nyingma]]pa school, intermixed with [[animism]] and [[paganism]] as incorporated within the general dimensions of [[Bon]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice" /&gt;

=== Language ===
{{main article|Yolmo language}}
The Yolmo language shares high lexical similarities with [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. It is traditionally transcribed in the [[Tibetan script|Sambhoti]] (Tibetan) script, but many modern academics use the [[Devanagari]] script as well. The Yolmo language is also very closely related to Kagate, another language of the [[Kyirong-Kagate language]] sub-group.

=== Economy ===
Essentially, the Yolmo people are agriculturalists. [[Potato]]es, [[radish]]es, and some other crops constitute their primary sustenance, along with milk and flesh from the [[yak]] which the Yolmos are known to herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Himalayan Herders|last=Bishop|first=Naomi|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|year=1998|isbn=9780534440602|location=Fort Worth; London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few decades, the Helambu region has also become a popular site for tourism and trekking, and many Yolmos are now employed in the tourism industry as tour-guides either in their own respective villages or in various other parts of Nepal.

==Distribution==

=== Nepal ===
According to the Nepal National Census of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indigenousvoice.com/en/indigenous-peoples/5/hyolmo.html|title=Indigenous Peoples -Hyolmo|last=Voice|first=Indigenous|website=www.indigenousvoice.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the population of the Yolmo people living within Nepal is 10,752, who are distributed over 11 districts of the country, and 99% of this population speak the Yolmo language. However, the number of monolingual Yolmo speakers is very low and on a gradual decline, as the number of monolingual [[Nepali language|Nepali]]-speaking Yolmos and bilingual Yolmos with [[English language|English]] as their [[second language]] increases.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice" /&gt; The largest Yolmo settlements in Nepal (and also internationally) are in the Helambu and Melamchi Valleys which are home to over 10,000 Yolmos. A separate group of about 700 reside in the [[Lamjung]] district while some have settled closer to [[Pokhara]].&lt;ref name=Gawne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawne|first1=Lauren|title=Report on the relationship between Hyolmo and Kagate|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|date=2013|volume= 12 | issue = 2 |pages=1–27|url=http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/HimalayanLinguistics/articles/2013/PDF/HLJ1202A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of villages in the [[Ilam District|Ilam]] district where Yolmo is spoken.

===India===
The Yolmos are listed as a [[Scheduled Tribe]] in the states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Sikkim]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="List of Notified Scheduled Tribes"&gt;[http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/ST%20Lists.pdf List of Notified Scheduled Tribes], Census of India&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhutan and Tibet ===
The Yolmo language is also spoken by significant populations in [[Bhutan]] and the [[Gyirong County]] of southwestern [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "Yolmo" or "Hyolmo" consists of two separate words — '''''Hyul''''', which means "a place or area surrounded by high mountains", and '''''Mo''''', which means "goddess", indicating a place under the protection of a female deity.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Voice" /&gt; For centuries, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] have referred to the Helambu region using the term "Yolmo". In recent years, most people, Yolmos ''and'' otherwise, seem to prefer the name "Helambu" itself. It is also often claimed that the name "Helambu" is derived from the Yolmo words for potatoes and radishes (''Hey'' means "potato" and ''lahbu'' means "radish").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Graham E.|title=A Helambu History|journal=Journal of the Nepal Research Centre|year=1980|volume=4|pages=1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Graham E.|title=Lama and Tamang in Yolmo|year=1980|publisher=Aris and Phillips|location=Warminster|pages=79–86|editor=M. Aris and A. S. S. Kyi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This etymology, however, is disputed and often considered spurious. Some refuters of this explanation argue that "Helambu" is an ambiguation of the word "Yolmo" phonetically contoured by the speakers of [[Nepali language|Nepali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hari|first=Anne Marie|title=Yolmo Grammar Sketch|year=2010|publisher=Ekta Books|location=Kathmandu|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ongoing discussion amongst Yolmo scholars regarding the spelling of "Yolmo" in the [[Latin]] script. Some favour "Yolmo" while others prefer "''Hyolmo''" or "''Yholmo''" wherein the presence of the letter "H" indicates that the first syllable of the word is spoken with a low, [[Breathy voice|breathy]] [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It is worth noting that '''Robert R. Desjarlais''' (except in his most recent work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo22995434.html|title=Subject to Death|last=Desjarlais|first=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Graham E. Clarke''' (works cited below) both use "Yolmo", while the Nepal Aadivasi Janajati Mahasangh (Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities) uses "Hyolmo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nefin.org.np/list/Geographical-Categorization/5/93/21|title = Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities|date = 2014|accessdate = 2014-11-24|website = Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities|publisher = Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
