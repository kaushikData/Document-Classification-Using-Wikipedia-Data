==History and profile==
The magazine was founded in 1993 by Daniel Brogan, a former reporter and columnist for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=MeetEds&gt;[http://www.5280.com/about_editors.php "Meet the Editors of 5280 Magazine"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129102557/http://www.5280.com/about_editors.php |date=2008-01-29 }}, ''5280'' (official website), accessed January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Pettas, [http://www.foliomag.com/2007/regional-magazine-makes-case-smart-spending "Regional Magazine Makes a Case for Smart Spending"], ''[[Folio (magazine)|Folio Publishing Summit]]'', August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other city and regional magazines, ''5280'' covers dining, entertainment, and special events, as well as local and regional politics.  Its "daily blog of the latest news, gossip, and commentary from the Mile-High City" is called  ''Elevated Voices'' (official website).

Annual cover stories include the "Top of the Town" awards, with top ratings in a wide range of products, services, stores, shops and community features; "Top Doctors", listing top-rated physicians by specialty; and "Top Restaurants" (official website).

In 2002, the magazine broke the news that [[John Hickenlooper]], a popular local bar owner, was considering a run for mayor and later endorsed Hickenlooper, who was then elected in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Since 2005, "5280" has been a finalist for six [[National Magazine Award]]s (known as "Ellies"), "the magazine industry's highest honor." In 2005, ''5280'' was a finalist for both "Conduct Unbecoming" and "Private Stites Should Have Been Saved", by its Executive Editor Maximillian Potter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine.org/editorial/about_asme/press_releases/11296.cfm "The American Society of Magazine Editors Announces National Magazine Award Finalists:] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214054023/http://www.magazine.org/editorial/about_asme/press_releases/11296.cfm |date=2007-12-14 }} 40th annual 'Ellies' -- Magazine Industry's Premiere Editorial Awards -- To Be Presented April 13 [2005]", press release, ''[[American Society of Magazine Editors]]'', March 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maximillian Potter, [http://www.5280.com/issues/2004/0402/feature.php?pageID=38 "Conduct Unbecoming]", ''5280'', February 2004, and [http://www.5280.com/issues/2004/0406/feature.php?pageID=53 "Private Stites Should Have Been Saved"], ''5280'', June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyobserver.com/node/50569 "Off the Record"], ''[[The New York Observer]]'', March 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; "Out in the Cold",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5280.com/issues/2007/0711/feature.php?pageID=900|title=Out in the Cold|work=5280}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article by Mike Kessler on the plight of workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, was a National Magazine Award finalist in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine.org/ASME/ABOUT_ASME/ASME_PRESS_RELEASES/26571.aspx "The American Society of Magazine Editors Announces 43rd Annual National Magazine Award Finalists"], press release, ''[[American Society of Magazine Editors]]'', March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "Low on O2",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5280.com/issues/2009/0910/feature.php?pageID=1933|title=Low On 02|work=5280}}&lt;/ref&gt; a package by Lindsey B.

'''Anne Pasternak''' (born 1961) is an art critic and curator. She is the current [https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/about/anne_pasternak Shelby White and Leon Levy Director] of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

== Education ==
Pasternak was born in [[New York City]] and received her undergraduate degree in Art History from the [[University of Massachusetts, Amherst]].  She went on to take graduate courses at [[Hunter College]] but she left without completing a graduate degree.&lt;ref name="Public Art and Media"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Art and Media: From Spectacle to Political (lecture summary)|url=http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Anne_Pasternak|website=The Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquium|publisher=[[UC Berkeley]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Pasternak's career began with an internship turned directorship at the Stux Gallery in Brooklyn in the 1980s. She then received a curatorship at [[Real Art Ways]], an arts nonprofit in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1990 she curated an exhibition at Real Art Ways titled "The Abortion Project," which focused on women artists and sparked debate in Hartford's broader community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1991-10-11/features/0000210990_1_art-exhibit-women-artists-real-art-ways-gallery|title=`The Abortion Project' Opens At Real Art Ways|website=tribunedigital-thecourant|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creative Time ===
In 1993 Anne Pasternak left Real Art Ways and became the executive director of [[Creative Time]]. As the director of Creative Time, Pasternak curated and organized numerous exhibitions, events, discussions, and spectacles including the annual "[[Tribute in Light|Tribute In Light]]" event, a memorial for the events of September 11, 2001, and [[Kara Walker]]'s "A Subtlety" a large public installation that appropriated a foreclosed sugar factory in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativetime.org/projects/|title=Projects - Creative Time Projects and Artist Commissions|website=Creative Time|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brooklyn Museum ===
In 2015, Pasternak left Creative Time and replaced Arnold Lehman as the director of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/arts/design/brooklyn-museum-picks-anne-pasternak-as-new-director.html?_r=0|title=Brooklyn Museum chooses Anne Pasternak as New Director|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|last1=Smith|first1=Roberta|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasternak's directorship at the Brooklyn Museum marks the first time a woman has kept a directing role in an encyclopedic New York museum (the other one being the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/arts/design/brooklyn-museum-picks-anne-pasternak-as-new-director.html|title=Brooklyn Museum Picks Anne Pasternak as New Director|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=2015-05-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a former director of a public art organization, this new position represents a shift in her career from a broader public sphere into the architecture of a museum.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

Pasternak's tenure at the Brooklyn Museum has been plagued by controversy. Two prominent deputy directors of the Museum under her directorship have departed in less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/nancy-spector-guggenheim-862157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2018/06/22/jennifer-y-chi-brooklyn-museum-deputy-director-chief-curator/&lt;/ref&gt;. Pasternak has also been criticized by the Brooklyn community for accepting monetary compensation for shows of questionable artistic value and for lack of diversity in hiring curatorial staff&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/market/gray-market-brooklyn-museum-diversity-1257761&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/market/the-gray-market-how-to-run-an-acid-test-on-museum-scandals-and-other-insights-1203194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/arts/brooklyn-museum-african-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperallergic.com/440426/protesters-occupy-brooklyn-museum-atrium-demanding-decolonization-commission/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations''''', often simply called '''''Bartlett's''''', is an American [[reference work]] that is the longest-lived and most widely distributed collection of [[quotation]]s. The book was first issued in 1855 and is currently in its eighteenth edition, published in 2012.

The book arranges its entries by author, rather than by subject, as many other quotation collections, and enters the authors chronologically by date of birth rather than alphabetically. Within years, authors are arranged alphabetically and quotations are arranged chronologically within each author's entry, followed by "attributed" remarks whose source in the author's writings has not been confirmed. The book contains a thorough keyword index and details the source of each quotation.

==History==
[[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]], who ran the University Book Store in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], was frequently asked for information on quotations and he began a [[commonplace book]] of them for reference.  In 1855, he privately printed his compilation as ''A Collection of Familiar Quotations''. This first edition contained 258 pages of quotations by 169 authors, chiefly the [[Bible]], [[William Shakespeare]], and the great [[English poetry|English poets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Collection of Familiar Quotations: With Complete Indices of Authors and Subjects |edition= New |year= 1856 |place=Cambridge |publisher= John Bartlett |publisher-link=   |accessdate= October 30, 2018 |url= https://books.google.bg/books?id=rrFDBtxCbEYC&amp;dq=editions%3A9MJV0sJQdMAC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett wrote in the fourth edition that "it is not easy to determine in all cases the degree of familiarity that may belong to phrases and sentences which present themselves for admission; for what is familiar to one class of readers may be quite new to another."

The book was a great success, and Bartlett issued three more editions before joining the [[Boston]] publishing firm of [[Little, Brown, and Company]]. Bartlett rose to be the senior partner of the firm and supervised nine editions of the work before his death in 1905, the work selling over 300,000 copies. The seventh edition had appeared in 1875, the eighth edition in 1882, and the ninth in 1891. The tenth edition, however, would not appear for more than twenty years.

Edited by [[Nathan Haskell Dole]], the tenth edition (1914) was much like its predecessors.  The book began with quotations originally in English, arranging them chronologically by author ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]] was the first entry, [[Mary Frances Butts]] the last). These quotes were chiefly from literary sources. A "miscellaneous" section follows of quotations in English from politicians and scientists (such as "[[fifty-four forty or fight]]!"). A section of "[[translation]]s" follows, consisting mainly of lines from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The last section was devoted to the Bible and the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Quotations were arranged in a single column.

The eleventh edition (1937), edited by [[Christopher Morley]] (1890&amp;ndash;1957) and [[Louella D. Everett]], expanded the page size and created a two-column format, making it the first edition that is recognizable to users of the modern work. A twelfth edition (1948) was also edited by Morley and Everett.

The thirteenth edition (1955) was billed by the publisher as the "Centennial Edition." While the work was credited to the editors of Little, Brown, the preface gives special thanks to Morley and Everett as well as Emily Morison Beck (1915&amp;ndash;2004).  The volume continued to add more recent material, the two youngest authors being cartoonist [[Bill Mauldin]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Beck also edited the fourteenth edition (1968) and the fifteenth (1980). [[Aram Bakshian]] said Beck's work on the fifteenth edition was the start of the work's downfall: "Donning the intellectual bell-bottoms and platform shoes of its era, ''Bartlett's'' began spouting third-rate [[Third World]], youth-culture, and feminist quotes," part of "a middle-aged obsession with staying trendy."{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}}

Following Beck's retirement, Little, Brown entrusted the editorship to [[Justin Kaplan]], whose life of [[Mark Twain]] ''Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain'' had won the 1967 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize]]. Kaplan brought out the sixteenth edition (1993) to criticism in part because he included only three minor [[Ronald Reagan]] quotations and commented publicly he despised Reagan. ([[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had 35 entries and [[John F. Kennedy]] had 28.) Jonathan Siegel, who edited the ''Macmillan Book of Political Quotations'', said Kaplan was "an insult to the memory of John Bartlett and the ideologically inclusive spirit of the first fifteen editions."{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} Kaplan was also criticized for including [[popular culture|pop culture]] material that was considered neither "familiar" nor durable. Similar criticisms were leveled against his editing of the seventeenth edition (2003) which included entries for the first time from [[J.K. Rowling]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], and [[Larry David]]. Classics were cut: eleven quotations by Alexander Pope were dropped, as were what Kaplan considered high-sounding sentimental quotes. Kaplan did include six Reagan quotations, and Kaplan told ''[[USA Today]]'' "I admit I was carried away by prejudice. Mischievously I did him dirty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2002-10-16-bartletts_x.htm Caroline Binham, "'Bartlett's' gets more familiar, contemporary"], USA TODAY, Books, 16 Oct 2002.

A '''blanket order''', '''blanket purchase agreement''' or '''call-off order''' &lt;ref&gt;University of Manchester, [http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=8182 Call‐off Orders: Awareness of call‐off orders and their use], accessed 24 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[purchase order]] which a [[customer]] places with its [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] to allow multiple delivery dates over a period of time, often negotiated to take advantage of predetermined [[pricing]]. It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working with sales blanket orders|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa498438(v=ax.10).aspx|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Issuing a blanket order allows a customer not to hold more stock than necessary at any time, and avoids the administrative expense of processing frequent purchase orders, while favoring [[discount pricing]] through volume commitments or [[price break]]s. On the supplier's side, a blanket order may provide the benefit of guaranteeing ongoing business and also help suppliers better predict future cash flows and orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomassini-Buechner|first1=Bogdan|title=Blanket Orders: What You Need To Know|url=https://www.digitalpurchaseorder.com/blanket-orders/|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=April 2017}}

A blanket order is set at a fixed priced contract for a period of time. The buyer looks for the best pricing among competing supplier bids. After the best one is chosen, the prices of goods are fixed, and also quantities of each products are given to the supplier to prepare stock for on requested delivery.

Forecasted quantity is provided by the buyer as full usage quantity recorded historically few years or as needed for quantitative analysis. The supplier may give a condition of quantity to supply for this [contract]. For example, 80% of the forecast quantity must be bought at the end of the contract, which may be one or two years.

The blanket order will charge the delay delivery if the supplier could not supply the products in the contract on time. Anyway, since the supplier has already kept the stock for ready delivery for the first year or agreed period, if the buyer could not fulfill the contract's conditions, such as "must buy 80% of [[forecast quantity]] within a year," the contract may be extended, or the delay charge could be no more, or no other charges requested by the buyer.

Realistically, at the end of the blanket order [[contract]], the buyer would not buy at forecasted quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to the supplier. The buyer will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform the buyer the quantities of goods kept in order that the buyer could know the status of the stock.  Before the buyer issuing the purchase order to supplier, the buyer must ask the supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability.

Blanket orders or call-off orders may also be used for ordering services, for example for [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance and repair]] services. In these cases the benefits associated with stock-holding do not arise but the call-off order may allow emergency repairs or on-call maintenance to be arranged easily at guaranteed rates.

==Difficulties==
The most difficult part of having a contract is determining the forecast quantity arranged by the user of the product. As the forecast quantity can be difficult to get, the supplier must be aware of the quantity to keep in stock. An easy way to do this is to discuss with the buyer what quantity to keep in stock. For example, they might keep only 20% in stock in the first 6 months, so that the supplier and the buyer are able to review the quantity and adjust it appropriately. This reduces the [[stock burden]] of the supplier during the contract period and might help the buyer at the end of the contract if the stock does not move as quickly as anticipated. The contract might be extended year after year, but it can be adjusted each time as more relevant forecasting history will predicate the need to decrease or increase stock requirements. Alternatively, some companies may utilize forecasted information via a [[material requirements planning]] system to determine appropriate stock quantities throughout the [[Product lifecycle|product's life cycle]].

==Federal Acquisition Regulation==
The United States' [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] uses the term "blanket purchase agreements" or BPAs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%208_4.html#wp1089547 FAR 8.405-3], accessed 24 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. [[General Services Administration]], BPAs:
* Provide opportunities to negotiate improved discounts
* Satisfy recurring requirements
* Reduce administrative costs by eliminating repetitive acquisition efforts
* Permit ordering activities to leverage buying power through volume purchasing
* Enable ordering activities streamlined ordering procedures
* Permit ordering activities to incorporate Contractor Team Arrangements (CTAs)
* Reduce procurement lead time
* Permit ordering activities the ability to incorporate terms and conditions not in conflict with the underlying contract.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. General Services Administration [http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/199353 Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|:la:Breve Chronicon Northmannicum|Breve chronicon Northmannicum}}
The '''''Breve chronicon Northmannicum''''' or '''''Little Norman Chronicle''''' is a short, anonymous [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] [[chronicle]] of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], probably written in [[Apulia]] in the early twelfth-century. It covers the years from the first Norman "invasion"&lt;ref&gt;The chronicle reads, for the year 1041: ''Northmanni duce Harduino Langobardo primum invadunt Apuliam cum exercitu magno et forti'', which translates "[[Arduin the Lombard]], duke of the Normans, invaded Apulia for the first time with a great and strong army".&lt;/ref&gt; of Apulia in 1041 to the death of [[Robert Guiscard]] in 1085. Though once treated as an important source, its reliability and authenticity have been called into question by André Jacob, who showed that it is probably an eighteenth-century forgery by Pietro Polidori.&lt;ref&gt;"Le ''Breve chronicon Northmannicum'': un véritable faux de Pietro Polidori," ''Quellen und Forschungen aus Italienischen Archiven und Bibliotheken'', 66(1986), 378–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vera von Falkenhausen]] (2007), "The South Italian Sources," ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', 132, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John France, who seems unaware of Jacob's argument, it was based mainly on an [[oral tradition]] and was subsequently used as a source for both the ''[[Chronicon Amalfitanum]]'' and [[Romuald Guarna]].&lt;ref&gt;John France (1991), "The Occasion of the Coming of the Normans to Southern Italy," ''[[Journal of Medieval History]]'', 17, 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first edition of the ''Chronicon'' was published by [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]] in the fifth volume of his ''Rerum italicarum scriptores'' (1724) under the long title ''Breve chronicon Northmannicum de rebus in Iapygia et Apulia gestis contra Graecos''. The text he used was preserved in a twelfth- or thirteenth-century codex borrowed from Pietro Polidori, as well as a copy of ''c''.1530, both now lost. Only one authentic copy remains, though a forgery of G. Guerrieri also exists. In 1971 a new edition was published by Errico Cuozzo in the ''Bollettino dell'Istituto storico italiano per il Medioevo''.&lt;ref&gt;Errico Cuozzo, "Il Breve Chronicon Northmannicum", ''Bollettino dell'Istituto storico italiano per il Medioevo'', 83 (1971), pp.131–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[legal deposit]] library, the British Library receives copies of all books produced in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a significant proportion of overseas titles distributed in the UK.  The Library is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].

The British Library is a major [[research library]], with items in many languages&lt;ref name="BL-CDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cresearch/skills/using1/usingthebritishlibrary.htmll|title=Using the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many formats, both print and digital: books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines,  sound and music recordings, videos, play-scripts, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings. The Library's collections include around 14 million books,&lt;ref name="BLhome"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bl.uk/|title=The British Library; Explore the world's knowledge|publisher=British Library|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with substantial holdings of manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 2000 BC.  In addition to receiving a copy of every publication produced in the UK and Ireland (approximately 8,000 per day), the Library has a programme for content acquisitions.  The Library adds some three million items every year occupying {{convert|9.6|km|mi}} of new shelf space.&lt;ref&gt;The British Library Annual Report and Accounts 2010/11, [http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/annrep/2010to2011/priorperf/perform/kpis_stats.pdf p.31]&lt;!--2010/11: 668.0&amp;nbsp;km, 2009/10: 658.4&amp;nbsp;km--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is space in the library for over 1,200 readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/|title=Facts and figures|last=Wight|first=Colin|website=www.bl.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1973, the Library was part of the [[British Museum]].  The British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] and building as the museum until 1997.  The Library is now located in a purpose-built building on the north side of [[Euston Road]] in [[St Pancras, London]] (between [[Euston railway station]] and [[St Pancras railway station]]), and has a document storage centre and reading room near [[Boston Spa]], near [[Wetherby]] in [[West Yorkshire]]. The Euston Road building is classified as a Grade I [[listed building]] "of exceptional interest" for its architecture and history.&lt;ref name="listed" /&gt;

== Historical background ==
The British Library was created on 1 July 1973 as a result of the British Library Act 1972.&lt;ref name=blhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/index.html |title=History of the British Library |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvVlrFD?url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/index.html |archivedate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the national library was part of the [[British Museum]], which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the [[National Central Library (England and Wales)|National Central Library]],&lt;ref&gt;The National Central Library, a tutorial system and a scholarly library for working people who were not connected to an academic institution, had been founded by [[Albert Mansbridge]].--"Mansbridge, Albert." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Lending Library for Science and Technology]] and the [[British National Bibliography]]).&lt;ref name=blhistory/&gt; In 1974 functions previously exercised by the [[Office for Scientific and Technical Information]] were taken over; in 1982 the [[India Office Library and Records]] and the [[HMSO]] Binderies became British Library responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Almanack''; 1988, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the Library absorbed the [[National Sound Archive]], which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvMvV7b?url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/about/soundarchive.html |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/about/soundarchive.html |title=About the British Library Sound Archive |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the Library's historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the 18th century, known as the "foundation collections".&lt;ref name=Wedgeworth1993&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wedgeworth | first=Robert | year=1993 | title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services | edition=3 | publisher=ALA Editions | isbn=978-0-8389-0609-5 | page=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the books and manuscripts of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], [[Sir Hans Sloane]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] and the [[King's Library]] of [[King George III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snfcc.snfoundation.org/snfcc/EN/index.php?ID=Zq437NxVGjNsz7nf_EN |title=Similar Projects – The British Library |publisher=Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvFvVto?url=http://snfcc.snfoundation.org/snfcc/EN/index.php?ID=Zq437NxVGjNsz7nf_EN |archivedate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Old Royal Library]] donated by [[George II of England|King George II]].

[[File:British Library.jpg|thumb|left|The British Library at Boston Spa (on [[Thorp Arch Trading Estate]]), [[West Yorkshire]]]]

For many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around [[central London]], in places such as [[Bloomsbury]] (within the British Museum), [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]], [[Bayswater]], and [[Holborn]], with an [[Interlibrary loan|interlibrary lending]] centre at [[Boston Spa]], {{convert|2.5|mi}} east of [[Wetherby]] in West Yorkshire (situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate), and the newspaper library at [[Colindale]], north-west London.&lt;ref name=blhistory/&gt;

Initial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by [[John Laing Group|John Laing plc]]&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; on a site at [[Euston Road]] next to [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloomsburyassociation.org.uk/news/news20070919134787 |title=What and Where is Bloomsbury Village? |publisher=Bloomsbury Association |date= |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2009 the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at [[Colindale]]. In July 2008 the Library announced that it would be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site.&lt;ref name="BL Collection Moves Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Library Announces Collection Moves Strategy|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/The-British-Library-Announces-Collection-Moves-Strategy-34e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200&amp;nbsp;km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service.&lt;ref name="200km material moved"&gt;{{cite web|title=200km of books successfully moved to high-tech home|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/200km-of-books-successfully-moved-to-high-tech-home-56e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013.

Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds.&lt;ref name=SteveMorrisBBC&gt;{{cite news|title=British Library builds fire-proof home for 750m newspapers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-20717391|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 July 2013|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library previously had a book storage depot in [[Woolwich]], south-east London, which is no longer in use.

The new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect [[Colin St John Wilson]]&lt;ref name=blhistory/&gt; in collaboration with his wife [[MJ Long]]&lt;ref name=MJLongObit&gt;{{cite news|title=MJ Long obituary|author=Peter Carolin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/18/mj-long-obituary|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=16 October 2018|date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of [[public art]], such as large sculptures by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (a bronze statue based on [[William Blake]]'s study of [[Isaac Newton]]) and [[Antony Gormley]]. It is the largest public building constructed in the United Kingdom in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/index.html|title=British Library – About Us|publisher=British Library|accessdate=7 February 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvdOGz0?url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/index.html|archivedate=7 February 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walkowitz2009&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Walkowitz|first1=Daniel J.|year=2009|title=Contested Histories in Public Space: Memory, Race, and Nation|last2=Knauer|first2=Lisa Maya|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4236-6|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the building is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the [[Beinecke Library]], containing the [[King's Library]] with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820.&lt;ref name=Nichols1870&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Nichols | first=Thomas | year=1870 | title=A handy-book of the British Museum: for every-day readers | publisher=Cassell, Petter, and Galpin | page=396 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rVCAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by [[Rosie Winterton]].

On Friday, 5 April 2013, the Library announced that it would begin saving all sites with the suffix [[.uk]] (every British website, [[e-book]], online [[newsletter]], and blog) in a bid to preserve the nation's "[[digital memory]]" (which as of then amounted to about 4.8 million sites containing 1 billion web pages). The Library would make all the material publicly available to users by the end of 2013, and would ensure that, through technological advancements, all the material is preserved for future generations, despite the fluidity of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/world/british-library-to-preserve-nation%e2%80%99s-entire-internet-history |title=British Library to preserve nation's entire Internet history |publisher=News.msn.com |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was Grade I listed on 1 August 2015.&lt;ref name="listed" /&gt;

== Legal deposit ==
[[File:BritishLibraryInterior02.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the British Library, with the smoked glass wall of the King's Library in the background.]]
In England, [[legal deposit]] can be traced back to at least 1610.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Barrington Partridge "The history of the legal deposit of books throughout the British Empire", London: Library Association, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copyright Act 1911]] established the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]]; the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]] at [[Cambridge]]; the [[Trinity College Library]] at [[Dublin]]; and the [[National Library of Scotland|National Libraries of Scotland]] and [[National Library of Wales|Wales]]. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the [[Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries]].

Further, under the terms of [[Irish copyright law]] (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland, alongside the [[National Library of Ireland]], the Trinity College Library at Dublin, the library of the [[University of Limerick]], the library of [[Dublin City University]] and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the [[National University of Ireland]]. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.

In 2003 the [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] MP [[Chris Mole]] introduced a [[Private Member's Bill]] which became the [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]. The Act extends United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents, such as [[CD-ROM]]s and selected [[websites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030028_en_1 |title=Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nNN5GQdv?url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030028_en_1 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library also holds the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]] (APAC) which include the [[India Office Records]] and materials in the languages of Asia and of north and north-east Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/apac/apacoll/apac.html|title=Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library is open to everyone who has a genuine need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes to carry out research can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/register/howreg/howtoregister.html|title=How to register for a Reader Pass|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, only those wishing to use specialised material unavailable in other public or academic libraries would be given a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, who have access to their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23479468-british-library-like-a-branch-of-starbooks-say-the-literati.do |title=British Library like a branch of Starbooks say the literati |last=Brierley |first=Danny |date=21 April 2008 |publisher=Evening Standard |accessdate=8 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063706/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23479468-british-library-like-a-branch-of-starbooks-say-the-literati.do |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of catalogue entries can be found on Explore the British Library, the Library's main catalogue, which is based on Primo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview|date=8 December 2011|publisher=Exlibris Group|title=Primo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628163157/http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other collections have their own catalogues, such as western manuscripts. The large reading rooms offer hundreds of seats which are often filled with researchers, especially during the Easter and summer holidays.

British Library Reader Pass holders are also able to view the Document Supply Collection in the Reading Room at the Library's site in [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire as well as the hard copy newspaper collection from 29 September 2014.  Now that access is available to legal deposit collection material, it is necessary for visitors to register as a Reader to use the Boston Spa Reading Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/notices/boston_spa_readingroom.html|title=Major changes for Readers using the Boston Spa Reading Room|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material available online ==
The British Library makes a number of images of items within its collections available online. Its ''Online Gallery'' gives access to 30,000 images from various medieval books, together with a handful of exhibition-style items in a proprietary format, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. This includes the facility to "turn the virtual pages" of a few documents, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/index.html|title=Explore the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalogue entries for many of the [[illuminated manuscript]] collections are available online, with selected images of pages or miniatures from a growing number of them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm |title=Catalogue of Illuminated manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a database of significant [[bookbinding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/bookbindings/ |title=Database of bookbindings |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Library Sounds]] provides free online access to over 60,000 sound recordings.

The British Library's commercial [[secure electronic delivery service]] was started in 2003 at a cost of £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of [[copyright]] restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

When Google Books started, the British Library signed an agreement with [[Microsoft]] to digitise a number of books from the British Library for its [[Live Search Books]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/nov/04/microsoft.books |title=Microsoft teams up with British Library to digitise books | work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=12 April 2010|date=4 November 2005|last=Tran|first=Mark | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material was only available to readers in the US, and closed in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Miguel|last= Helft|authorlink= |title=Microsoft Will Shut Down Book Search Program |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/technology/24soft.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin |publisher=New York Times |date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=26 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scanned books are currently available via the British Library catalogue or [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/portable-devices/other-devices/amazon-seals-british-library-deal-for-free-kindle-classics-672583 |title=Amazon seals British Library deal for free Kindle classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 the British Library launched its ''Management and business studies portal''. This website is designed to allow digital access to management research reports, consulting reports, working papers and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbsportal.bl.uk/about/index.aspx|title=Management and business studies portal: About this site|publisher=British Library|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, four million newspaper pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online. The project will scan up to 40 million pages over the next 10 years. The archive is free to search, but there is a charge for accessing the pages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15932683 |title=British Library scans 18th and 19th-Century newspapers |date=29 November 2011 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic collections ==
[http://explore.bl.uk ''Explore the British Library''] is the latest{{when|date=November 2017}} iteration of the online catalogue. It contains nearly 57 million records and may be used to search, view and order items from the collections or search the contents of the Library's website. The Library's electronic collections include over 40,000 ejournals, 800 databases and other electronic resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/eresources/main.shtml |title=Electronic collections, British Library, 25 July 2012.

== Digital Library System ==
In 2012, the UK [[legal deposit]] libraries signed a memorandum of understanding to create a shared technical infrastructure implementing the Digital Library System developed by the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/legaldeposit/websites/security/joint_security_undertaking.pdf|title=Undertaking to the joint Committee on Legal Deposit, on the security of non-print publications|publisher=© The British Library Board|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLS was in anticipation of the Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013, an extension of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 to include non-print electronic publications from 6 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2013/9780111533703|title=Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013|publisher=© Crown|date=2013|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four storage nodes, located in [[London]], [[Boston Spa]], [[Aberystwyth]], and [[Edinburgh]], linked via a secure network in constant communication automatically replicate, self-check, and repair data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/legaldeposit/websites/security/|title=Security for electronic publications|publisher=© The British Library Board|date=2013|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete [[Web crawler|crawl]] of every [[.uk]] domain (and other [[TLD]]s with UK based server [[GeoIP]]) has been added annually to the DLS since 2013, which also contains all of the [[Internet Archive]]'s 1996-2013 .uk collection. The policy and system is based on that of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], which has crawled (via [[Internet Archive|IA]] until 2010) the [[.fr]] domain annually (62 [[Terabyte|TB]]s in 2015) since 2006.

== Business and IP Centre ==
In May 2005, the British Library received a grant of £1 million from the [[London Development Agency]] to change two of its reading rooms into the Business &amp; IP Centre. The Centre was opened in March 2006.&lt;ref name=Chadwick &gt;{{cite news |last=Chadwick |first=Gareth |title=The British Library: An excellent business support centre |date=5 June 2007 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sme/the-british-library-an-excellent-business-support-centre-451812.html|quote=The pilot was such a success that in May 2005 the London Development Agency, the Mayor of London's agency for business and jobs, announced a £1m funding package to turn the project into a permanent resource.  The centre's facilities were enlarged and upgraded to include state-of-the-art meeting rooms, a networking area and wireless internet access. A team of information experts is on hand to help people find the information they need. The new centre re-launched in March 2006. In the 14 months since, it has welcomed more than 25,000 people through its doors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds arguably the most comprehensive collection of business and intellectual property (IP) material in the United Kingdom and is the official library of the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]].

The collection is divided up into four main information areas: [[market research]], company information, trade directories, and [[Magazine|journals]]. It is free of charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/what-s-on-offer-at-the-british-library-business-and-ip-centre.html |title=What's on offer at the British Library Business &amp; IP Centre? |publisher=Startups |date= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929010654/http://www.startups.co.uk/what-s-on-offer-at-the-british-library-business-and-ip-centre.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 50 million patent specifications from 40 countries in a collection dating back to 1855. The collection also includes official gazettes on patents, [[trade marks]] and [[Registered Design]]; law reports and other material on [[litigation]]; and information on [[copyright]]. This is available in hard copy and via online databases.&lt;ref name=bipc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/bipc/aboutus/faq/index.html |title=British Library Business &amp; IP Centre in London &amp;#124; Frequently asked questions |publisher=British Library |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216143804/http://www.bl.uk/bipc/aboutus/faq/index.html |archivedate=16 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document Supply Service ==
As part of its establishment in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a [[World War II]] [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[ROF Thorp Arch]], which closed in 1957. When the NLL became part of the British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/about/history/index.html|title=British Library document supply history|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Newspapers ==
[[File:British Library Newspapers.JPG|thumb|Former British Library Newspapers building, [[Colindale]]]]

The Library holds an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total, the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of [[microfilm]] containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45&amp;nbsp;km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the [[Thomason Tracts]], comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-457883/Secret-gold-chest-treasure-ship.html |title=Secret gold chest in treasure ship |publisher=Mail Online |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Burney Collection]], featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.resourceshelf.com/go/resourceblog/52810 |title=The Burney Collection of 17th and 18th Century Newspapers |publisher=Web.resourceshelf.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903023424/http://web.resourceshelf.com/go/resourceblog/52810# |archive-date=3 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.

The Newspapers section was based in [[Colindale]] in North London until 2013, when the buildings, which were considered to provide inadequate storage conditions and to be beyond improvement, were closed and sold for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/01/19/farewell-to-history/ |title=Farewell to history? |first=Alan |last=Cleaver |publisher=Independent |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125225356/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/01/19/farewell-to-history/ |archivedate=25 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspaper Collection – Frequently Asked Questions for Readers|publisher=British Library|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/newspapermoves/newspaper-moves-faqs.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical holdings are now divided between the sites at St Pancras (some high-use periodicals, and rare items such as the Thomason Tracts and Burney collections) and Boston Spa (the bulk of the collections, stored in a new purpose-built facility).&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

A significant and growing proportion of the collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary [[Brightsolid]] began,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentmanagementnews.com/the-news/general-news/41-general-news/567-british-library-digitises-40m-newspaper-pages-to-enable-paid-for-web-access.html |title=British Library digitises 40m newspaper pages to enable paid-for web access |publisher=Document Management News |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121023759/http://www.documentmanagementnews.com/the-news/general-news/41-general-news/567-british-library-digitises-40m-newspaper-pages-to-enable-paid-for-web-access.html |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsolid.com/news/recent-news/british-library-and-brightsolid-partnership-to-digitise-up-to-40-million-pages-of-historic-newspapers |title=British Library and Brightsolid partnership to digitise up to 40 million pages of historic newspapers |publisher=Brightsolid |date= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111040247/http://www.brightsolid.com/news/recent-news/british-library-and-brightsolid-partnership-to-digitise-up-to-40-million-pages-of-historic-newspapers |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Newspaper Archive]] was launched in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Newspaper Archive launched online |date= 29 November 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15924466 |accessdate=5 December 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yorkpress 20140429"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/11178458.British_Library_s_newspaper_archive_receives___33m_makeover/ | title=British Library's newspaper archive receives £33m makeover | work=[[York Press]] | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moving image services ==
Launched in October 2012, the British Library's moving image services provide access to nearly a million sound and moving image items onsite, supported by data for over 20 million sound and moving image recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/movingimage/2012/10/new-moving-image-service-at-the-british-library.html |title=New moving image service at the British Library |publisher=British Library, Moving Image Blog |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313095406/http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/movingimage/2012/10/new-moving-image-service-at-the-british-library.html |archivedate=13 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three services, which for copyright reasons can only be accessed from terminals within the Reading Rooms at St Pancras or Boston Spa, are:

* BBC Pilot/[[BBC Redux|Redux]]: A collaboration with [[BBC Research &amp; Development]] to mirror its archive which has, since June 2007, been recording 24/7 of all of the BBC's national and some regional broadcast output. BBC Pilot includes 2.2 million catalogue records and 225,000 playable programmes, but unlike BBC Redux it does not include any broadcasts beyond 2011.
* Broadcast News: Since May 2010, the British Library has been making off-air recordings of daily TV and radio news broadcasts from seventeen channels, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News, Al-Jazeera English, NHK World, CNN, France 24, Bloomberg, Russia Today and China's CCTV News. Many of the programs come with subtitles, which can be electronically searched, greatly enhancing the value of the collection as a research tool.
* Television &amp; Radio Index for Learning &amp; Teaching (TRILT): Produced by the British Universities Film &amp; Video Council ([[BUFVC]]), TRILT is a database of all UK television and radio broadcasts since 2001 (and selectively back to 1995). Its 16 million records, growing by a million per year, cover every channel, broadcast and repeat.

== Philatelic collections ==
{{main|British Library Philatelic Collections}}

[[File:British Library Gate Shadow.jpg|thumb|The entrance gate and its shadow (designed by [[Lida Cardozo|Lida]] and [[David Kindersley]])]]
The [[British Library Philatelic Collections]] are held at St Pancras.  The collections were established in 1891 with the donation of the [[Thomas Tapling|Tapling]] collection;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/philatelic/philateliccollections/philateliccollectionsintroduction/philatelicintro.html|title=The Tapling Collection|work=British Library|accessdate=12 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329190938/http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/philatelic/philateliccollections/philateliccollectionsintroduction/philatelicintro.html#|archive-date=29 March 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; they steadily developed and now comprise over 25 major collections and a number of smaller ones, encompassing a wide range of disciplines. The collections include [[postage stamp|postage]] and [[revenue stamp]]s, [[postal stationery]], [[essay (philately)|essays]], [[proofreading|proofs]], [[cover (philately)|covers]] and entries, "[[cinderella stamp]]" material, specimen issues, [[airmail]]s, some [[postal history]] materials, official and private [[postal system|posts]], etc., for almost all countries and periods.&lt;ref name=pocket&gt;{{Cite book |author1=David Beech|author2=Paul Skinner |author3=Bobby Birchall|author4=Catherine Britton |url=http://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/ISBN_9780712309530/353759 |title=Treasures in Focus – Stamps |publisher=British Library |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011 |isbn=978-0-7123-0953-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive display of material from the collections is on exhibit, which may be the best permanent display of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers.&lt;ref name=pocket/&gt; As well as these collections, the library actively acquires literature on the subject. This makes the British Library one of the world's prime philatelic research centres. The Head Curator of the Philatelic Collections is [https://twitter.com/sentrystamps Paul Skinner].

The '''Carrousel du Louvre''' is an underground [[shopping mall]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The name refers to two nearby sites, the [[Louvre]] museum and the [[Place du Carrousel]]. The mall contains a famous skylight, ''[[La Pyramide Inversée]]'' (the ''Inverted Pyramid''), which plays an important role in the best-selling book ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

==Details==
[[File:Plan of the Carrousel du Louvre and the Palais du Louvre 01.svg|thumbnail|left|Plan of the Carrousel du Louvre and the Palais du Louvre]]
The shopping mall is located at 99 [[Rue de Rivoli]] in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1st arrondissement]]. The mall is located near the [[Tuileries| Tuileries Gardens]], the [[Comédie-Française]], the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and the [[Louvre]].  The nearest metro stop is  [[Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro)|Palais Royal-Musée du Louvre]] (Lines 1 and 7).

The mall covers 10,200 square metres. It was opened in October 1993.  Major retail tenants include  [[Sephora]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], the first [[Apple Store]] in France, [[Mariage Frères]] Tea Emporium, [[Plaisirs de Paris]], [[Swarovski]], [[Perigot]], [[Le Tanneur]] and [[Fossil]].
 
The mall includes a [[food court]], Restaurants du Monde, containing several restaurants including a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/06/mcdonalds.louvre/ |publisher=CNN | title='Bad taste' cries as McDonald's moves into 'Mona Lisa' museum | accessdate=11 May 2010 | date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]]. The mall includes a convention centre and exhibition hall.

The shopping mall contains one of a number of entrances to the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]].

On 3 February 2017, the mall was the scene of [[2017 Paris machete attack|an attempted terrorist attack]] by a 29-year-old Egyptian man, in which he slightly injured a soldier before being shot and wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38863431|title=Louvre attack: Egyptian man, 29, believed to be assailant|date=3 February 2017|accessdate=4 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative anatomy''' is the study of similarities and differences in the [[anatomy]] of different [[species]]. It is closely related to [[evolutionary biology]] and [[phylogeny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaucher |first=Eric A. |last2=Kratzer |first2=James T. |last3=Randall |first3=Ryan N. |date=2010 |title=Deep Phylogeny—How a Tree Can Help Characterize Early Life on Earth|url=http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/1/a002238 |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=a002238 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002238 |pmc=2827910 |pmid=20182607}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[evolution]] of species). 

The science began in the [[classical era]], continuing in [[Early Modern]] times with work by [[Pierre Belon]] who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans.

Comparative anatomy has provided [[evidence of common descent]], and has assisted in the classification of animals.

== History ==
[[File:Belon_Oyseaux.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Skeletons of humans and birds compared by [[Pierre Belon]], 1555.]]

The first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by early commentators with [[Alcmaeon of Croton]].&lt;ref&gt;Blits, K. C. (1999), Aristotle: Form, function, and comparative anatomy. Anat. Rec., 257: 58–63. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(19990415)257:2&lt;58::AID-AR6&gt;3.0.CO;2-I&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Belon]], a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on [[dolphin]] embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudger |first1=E. W. |title=The Five Great Naturalists of the Sixteenth Century: Belon, Rondelet, Salviani, Gesner and Aldrovandi: A Chapter in the History of Ichthyology |journal=Isis |date=1934 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1086/346870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andreas Vesalius-Pierre Poncet.jpg|thumb|left|upright||[[Andreas Vesalius]]]]

Around the same time, [[Andreas Vesalius]] was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen's observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on animals such as [[oxen]]. Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one's own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen.  An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals which included humans. These observations were later used by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he formed his theory of [[Natural Selection]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell2006&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/compar_anat.shtml | title=Comparative Anatomy: Andreas Vesalius | accessdate=2011-02-17 | last=Caldwell | first=Roy | year=2006 | publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Affe-tyson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A drawing by [[Edward Tyson]]]]

[[Edward Tyson]] is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that [[chimpanzee]]s are more similar to humans than to [[monkey]]s because of their arms. [[Marco Aurelio Severino]] also compared various animals, including birds, in his ''Zootomia democritaea'', one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like [[George Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and [[systematics]] of [[vertebrates]], laying the foundation for [[Charles Darwin]]'s work on [[evolution]]. An example of a 20th-century comparative anatomist is [[Victor Negus]], who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like [[DNA sequencing]], comparative anatomy together with [[embryology]] were the primary tools for understanding [[phylogeny]], as exemplified by the work of [[Alfred Romer]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Concepts==
&lt;!--{{multiple image | direction=vertical | width= 282 | image1= Human_Heart_vs_Chicken_Heart.png | caption1= The human heart (left) and chicken heart (right) share many similar characteristics. Avian hearts pump faster than mammalian hearts. Due to the faster heart rate, the muscles surrounding the ventricles of the chicken heart are thicker. Both hearts are labeled with the following parts: 1. Ascending Aorta 2. Left Atrium 3. Left Ventricle 4. Right Ventricle 5. Right Atrium. | image2= Braus 1921 80.png | caption2=A 20th century illustration comparing the bone-structures of a human and a dog.}}--&gt;

Two major concepts of comparative anatomy are:
# [[homology (biology)|Homologous structures]] - structures (body parts/anatomy) which are similar in different species because the species have [[common descent]] and have evolved, usually divergently, from a shared ancestor.  They may or may not perform the same function. An example is the forelimb structure shared by [[cat]]s and [[whales]].
# [[Analogy (biology)|Analogous structures]] - structures similar in different organisms because, in [[convergent evolution]], they evolved in a ''similar environment'', rather than were inherited from a recent common ancestor. They usually serve the same or similar purposes. An example is the streamlined torpedo body shape of [[porpoise]]s and [[shark]]s. So even though they evolved from different ancestors, porpoises and sharks developed analogous structures as a result of their evolution in the same aquatic environment. This is known as a homoplasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution |last=Kardong |first=Kenneth V. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-07-802302-6 |location=New York |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

Comparative anatomy has long served as [[evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]], now joined in that role by [[comparative genomics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardison, R.C. |year=2003 |title=Comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=e58 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000058 |pmid=14624258 |pmc=261895}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor.

It also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal to form a wing, which is better-suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs' similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism's anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A.  | first2=Jane B. | last2=Reece |title=[[Biology]]|location=San Francisco, CA| publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]]|date=February 2002| pages=438–439| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for development of ''special'' characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] as [[von Baer's laws (embryology)|the laws now named after him]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1353">The '''Croatian Top 20 Chart''' is a [[Croatia]]n radio show that airs on the HR1 channel of [[Croatian Radiotelevision|Croatian Radio]].&lt;ref name="hrtsite"&gt;[http://www.hrt.hr/hr/top20/o_emisiji.html Dobrodošli na stranice emisije TOP 20], ''[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]'' (in Croatian), Retrieved December 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The show first aired in 1985, though it was put on hiatus by the [[Croatian War of Independence|war in Croatia]] in the early 1990s.   Since 1993 and the end of the war, it has been airing continuously.&lt;ref name="hrtsite"/&gt;  The show has retained the same format, counting down the Top 10 Croatian Singles and Top 10 International Singles.&lt;ref name="hrtsite"/&gt;

The founder of the show was '''Andrej Stengl'''.  From 1993 to 1998, the show was hosted by '''Silvio Sop''', but in 1998 his role was taken over by '''Dinko Komadina''', who has hosted the show ever since.&lt;ref name="hrtsite"/&gt;

==About==
The Chart consists of 10 international and 10 Croatian singles.  All songs that enter the charts can stay on the chart for ten weeks and then they are retired and they are sent to archives until the year-end list comes up.   The chart is based solely on public voting.

'''Danish Front''' ('''Dansk Front''' in [[Danish language|Danish]]) was an extreme right, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] network in [[Denmark]], whose goal was to ''"keep Denmark for the Danish people"'', thus they were also against [[multiculturalism]] and "alien religions" such as [[Islam]].

The phenomenon known as ''Dansk Front'' consisted of:

* An organization that united many extreme right radicals.
* A homepage that consisted of nationalistic messages and [[propaganda]]. The homepage also functioned as an online forum.
* A slogan ("Danish Front!") that was used in [[graffiti]], [[t-shirts]], [[stickers]] and such, both for Dansk Front and other extreme right radicals.

Their homepage tried to portray the Danish Front as a new, popular [[Racism|racist]] concept, but many saw them as [[neo-nazis]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The leaders of Danish Front discouraged members from using [[swastika]]s and other traditional [[Nazism|nazi]] symbols to express their views.

Members of this organization also used [[violence]] to further their goals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A number of members of Danish Front had previously been members of [[Dansk Folkeparti]] or [[Dansk Folkepartis Ungdom]] but had been expelled from those political parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Controversial surroundings==
* In their yearly review the [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste|Danish Security Intelligence Service]] (''Politiets Efterretningstjeneste'') found that Danish Front had cooperated with groups such as [[Blood &amp; Honour]] and the English [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] [[Combat 18]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Danish |publisher=Politiets Efterretningstjeneste |url=http://www.pet.dk/upload/pet_%C3%A5rsberetning_03.pdf |year=2003 |title=Politiets Efterretningstjeneste Årsberetning 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Danish Front had collaborated with Combat 18 and Blood &amp; Honour, as well as with [[Sweden|Swedish]] radical nationalist groups, and marched with them in [[Salem Municipality|Salem]] during 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Dissolution ==
The organization was dissolved on 19 July 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4059">The synagogue of [[Delos]], [[Greece]], is one of the [[List of oldest synagogues|oldest synagogues]] known today,&lt;ref name="Delos"&gt;[http://www.pohick.org/sts/delos.html Delos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; its proposed origin dating between 150 and 128 BCE, although its identification as a synagogue has been disputed.&lt;ref name=Matassa/&gt;

==Description==
The building’s most recent use is widely agreed to have been an assembly hall for [[Jews]] or [[Samaritans]]. However, the first use for the building is more controversial. While some people think the building was erected as a private house or a [[pagan]] meeting place, most believe that it was a synagogue even in its earliest form.

Located on the eastern side of the city of Delos, the synagogue was far from the central areas of the city. Instead, the synagogue was built in a section of Delos called the Quartier du stade. In this part of the city, in contrast to the religious and commercial focus at Delos’ center, residences dominated the scene (there was also a small, easily accessible port).

The synagogue itself consisted of two large rooms containing a throne and multiple marble benches as well as many smaller rooms which allowed for access to a [[cistern|reservoir]].

==Archaeology==

The synagogue was discovered in 1912 by a team led by archaeologist [[André Plassart]].&lt;ref name="Delos" /&gt;  The synagogue is understood to have remained in use until the end of the second century AD.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years,''  Lee I. Levine, Edition: 2,  Yale University Press, 2005, pp. 107 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaspora 2004 pp. 513-598"&gt;"The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered," Monika Trümper ''Hesperia,'' Vol. 73, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 2004), pp. 513-598&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominating feature of the building is the large hall, which was presumably used in a flexible way,  with moveable furniture, since there is no evidence for benches built along the walls.&lt;ref name="Diaspora 2004 pp. 513-598" /&gt;  The hall is oriented towards the east, with a series of secondary rooms at the southern end.&lt;ref name="Diaspora 2004 pp. 513-598" /&gt;

The identification of the building as a Jewish synagogue at any point in its history has been a matter of debate.  The original identification of the building as a synagogue by Plassart was based in large part on dedicatory inscriptions referring to "Theos Hypsistos," or "God Most High," often considered an appellation for the Jewish God in antiquity, though not exclusively.  The identification of the building as a synagogue was originally challenged by Belle Mazur in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Belle D. Mazur, '' Studies on Jewry in Greece'' (Athens: Hestia, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; though this argument has gone largely unnoticed by more recent scholarship.  The evidence of "synagogue's" architecture and inscriptions is complicated by the apparent presence of a contemporary Samaritan community not far.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Brueneau, "'Les Israelites de Delos' et la Juiverie Delienne," ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique'' 106 (1982): 465-504.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent studies have concluded that the evidence suggesting that this building was indeed a synagogue is tenuous at best and will no doubt remain an open question.&lt;ref name=Matassa&gt;Lidia Matassa, "[http://www.religion.ucsb.edu/faculty/thomas/classes/rgst116c/Matassa.pdf Unraveling the Myth of the Synagogue on Delos]," ''Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society'' 25 (2007): 81-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sebastian Bieniek 2013 doublefaced no 23 two faced double face.jpg|right|thumb|Sebastian Bieniek 2013, ''Doublefaced Nr. 23'', from the serial of photographs "Doublefaced".]]

'''''Doublefaced''''' is a series of 52&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b1en1ek.com/works/face-paint/2013-doublefaced/ All 52 „Doublefaced-2013-photographs“ on the official artist's website www.b1en1ek.com]&lt;/ref&gt; photographs by German artist and photographer [[Sebastian Bieniek]].

The photographs were created in 2013 between August and November. All of the images, with the exception of two from [[Barcelona]], were photographed in [[Berlin]]. Within a matter of weeks, following their introduction, the series became a sensation via the Internet and one of the best-known [[Internet meme|memes]] of the year 2013/2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartfoundation.metamatic.gr/EN/BLOG_/art-culture/1555/A_two-faced_life/ Review about the "Doublefaced" by metamatic.gr writing that "Doublefaced" is one of the best-known memes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.doublefaced.de/Press.html Press review on the official "Doublefaced" website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 ''Doublefaced'' was selected as one of the "Top 10 Body Art of 2013" by [[designboom]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/art/top-10-body-art-of-2013-12-31-2013/ "Top 10 Body Art Stories of 2013" on the designboom.com website]&lt;/ref&gt; a web-based publication covering the fields of art, design and architecture. Sebastian's ''Doublefaced'' is featured in print, as well as on the web, in "Top 2013 Photography" by designcollector magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designcollector.net/t/top2013photography/ "Top 2013 Photography" on the designcollector.net website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Five ''Doublefaced'' photographs were exclusively published, in the February 2014 edition of the  German-based music publication, ''Intro'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intro.de/fotostrecke/2336 ''Doublefaced'' photographs in on the website of the german Intro-Magazin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2014 magazines from Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intro.de/news/newsfeatures/23074706/pharrell-williams-alles-nur-geklaut Review in the german intro-magazin about the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inferno-magazine.com/2014/04/29/sebastian-bienieck-doublefaced-plagie-par-pharrell-williams/ Review in the french inferno-magazine about the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soyhomosensual.com/los-rostros-de-bieniek/ Review in the soyhomosensual-magazine üabout the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903010659/http://www.soyhomosensual.com/los-rostros-de-bieniek/ |date=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetoc.gr/new-life/creatives/article/to-koritsi-me-ta-duo-proswpa-oneireuetai-melagxolei-zei Review in the Thetoc-magazine about the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.tagesanzeiger.ch/privateview/index.php/tag/sebastian-bieniek/ Review in the swiss newspaper "Tages-Anzeiger" about the "Doublefaced" exhibition and the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofann.com/ar/news/view/25533 Review in the ofann-magazine about the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; and Saudi-Arabia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooonzyah.net/articles/view-229.html Review in the brooonzyah-Magazin about the plagiarism in Pharrell Williams music video]&lt;/ref&gt; have acknowledged that Sebastian Bieniek’s ''Doublefaced'' series was plagiarized in the music video for [[Pharrell Williams]]' song "[[Marilyn Monroe (Pharrell Williams song)|Marilyn Monroe]]".


== The look ==
Most of the Doublefaced photographs are portraits of women. In a few cases they are portraits of the artist's six-year-old-son. 
The signature concept of ''Doublefaced'' is creating a second face. Bieniek simply draws an image of a face onto the side of the model's cheek. The sketch includes only one eye: carefully placed hair hides the rest of the face from view, revealing one, moving eye of the model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">A '''dream dictionary''' is a tool made for interpreting images in a [[dream]]. Dream dictionaries tend to include specific images which are attached to specific interpretations. However, dream dictionaries are generally not considered scientifically viable by those within the psychology community.
 
==History==
Since the 19th century, the art of dream interpretation has been transferred to a scientific ground, making it a distinct part of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dream symbols of the "unscientific" days—the outcome of hearsay interpretations that differ around the world among different cultures—continued to mark the day of an average human-being, who is most likely unfamiliar with Freudian analysis of dreams.

The dream dictionary includes interpretations of dreams, giving each symbol in a dream a specific meaning. The argument of what dreams represent has greatly changed over time. With this changing, so have the interpretation of dreams. Dream dictionaries have changed in content since they were first published. The Greeks and Romans saw dreams as having a religious meaning. This made them believe that their dreams were an insight into the future and held the key to the solutions of their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's view on dreams were that they were merely a function of our physiological make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beare|first=J.I.|title=On Dreams by Aristotle|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/dreams.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not believe dreams have a greater meaning, solely that it is a result of how we sleep. In the Middle Ages, dreams were seen as an interpretation of good or evil.

Although the dream dictionary is not recognized in the psychology world, Freud is said to have revolutionized the interpretation and study of dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud came to the conclusion that dreams were a form of wish fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Kevin|title=Introduction to Sigmund Freud's Theory on Dreams|url=http://www.insomnium.co.uk/dream-theory/introduction-freud-theory-on-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries were first based upon Freudian thoughts and ancient interpretations of dreams.

Some examples of [[dream interpretation]] are: dreaming you are on a beach means you are facing negativity in your life, or a lion may represent a need to control others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Dreams|url=http://www.dreambible.com/common-dreams.html|publisher=US Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries typically hold interpretations ranging from A-Z. Dream dictionaries can be found in book form or on the internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">In [[number theory]], the '''Embree–Trefethen constant''' is a threshold value labelled '''''β*'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Embree | first1 = M. | authorlink1 = Mark Embree| last2 = Trefethen | first2 = L. N. | authorlink2  = Lloyd N. Trefethen| doi = 10.1098/rspa.1999.0412 | title = Growth and decay of random Fibonacci sequences | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 455 | issue = 1987 | pages = 2471 | year = 1999 | url = http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~trefethen/publication/PDF/1999_86.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1999RSPSA.455.2471T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a fixed positive number ''β'', consider the [[recurrence relation]]

: &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n \pm \beta x_{n-1} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where the sign in the sum is chosen at random for each ''n'' independently with equal probabilities for "+" and&amp;nbsp;"&amp;minus;".

It can be proven that for any choice of ''β'', the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\beta) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (|x_n|^{1/n}) \, &lt;/math&gt;

exists [[almost surely]]. In informal words, the sequence behaves exponentially with probability one, and ''σ''(''β'') can be interpreted as its almost sure rate of [[exponential growth]].

We have

:''&amp;sigma;'' &lt; 1 for 0 &lt; ''&amp;beta;'' &lt; ''&amp;beta;*'' = 0.70258 approximately,

so solutions to this recurrence decay exponentially as ''n''→∞ with probability&amp;nbsp;1, and

:''&amp;sigma;'' &gt; 1 for ''&amp;beta;*'' &lt; ''&amp;beta;'',

so they grow exponentially.

Regarding values of σ, we have:
* σ(1) = 1.13198824... ([[Random Fibonacci sequence|Viswanath's constant]]), and 
* σ(''β''*) = 1.

The constant is named after [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]] [[Mark Embree]] and [[Lloyd N. Trefethen]].

'''''Enciklopedio Kalblanda''''' ({{lang-en|Kalb-land Encyclopedia}}), edited from 1996 to 2001, was the first Internet [[Esperanto]] [[encyclopedia]]. It was founded on January 11, 1996 by Stephen Kalb, who was the general editor. The encyclopedia contained 139 articles linked to 85 other themes. The text of the encyclopedia (though not the pictures) is under the [[GFDL]].

In December 2001, Kalb donated his 139 articles to the [[Esperanto Wikipedia]], to be expanded. It is linked on [[Vikipedio]] as ''Enciklopedio Kalblanda''. He now contributes directly to Vikipedio.&lt;ref&gt;Added (translated) from [[:eo:Enciklopedio Kalblanda]], ~~~~~&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is a largely self-selected body, composed of Islamic clerics and scholars, presided over by [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]].

== Statutory ambitions ==
The ECFR aims "to present to the [[Muslim World]] and the [[Ummah|Muslim minorities in the West]] particularly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-cfr.org/new/|title=المجلس الأوروبي للإفتاء والبحوث|publisher=e-cfr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; its interpretation of "the manifestation of Allah's infinite mercy, knowledge and wisdom". For the ECFR, the [[shariah]] clearly embodies the superior rules in life: "the Shari'ah cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards, rather, it is the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform; it is the frame to which they must be referred; it is the scale on which they must be weighed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title =Challenging the Applicability of Shari`ah 
| date=  July 23, 2003
| publisher = Islam Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wants to achieve these through:
# bringing together Islamic scholars who live in Europe
# attempting to unify the jurisprudence views between them in regards with the main [[Fiqh]] (Islamic law) issues, especially with regard to the minority status of Muslims in Europe;
# issue collective fatwas which meet the needs of Muslims in Europe, solve their problems and regulate their interaction with the European communities, all according to the shariah;
# research how  issues arising in Europe can be resolved with strict respect for the shariah.

The ECFR is one of the main channels for the publications of [[fatwa]]'s by [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a Muslim scholar affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Among others, it wants to promote, and control, the local education of native [[imam]]'s for the Muslim minorities in European countries. Amongst others, it participates in such initiatives in [[France]] (in cooperation with the [[European Institute for Humanitarian and Islamic Studies]]) and the [[United Kingdom]].

It also strives to become an approved religious authority before local governments and private establishments in all countries where Muslims are a minority.

== Evaluation of the positions of the ECFR ==
According to its Mission Statement&lt;ref name="e-cfr.org"&gt;http://www.e-cfr.org//en/ECFR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the ECFR wants to assume a leading role in all dogmatic and accordingly also in all worldly issues in the worldwide Islamic community, the [[Ummah]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among others, it wants to address the younger Muslim generations living in  outside Islamic countries, especially those in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It wants to project a relatively contemporary position, all through it is heavily criticized for very undemocratic and non-contemporary positions:{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

* Its fatwas often rely on the four classical Islamic law schools (four schools of Fiqh), as well as all other schools of the people of Islamic law (Fiqh) knowledge, although with exclusion of modernist Islamic scholars in Europe as French ex-great-imam from [[Marseille]], [[Soheib Bencheikh]] and [[Zaki Badawi]], president of the London-based Muslim College and a keen promotor of interfaith dialogue (among other publishing regularly together with the Archbishop of York and the British Chief Rabbi).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* Its fatwas also insist on a strong priority for religious law over secular law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

On the other hand, it regularly pleads for mutual respect for non-Muslims, and for respect for civil procedures; e.g. marriage is considered valid only if the rights of both spouses are respected and if the civil procedure is followed to (any marriage which is conducted purely in the mosque is not considered Islamic).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Aside from the exclusion of non-[[Sunni]] Muslims, and more importantly, other people criticize the ECFR for its fierce refusal to accept separation of church and state as an element of democracy, as well as several principles of democracy. The fatwas of the ECFR's chairmain, Yussuf al-Qaradawi, are clear on how this tendency in Islam sees [[democracy]] and [[Human rights|universal human rights]]:

* On the [[separation of church and state|separation of state and church]] ([[secularism]]):{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} ''"Since Islam is a comprehensive system of `[[Ibadah]] (worship) and Shari'ah (legislation), the acceptance of secularism means abandonment of Shari'ah, a denial of the Divine guidance and a rejection of Allah’s injunctions. (...) the call for secularism among Muslims is atheism and a rejection of Islam. Its acceptance as a basis for rule in place of Shari'ah is a downright apostasy"''.&lt;ref name="islamonline.net"&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=61551&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* On democracy -where per definition a majority vote might differ from the commands in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} ''"the Shari'ah cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards, rather, it is the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform ..."''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/askaboutislam/display.asp?hquestionID=5978&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the freedom of religion:{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} ''"All Muslim jurists agree that the apostate is to be punished. However, they differ regarding the punishment itself. The majority of them go for killing; meaning that an apostate is to be sentenced to death"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamonline.net/fatwaapplication/english/display.asp?hFatwaID=102152&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in August 2005, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the Council had used the infamous [[anti-Semitic]] forgery known as the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] in its theological deliberations. They also reported that "the council is part of a web of organizations that spread ideology close to the Muslim Brotherhood throughout Europe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zmo.de/pressekit/material/Wall_Street_BG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Film''''' is a 1965 short film written by [[Samuel Beckett]], his only [[screenplay]]. It was commissioned by [[Barney Rosset]] of [[Grove Press]]. Writing began on 5 April 1963 with a first draft completed within four days. A second draft was produced by 22 May and a 40-leaf [[shooting script]] followed thereafter. It was filmed in [[New York City]] in July 1964.

Beckett's original choice for the lead – referred to only as “O” – was [[Charlie Chaplin]], but his script never reached him.&lt;ref&gt;”[W]hen Rosset, who had commissioned the screenplay — and whose Grove Press would publish it — sent a copy to Chaplin in [[California]], he was coolly informed by a secretary: ‘Mr. Chaplin doesn’t read scripts.’” – Talmer, J., ‘A film of few words and one Keaton’ in  ''[http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_157/afilmoffewwords.html Downtown Express, Vol. 18, Issue 52]'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Both Beckett and the director [[Alan Schneider]] were interested in [[Zero Mostel]] and [[Jack MacGowran]]. However, the former was unavailable and the latter, who accepted at first, became unavailable due to his role in a "Hollywood epic."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Alan Schneider's essay, "On Directing ''Film''" in ''Film'' by Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1969), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett then suggested [[Buster Keaton]].&lt;ref name="On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film"&gt;Schneider, A., ''[http://www.ubu.com/papers/beckett_schneider.html On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film]'' Explains Schneider: "During a transatlantic call one day (as I remember) he shattered our desperation over the sudden casting crisis by calmly suggesting Buster Keaton." In print: Schneider, "On Directing ''Film''" (Grove, 1969), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider promptly flew to Los Angeles and persuaded Keaton to accept the role along with "a handsome fee for less than three weeks' work."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, "On Directing ''Film''", 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Karen]], who was to have a small part in the film, also encouraged Schneider to contact Keaton.&lt;ref name="FilmWest 22"&gt;According to Karen, he had urged Schneider to consider the 68-year-old Keaton when MacGowran’s schedule changed, making him unavailable. Brownlow, K., ‘Brownlow on Beckett (on Keaton)’ in ''[http://ireland.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/22brown.htm FilmWest 22]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmed version differs from Beckett's original script but with his approval since he was on set all the time, this being his only visit to the United States. The script printed in ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (Faber and Faber, 1984) states:

: “This is the original film project for ''Film''. No attempt has been made to bring it into line with the finished work. The one considerable departure from what was imagined concerns the opening sequence in the street. This was first shot as given, then replaced by a simplified version in which only the indispensable couple is retained. For the rest the shooting script followed closely the indications in the script.”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 162&lt;/ref&gt;

It was remade by the [[British Film Institute]] (1979, 16&amp;nbsp;mm, 26 minutes) without Beckett's supervision, as '''''Film: a screenplay by Samuel Beckett'''''. David Rayner Clark directed [[Max Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckett did not approve of the finished product: “It was awful. I was there when they were setting it all up and then I had to go with the director - what was his name? - and I was very embarrassed. It was supposed to be silent with just the sound of feet and the one word "ssh" and he had every kind of noise going on.” – Brownlow, K., ‘Brownlow on Beckett (on Keaton) ’ in  ''[http://ireland.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/22brown.htm FilmWest 22]''. A full review can be read at ''[http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num07/Num7Cave.htm Journal of Beckett Studies Vol. 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726060333/http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num07/Num7Cave.htm |date=2007-07-26 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

It first appeared in print in ''[[Eh Joe]] and Other Writings'' (Faber and Faber, 1967).

==Synopsis==
Throughout the first two parts, almost everything is seen through the eye of the camera (designated in the script as E), although there are occasional moments when O's perception is seen. In the third part, much more of O's perception of the room and its contents is given. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a [[Scrim (material)|lens-gauze]], blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or [[Lens filter|filters]], keeping the images sharp.

===The street===
The film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour, it is difficult to discern what is being shown, but it is alive. As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still.&lt;ref&gt;”When the rushes of the first frenetic day’s outdoor filming were viewed, it was clear that it had been an almost total disaster … Yet the budget did not allow for the scene to be reshot … Hours were spent getting the exact close-up that they required of Buster Keaton’s ‘creased, reptilian’ eye to replace the abandoned outdoor scene with the extras.” – Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), pp 523,524&lt;/ref&gt; As the camera begins to [[Panning (camera)|pan]] right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in [[Lower Manhattan]]). It is summer, though it is hard to tell. The camera's movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.

Suddenly, the camera (E) shifts violently to the left. A man (O) is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall, and E gets a chance to [[Focus (optics)|focus]] on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. Keaton asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. “I hadn't thought of that,” the author admitted and then proposed, “the same coat,” which appealed to both men.&lt;ref name="FilmWest 22" /&gt; He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he's been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him.

No longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle and stumbling over a railway sleeper—anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man's hat off. E looks from the man's face to the woman's and back again. The man has a [[moustache]] and is wearing a [[pince-nez]]. They have been consulting a newspaper, which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened.

E moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez. and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man “opens his mouth to [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vituperate vituperate]”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 165&lt;/ref&gt; but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E  as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can’t bear to look at what they’ve seen and turn their faces away.

The action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.

===Stairs===
The camera cuts to the [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]]. The viewer is directly behind O. Stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his [[pulse]] and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs.

A frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. “She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 166&lt;/ref&gt; O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the [[baluster]]s. He glances up briefly to see where she is, then hides his head from view.

As the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs, she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.

E chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied, he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.

===The room===
We find ourselves in a “small barely furnished room.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett’s notes identify this as the man’s mother’s room. This recalls [[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]’s return to his mother’s room/womb/tomb to die. – Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), pp 195,383&lt;/ref&gt; The man—and the camera following him from behind—survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged [[parrot]] and a [[goldfish]] in its bowl sit atop a small table; the walls are bare, apart from a mirror and an unframed picture of “the face of [[God the Father]]”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 167. The actual photograph was “suggested to him by [[Avigdor Arikha]] [and] was a reproduction of a Sumerian head of God [[Mesopotamian mythology|Abu]] in the Museum in [[Baghdad]]. – Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 523&lt;/ref&gt; pinned to the wall; there is a couch with a pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a [[rocking chair]]&lt;ref&gt;The rocking-chair is a common Beckettian prop, appearing in the opening chapter of ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'', ''Rockaby'', ''Molloy'' (''Trilogy'' p 108) and the abandoned ''Mime de rêveur, A''.&lt;/ref&gt; with a “curiously carved headrest”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 167&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a window with a tattered [[Window blind#Solid blinds|roller blind]] with full-length net curtains to either side.

====Preparation of room====
Systematically, O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to ‘see’ him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (“a shy and uncooperative, little [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]”&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 523&lt;/ref&gt;) are – with some difficulty – ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply, the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious (e.g., as he passes the window, he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door).

After all the above, he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes.&lt;ref&gt;In his manuscript notes Beckett had not envisioned these ‘eye’ holes but had written “Make chair back memorable” and foresaw an “upright back, intersecting wooden bars or [[lozenge]]s”. – Notes for ''Film'' (Reading University Library MS 1227/7/6/1 p 15), quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 802 n 54&lt;/ref&gt; He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it, but there are “two eyelets, well proportioned”;&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 524&lt;/ref&gt; he turns the folder through 90° but he's disturbed by the parrot's eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. He sits again, repeats the same process with his folder and then has to get up and cover the goldfish bowl, too.

"Beckett initially contemplated setting ''Film'' in the evening, but had to decide against it for a practical reason: 'to remove all possibility of his putting off light in room.'"&lt;ref&gt;Pountney, R., ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama'' 1956-1976 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 127&lt;/ref&gt;

====Period in rocking chair====
Finally O sits down opposite the [[Denudation|denuded]] wall, opens the folder, and takes out seven photographs of himself, which he examines in sequence:

# 6 months old – in his mother's arms
# 4 years old – kneeling in an attitude of prayer&lt;ref&gt;The photograph in question is also referenced in ''[[How It Is]]'' (London: Calder, 1964), pp 16,17 and refers to a posed photograph of Beckett when he was four kneeling at his mother’s knee. It was taken so that Beatrice Evelyn’s sister, Dorothy could paint a subject called ‘Bedtime’ since it was impractical to have the young child pose for any length of time. – Cronin, A., ''Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997), p 20&lt;/ref&gt;
# 15 years old – in his [[School uniform#United Kingdom|school blazer]], teaching a dog to beg
# 20 years old – in his [[Academic dress|graduation gown]], receiving his scroll from the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]
# 21 years old – with his arm around his [[Engagement#Fiancé(e)|fiancée]]
# 25 years old – a newly enlisted man, with a little girl in his arms
# 30 years old – looking over forty, wearing a patch over one eye and looking grim

He spends twice as long on pictures 5 and 6. After he looks at each one he places them at the back of the pile so the viewing order is reversed. He does not need to do anything with the seventh photograph since it is now on the top of the pile. After a few seconds, he rips it up and drops it on the floor and then works his way one after another through the rest of the photos, looking at each one briefly again and then tearing it up. The photograph of him as an infant must be on a tougher mount and he has some difficulty with that one. “[I]n Beckett the distant past is always more tenacious than recent events.”&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, M., ''The Long Sonata of the Dead: A Study of Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 1969), p 35&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he rocks slightly, hands holding the armrests and then checks his pulse once more.

O is now in a similar situation to the man in ''[[A Piece of Monologue]],'' who has also destroyed all his old photographs and now stands facing a similarly blank wall.

====Investment proper====
&lt;small&gt;(See the opening two paragraphs of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070726060333/http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num07/Num7Cave.htm Richard Cave’s review of the 1979 version of the film] for a discussion of the possible definition of ‘investment’ here).&lt;/small&gt;

As O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly, O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was.

E turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch.

He half starts from the chair, then stiffens. Gradually, the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman's faces appears on his. He is looking at himself, but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching. The man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of “acute ''intentness''”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 169&lt;/ref&gt; on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes.

O covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over.

==Interpretation==
:"The greatest Irish film." – [[Gilles Deleuze]] &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, G., Gilles ''Deleuze: Essays Critical and Clinical'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

:A "load of old bosh." – [[Dilys Powell]] (''[http://www.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/21sludds.htm The Sunday Times]'')&lt;/tt&gt;

The work is studied by and has been the subject of criticism from both [[film]] and [[theatre]] scholars, with the former tending to study the film as shot, the latter tending to study the script as written. Critical opinion is mixed, but it is generally held in higher regard by film scholars than it is by theatre or Beckett scholars. The views above represent extremes. A ‘middle-ground’ review would probably be “a poor attempt by a genuine writer to move into a medium that he simply hadn’t the flair or understanding of to make a success.”&lt;ref&gt;Sludds, T., ‘Film, Beckett and Failure’ in ''[http://www.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/21sludds.htm FilmWest 21]'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett's own opinion was that it was an “interesting failure.”&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The film opens and closes with close-ups of a sightless eye. This inevitably evokes the notorious opening sequence of ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]''&lt;ref&gt;Beckett sets his film in the year 1929, the year ''Un Chien Andalou'' was made (and of course the first year of the sound film).&lt;/ref&gt; in which a human eye is sliced open with a razor blade. In fact, ''The Eye''&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A., ''[http://www.ubu.com/papers/beckett_schneider.html ''On Directing Samuel Beckett’s'' 'Film']''&lt;/ref&gt; was an early title for ''Film'', though admittedly, at that time, he had not thought of the need for the opening close-up. As a student of [[French literature]], Beckett would have been familiar with [[Victor Hugo]]’s poem ''La Conscience''. ‘''Conscience''’ in French can mean either ‘conscience’ in the English sense or ‘consciousness’ and the double meaning is important. Hugo's poem concerns a man haunted by an eye that stares at him unceasingly from the sky. He runs away from it, ever further, even to the grave, where, in the tomb, the eye awaits him. The man is [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. He has been trying to escape consciousness of himself, the self that killed his brother, but his conscience will not let him rest. The eye/I is always present and, when he can run no further, must be faced in the tomb.&lt;ref name="Pountney, R. 1988 p 129"&gt;Pountney, R., ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama'' 1956-1976 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 129&lt;/ref&gt;

''Film'' takes its inspiration from the 18th century [[Idealism#George Berkeley|Idealist Irish philosopher Berkeley]]. At the beginning of the work, Beckett uses the famous quotation: "''esse est percipi''" (to be is to be perceived). Notably, Beckett leaves off a portion of Berkeley's edict, which reads in full: “''esse est percipi aut percipere''” (to be is to be perceived or to perceive). Beckett was once asked if he could provide an explanation that ‘the man in the street’ could understand:

: “It’s a movie about the perceiving eye, about the perceived and the perceiver – two aspects of the same man. The perceiver desires like mad to perceive and the perceived tries desperately to hide. Then, in the end, one wins.”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., quoted in ‘Beckett’, ''New Yorker'', 8th Aug 1964, pp 22,23&lt;/ref&gt;

In between takes on the set near the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], Keaton told a reporter something similar, summarizing the theme as "a man may keep away from everybody but he can't get away from himself."

In Beckett's original script, the two main characters, the camera and the man it is pursuing are referred to as E (the Eye) and O (the Object). This simplistic division might lead one to assume that the Eye is only interested in the man it is pursuing. This may be true, but it does not mean it will not have the same effect on anyone who comes in contact with it. “E is both part of O and not part of O; E is also the camera and, through the camera, the eye of the spectator as well. But E is also self, not merely O’s self but the self of any person or people, specifically that of the other characters — the elderly couple and the flower-lady — who respond to its stare with that look of horror.”&lt;ref&gt;Henning S. D., ‘''Film'': a dialogue between Beckett and Berkeley’ in ''[http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num07/Num7Henning.htm Journal of Beckett Studies, No 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726060835/http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num07/Num7Henning.htm |date=2007-07-26 }}'', Spring 1982&lt;/ref&gt; E is, so to speak, O's blind eye. "He has the function of making all with whom he comes into contact self-aware.”&lt;ref&gt;Pountney, R., ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama'' 1956-1976 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 128&lt;/ref&gt;

O does everything physically possible to avoid being seen by others, but the only thing he can do to avoid perception by an “all seeing god” is to tear up his picture, a symbolic act, as if saying, “If I don’t believe you exist you can’t see me.” There is no one there to see him for what he really is other than himself and so, in this godless world, it is only fitting that E, representing O's self-perception, would appear standing where the picture has been torn from the wall. O also destroys the photographs of his past, his ‘memories’ of who he was. Now all that remains for O is to escape from himself - which he achieves by falling asleep until woken by E's intense gaze. The room is more figurative than literal, like many of Beckett's rooms, “as much psychological as physical, ‘rooms of the mind,’ as one ... actor called them.”&lt;ref&gt;Homan, S., ''Filming Beckett’s Television Plays: A Director’s Experience'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1992), p 53&lt;/ref&gt;

If Beckett were [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] he might well have written: “To be seen or not to be seen, that is the question.”&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, R. C., ‘To Speak the Words of “The Tribe” – The Wordlessness of Samuel Beckett’s Metaphysical Clowns’ in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987)', p 58&lt;/ref&gt; It is an issue that concerns many of Beckett's characters. At the end of the first act of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', when the boy wants to know what to tell Mr Godot, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] tells him: “Tell him … (''he hesitates'') … tell him you saw us. (''Pause.'') You did see us, didn’t you?”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Waiting for Godot'' (London: Faber and Faber, [1956] 1988), p 52&lt;/ref&gt; But what happens when you are alone? The narrator of ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' answers: “They depart, one by one, and the voices go on, it’s not theirs, they were never there, there was never anyone but you, talking to you about you…”&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''The Unnamable'' (New York: Grove Press, 1954), p 34&lt;/ref&gt; The old woman in ''[[Rockaby]]'' appears to be the exact opposite of O but although she actively seeks to be seen by someone while O does everything to avoid perceivedness, the irony is that both characters are alone with only themselves for company.

Beckett's script has been interpreted in various ways. R. C. Lamont writes that "''Film'' deals with the apprenticeship to death, the process of detaching oneself from life. Like the [[Tibet]]an ''[[Bardo Thodol|Book of the Dead]]'', it teaches the gradual dissolution of self. The veiling of the windows and mirrors, the covering of the birdcage – the extinction of light, reflection and light – are so many ritualistic steps to be taken before final immobility, the resignation of the end.”&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, R. C., ‘To Speak the Words of “The Tribe” – The Wordlessness of Samuel Beckett’s Metaphysical Clowns’ in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), pp 57,58&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of ''Film'', O is seated in his rocker with his face buried in his hands; at the end of ''Rockaby'', the old woman's head inclines forward as if, finally, she had died.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, James, ''Damned to Fame'', London: Bloomsbury, 1997, p. 662&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene in ''Film'' is also comparable to the moment in the library when the old man in ''[[That Time#C|That Time]]'' sees his own reflection in the glass covering a painting.

It could be tempting to think of O and E as a Beckettian ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' – indeed in notes for the first draft Beckett did toy “with the idea of making ‘E tall’ and ‘O short (and) fat’ which corresponds with the dual physique of Jekyll and Hyde” – but ''Film'' is not concerned with representations of good and evil, only with the concept of the second self, of pursuer and pursued.”&lt;ref name="Pountney, R. 1988 p 129"/&gt; The special relationship existing between O and E - an atypical case of Doppelgänger - constitutes what has been called "palindromic identity." &lt;ref&gt;Ferri, L., ‘Filosofia della Visione e l'Occhio Palindromico in "Film" di Samuel Beckett’ in Dolfi, A.,(Ed.) ''Il Romanzo e il Racconto Filosofico nella modernità'', (Firenze: University Press, 2012), pp 189-215&lt;/ref&gt;

For Linda Ben-Zvi, “Beckett does not merely reproduce the modernist critique of and anxiety over technology and the reproduction of art; he attaches 'no [[truth value]]'&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'', p 163&lt;/ref&gt; to his critique of technology and the reproduction of the gaze. Instead, he creates a dialogue that awakens and revitalises the uncritical perception of his audience... The work not only is predicated on the form but invariably becomes a critique of its form."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Zvi, L., ‘Samuel Beckett's Media Plays’ in ''Modern Drama'' 28.1 (1985): pp 22-37&lt;/ref&gt; Having written a play titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' and a song called ''Song'',&lt;ref&gt;The first part of the song in [[Words and Music (play)|Words and Music]] was published separately as ''Song'' in ''Collected Poems'' (Faber, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; it comes as no surprise that Beckett would entitle his first foray into cinema as ''Film''. The title supports Ben-Zvi's interpretation in that it is a film about cinematic technology: how the movie camera and photographic images are used in ''Film'' are essential to understanding it. When he writes, “No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience”,&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 163&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett takes the emphasis away from Berkeley's [[Saying|maxim]] thus stressing the dramatic structure of the work. The viewers are being asked to consider the work structurally and dramatically rather than emotionally or philosophically.

[[Film critic]] and [[film historian]] [[Andrew Sarris]] briefly mentions ''Film'' in his [[book]], ''The American cinema: directors and directions, 1929-1968''.  Sarris discusses ''Film'' in the context of his section on the film career of [[Buster Keaton]], writing that: "Even Samuel Beckett contributed to the desecration of the Keaton mask by involving the actor of absurdity before its time in a dreary exercise called ''Film'', the most pretentious title in all cinema."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The American cinema: directors and directions, 1929-1968 | author = Sarris, Andrew |year=1996|publisher=Da Capo Press |location= Cambridge, MA|isbn= 0-306-80728-9|page= 62 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 7 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beckett and Keaton==
Beckett had never seen Schneider direct any of his plays and yet continued to entrust him with the work. However, for this particular project, Beckett became personally involved. Schneider has speculated that it may simply have been the opportunity to work directly with Keaton. “It has even been suggested that the inspiration for ''Waiting for Godot'' might have come from a minor Keaton film called ''The Lovable Cheat'' in which Keaton plays a man who waits endlessly for the return of his partner - whose name was Godot.”&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, K., and Daly, F., ‘''Film'' by Samuel Beckett’ in ''FilmWest'' 20, 1995, pp 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

“When Schneider managed to hunt up Keaton, he found that genius of the silent screen — old, broke, ill, and alone — some $2 million ahead in a four-handed poker game with an imaginary [[Louis B. Mayer]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and two other invisible Hollywood moguls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Thalberg]] and [[Nicholas Schenck]] according to Schneider.  The game had been going on since 1927. [http://www.ubu.com/papers/beckett_schneider.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

“‘Yes, I accept the offer,’ were silent Keaton's unexpected first words to Schneider. Keaton was dying even as they made the film. ‘We didn’t know that,’ Rosset told interviewer Patsy Southgate in 1990, ‘but looking back at it, the signs were there. Couldn’t speak — he was not so much difficult, he just wasn’t there.’ Keaton would in fact die 18 months after the shooting of Film.”&lt;ref&gt;Talmer, J., ‘A film of few words and one Keaton’ in ''[http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_157/afilmoffewwords.html Downtown Express, Vol. 18, Issue 52]'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

From this one might think that Keaton jumped at the chance but this is not the case. James Karen remembers:

: “He had to be talked into it by Eleanor [his wife] and I remember calling and saying, ‘You know, it could be your ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du paradis]]''. It could be that wonderful, wonderful thing.’”&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, K., Brownlow on Beckett (on Keaton) in  ''[http://ireland.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/22brown.htm FilmWest 22]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett had wanted to work with Keaton several years earlier, when he offered him the role of Lucky in the American stage premiere of "Waiting for Godot," but Buster turned it down. It's said that Buster didn't understand ''Godot'' and had misgivings about this script as well. Presumably this went a long way to make him think twice about this new project.

During a meeting with documentary filmmaker Kevin Brownlow, Beckett was quite forthcoming:

: “Buster Keaton was inaccessible. He had a poker mind as well as a poker face. I doubt if he ever read the text&lt;ref&gt;According to Schneider, he had, prior to their initial meeting but “was not sure what could be done to fix it up”. [http://www.ubu.com/papers/beckett_schneider.html]&lt;/ref&gt; - I don't think he approved of it or liked it. But he agreed to do it and he was very competent … Of course, I had seen his silent films and enjoyed them – don't suppose I could remember them now. He had a young woman with him – his wife, who had picked him up from his alcoholism. We met him at a hotel. I tried to engage him in conversation, but it was no good. He was absent. He didn't even offer us a drink. Not because he was being unfriendly, but because it never occurred to him.”&lt;ref name="FilmWest 22"/&gt;

Schneider's recollection of that awkward first meeting confirms all of this and more: “They simply had nothing to say to each other, no worlds of any kind to share. And all of Sam's good will and my own failing efforts to get something started failed to bring them together on any level. It was a disaster.”&lt;ref name="On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film"/&gt;

But not entirely. Although the role called for Beckett's seemingly ubiquitous bowler hat, Keaton had brought along some of his trademark flattened-down [[Stetson]]s and it was quickly agreed that he should wear one of those. On the Monday morning they “traipsed down in Joe Coffey's ancient [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]] to just beneath the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge and began the shooting.”&lt;ref name="On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film"/&gt; Beckett continues:

: “The heat was terrible - while I was staggering in the humidity, Keaton was galloping up and down and doing whatever we asked of him. He had great endurance, he was very tough and, yes, reliable. And when you saw that face at the end - oh!’ He smiled, ‘At last’”&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, K., ‘Brownlow on Beckett (on Keaton) ’ in  ''[http://ireland.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/22brown.htm FilmWest 22]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Beckett and Schneider were novices, Keaton a seasoned veteran. That said, “Keaton's behaviour on the set was … steady and cooperative … He was indefatigable if not exactly loquacious. To all intents and purposes, we were shooting a silent film, and he was in his best form. He encouraged [Schneider] to give him vocal directions during the shot, sometimes starting over again without stopping the camera if he felt he hadn't done something well the first time. (Nor did he believe much in rehearsal, preferring the spontaneity of performance.) Often when [the crew was] stumped over a technical problem with the camera, he came through with suggestions, inevitably prefacing his comments by explaining that he had solved such problems many times at the Keaton Studios back in 1927.”&lt;ref name="On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film"/&gt;

Both Beckett and Schneider pronounced themselves more than pleased with Keaton's performance; the latter called him "magnificent."

Keaton's negative comments about the film are often reported but this final recollection by Schneider may redress the balance: “[W]hatever he may have subsequently said to interviewers or reporters about not understanding a moment of what he was doing or what the film was about, what I remember best of our final farewell on the set was that he smiled and half-admitted those six pages were worth doing after all.”&lt;ref name="On Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film"/&gt;

In February 1965, when on a trip to [[West Berlin]], “in deference to his recent work with Buster Keaton, he went to see Keaton again in his 1927 film ''[[The General (1927 film)|The General]]'', finding it, however, disappointing.”&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian playwright Sherry MacDonald wrote a play, ''The Stone Face'', based on the encounter between Beckett, Keaton and Schneider.

'''Gor''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɔr}} is the [[Counter-Earth]] setting for an extended series of [[sword and planet]] novels by author and philosophy professor [[John Norman]].  The series is inspired particularly by the ''[[Barsoom]]'' series and ''[[Almuric]]'', but is also known for its content combining [[philosophy]], [[erotica]] and [[science fantasy]].  The series is known for its repeated depiction of sexual fantasies involving men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state.  According to ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]],'' Norman's "sexual philosophy" is "widely detested",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/norman_john|title=Authors : Norman, John : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the books have inspired a [[Gorean subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/05/18/gor/|title=Chain gang|last=Gracen|first=Julia|website=Salon|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has been variably referred to by publishers with several names including '''''The Chronicles of Counter-Earth''''' ([[Ballantine Books]]), '''''The Saga of Tarl Cabot''''' ([[DAW Books]]), '''''Gorean Cycle''''' ([[Tandem Books]]), '''''Gorean Chronicles''''' (Masquerade Books), '''''Gorean Saga''''' (Open Road Media) and '''''The Counter-Earth Saga''''' (DAW Books, for novels with a protagonist other than Tarl Cabot).

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Norman spoke at length about the creation of the Gor universe and his influences.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Counter-Earth, or ''Antichthon,'' is from Greek cosmology. Speculation on such a world, you see, is ancient. One of the premises of the Gorean series is that a race of aliens, whom we might speak of as the Priest-Kings, have a technology at their disposal compared to which ours would be something like that in the Bronze Age." [http://io9.com/5783833/john-norman-the-philosopher-who-created-the-barbaric-world-of-gor] &lt;ref&gt;Anders, Charlie Jane. "John Norman, the philosophy professor who created the barbaric world of Gor". 2011-3-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think, pretty clearly, the three major influences on my work are [[Homer]], [[Freud]], and [[Nietzsche]]. Interestingly, however obvious this influence might be, few, if any, critics, commentators, or such, have called attention to it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, he said "one of the pleasures of writing science fiction is the development of, and characterization of, alien life forms".

===Setting===
Gor is described as a [[planetary habitability|habitable planet]] in the [[Solar System]] that shares the same orbit as [[Earth]], but it is [[Counter-earth|linearly opposed to Earth]] and consequently always hidden by the [[Sun]], making direct observation of it from Earth impossible. The flora, fauna and customs of Gor are intricately detailed. Norman populates his planet with the equivalents of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Viking]] and other cultures. In the novels, these various population groups are transplants from Earth brought there by space-craft through the behind-the-scenes rulers of Gor, the Priest-Kings, an extraterrestrial species of [[insect]]oid appearance. The Gorean humans are permitted advanced architectural, agricultural and medical skills (including life extension), but are forced to remain primitive in the fields of transportation, communication and weaponry (at approximately the level of Classical Mediterranean civilization) due to restrictions on technology imposed by the Priest-Kings. The most advanced form of transportation is the riding of large predatory birds called ''tarns'' by masterful men known as ''tarnsmen''. The limitation of technology is imposed to ensure the safety of both the Priest-Kings and the other indigenous and transplanted beings on Gor, who would otherwise possibly come to harm due to humans' belligerent tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofgor.com/reference.aspx?rpID=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424084718/http://www.worldofgor.com/reference.aspx?rpID=9 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-24 |title=Cultures |publisher=World of Gor |date= |accessdate=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planet Gor has lower gravity than the Earth (which allows for the existence of large flying creatures, and tall towers connected by aerial bridges in the cities) and would have an even lower gravity if not for the technology of the Priest-Kings. The known geography of Gor consists mainly of the western seaboard of a continent that runs from the Arctic in the north to south of the equator, with the Thassa ocean to the west, and the Voltai mountain range forming an eastern boundary at many latitudes. There are also offshore islands in the ocean and some relatively sparsely settled plains to the east of the Voltai. The word "Gor" itself means "home stone" in the Gorean language, the native language of the "northern civilized cities of known Gor" (which resemble ancient Greco-Roman city-states in many respects), and a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in many other areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofgor.com/reference.aspx?rpID=12 |title=Places |publisher=World of Gor |date= |accessdate=2009-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227220134/http://www.worldofgor.com/reference.aspx?rpID=12 |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plotlines===
Most of the novels in the series are action and sexual adventures, with many of the military engagements borrowing liberally from historic ones, such as the [[trireme]] battles of [[ancient Greece]] and the castle sieges of medieval Europe. Ar, the largest city in known Gor, has resemblances to the ancient city of [[Rome]], and its land empire is opposed by the sea-power of the island of Cos.

The series is an overlapping of [[planetary romance]] and [[sword and planet]]. The first book, ''Tarnsman of Gor'', opens with scenes reminiscent of scenes in the first book of the [[Barsoom]] series by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]; both feature the protagonist narrating his adventures after being transported to another world. These parallels end after the first few books, when the stories of the books begin to be structured along a loose plot arc involving the struggles of the city-state of Ar and the island of Cos to control the Vosk river area, as well as the struggles at a higher level between the non-human Priest-Kings and Kurii (another alien race) to control the solar system.

[[File:Bosk-Port-Kar-ship-flag-Norman-Gor.svg|200px|thumb|Personal flag of Bosk of Port Kar (a.k.a. Tarl Cabot of Bristol), the main narrator of the ''Gor'' books]]
Most of the books are narrated by transplanted British professor '''Tarl Cabot''', master swordsman, as he engages in adventures involving Priest-Kings, Kurii, and humans. Books 7, 11, 19, 22, 26, 27, 31, 34 and parts of 32 are narrated by abducted Earth women who are made slaves. Books 14, 15, and 16 are narrated by male abductee Jason Marshall. Book 28 is narrated by an unknown Kur, but features Tarl Cabot. Book 30 and parts of 32 are narrated by three Gorean men: a mariner, a scribe and a merchant/slaver.

The series features several sentient alien races. The most important to the books are the insectoid Priest-Kings and the huge sharp-clawed predatory Kurii, both space-farers from foreign star systems. The Priest-Kings rule Gor as disinterested custodians, leaving humans to their own affairs as long as they abide by certain restrictions on technology. The Kurii are an aggressive, invasive race with advanced technology (but less so than that of the Priest-Kings) who wish to colonize both Gor and Earth. The power of the Priest-Kings is diminished after the "Nest War" described in the third book and the Priest-Kings and Kurii struggle against each other via their respective human agents and spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moonproductions.com/Fantasy/Gor/annalsmain.html |title=The Annals of Gor |publisher=Moonproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early entries in the series were plot-driven [[space opera]] adventures, but later entries grew more philosophical and sexual. Many subplots run the course of several books and tie back to the main plot in later books. Some of these plots begin in the first book, but most are underway in the first ten books.

==Publication==
[[DAW Books]], which published the Gor series from the 8th volume (''Hunters of Gor'') through the 25th volume (''Magicians of Gor''), subsequently decided to cease publication of the books, citing low sales;&lt;ref name="kink" /&gt; Norman attributes the decision to [[feminism|feminist]] influences, saying in 1996:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Tarnsman of Gor'' was published in late 1966. It has been reprinted 22 times... I have recently signed contracts for fresh French and German sales, and have recently been published for the first time in Czechoslovakia. There have been recent Spanish and Italian sales. There's no evidence that my books no longer sell... After DAW refused to buy any more Gor books, I sold a three-part Telnarian series to Brian Thomsen of Warner Books. The first book, ''The Chieftain'', had a 67 percent [[sell-through]]. The second, ''The Captain'', had a 91 percent sell-through, which is the sort of thing that would make [[Stephen King]] rush over to shake your hand... Brian Thomsen, my Warner editor for the Telnarian series... was replaced by an editor from one of the blacklisting presses, one that ''explicitly'' informed my agent they would not consider anything by John Norman. That new editor canceled the series despite its success and without waiting to see how the third book, ''The King'', would do. That way things are made nicely clear...

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately for me, only about seven or eight publishing houses maintain a mass-market paperback line in science fiction and fantasy; this small, {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}knit group effectively controls the market. With such a group, a blacklist need not be an explicit, formal written or oral agreement subscribed to by a gathered cabal pledged to secrecy. It is an understanding that a certain individual is to be ostracized, excluded, methodologically overlooked or such."&lt;ref&gt;"No More Gor: A Conversation with John Norman", David Alexander Smith, ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'', #92, April, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All of John Norman's books are now published by E-Reads as [[ebooks]] and print copies. According to their website, "they are among E-Reads’ biggest sellers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ereads.com/2007/10/are-john-normans-gors-boy-books-2.html |title=Are John Norman’s Gors "Boy-Books"? |publisher=E-Reads |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031111019/http://ereads.com/2007/10/are-john-normans-gors-boy-books-2.html |archivedate=2012-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
Two films have been made, [[Gor (film)|''Gor'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0095241|title=Gor (1987)|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Outlaw of Gor]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0098048|title=Outlaw of Gor (1989)|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ''Outlaw'').

While not officially connected to John Norman's work, ''[[Fencer of Minerva]]'' is a Japanese animated series containing many of the elements and ideas discussed in Gorean Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0249509|title=Minerva no kenshi (1994) (V) |accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1990s, an attempt was made to publish an authorized [[graphic novel]] adaptation of the Gor series under [[Vision Entertainment]]. The project collapsed under a combination of financial issues and the nature of the imagery, which violated [[Censorship in Canada|Canadian law]], where the printer was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marrus|title=Lightsurfing: Living Life in the Front of My Mouth 1992–2003|publisher= Kissena Park Press|date= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9768508-2-3 |pages= 51–55, 67–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the Gor series was adapted into a [[role-playing game]] for [[Postmortem Studios]], written by [[James Desborough (game designer)|James Desborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://postmortemstudios.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/rpg-the-gor-rpg-is-released/|title=#RPG – The Gor RPG is RELEASED!|last=grimachu|date=2017-04-23|website=Postmortem Studios|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''Gor'' novels have been criticized for their focus on relationships between [[Male dominance (BDSM)|dominant men]] and [[Female submission|submissive women]], the latter often in positions of slavery. ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' has stated that the first several books are "passable exercises" of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] style fiction while "later volumes degenerate into extremely sexist, sadomasochistic pornography involving the [[ritual humiliation]] of women, and as a result have caused widespread offence".&lt;ref name="kink"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langford |first1=David |date=1998 |title=The Kink in Space |journal=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |issue=39 |pages= |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |url=http://ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx039.html |accessdate=January 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]] |last1=Clute |first1=John |last2=Grant |first2=John |authorlink1=John Clute |authorlink2=John Grant (science fiction writer) |date=1999 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-19869-8 |pages=692–693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction/fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]] has suggested that the ''Gor'' novels should be placed on the top shelves of bookstores, saying, "I’m not for censorship but I am for strategies which marginalize stuff that works to objectify women and suggests women enjoy being beaten."&lt;ref&gt;Killjoy, Margaret.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">[[File:NAMA Grave stele of a young doryphoros.JPG|thumb|Grave stele in its current display in Athens]]
The [[Attica|Attic]] '''Grave stele''' in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] ('''NAMA''') with the inventory number '''7901''' is an [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] grave marker of a young Greek, which was made in the middle of the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/sculpture/archaic/archaic12-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original height of the grave monument is assumed to have been around 4.5&amp;nbsp;m. A [[Sphinx]] probably sat on top. The surviving piece of the stele is 1.16&amp;nbsp;m high and up to 52&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The stele, which tapers at the top, is made of [[Parian marble]]. A great deal of red-brown [[Ancient polychromy|paint]] survives in the background and on the hair. The stele was found in 1973 during excavation of the [[Themistoclean wall]] in [[Athens]] and is dated to around the year 550/540.

The stele is only partially preserved. The lower part is missing from the hips, as is the very top. There is further damage to the head, hair and other details, but these do not spoil the impression that it is relatively well preserved. Small pieces broken off the head and right arm have been reconstructed. At its right and left edges, the stele was rimmed by two thin relief bands. The young man is depicted in profile, looking to the right, in the guiet, motionless pose typical of the Archaic period. He is [[Heroic nudity|naked and muscular]], which creates a strong impression; the spear in the raised left hand marks him as an [[Ancient Greek sports|athlete]]. His right arm dangles at his side. His shoulder-length hair is gathered in locks, with chin length plaits between his eye and his ear. His hair is tied in place by a narrow band, covered at the front by his hair.

{{Wiktionary|guideline}}
A '''guideline''' is a statement by which to determine a course of action. A guideline aims to streamline particular processes according to a set routine or sound practice. By definition, following a guideline is never mandatory. Guidelines are not binding and are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, http://www.va.gov/trm/TRMGlossaryPage.asp  &lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines may be issued by and used by any organization (governmental or private) to make the actions of its employees or divisions more predictable, and presumably of higher quality.

'''House demolition''' is a method utilized by the [[Israeli Defence Forces]] (IDF) in [[Jerusalem]], the [[West Bank]], and the [[Gaza Strip]] against [[Palestinians]].

==History==
[[File:DemolishedPalestinianHome.jpg|thumb|right|A Palestinian home after demolition by Israeli military forces.]]
The practice originated under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], when the government gave authority to military commanders to confiscate and raze “any house, structure or land... the inhabitants of which he is satisfied have committed… any offence against these Regulations involving violence.”&lt;ref name=Schwartz8&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Yishai|title=Israel Destroys Homes to Deter Terrorists.

Some 2,000 Arab homes were demolished during the Arab revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Golani, Motti: ''Palestine Between Politics and Terror, 1945-1947'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 the authorities passed the ''Defence (Emergency) Regulations''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihlresearch.org/opt/pdfs/briefing3403.pdf Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041205/http://www.ihlresearch.org/opt/pdfs/briefing3403.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} The Legality of House Demolitions under International Humanitarian Law. Retrieved 30 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Regulation 119 made this practice available to the local Military Commander without limit or appeal. During the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] against the British in the 1940s, the British only employed this tactic one time against the Jews. In August 1947, after failing to quell the Jewish insurgency, the British military received clearance from the High Commissioner to demolish Jewish homes. Subsequently, a Jewish home in the Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Givat Shaul]] where arms were discovered during a routine search was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, after Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza, [[Theodor Meron]], then legal adviser to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Foreign Ministry]], advised the Prime Minister's office in a top secret memorandum that house demolitions, even of suspected terrorists's residences, violated the 1949 [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] on the protection of civilians in war. Undertaking such measures, as though they were in continuity with British mandatory emergency regulations, might be useful as [[hasbara]] but were 'legally unconvincing'.  The advice was ignored. His view, according to [[Gershom Gorenberg]], is shared by nearly all scholars of international law,  prominent Israeli experts included.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershom Gorenberg]], [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.657167 'Israel knew all along that settlements, home demolitions were illegal,'] [[Haaretz]] 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1987 letter, the British said this regulation had been repealed in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;In a 1987 letter, the British Foreign Ministry indicated that "in view of the Palestine (Revocations) Order in Council 1948 (S.I. 1948/1004, at 1350-51), the Palestine (Defense) Order in Council 1937 and the Defense Regulations 1945 made under it are, as a matter of English law, no longer in force." See Emma Playfair, "Demolition and Sealing of Houses as a Punitive Measure in the Israeli-Occupied West Bank," Al Haq, 33, April 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the repeal was not published in the [[Palestine Gazette]], as required in law at that time, and Israel still operates the contentious policy of punitive military house demolition under the 1945 British DER 119.

During the [[Second Intifada]], the IDF adopted a policy of [[house demolition]] following a [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|wave of suicide bombings]]. Israel justified the policy on the basis of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] against [[terrorism]], and providing an incentive for families of potential [[suicide bombers]] to dissuade the bomber from attacking. Demolitions can also occur in the course of fighting. During [[Operation Defensive Shield]], several IDF soldiers were killed early in the conflict while searching houses containing militants. In response, the IDF started employing a tactic of surrounding such houses, calling on the occupants (civilian and militant) to exit, and demolishing the house on top of the militants that do not surrender. This tactic, called "Nohal Sir Lachatz" [[:he:נוהל סיר לחץ|נוהל סיר לחץ]] "Pressure Pot", is now used whenever feasible (i.e., non multi-rise building that is separated from other houses). In some heavy fighting incidents, especially in the [[Battle of Jenin|2002 Battle of Jenin]] and [[Operation Rainbow]] in [[Rafah]] 2004, heavily [[Vehicle armour|armored]] [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[bulldozers]] were used to demolish houses to widen alleyways, uncover tunnels or to secure locations for IDF troops.  The result was an indiscriminate use of demolitions against civilian housing unconnected to terrorism that left 1,000 people homeless in the  Rafah Refugee Camp.&lt;ref name="Kober" /&gt;

According to a report by Amnesty International in 1999, house demolitions are usually done without prior warning and the home's inhabitants are given little time to evacuate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/mde15/078/1999/fr/ Israel: House demolitions -- Palestinians given "15 minutes to leave...]  [[Amnesty International]]. December 8, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 HRW report, many families in Rafah own a "cluster of homes". For example, the family may own a "small house from earlier days in the camp, often with nothing more than an [[asbestos]] roof". Later, sons will build homes nearby when they start their own families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Razing Rafah - Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip| website = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2018-08-21| date = 2004-10-17| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/10/17/razing-rafah/mass-home-demolitions-gaza-strip}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2005, the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)]] ordered an end to the demolition of houses for the purpose of punishing the families of [[suicide bomber]]s unless there is "an extreme change in circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4274977.stm "Israel limits house demolitions"], Thursday, 17 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, house demolitions continue for other reasons. In 2010 (to 9 Nov) 315 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished in East Jerusalem and Area C (including 17 structures demolished by their owners following demolition orders). 402 people have been displaced and about 1,296 people have been otherwise affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101118w0001.htm#10111866000542|title=Lords Hansard text for 18 Nov 201018 Nov 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, after a string of fatal attacks by Palestinian against Israelis in Jerusalem, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in favor of the Israeli Defense Forces to seal with cement the family homes of Palestinian terrorists as a deterrent against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/court-orders-home-of-jerusalem-yeshiva-terrorist-sealed-off-1.267483|title=Court Orders Home of Jerusalem Yeshiva Terrorist Sealed Off|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

A January 2015 efficacy study by [[Efraim Benmelech|Benmelech]], Berrebi and Klor distinguishes between “punitive demolitions”, in which homes belonging to the families of terror operatives are demolished, and “precautionary demolitions”, such as the demolition of a house well-positioned for use by Palestinian snipers.  Their results, which [[The New Republic]] calls "politically explosive" indicate that "precautionary demolitions" have caused [[suicide attack]]s to increase, a “48.7 percent increase in the number of suicide terrorists from an average district,” while in the months immediately following a demolition, punitive demolitions caused terror attacks to decline by  between 11.7 and 14.9 percent.&lt;ref name=Schwartz8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Yair|title=Study Finds Israeli House Demolitions Deter Terrorism|url=http://tabletmag.com/scroll/187529/study-finds-israeli-house-demolitions-deter-terrorism|accessdate=10 December 2014|publisher=Tablet|date=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Klor later described the effect of punitive demolitions as "small, localized and diminish[ing] over time" and suggested that the real reason they were carried out was "to placate the Israeli public".&lt;ref name=Schwartz8/&gt;

==Purpose==

===IDF arguments===

House demolition is typically justified by the IDF on the basis of:
* [[Deterrence theory|Deterrence]], achieved by harming the relatives of those who carry out, or are suspected of involvement in carrying out, attacks&lt;ref name="btselem-punishment"/&gt; [[Efraim Benmelech|Benmelech]], Berrebi and Klor call demolitions of this type, targeting the homes of terror operatives “punitive demolitions”.&lt;ref name=Schwartz8/&gt;
* The following types are labeled as “precautionary demolitions” by [[Efraim Benmelech|Benmelech]], Berrebi and Klor, however punishing they may feel to the impacted families.&lt;ref name=Schwartz8/&gt;
* [[Counter-terrorism]], by destroying militant facilities such as [[bomb]]s [[Laboratory|labs]], weapons factories, weapons and ammunition [[warehouse]]s, headquarters, offices etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Human rights organisations' criticism===

The [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[human rights]] groups such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] who oppose the house demolitions reject the IDF's claims, and document numerous instances where they argue the IDF's claims do not apply.&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt; They accuse the Israeli government and IDF of other motives:
* [[Collective punishment]], the punishment of an innocent Palestinian "for an offence he or she has not personally committed."&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geneva-article33"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600038?OpenDocument Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention], International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theft of Palestinian land by [[annexation]] to build the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] or to create, expand or otherwise benefit [[Israeli settlements]].&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/007/2007/en/?open&amp;of=ENG-2D2 ''Update to Amnesty International’s briefing to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination''] , [[Amnesty International]], 1 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations, about 1,500 homes were demolished by the IDF just in the [[Rafah]] area in the period 2000-2004.&lt;ref name="Israeli troops raze Rafah houses"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3557804.stm | work=BBC News | title=Israeli troops raze Rafah houses | date=2004-08-12 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The report documented what it described as a "pattern of illegal demolitions" by the IDF in Rafah, a refugee camp and city at the southern end of the Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt where sixteen thousand people lost their homes after the Israeli government approved a plan to expand the de facto [[Philadelphi Route|"buffer zone"]] in May 2004.&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah-SUM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah"&gt;{{cite web

==Means==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:D9rafah01.jpg|thumb|Armored D9R bulldozer demolish house during [[Operation Rainbow]] in [[Rafah]], 2004.]] --&gt;
[[File:IDF-D9-Zachi-Evenor-001.jpg|thumb|IDF [[armored bulldozer|armored]] [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]]R [[bulldozer]].]]
Demolitions are carried out by the Israeli Army [[Israeli Engineering Corps|Combat Engineering Corps]] using [[armored bulldozer]]s, usually [[Caterpillar D9]], but also with [[excavator]]s (for high multi-story buildings) and [[wheel loaders]] (for small houses with low risk) modified by the IDF. The heavily armored [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] is often used when there is a risk demolishing the building (such as when armed insurgents are barricaded inside or the structure is rigged with [[explosive]] and [[booby traps]]). Multi-story buildings, flats, and explosive labs are demolished by explosive devices, set by IDF demolition experts of [[Sayeret Yahalom|Yaalom]]'s ''Sayeret Yael''. Amnesty International has also described house demolitions that were carried out by the IDF using "powerful explosive charges".&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt;

==Legal status==
{{see|Israeli occupation of the West Bank}}
The use of house demolition under [[international law]] is today governed by the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], enacted in 1949, which protects non-combatants in occupied territories. Article 53 provides that "Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons ... is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations."&lt;ref name="Geneva"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView Fourth Geneva Convention], International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Israel, which is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention, asserts that the terms of the Convention are not applicable to the [[Palestinian territories]] on the grounds that the territories do not constitute a state which is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dowty, ''The Jewish State: A Century Later'', University of California Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-520-22911-8}}, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerson, Allan. ''Israel, the West Bank, and International law'', Routledge, 28 September 1978, {{ISBN|0-7146-3091-8}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam, "Decline of Illusions: The Status of the Israeli-Occupied Territories over 21 Years" in ''International Affairs'' (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944-), Vol. 64, No. 3. (Summer, 1988), pp. 345-359., p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; This position is rejected by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, which notes that "it is a basic principle of human rights law that international human rights treaties are applicable in all areas in which states parties exercise effective control, regardless of whether or not they exercise sovereignty in that area."&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/033/2004 Israel and the Occupied Territories Under the rubble: House demolition and destruction of land and property] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207215812/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/033/2004 |date=2014-12-07 }} by [[Amnesty International]], 18 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a punitive measure==
As a punitive measure, one study by a Northwestern and Hebrew University group concluded that prompt demolitions brought about a lowering of suicide attacks for a month and that they are an effective [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] against [[terrorism]]. They are related to the identity of the house’s owner, and result in a 'significant decrease' of Palestinian terrorists attacks.&lt;ref name=EffectfulTerroristsHomeDemolitions /&gt; Conversely, an internal IDF report of 2005, analyzing the effectiveness of the policy during the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in which 3,000 civilian homes were demolished, found that terror attacks increased after house demolitions, only  stimulated hatred of Israel, the damage caused outweighed any benefits, and recommended the practice be dropped.&lt;ref name="Kober" &gt;Avi Kober,[https://books.google.com/books?id=p1GOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131  ''Israel's Wars of Attrition:Attrition Chanllenges to DSemocratic States''] Routledge 2009 p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Byman]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mYppAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167 ''A High Price:The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism,''] Oxford University Press p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has criticised the lack of [[due process]] in the use of house demolitions by Israel. Many demolitions are carried out with no warning or opportunity for the householder to appeal. In 2002, a proposed demolition case was appealed to the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] who ruled that there must be a right to appeal unless doing so would ''"endanger the lives of Israelis or if there are combat activities in the vicinity."'' In a later ruling the Supreme Court decided that demolitions without advanced warning or due process can be carried out if advance notice would hinder demolition. Amnesty describes this as ''"a virtual green light"'' to demolition with no warning.&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt;


===Criticism and responses===
The effectiveness of house demolitions as a deterrence has been questioned. In 2005 an Israeli Army commission to study house demolitions found no proof of effective deterrence and concluded that the damage caused by the demolitions overrides its effectiveness. As a result, the IDF approved the commission's recommendations to end punitive demolitions of Palestinian houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diakonia.se/sa/node.asp?node=859 Is the House Demolition Policy Legal under International Humanitarian Law?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013706/http://www.diakonia.se/sa/node.asp?node=859 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[human rights]] organizations, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and the [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]], oppose the practice. Human Rights Watch has argued that the practice violates international laws against collective punishment, the destruction of [[private property]], and the use of force against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/press/2002/10/gaza1024.htm Human Rights News: IDF House Demolition Injures Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli historian [[Yaacov Lozowick]], however, implied that there is a moral basis for demolishing the houses of families of suicide bombers, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Demolishing the homes of civilians merely because a family member has committed a crime is immoral. If, however,... potential suicide murderers... will refrain from killing out of fear that their mothers will become homeless, it would be immoral to leave the Palestinian mothers untouched in their homes while Israeli children die on their school buses."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yaacov Lozowick]] (2004): ''"Right to Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars"'' {{ISBN|1-4000-3243-1}}. p.260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2004, The Israeli Foreign Ministry publicly stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...other means employed by Israel against terrorists is the demolition of homes of those who have carried out suicide attacks or other grave attacks, or those who are responsible for sending suicide bombers on their deadly missions. Israel has few available and effective means in its war against terrorism. This measure is employed to provide effective deterrence of the perpetrators and their dispatchers, not as a punitive measure. This practice has been reviewed and upheld by the High Court of Justice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFAHeb/MFAArchive/2004/rafiah190504|title=2BackToHomePage3|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] criticised the Israeli government's plans to demolish Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem calling the action a violation of international obligations.&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/03/04/ST2009030401707.html|title=Clinton Criticizes Israel's Eviction, Demolition Plans|last=Glenn|first=Kessler|date=2009-03-05|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent conflicts===
House demolition has been used in an on-again-off-again fashion by the Israeli government during the [[Second Intifada]]. More than 3,000 homes have been destroyed in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/english/Publications/Summaries/200411_Punitive_House_Demolitions.asp  Through No Fault of Their Own: Israel's Punitive House Demolitions in the al-Aqsa Intifada].

According to the Israeli human rights organization [[B'Tselem]]:
* From October 2001 to December 2005, Israel has demolished 668 homes as punishment, leaving 4,182 people homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[[B'Tselem]], [http://www.btselem.org/english/Punitive_Demolitions/Statistics.asp B'Tselem - House demolitions as punishment - Statistics:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a regulatory measure==
[[File:Five demolitions in East Jerusalem, January 2014 (5 2).jpg|thumb|right|Demolished 2 apartment home of the 8-member Idris family, their relative, her husband and their two children ([[Beit Hanina]], 2014)]]
[[File:Five demolitions in East Jerusalem, January 2014 (6 3).jpg|thumb|right|The Idris family collecting their belongings after the demolition. (Beit Hanina, 2014)]]
Some house demolitions are allegedly performed because the houses may have been built without permits, or are in violation of various building codes, ordinances or regulations. Some International human rights groups and community figures claim that Israeli authorities are in fact systematically denying building permit requests in Arab areas as a means of appropriating land.&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt; This is disputed by Israeli sources, who claim that both Arabs and Jews enjoy a similar rate of application approvals.&lt;ref name="JCPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jlmbldg.htm|title=Illegal Construction in Jerusalem by Justus Reid Weiner|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amnesty International, "The destruction of Palestinian homes, agricultural land and other property in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is inextricably linked with Israel’s long-standing policy of appropriating as much as possible of the land it occupies, notably by establishing Israeli settlements."&lt;ref name="Amnesty-rubble"/&gt; In October 1999, during the "Peace Process" and before the start of the Al Aqsa Intefada, Amnesty International wrote that: "well over one third of the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem live under threat of having their house demolished. ... Threatened houses exist in almost every street and it is probable that the great majority of Palestinians live in or next to a house due for demolition."&lt;ref name="Amnesty-theft"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/059/1999/en|title=Document|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"House demolitions ostensibly occur because the homes are built 'illegally' - i.e. without a permit. Officials and spokespersons of the Israeli government have consistently maintained that the demolition of Palestinian houses is based on planning considerations and is carried out according to the law. ... But the Israeli policy has been based on discrimination. Palestinians are targeted for no other reasons than that they are Palestinians. ... [Israel has] discriminated in the application of the law, strictly enforcing planning prohibitions where Palestinian houses are built and freely allowing amendments to the plans to promote development where Israelis are setting up settlements."&lt;ref name="Amnesty-theft"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. [[Meir Margalit]] of [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The thinking is that a national threat calls for a national response, invariably aggressive. Accordingly, a Jewish house without a permit is an urban problem; but a Palestinian home without a permit is a strategic threat. A Jew building without a permit is ‘cocking a snook at the law’; a Palestinian doing the same is defying Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="Icahd"&gt;Dr. [[Meir Margalit]], (2007): [http://www.icahd.org/eng/images/uploaded_admin_content/NoPlaceLikeHome_withCover.pdf ''"No Place Like Home"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925135545/http://www.icahd.org/eng/images/uploaded_admin_content/NoPlaceLikeHome_withCover.pdf |date=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current demolition issues==
{{Update|section|date=September 2015}}
{{Overly detailed|date=September 2015|section=yes}}
The Palestinian village [[Aqabah]], located in the northeastern [[West Bank]], is currently being threatened by demolition orders issued by the Israeli Civil Administration against the entire village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metimes.com/Politics/2008/05/15/the_lament_of_iqrit_and_kafr_birim/5264/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204230836/http://www.metimes.com/Politics/2008/05/15/the_lament_of_iqrit_and_kafr_birim/5264/ |archivedate=2008-12-04 |title=The lament of Iqrit and Kafr Birim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Administration had previously expropriated large areas of privately registered land in the village, and as of May 2008 it has threatened to demolish the following structures: the mosque, the [[British government]]-funded medical clinic, the internationally funded kindergarten, the Rural Women's Association building, the roads, the water tank, and nearly all private homes. According to the [[Rebuilding Alliance]], a California-based organization that opposes house demolitions, Haj Sami Sadek, the mayor of the village, has circulated an open letter asking for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rebuildingalliance.org/blog/?p=425 |title=Contact Us « Rebuilding Alliance |publisher=Rebuildingalliance.org |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rebuildingalliance.org/campaignJordanRiverValley.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013015755/http://rebuildingalliance.org/campaignJordanRiverValley.php |archivedate=2008-10-13 |title=Al Aqabah Kindergarten and their Village}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gush Shalom]], the Israeli Peace Bloc, and the [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]] are said to be supporting the campaign.

In May 2008, a UN agency said that thousands of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank risk being displaced as the Israeli authorities threaten to tear down their homes and in some cases entire communities. "To date, more than 3,000 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank have pending demolition orders, which can be immediately executed without prior warning," the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/080527/world/mideast_conflict_demolitions Israeli demolition threatens 3,000 Palestinian homes: UN - Yahoo!

===Statistics for Jerusalem===

====Demolitions====
Statistics have been compiled by ICAHD recording the number of demolitions of existing houses in the two parts of Jerusalem. According to ICAHD, there are many more building violations in the western (Jewish) parts of Jerusalem, but the great majority of actual demolitions are carried out in the eastern (Palestinian) parts. ICAHD statistics on house demolitions in Jerusalem were cited in the "2005 County Reports on Human Rights Practices" by the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref name="USStateDept"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61690.htm 2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Israel and the occupied territories], [[United States Department of State]], 8 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For 2004 and 2005 ICAHD's figures are as follows:

ICAHD's report&lt;ref name="Icahd"/&gt; further claims that building inspectors record only a small proportion of the infractions in West Jerusalem (usually illegal extensions or porches), and say that no entire residential building in the Western section has ever received demolition orders or been demolished. ICAHD claims that: "The Jerusalem Municipality expropriates land, prevents preparation of a town planning scheme for Palestinian neighborhoods, and refuses to grant building permits, '''causing''' a severe housing shortage, '''forcing''' residents to build without a permit, '''after which''' the Ministry of Interior and the Municipality demolish the houses, '''so''' the residents move into homes outside the city, '''and then''' the Ministry of Interior revokes their residency and banishes them from the city forever".&lt;ref name="Beit"&gt;[http://www.icahd.org/eng/articles.asp?menu=6&amp;submenu=5&amp;story=32 Chronology of Permit Applications, Demolitions &amp; Rebuilding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524005506/http://www.icahd.org/eng/articles.asp?menu=6&amp;submenu=5&amp;story=32 |date=2007-05-24 }} ICAHD, Oct. 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

ICAHD's conclusions have been disputed by the Israeli [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], who argue on their website that the larger number of Palestinian demolitions is simply because many more Palestinian homes have been built illegally. They claim to have "document[ed] a pattern of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated behavior and criminal profiteering that characterizes much of the construction in the Arab sector of the Holy City",&lt;ref name="JCPA"/&gt; notwithstanding the punitive house demolitions, which have been effective as a [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] against [[terrorism]] by means of a 'significant decrease' Palestinian terrorists attacks.&lt;ref name=EffectfulTerroristsHomeDemolitions /&gt;

Though the statistics do not show the nationality of the permit requestee nor the nationality of the land owner, CAMERA argues that these figures show that the denial of permits to Arabs and Jews is not based on the ethnicity of the applicant, but instead is generally meant to uphold Israeli master plans and building codes.&lt;ref name="Camera"&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=38&amp;x_article=1288 Washington Post Watch] CAMERA, February, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Amnesty International highlight in these figures the small number of Palestinian permit requests (only about 10 percent of the Israeli requests), and argue that this is indicative of the tiny (and ever-shrinking) percentage of land that the Palestinians have available for their use.&lt;ref name="Amnesty-theft"/&gt; In 2008 Nicoletta Dimova wrote in the [[Palestine-Israel Journal]] that "today, the city's Palestinians are only allowed to build on about 9% of the 17,600 acres of land comprising East Jerusalem",&lt;ref name="Dimova"&gt;[http://www.pij.org/current.php?id=68 When Ideology Leads to Destruction: Home Demolitions in East Jerusalem] [[Palestine-Israel Journal]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the remainder having been expropriated by Israeli authorities for use by Israeli settlers or as land where Israel currently permits no construction.

===Area C===
According to [[B'tselem]], since the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] Israel has issued over 14,600 demolition orders for Palestinian infrastructure, of which it has destroyed roughly 2,925. In the period 2000-2012, Palestinian were given only 211 permits to build, from 2009-2012, only 27 permits were given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/download/201306_area_c_report_eng.pdf ''Acting the Landlord: Israel's Policy in Area C, the West Bank,''] [[B'tselem]] June 2013  p.19&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, according to Ma'an News Agency, citing  Bimkom, only one such permit was issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=765324 'Israel's West Bank housing policy by numbers,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 10 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

In 2005, the Israeli government demolished many houses of Israeli settlers who were transferred in accordance with the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]]. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said this was done by request of the Palestinian Authorities.&lt;ref name="IMFA-SETTLER-DEMOLITIONS"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/The+demolition+of+Gaza+settlement+homes+16-Aug-2005.htm  The demolition of Gaza settlement homes - Background brief], Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website .

In February 2017, Israeli forces began an operation to evacuate settlers from the West Bank outpost of [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]] after the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Supreme Court]] stated that it must be demolished by 8 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/01/israeli-forces-begin-evacuation-west-bank-outpost-residents/|title=Israeli forces begin evacuation of West Bank outpost as residents barricade in their homes|website=The Telegraph|date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of films whose running time exceeds 300 minutes (five hours).

==Experimental films==

While most cinematic films have a broad theatrical release in multiple locations through normal distribution channels, some of the longest films are experimental in nature or created for art gallery installations, having never been simultaneously released to multiple screens or intended for mainstream audiences. They may have been shown in venues where audiences were only expected to view a portion of the film during its screening.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14012">[[File:LouisianaStateMuseumNewOrleansLA.JPG|thumb|Louisiana State Museum, [[The Presbytere]].]]
The '''Louisiana State Museum (LSM)''', founded in [[New Orleans]] in 1906, is a statewide system of [[National Historic Landmark]]s and modern structures across [[Louisiana]], housing thousands of artifacts and works of art reflecting Louisiana's legacy of historic events and cultural diversity.

==Overview==
The Louisiana State Museum system has its beginnings in the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in 1904 at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. A large number of pertinent artifacts were gathered to be displayed at Louisiana's exhibition at this fair. After the Exposition, it was decided that this collection should be stored, expanded, and displayed. The Louisiana State Museum was established in 1906 to fulfill this role. The [[Presbytere]] and the [[The Cabildo|Cabildo]] buildings, located on either side of the [[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|St. Louis Cathedral]] on [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], were some of the first properties that the Louisiana State Museum was lodged in. The Louisiana State Museum now has thirteen properties around the state: historic structures, museums open to the public, and modern purpose-built buildings.

Over the past 100-plus years, the Louisiana State Museum has not only operated museums and maintained buildings, but it has served as the repository for all things historic from the state’s past. As Louisiana has been part of a French colony, a Spanish colony, Napoleon’s short-lived property, the United States' [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory, and finally the [[U.S. state|state]] of Louisiana; the Louisiana State Museum’s collections of artifacts and documents are an important asset for understanding state, national, and even global history.

In addition to protecting and preserving Louisiana’s historic artifacts and buildings, the Louisiana State Museum is proactive in many areas concerning the state’s unique culture and history. Several new museum sites have opened in the last ten years or so, including the [[Wedell-Williams Aviation &amp; Cypress Sawmill Museum - Patterson]] location, the Performing Arts Center at the [[New Orleans Mint]], the [[Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge]], and the [[Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Northwest Louisiana History Museum – Natchitoches]]. In addition to opening new facilities, the State Museum is continually creating new temporary and permanent exhibits, bringing to light intriguing topics from Louisiana’s culture and history. The Museum hosts an array of programs such as lecture series, school group educational tours, walking tours of historic districts, and musical performances.

Numerous organizations exist throughout Louisiana to support the Museum including the Louisiana Museum Foundation, Friends of the Cabildo, Friends of the Capitol Park Museum, Wedell-Williams and Cypress Sawmill Foundation, Friends of Louisiana Sports and History, and Friends of the E.D. White Historic Site.

==Sites in the French Quarter, New Orleans==
[[File:NewOrleans200212 2107.jpg|thumbnail|2nd Floor gallery of [[the Cabildo]], 10 flags over Louisiana]]

* '''[[New Orleans Mint]]''' - A United States Mint built under the direction of President Andrew Jackson in 1835. It was the only U.S. Mint to ever mint under a flag other than that of the United States, as it briefly minted coins for the Confederacy. The building also served as a federal prison and a Coast Guard depot before becoming a Louisiana State Museum. There is a permanent exhibit on the Mint's coining operations, exhibits on Louisiana music on the 2nd floor, a Performing Arts Center on the 3rd floor, and the Louisiana Historical Center and archives on the 3rd floor. [http://louisianastatemuseum.org/museums/the-old-us-mint/ Official website]

* '''[[Madame John's Legacy]]''' - A building of historic significance because it escaped the [[Great New Orleans Fire (1794)]], which leveled much of New Orleans, the house is actually a product of the preceding fire of 1788. The structures on the site in the early 1780s were partially destroyed by that conflagration and the current structure was rebuilt in the same French colonial fashion six months later.

The '''Punta Culebra Nature Center''' is a visitor center located in [[Panama City]], on one of the islands connected by the [[Amador Causeway]]. It is operated by the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]], also located in [[Panamá]]. The center focuses mainly on [[marine and terrestrial science and education, conservation and interpretation of marine coastal environments in the [[tropics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stri.si.edu/english/visit_us/culebra/index.php |title=What Is the Punta Culebra Nature Center? |publisher=STRI |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among its attractions, the Fabulous Frogs of Panama, a touch tank with equinoderms and trutles are some of the [[exhibits]] found in Punta Culebra. A [[trail]] to a stretch of [[tropical dry forest]] is also part of the attractions where free roaming animals such as raccoons, sloths, green iguanas and beautiful birds and butterflies can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/panama/panama-city/sights/museum/centro-exhibiciones-marinas |title=Lonely Planet review for Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas. |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MediaMan''' is a general purpose collection organizer software for establishing a personal database of media collections (DVDs, CDs, books, etc.) developed by [[He Shiming]].

Debuted in 2004 as freeware, MediaMan is the first software in its genre to create the concept of general purpose organizer, as people usually have to pay two licenses for a book organizer and a video organizer.

The license of MediaMan was freeware until late 2006, when the author decided to switch to shareware with a price of $39.95 for each license.

[[Amazon Web Services]] (later called E-Commerce Service and Product Advertising API) was used to retrieve product information automatically during the import process in MediaMan, which means it is also a part of the Amazon Associates program. However, the latest version of MediaMan (v3.10 series) no longer uses this API due to the efficiency guidelines introduced in October 2010.

MediaMan is also known as a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] alternative to [[Mac OS X|Mac OS X's]] [[Delicious Library]].

Software development seems to have stalled with the last release of a beta of MediaMan 4.0 back in December 2013.  There have been a growing number of bugs in the software that has made the program unusable for some.  Communications with the developer have stopped, development and bug fixes have ceased, and the site has gone offline.

'''Migration museums''' cover [[human migration]] in the past, present and future.

The current trend in the development of migration museums, named differently worldwide, is an interesting phenomenon, as it may contribute to the creation of a new and multiple identity, at an individual and collective level. The [[United States]] with [[Ellis Island]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and more recently several [[Europe]]an countries — e.g., [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] — have been creating such venues to facilitate transmission between generations as well as encounters between migrants and the host populations, by telling their personal story.

While these initiatives also serve the duty to remember, they seem to have three main objectives: ''Acknowledge, integrate and build awareness''

* ''Acknowledge'': The contributions made by migrants to their host societies; the diversity and wealth of the origin cultures and; the right to a dual-belonging.
* ''Include and Integrate'': Foster the sense of belonging; enable the communities to feel as an integral part of the nation; find common ground and contribute to a national identity.
* ''Build awareness and educate'' on the events that induced individuals — and refugees in particular — to leave their land, thus developing empathy among the host population. More generally, deconstruct stereotypes on immigration.

Given the international scene and the latest events, from the Van Gogh affair in the Netherlands in 2004 to the so-called ‘crise des banlieues’ in France in 2005there is an urgent need to give the migrant generations (the youth as well as their parents) a voice, in order to foster inclusion, integration and the right to difference. Listening to individual stories may help to deconstruct stereotypes. Memory, History and Narration may also allow to take a step back and to consider the complete picture.

Migration museums also face common challenges, in that they intend to be not only a venue for conservation and exhibition, but also and above all a lively meeting place. The challenge is not so much to bring in the intellectuals, academics, researchers, historians, traditional visitors of museums (the converted) but to attract the general public, those with preconceived ideas on immigration and the migrants themselves.

In addition to the following list, there are many local heritage initiatives and smaller museums which have increasingly focused on migration as a part of the narrative they portray.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20458">[[File:PTV024.jpg|thumb|The [[Petit Trianon]] in 2005 seen from the direction of the Temple de l'Amour.]]
The '''Moberly–Jourdain incident''' (also '''the Ghosts of Petit Trianon''' or '''Versailles''', {{lang-fr|les fantômes du Trianon}} / ''les fantômes de Versailles'') is a claim of [[time travel]] and [[list of reportedly haunted locations|hauntings]] made by [[Charlotte Anne Moberly]] (1846–1937) and [[Eleanor Jourdain]] (1863–1924).

In 1911, Moberly and Jourdain published a book entitled ''An Adventure'' under the names of "Elizabeth Morison" and "Frances Lamont". Their book describes a visit they made to the ''[[Petit Trianon]]'', a small ''château'' in the grounds of the [[Palace of Versailles]] where they claimed to have seen the gardens as they had been in the late eighteenth century as well as [[ghost]]s, including [[Marie Antoinette]] and others. Their story caused a sensation and was subject to much ridicule.

== Background ==
[[File:Charlotte Anne Moberly.jpg|thumb|upright|Charlotte Anne Moberly]]
Moberly, born in 1846, was the tenth of fifteen children.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_27"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She came from a professional background; her father, [[George Moberly]], was the headmaster of [[Winchester College]] and later [[Bishop of Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deuchar|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|Harrison|1869|p=4637}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 Moberly became the first Principal of a hall of residence for young women, [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St. Hugh's College]] in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quare|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It became apparent that Moberly needed someone to help run the college, and Jourdain was asked to become Moberly's assistant.&lt;ref name=Farson18 /&gt;

[[File:EleanorJourdain2.jpg|thumb|upright|Eleanor Jourdain]]
Jourdain, born in 1863, was the eldest of ten children.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_64"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, the Reverend Francis Jourdain, was the vicar of [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] in [[Derbyshire]]. She was the sister of art historian [[Margaret Jourdain]] and mathematician [[Philip Jourdain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She went to school in [[Manchester]], unlike most girls of the time who were educated at home.&lt;ref name=Farson18&gt;{{harvnb|Farson|1978|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jourdain was also the author of several textbooks, ran a school of her own, and after the incident became the vice-Principal of St. Hugh's College.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_80"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Jourdain was appointed, it was decided that the two women should get to know one another better; Jourdain owned an apartment in [[Paris]] where she tutored English children, and so Moberly went to stay with her.&lt;ref name=Farson18 /&gt;

== Claims ==
According to Moberly and Jourdain, the two women decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they travelled by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it,&lt;ref name=Farson18 /&gt; so they decided to walk through the gardens to the ''[[Petit Trianon]]''.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_127"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the way, they reached the ''[[Grand Trianon]]'' and found it was closed to the public.&lt;ref name=Farson18 /&gt;

They travelled with a [[Baedeker]] guidebook, but the two women soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue, ''Allée des Deux Trianons''. They passed this road, and entered a lane, where unknown to them they passed their destination.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_127"/&gt; Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window&lt;ref name="Iremonger_128"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse, outside of which was an old plough.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_128"/&gt;

At this point they claimed that a feeling of oppression and dreariness came over them.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_128_129"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|pp=128–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners, who told them to go straight on. Moberly later described the men as "very dignified officials, dressed in long greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats."&lt;ref name="qtd_Castle_193"&gt;qtd. in {{harvnb|Castle|1995|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jourdain noticed a cottage with a woman and a girl in the doorway. The woman was holding out a jug to the girl.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_128"/&gt; Jourdain described it as a "''tableau vivant''", a living picture, much like [[Madame Tussauds]] waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: "Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless, like wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees."&lt;ref name="qtd_Castle_194"&gt;qtd. in {{harvnb|Castle|1995|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comte de Vaudreuil2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Joseph Hyacinthe François de Paule de Rigaud, Comte de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] was later suggested as a candidate for the man with the marked face allegedly seen by Moberly and Jourdain.]]

They reached the edge of a wood, close to the ''[[Temple de l'Amour]]'', and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_129"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moberly, his appearance was "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough."&lt;ref name="Moberly"&gt;{{harvnb|Moberly|Jourdain|1989|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jourdain noted "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by [[smallpox]]; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him.&lt;ref name="Moberly"/&gt; A man later described as "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" came up to them, and showed them the way to the ''Petit Trianon''.&lt;ref name=Farson20&gt;{{harvnb|Farson|1978|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller - Queen Marie Antoinette of France and two of her Children Walking in The Park of Trianon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Antoinette by [[Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller|Wertmüller]]. The figure that Moberly saw near the Petit Trianon was claimed to bear a resemblance to the Queen as depicted in this painting]]
After crossing a bridge, they reached the gardens in front of the palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_130"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_181"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, they were directed round to the entrance and joined a party of other visitors.&lt;ref name=Farson22&gt;{{harvnb|Farson|1978|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After touring the house, they had tea at the ''Hotel des Reservoirs'' before returning to Jourdain's apartment.

== Aftermath ==
After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly mentioned the incident to one another until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister&lt;ref name=Farson22 /&gt; and when she got to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the ''Petit Trianon'' was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford,&lt;ref name="Iremonger_131"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the [[Tuileries]] palace in Paris was [[10 August (French Revolution)|besieged]], the king's [[Swiss guard]]s were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.&lt;!-- WP:SYNTH citation of: {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/boyle-goethe2.html |title=Goethe |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}--&gt;

They visited the Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but were unable to trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying to come up with an explanation, they wondered if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon.&lt;ref name=Farson22 /&gt; During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.

Convinced that the grounds were haunted, they decided to publish their findings in a book ''An Adventure'' (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously on the grounds of the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by [[Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick]] in the Proceedings of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The review is reprinted in {{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|pp=146–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Dena; Kaiser, Thomas E. (2003). ''Marie Antoinette: Writings on the Body of a Queen''. Routledge. p. 231. {{ISBN|0-415-93394-3}} "Mrs. Sidgwick's anonymous review appeared in the June 1911 supplement to The Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_197"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of the authors of ''An Adventure'' was not made public until 1931.

Both women are reported to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_41_97-103"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|pp=41, 97–103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of them, Moberly claimed to have seen in the Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed by anybody else.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_42"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_92"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 in the middle of an academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff.&lt;ref name="Iremonger_105"&gt;{{harvnb|Iremonger|1975|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moberly died in 1937.

The story of the adventure was made into a [[TV movie]], ''[[Miss Morison's Ghosts]]'', in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;''cf''. &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{IMDb title|0124008|Miss Morison's Ghosts}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Dame Wendy Hiller]] as Moberly/Morison. The BBC broadcast a 90-minute radio dramatization in 2004 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miss Morison's Ghosts |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b060bn9s |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some explanations ==
[[File:Blanche Robert de Montesquiou.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Robert de Montesquiou]]
In addition to the explanation by the women that they had been caught up in what is now called a [[time travel|time slip]] and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by [[Philippe Jullian]] in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet [[Robert de Montesquiou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jullian|1967|pp=140–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1976|pp=33–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the history of the Moberly-Jourdain adventure and the extensive public reaction to it, [[Terry Castle]] noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a [[lesbian]] [[folie à deux]] between the two women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castle|1991|pp=741–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.

Without fully endorsing the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published versions of the ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously been published in the second, small print-run, edition of ''An Adventure'' in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, M. H. (Ed.) ''The Ghosts of the Trianon''. Aquarian Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Leonard Zusne]] suggested that incident was a "hallucinatory experience" that was embellished over time by information gathered after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (2014 edition). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. p. 195. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] of [[Skeptoid]] researched much of the evidence and concluded that "Moberly and Jourdain were simply human" and were mistaken. He notes that in the second edition of ''An Adventure'', it is revealed that Moberly did not mention the sketching woman until three months after their visit to Versailles, while Jourdain did not remember such a thing, and that Moberly did not remember much of what Jourdain described. "It was only after much discussion, note-sharing, and historical research that Moberly and Jourdain came up with the time period as 1789 and assigned identities to a few of the characters they saw, including Marie Antoinette herself as the lady sketching on the lawn."&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4296|number=296|title= The Versailles Time Slip|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Evans (art historian)|Dame Joan Evans]], who owned the copyright to ''An Adventure'', accepted the Jullian explanation and forbade any further editions. However, after the work came out of [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|copyright]], it was republished in 1988 as ''The Ghosts of Trianon: The Complete 'An Adventure''' by Thoth Publication and again in 2008 by CreateSpace, both times crediting Moberly and Jourdain as the authors.

Historian [[Roy Strong]] has noted that although the Moberly-Jourdain story has been debunked it "retained its hold on the public imagination for half a century."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Roy. (1991). ''A Celebration of Gardens''. Timber Press. p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">The '''Palestinian Declaration of Independence''' is a statement written by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]] and proclaimed by [[Yasser Arafat]] on 15 November 1988 (5 [[Rabi' al-Thani]] 1409). It had previously&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok,[https://books.google.com/books?id=3pjYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105 ''The Palestinian State: A Jewish Justification,''] Impress Books, 2012 p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; been adopted by the [[Palestinian National Council]], the legislative body of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), by a vote of 253 in favour 46 against and 10 abstentions. It was read at the closing session of the 19th Palestinian National Council to a standing ovation.&lt;ref name=Sayighp624&gt;Sayigh, 1999, p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing the reading of the declaration, Arafat, as [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization]] assumed the title of "President of Palestine."&lt;ref name=Silverburg198&gt;Silverburg, 2002, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1989, the [[PLO Central Council]] elected Yasser Arafat the first [[President of the State of Palestine]].&lt;ref name=lansford_p1628&gt;Tom Lansford, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iC_VBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1628 ''Political Handbook of the World 2014''], p. 1628. CQ Press, March 2014.&lt;br /&gt;
"On April 2, 1989, the PLO's Central Council unanimously elected Arafat president of the self-proclaimed Palestinian state and designated Faruk Qaddumi as foreign minister ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 28 October 1974, the [[1974 Arab League summit]] held in [[Rabat]] designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the [[Palestinian people]] and reaffirmed their right to establish an independent state of urgency."&lt;ref name="al -Madfai"&gt;Madiha Rashid al Madfai, ''Jordan, the United States and the Middle East Peace Process, 1974-1991'', Cambridge Middle East Library, Cambridge University Press (1993). {{ISBN|0-521-41523-3}}. p 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal justification for the declaration was based on [[United Nations General Assembly]] [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181 (II)]] of 29 November 1947, which provided for the termination and partition of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] into [[Two-state solution|two states]]. On 14 May 1948 the British mandate ended, the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|State of Israel was declared]] and the [[Arab Legion]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] (later [[Jordan]]) invaded the West Bank (only to [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annex]] it in 1950). In September 1948 [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian forces captured the Gaza strip and kept it under military rule]]. Until the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 these two territories remained under Jordanian and Egyptian rule.

Despite the 1988 proclamation of the [[State of Palestine]], at the time the Palestine Liberation Organization did not exercise control over any territory,&lt;ref name=Zartmanp43&gt;Berchovitch and Zartman, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1cqjpHmhTZsC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22state+of+palestine%22+%22recognition%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22state%20of%20palestine%22%20%22recognition%22&amp;f=false p. 43].&lt;/ref&gt; and designated [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of Palestine,{{ref label|capital|i|}}&lt;ref name=Pagep161&gt;Baroud in Page, 2004, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; which was under Israeli control and claimed by it as [[Jerusalem Law|Israel's capital]]. The PLO was hence a [[government in exile]] between 1988 and 1994.

The PLO began to exercise a limited rule in the [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Areas A and B of the West Bank]] and part of the Gaza Strip as a consequence of the 1994 [[Gaza-Jericho Agreement]], under the umbrella of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In 2012, Palestine was upgraded to the status of non-member observer state in the UN.

==Significance==
[[File:1947-UN-Partition-Plan-1949-Armistice-Comparison.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Map comparing the borders of the 1947 partition plan and the armistice of 1949.|{{Partition Plan-Armistice Lines comparison map legend}}]]

The declaration concerned the [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] region, as defined by the borders of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], which includes the whole of the State of Israel as well as the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza strip]] (at the time part of the [[Israeli Civil Administration]]). It references the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] of 1947 and "UN resolutions since 1947" in general as providing legitimacy to Palestinian statehood.

The Partition Plan served as the basis for [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|Israel's declaration of independence]], but was not accepted by the Palestinian Arab leadership at the time. Though, in September 1948, the [[All-Palestine Government]] was declared within the Gaza Strip as an Egyptian protectorate and recognized by most members of the Arab League, which is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state; All-Palestine had however been dissolved by Egypt several years later. The 1988 declaration does not explicitly recognize the [[State of Israel]]. However, an accompanying document&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm Political Statement accompanying the Palestinian Declaration of Independence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420191313/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm |date=2001-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that explicitly mentions [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], and [[Yasser Arafat]]'s statements in Geneva a month later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/focus/mideast/arafat88-en|title=Yasser Arafat, Speech at UN General Assembly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were accepted by the United States as sufficient to interpret the declaration as recognizing Israel in its pre-1967 boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The declaration's reference to Palestine being the "land of the three monotheistic faiths" has been held as recognising the Jewish historical connection to the land, instead of arguing that Jews are colonists and foreigners in the land. Referring to "the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their [[right to self-determination]]," the declaration recalled the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923) and [[UN General Assembly Resolution 181]] as supporting the rights of Palestinians and Palestine. The declaration then proclaims a "State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory with its capital [[Jerusalem]]".&lt;ref name=Silverburgp42&gt;Silverburg, 2002, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quigleyp212/&gt; The borders of the state are not specified. The population of the state was referred to by the statement: "The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinians wherever they may be". The state was defined as an Arab country by the statement: "The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the [[Arab nation]]".

==Consequences==
The declaration was accompanied by a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]]. This call was later termed "the Historic Compromise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carim.org/public/polsoctexts/PS2PAL005_EN.pdf |title=The Historic Compromise: The Palestinian Declaration of Independence and the Twenty-Year Struggle for a Two-State Solution |author=PLO Negotiations Affairs Department |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022554/http://www.carim.org/public/polsoctexts/PS2PAL005_EN.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it implied acceptance of the "two-state solution", namely that it no longer questioned the legitimacy of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name=Quigleyp212&gt;Quigley, 2005, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The PNC's political communiqué accompanying the declaration called only for withdrawal from "[[East Jerusalem|Arab Jerusalem]]" and the other "Arab territories occupied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm Political communique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420191313/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal4.htm |date=2001-04-20 }} Palestine National Council.

As a result of the declaration, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) convened, inviting Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the PLO to give an address. [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/177]] was adopted "acknowledging the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988," and it was further decided that "the designation 'Palestine' should be used in place of the designation 'Palestine Liberation Organization' in the [[United Nations]] system." One hundred and four states voted for this resolution, forty-four abstained, and two - the [[United States]] and [[Israel]] - voted against.&lt;ref name=Quigley&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 6, 2009 |title=THE PALESTINE DECLARATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT: THE STATEHOOD ISSUE |url=http://www.lawrecord.com/files/35-rutgers-l-rec-1.pdf |publisher=Rutgers Law Record |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143235/http://www.lawrecord.com/files/35-rutgers-l-rec-1.pdf |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-December, 75 states had recognised Palestine, rising to 93 states by February 1989.&lt;ref name=Kassimp49&gt;The Palestine Yearbook of International Law; Kassim, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LoRru2_pAkQC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=state+recognition+palestine+89+1988&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 49].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2014, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted down a resolution demanding the end of Israeli occupation and Palestinian statehood by 2017. Eight members voted for the Resolution (Russia, China, France, Argentina, Chad, Chile, Jordan, Luxembourg). However the resolution did not get the minimum of nine votes needed to pass the resolution.

|{{note|capital}}The Palestine Basic Law, approved by the PLC in May 2002, states unambiguously "Jerusalem is the Capital of Palestine" (source: [http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/2002-basic-law]). [[Ramallah]] is the administrative capital where government institutions and foreign representative offices of [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]] [[Colombia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], and [[Switzerland]] are located. Jerusalem's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20060514191731/http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/IPPP/Fall97Report/negotiating_jerusalem.htm "Negotiating Jerusalem", University of Maryland]). The [[United Nations]] and most countries do not accept Israel's claim over the whole of Jerusalem (see {{harvnb|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}) and maintain their embassies to Israel in other cities (see the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook]).

The '''Russian Museum of Ethnography''' (Российский этнографический музей) is a [[museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] that houses a collection of about 500,000 items relating to the [[ethnography]], or [[cultural anthropology]], of peoples of the former [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;

The museum was set up in 1902 as the ethnographic department of the [[Russian Museum]]. It is housed in a purpose-built [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] building erected between 1902 and 1913 to [[Vasily Svinyin]]'s design in the proximity of the [[Old Michael Palace]] (which accommodates the art collection of the Russian Museum). It occupies the place of the eastern service wing, the stables and the laundry of the palace. 

The museum's first exhibits were the gifts received by the Russian Tsars from peoples of Imperial Russia. These were supplemented by regular expeditions to various parts of the Russian Empire which began in 1901. Further exhibits were purchased by [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and other members of his family (as state financing was not enough to purchase new exhibits). A collection of [[Buddhist]] religious objects was acquired for the museum by Prince [[Esper Ukhtomsky]]. [[Vyacheslav Tenishev|Prince Tenishev]], a wealthy industrialist, donated to the museum the archives of his private ethnographic bureau that had been documenting the life of Russian peasants since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/article.php?kod=2804034543 The Encyclopaedia of St. Petersburg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection was not officially opened to the general public until 1923 and was not detached from the Russian Museum until 1934. When the [[Museum of the Peoples of the USSR]] in [[Moscow]] (successor to the [[Dashkov Museum]]) was shut down in 1948, its collections were transferred to the Ethnographic Museum in Leningrad.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt; This museum should not be confused with the much older Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, popularly known as the [[Kunstkamera]].

'''Smithsonian Affiliations''' is a division of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] that establishes long-term partnerships with non-Smithsonian [[museums]] and educational and cultural organizations, in order to share collections, exhibitions and educational strategies and conduct joint research.

Partner organizations are known as "'''Smithsonian Affiliates'''" and are allowed to use the tag line "In Association with the Smithsonian Institution" and the approved Smithsonian Affiliations logo on their website, programming, and marketing material.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Affiliations Program Overview."&gt;{{cite web|title=Smithsonian Affiliations Program Overview|url=https://affiliations.si.edu/DetailPage.Asp?MenuID=44|work=Article|publisher=Smithsonian Affiliations|accessdate= 20 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit or publicly operated educational entity can apply to become a Smithsonian Affiliate.&lt;ref name="refname1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smithsonian Affiliations Fact Sheet|url=https://affiliations.si.edu/DetailPage.Asp?|work=Article|publisher=Smithsonian Affiliations|accessdate= 20 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Smithsonian Affiliations program was established in 1996 by Smithsonian Secretary [[I. Michael Heyman]] with the approval of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, in response to several challenges the Institution faced at the time: a decrease in federal funding, limited storage space for expanding collections, and the need to make the Institution more reflective of the nation without operating additional museums outside of [[Washington, D.C.]] &lt;ref name="refname4"&gt;{{cite speech|last=Heyman|first=I. Michael|date=17 May 1996|event=American Law Institute Luncheon. Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D.C|location=Smithsonian Institution Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution===
In 1993, the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution introduced the first proposal for initiatives promoting strategic, collections-based partnerships at the Institution.  The Commission, composed of 22 members appointed by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, was charged with examining the Institution's ability to uphold [[James Smithson]]'s vision of an organization dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge" despite a changing society and increasing financial hardships. Of the four initiatives proposed by the Commission: Educate More of the Nation's People; Collections, Research and Exhibitions; Governance; and Assure the Future, two directly called for the creation of strategic partnerships and making artifacts in the collections accessible to other museums.&lt;ref name=CommisionoftheFurtureoftheSmithsonianReport&gt;{{cite web|title= E Pluribus Unum: This Divine Paradox Report on the Commission of the Future of the Smithsonian Institution|url=http://sirismm.si.edu/siahistory/pdfs/strategic_plans/1995_Report_of_the_Commission_on_the_Future_of_SI001.pdf|work=Report|publisher=Smithsonian Press|accessdate=20 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''To Educate More of the Nation's People''': "Build [[collaborative partnerships]] with other museums, research centers, and educational institutions throughout the nation."&lt;ref name="CommisionoftheFurtureoftheSmithsonianReport" /&gt;

'''Collections, Research and Exhibitions''':  "Shape a master plan for maintenance of the priceless collections, including the sharing of collections through long-term or permanent loans to partner institutions."&lt;ref name="CommisionoftheFurtureoftheSmithsonianReport" /&gt;

Significant emphasis was placed on the benefits that partnerships with outside museums would create for the Institution.  By dispersing artifacts to museums in a responsible way, the Commission believed it, "could make the Institution more reflective of our nation… [as well as] address the problem of storing, curating, studying, and exhibiting the constantly growing collections."&lt;ref name="CommisionoftheFurtureoftheSmithsonianReport" /&gt;

===Creating Smithsonian Affiliations===
In 1996, during his second year as Secretary, Heyman observed several challenges facing the Institution.  Closely aligned with the announcements presented by the "Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution" in 1993, Heyman was faced with the challenges of dwindling storage for expanding collections, decreasing funds, and the need to reinforce the Smithsonian's identity as the nation's museum.  In addition, the Institution began to see increased interest from outside museums for partnerships and loans of artifacts that extended beyond standing practices.  Although collaborative agreements in the form of traveling exhibitions, joint exhibition sponsorship, and loans had been entered in the past by different Smithsonian museums, no infrastructure existed to provide institution-wide oversight and coordination of such partnerships. Heyman responded to these challenges by creating the Smithsonian Affiliations program to oversee and manage collections-based partnerships with other museums.  As stated by the minutes from the Smithsonian Board of Regents meeting housed in the [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]], the program was formally approved by the Board of Regents on September 15, 1996.

Using the occasion of the Smithsonian Institution's 150th Anniversary, Smithsonian Affiliations was one of several outreach initiatives introduced by Heyman to expand the Institution's reach nationally.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former College Trustee Heyman ‘51 dies at 81|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2011/11/28/news/heyman|work=Article|publisher=The Dartmouth|accessdate=30 Oct 2012|archive-url=http://archive.is/hf3R7|archive-date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the Affiliations program, the Institution became more accessible through its presence on the [[World Wide Web]] and through the largest traveling exhibition Smithsonian ever mounted, ''America's Smithsonian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Smithsonian Exhibition|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/general-history|work=Article|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=21 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary Heyman made formal announcements about the Affiliations program while delivering opening remarks for the Smithsonian's ''150th Birthday Party on the Mall'' and in a number of cities for the opening of ''America's Smithsonian'':

"The Smithsonian of the future must provide access to its collections and its vast resources.  There is no value in being just the largest if we do not share the Smithsonian with as many people as possible.  It means making sure those who cannot travel to Washington can somehow experience and enjoy the Smithsonian." – Secretary I. Michael Heyman &lt;ref name="refname9"&gt;{{cite speech|last=Heyman|first=I. Michael|date=10 August 1996|event=Smithsonian's 150th Anniversary, Washington, D.C.|location=Smithsonian Institution Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of the program===
The program was received by museums across the country.  The end of the fiscal year 1997 recognized 21 organizations as Affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;1997 Smithsonian Institution Annual Report, p. 55. Smithsonian Institution Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there are over 200 Affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://affiliations.si.edu/about-us/affiliate-directory/|title=Smithsonian Affiliates|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enterprise-D bridge.jpg|thumb|USS ''Enterprise'' D bridge replica in ''Star Trek: The Exhibition''.]]
'''''Star Trek: The Exhibition''''' is a traveling [[museum]] exhibit of ''[[Star Trek]]'' items and memorabilia.  The exhibition includes items used in the films and TV series such as props, costumes, set components and full-scale replicas of the Enterprise bridge.  Other comprehensive features of the exhibit including a complete time line, showing major events in the Star Trek Universe and how all of the various series and movies relate to one another chronologically, as well as a motion simulator ride.

Originally premiering as a single large exhibition '''''Star Trek: The Tour''''' under management of SEE Touring, financial complications arose when the show was packed up at the Queen Mary in Long Beach and the venue held onto the exhibits until it was settled by Plainfield Asset Management acquiring the entire exhibition under undisclosed terms.&lt;ref name="thetour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/230508_05.shtml|title='STAR TREK THE TOUR' TO TOUR AGAIN|last=T'Bonz|work=Trek Today|date=May 23, 2008|accessdate=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was split into two separate and smaller exhibitions which would display simultaneously in two locations.&lt;ref name="split"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080620/news_1m20trek.html|title=Museum sets course for the final frontier|last=Stele|first=Jeanette|work=Union Tribune San Diego|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They both feature a bridge recreation, one version of the exhibit includes the bridge from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and another replicates the ''Enterprise'' bridge from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

Photography is not permitted of any items in the exhibit, and staff are present around the set to ensure that rule is enforced.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Stone Cottage''' and '''The Smokehouse''' are two exhibit buildings at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==Stone Cottage==
[[Image:Stone Cottage, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Stone Cottage&lt;/center&gt;]]
Built about 1840 in [[South Burlington, Vermont]], '''Stone Cottage''' originally functioned as home to a family of five, including two children and an elderly parent. In later years the building served first as a school and then as a blacksmith shop. Constructed of [[limestone]], the cottage’s stone exterior was laid in straight courses rather than in the more common scatterstone technique, creating lending the exterior walls an even, harmonious pattern.

==Relocation==
When the [[Shelburne Museum]] purchased the cottage in 1947, only the exterior shell remained. When the Museum moved the structure to the grounds two years later, staff members numbered each stone individually before transporting the cottage piece by piece to reassemble it in its present location. By luck a direct descendant of the original occupants heard about the project. Her recollections of the interior enabled Museum staff to duplicate the original floor plan and furnishings, including the wrought-iron door latch that she had removed years before when the building began to slip into ruin. The restoration of the cottage made use of old beams and materials from local abandoned barns and homes. The furniture, textiles, and household goods exhibited in Stone Cottage evoke the simple lifestyle of agricultural workers in the mid-19th century.

==The Smokehouse==
{{coord|44|22|39.83|N|73|13|47.03|W|region:US}}

[[Smokehouse]]s, similar to the one behind Stone Cottage, which was built in [[Charlotte, Vermont]] in 1820, were a staple of American farm life and remained in common use until the late 19th century. Typically small stone structures with dirt floors, smokehouses possessed a confined interior chamber that enabled farmers to easily preserve meat. As such, the major structural requirement of a smokehouse was that the building be airtight, although chimneys and small vents were sometimes installed to regulate the density of smoke. Traditionally, farmers would soak butchered cuts in [[brine]] and then hang them in their smokehouse above a smoldering fire of corncobs and hickory wood, giving the meat its distinctive flavor. Meats remained in place for several days, or sometimes weeks, to complete the process.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections.

'''''The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis''''' is a 15th-century [[chronicle]] which reports the murder of [[James I of Scotland]] and its aftermath, including the execution of his killers. The chronicle was, according to a note in one of the manuscripts, originally written in Latin and then translated by John Shirley.&lt;ref name="Matheson 12"&gt;Matheson 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gloucester-Talbot-Shrewsbury-Book.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] from [[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]] c. 1445]]

===Manuscripts===
Three manuscripts have the text, two from the 15th century ([[British Library|BL]] Additional MSS. 38690 and 5467) and one from the 17th century ([[Advocates Library|National Library of Scotland Advocates]] MS 17.1.22, likely a copy of BL Add. 38690).&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In BL Add. 38690, originally a roll which was later cut into an 18-page manuscript, it occupies fols. 9–15, written in the same hand as the first three items (one a "complaint" by [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] read in parliament, the other two documents pertaining to the release of [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In BL Add. 5467, a 224-page manuscript that includes texts on horticulture and cooking, it occupies fols. 72v-84v.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The third is a late 17th-century manuscript, with ''The Dethe'' on fols. 13–25, copied from BL Add 38690 (also copied was the complaint by Humphrey).&lt;ref name="Matheson 11"&gt;Matheson 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translator===
BL Add 5467 claims ''The Dethe'' was translated by John Shirley from an unknown Latin poem,&lt;ref name=connolly46&gt;Connolly 46.&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Lister M. Matheson]] accepts on evidence of "numerous spelling peculiarities" with texts known to be done by Shirley.&lt;ref name="Matheson 11"/&gt; Shirley (ca.1366 – 1456) was a scribe and translator, and possibly a bookseller, who was an important figure in the literary scene of his day. His ascriptions in manuscripts associated with him, for instance, are proof of Chaucer's authorship of some of his lyrics. He was buried at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication history===
''The Dethe'' was published in 1797 (by [[John Pinkerton]]), in 1818 (anonymously, in an "obscure journal", the ''Miscellanea Scotica''), and in 1837 (by [[Joseph Stevenson]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 2.&lt;/ref&gt; All three were based on BL Add 5467, which is defective since "a page has been ripped out between the leaves now numbered f. 72" and f. 73'".&lt;ref&gt;Connolly 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, George Neilson printed the contents of the 17th-century manuscript, which does contain the text missing from BL Add. 5467. The existence of a text of ''The Dethe'' in BL Add. 38690 was first noted in 1925. According to Matheson this manuscript is earlier than BL Add. 5467; it was first edited in 1992 by Margaret Connolly. Matheson also notes that ''The Dethe'' entered into popular culture by way of four important works of history/historical fiction from the 19th and 20th centuries: [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]]'s ''The Spaewife'' (1823); [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Tales of a Grandfather]]'' (1828); [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s "The King's Tragedy" (in ''Ballads and Sonnets'', 1881); and [[Nigel Tranter]]'s ''Lion Let Loose'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the chronicle covers James I's reign as a king, it focuses on his murder and its aftermath in detail. James was stabbed to death, in a conspiracy led by [[Sir Robert Graham]] and the brothers Christopher and Robert Chambers, on the night of February 20–21, 1437, at [[Blackfriars, Perth]].&lt;ref name=matheson1&gt;Matheson 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Dethe'', he was murdered while hiding in the priory's [[Garderobe|privy]]; it is the only 15th-century chronicle that contains this detail.&lt;ref name=connolly46/&gt; The rest of the account relates how the murderers were tortured and executed.&lt;ref name=matheson1/&gt;

The chronicle describes how the king hears the noise of armed men outside the door of his bedchamber; he locks the door and unsuccessfully attempts to break through the windows. With metal tongs from the fireplace he breaks open the wooden floor of the privy and finds himself in the stone passage through which the privy drains. The only way out is the hole through which the privy can be emptied, but this very hole he had ordered closed up three days before to stop his tennis balls from rolling into it. The conspirators break down the door, and one of them threatens to kill the queen, [[Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots]], but is stopped by a son of Sir Robert Graham. When he is discovered, two men go down but the king defeats them, though unarmed; finally Graham descends into the privy and, refusing to let the king have a confessor, stabs him through the body. Graham is overcome by emotion and kills the king, with the help of the other two men, only after being threatened by the other conspirators. They try to find and kill the queen, but she has escaped and alerted the king's [[retinue]], which pursues the conspirators who manage to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the account relates in a very detailed fashion how the murderers were tortured and executed.&lt;ref name=matheson1/&gt; They are found within a month. [[Robert Stewart, Master of Atholl]] and Christopher Chambers are tortured in [[Edinburgh]] by being bound on crosses, having their flesh pulled from their bodies with tongs, being dragged by horses, hung up for all to see, decapitated with a rusty axe, and finally quartered. Their heads were displayed on a city gate. [[Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl]], was given a paper crown with "TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR" written on it. He was [[Sacrament of Penance|given confession]]; he denied being part of the assassination, though he said he knew of it. He was also beheaded, and his head, now crowned with an iron crown, was put on a pole in the centre of Edinburgh.

The torture and death of Graham in [[Stirling]] takes up six pages in the manuscript. "A mane of grete hart and manhode", he is defiant until the end and denounces his accusers. He is then hoisted onto a cart on which a tree is placed, and his hand is nailed to the tree with the very knife he used to kill the king. The executioner is ordered to cut off that hand with the same knife, and then he is drawn through the streets naked and tortured with iron instruments. He continues to defy his tormentors; they take pity on him and throw him back in jail, while more conspirators are [[Dismemberment|drawn and quartered]]. Graham is retrieved from jail and taken to the execution site, where his son is [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]] and beheaded before his eyes, after which he himself has his heart and then his bowels torn out.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 46–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience==
Shirley operated mostly in literary circles, perhaps an unlikely audience for the non-literary chronicle.&lt;ref name="Matheson 12"/&gt; [[Archie Duncan (historian)|Archibald Duncan]] thought it was clearly a "sadistic handbill, since it dwells so lovingly on the details of the executions of James's murderers",&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but Matheson identifies [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], and [[Henry VI of England]] as possible recipients of BL Add. 5467 and thinks, considering the context of BL Add. 38690 and its political and historical texts, that there were more precise political purposes at play.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible owner of BL Add. 38690, according to Matheson, was likely a member of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]], and singles out two possibilities, both men who were active participants in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. First of all, the Council's interest in MS Add. 38690 is suggested by the two texts that pertain to the release, after 25 years of captivity, of [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]] in 1440. The arguments presented for and against his release are similar to those brought up during the captivity of [[James I of Scotland]]. Matheson finds two members of the Council who may have had great interests in the documentation of those cases, as well as the two documents later in the manuscript, written in a different hand: the first a defense by [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], for his claim to the throne (also entered in the [[Rolls of Parliament]]), the second the agreement between York and Henry VI of October 1460 that made York's descendants heirs to the English throne. These two possible owners of BL Add. 38690 are [[John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton]], and [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World's First Collaborative Sentence''''' is a work of [[internet art]] by [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]] begun in 1994. It is held by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], and one version of it remains live to the present day.

== History ==
Douglas Davis began the "sentence without a period" in 1994 at the art gallery at [[Lehman College]], inviting people to contribute "words, photographs, video, graphics, WWW links, and sound via the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], regular mail, and personal visits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Douglas|title=The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction (An Evolving Thesis: 1991-1995)|journal=Leonardo|year=1995|volume=28|issue=5|page=381|doi=10.2307/1576221|jstor=1576221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 1995 but became plagued by technical problems such as file loss, [[link rot]], and formatting issues. By the year 2000, the sentence had received nearly 200,000 contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Douglas Davis: The World's First Collaborative Sentence 1994|url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/Artport/DouglasDavis|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation ==
In 2012, the Whitney decided to resurrect the work but found that it was completely unusable due to out-of-date code and links. Restoring the work generated a debate among conservators as to whether the links and code should be updated or left in their original state as a testament to the ephemeral nature of the web. The Whitney ultimately decided to duplicate the work and display two versions. The historical version, which is now locked to new contributions, was left frozen in time with broken and old links redirected through the [[Wayback Machine]] to the 90's version of sites when possible. The updated, "live" version, allows people to continue to contribute to the sentence, and the Whitney has opened some aspects of its maintenance to outside users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=When Artworks Crash: Restorers Face Digital Test|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/arts/design/whitney-saves-douglas-daviss-first-collaborative-sentence.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Tiitinen list''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] classified government document which was given by [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|West German Intelligence Service]] to the [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service|Finnish Security Police]] (Supo) in 1990. The list consists of the names of 18 persons&lt;ref name=Happonen /&gt; who are suspected to have been in contact with the [[East Germany|East German]] security service [[Stasi]].&lt;ref name=Sakki /&gt; The people are popularly described as having been suspected of spying for the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The list is named after [[Seppo Tiitinen]], who was the head of Supo in 1990.&lt;ref name=Sakki /&gt;

A copy of the list has been requested by journalist Susanna Reinboth and, in 2008, Supo was ordered to disclose the list by the Helsinki administrative court. In 2010, the ruling was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Finland]].&lt;ref name=Sakki /&gt;

One major argument in keeping the list classified has been that it only specifies individuals who have allegedly been in contact with Stasi, but not the nature of the contact. Therefore being on the list would not constitute proof of or even indicate breaking any Finnish laws. Consequently it was chosen not to shame potentially innocent persons in the media.

In October 2010, [[Julian Assange]] said in an interview that [[WikiLeaks]] had received a set of eight documents making up the Tiitinen list, and that it was to be published by the website pending a factual review. The list is "one of the most sought-after documents that Wikileaks has", according to Assange.&lt;ref name=Aula /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37084">A '''triple deity''' (sometimes referred to as threefold, tripled, triplicate, tripartite, triune or triadic, or as a trinity) is three [[deities]] that are worshipped as one. Such deities are common throughout world [[mythology]]; the number three  has a long history of mythical associations. [[Carl Jung]] considered the arrangement of deities into triplets an [[archetype]] in the [[history of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;"Triads of gods appear very early, at the primitive level.  The archaic triads in the religions of antiquity and of the East are too numerous to be mentioned here.  Arrangement in triads is an archetype in the history of religion, which in all probability formed the basis of the Christian Trinity." C. G. Jung.

The [[Matres]] or [[Matronae]] are usually represented as a group of three but sometimes with as many as 27 (3 × 3 × 3) inscriptions. They were associated with motherhood and fertility. Inscriptions to these deities have been found in Gaul, Spain, Italy, the Rhineland and Britain, as their worship was carried by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiery dating from the mid 1st century to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Takacs, Sarolta A. 2008 pp. 118"&gt;Takacs, Sarolta A. (2008) ''Vestal Virgins, Sybils, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion''. University of Texas Press. pp. 118–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miranda Green (academic)|Miranda Green]] observes that "triplism" reflects a way of "expressing the divine rather than presentation of specific god-types. [[wikt:triad|Triad]]s or [[wikt:triple|triple]] beings are ubiquitous in the Welsh and Irish mythic imagery" (she gives examples including the Irish battle-furies, [[Macha]], and [[Brighid|Brigit]]). "The religious iconographic repertoire of Gaul and Britain during the Roman period includes a wide range of triple forms: the most common triadic depiction is that of the triple mother goddess" (she lists numerous examples).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda.

[[Peter Goodrich|Peter H. Goodrich]] interprets the literary figure of [[Morgan le Fay]] as a manifestation of a British triple goddess in the medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H.

==Indo-European theory==
[[Georges Dumézil]]'s [[trifunctional hypothesis]] proposed that ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] society conceived itself as structured around three activities: worship, war, and toil.&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, ''Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press US, 2005), p. 306_308 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_s8nSgrD0jkC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22structures+reflecting+the+number+three%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In later times, when slave labor became common, the three functions came to be seen as separate "classes", represented each by its own god.&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Encyclopedia of Continental Philosophy'' p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil understood this mythology as reflecting and validating social structures in its content: such a tripartite class system is found in ancient Indian, Iranian, Greek and Celtic texts. In 1970 Dumézil proposed that some goddesses represented these three qualities as different aspects or epithets and identified examples in his interpretation of various deities including the Iranian [[Anāhitā]], the Vedic [[Sarasvatī]] and the Roman [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].&lt;ref&gt;(Nāsstrōm, Britt-Mari (1999) "Freyja — The Trivalent Goddess" in Sand, Erik Reenberg &amp; Sørensen, Jørgen Podemann (eds.) ''Comparative Studies in History of Religions: Their Aim, Scope and Validity''. Museum Tusculanum Press. pp. 62-4.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesna Petreska posits that myths including trinities of female mythical beings from Central and Eastern European cultures may be evidence for an Indo-European belief in trimutive female "[[weaving (mythology)|spinners]]" of destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Petreska, Vesna (2005) "Demons of Fate in Macedonian Folk Beliefs" in Gábor Klaniczay &amp; Éva Pócs (eds.) ''Christian Demonology and Popular Mythology''. Central European Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to the linguist [[M. L. West]], various female deities and mythological figures in Europe show the influence of pre-Indo-European goddess-worship, and triple female fate divinities, typically "[[weaving (mythology)|spinners]]" of destiny, are attested all over Europe and in Bronze Age Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. (2007) ''Indo-European Poetry and Myth''. Oxford University Press. pp. 140-1, 379-385.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
At her [[sacred grove]] at Aricia, on the shores of [[Lake Nemi]] a triplefold Diana was venerated from the late sixth century BCE as [[Diana Nemorensis]]. [[Andreas Alföldi]] interpreted a late Republican numismatic image as the Latin Diana "conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, [[Hekate]]".&lt;ref&gt;Alföldi, "Diana Nemorensis", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' (1960:137-44) p 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the ''lucus'' of Nemi in 43 BCE. The [[Lake of Nemi]] was ''Triviae lacus'' for Virgil (''Aeneid'' 7.516), while [[Horace]] called Diana ''montium custos nemoremque virgo'' ("keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi") and  ''diva triformis'' ("three-form goddess").&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carmina'' 3.22.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Diana is commonly addressed as [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]] by Virgil&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 6.35, 10.537.&lt;/ref&gt; and Catullus.&lt;ref&gt;''Carmina'' 34.14 ''tu potens Trivia''...&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek magical papyri===
Spells and hymns in [[Greek magical papyri]] refer to the goddess (called [[Hecate]], [[Persephone]], and [[Selene]], among other names) as "triple-sounding, triple-headed, triple-voiced..., triple-pointed, triple-faced, triple-necked". In one hymn, for instance, the "Three-faced Selene" is simultaneously identified as the three [[Charites]], the three [[Moirai]], and the three [[Erinyes]]; she is further addressed by the titles of several goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz |first=Hans Dieter (ed.) |title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation : Including the Demotic Spells : Texts |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0hCj5u3HNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=triple&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-226-04447-7}} PGM IV. 2785-2890 on pp.90-91.&lt;br /&gt;"Triple" assertions also occur in PGM IV. 1390-1495 on p.65, PGM IV. 2441-2621 on pp.84-86, and PGM IV. 2708-84 on p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; Translation editor [[Hans Dieter Betz]] notes: "The goddess Hekate, identical with Persephone, Selene, Artemis, and the old Babylonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most often invoked in the papyri."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz |first=Hans Dieter (ed.) |title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation : Including the Demotic Spells : Texts |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0hCj5u3HNQC&amp;lpg=PP48&amp;pg=PP48#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-226-04447-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century classical scholarship===
[[E. Cobham Brewer]]'s 1894 [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|''Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable'']] contained the entry, "[[Hecate]]: A triple deity, called [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] or the Moon in heaven, [[Diana Nemorensis|Diana]] on the earth, and Hecate or [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] in hell," and noted that "Chinese have the triple goddess Pussa".&lt;ref&gt;pp. 593 and 1246, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Ovid]], through the character of the Greek woman [[Medea]], refers to Hecate as "the triple Goddess";&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ovid/meta/meta07.htm ''Metamorphoses'', book 7], tr. John Dryden, et al (1717). Accessed 2009-09-23.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hecate will never join in that offence:&lt;br /&gt;Unjust is the request you make, and I&lt;br /&gt;In kindness your petition shall deny;&lt;br /&gt;Yet she that grants not what you do implore,&lt;br /&gt;Shall yet essay to give her Jason more;&lt;br /&gt;Find means t' encrease the stock of Aeson's years,&lt;br /&gt;Without retrenchment of your life's arrears;&lt;br /&gt;Provided that the triple Goddess join&lt;br /&gt;A strong confed'rate in my bold design.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the earlier Greek poet [[Hesiod]] represents her as a threefold goddess, with a share in earth, sea, and starry heavens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade|Eliade, Mircea]] (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1987 edition), "Hekate" entry, vol.6, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; Hecate was depicted variously as a single womanly form; as three women back-to-back; as a three-headed woman, sometimes with the heads of animals; or as three upper bodies of women springing from a single lower body ("we see three heads and shoulders and six hands, but the lower part of her body is single, and closely resembles that of the Ephesian Artemis"&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Richard Farnell|Farnell, Lewis Richard]] (1896). Chapter 19, "Hekate: Representations in Art", in [https://archive.org/details/cultsofgreekstat02farn ''The Cults of the Greek States'', volume 2]. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p.557.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Classical triple goddesses in literature==
The trinity of Asia, Panthea ("All-Goddess") and the [[Nereid]] Ione have been seen to be contrasted ironically with the triad of the Furies in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' making a careful separation between the Jungian figures of the Terrible and Good Mother.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Charlesworth Gelpi, ''Shelley's Goddess: Maternity, Language, Subjectivity'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 174 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R91vrrIsAboC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22triple+goddess%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA174,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finno-Ugric triads==
In the [[Sami mythology|mythology]] of the [[Sami people|Sámi]] (an important source of modern evidence concerning the [[Finno-Ugric language group]] and the cultures in which it evolved), a triad of goddesses are responsible for childbirth and protecting children. Sáhráhkka, who lives in the fireplace, is responsible for pregnancy and the particular protector of girls. Juksáhkká, who lives in the area of the back doors, is responsible for turning some children into boys while they are in the womb (there was a belief that all children are female at the outset). Uksáhkká guards the main doors, and is responsible for protecting all young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saivu.com/web/index.php?sladja=77&amp;vuolitsladja=88&amp;giella1=eng Gods, spirits and other beings], Samisk tro og mytologi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saivu.com/web/index.php?sladja=76&amp;vuolitsladja=82&amp;giella1=eng How children were created], Samisk tro og mytologi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Islamic==
A pagan god was worshipped in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] and [[Nabataea]] with a family of deities around him among which was a triad of goddesses called "the three daughters of God": [[Al-lāt|al-Lat]] ("Mother Goddess of prosperity")  [[Al-Uzza]] ("Mighty one") the youngest, and  [[Manāt|Manat]] ("Fate") "the third, the other".&lt;ref&gt;Khalīl, Shawqī Abū (2003) ''Atlas of the Qurʼān: Places, Nations, Landmarks''. Darussalam Press. pp. 196-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HawtingIdolatry"&gt;Hawting, Gerald R. (1999) ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam: From Polemic to History''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 130-2.&lt;/ref&gt; They were known collectively as the three [[crane (bird)|cranes]].&lt;ref name="HawtingIdolatry"/&gt; The name [[Al-lāt|al-Lat]] is known from the time of the histories of [[Herodotus]] in which she is named Alilat.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.131; 3.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healey, John F. (2001) ''The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus''. Brill Academic Publishers. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triple goddess stone==
[[File:Qetesh relief plaque (Triple Goddess Stone).png|thumb|[[Qetesh]] on the Triple Goddess Stone]]

'''Qudshu-Astarte-Anat''' is a representation of a single goddess who is a combination of three goddesses: [[Qetesh]] (Athirat "Asherah"), [[Astarte]], and [[Anat]]. It was a common practice for Canaanites and Egyptians to merge different deities through a process of syncretization, thereby, turning them into one single entity. This "Triple Goddess Stone", once owned by Winchester College, shows the goddess Qetesh with the inscription "Qudshu-Astarte-Anat", showing their association as being one goddess, and Qetesh (Qudshu) in place of Athirat.

Religious scholar Saul M. Olyan (author of Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel), calls the representation on the Qudshu-Astarte-Anat plaque "a triple-fusion hypostasis", and considers Qudshu to be an epithet of Athirat by a process of elimination, for Astarte and Anat appear after Qudshu in the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;The Ugaritic Baal cycle: Volume 2 by Mark S. Smith - Page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts by Mark S. Smith - Page 237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three-headed deities==
{{Further information|Polycephaly}}
* In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Trisiras]] and [[Dattatreya]] are explicitly tricephalous deities, but other instances of three-headedness are also found in [[Hindu iconography]], for example in depictions of goddess [[Durga]].
* The smaller [[Gallehus horn]] has a three-headed figure, holding an axe in its right hand and a rope tethered to the leg of a horned animal in the left.
* In [[Slavic mythology]], the god [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]], (literally meaning "three-heads") is a three-headed man, sometimes depicted with three goat heads. He is depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to another that serve as the representatives of the Slavic realms. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods.
* The hound [[Cerberus]] in Greek mythology is often depicted with three heads.
* [[Geryon]] has been depicted as three-headed on the [[Herculean Sarcophagus of Genzano]] currently held at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Signes gravés sur les églises de l'Eure et du Calvados'' by [[Asger Jorn]], Volume II of the Bibliotehéque Alexandrie, published by the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]], 1964, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

{{main article|Athanasian Creed|Trinity}}

Christians profess "one God in three divine persons" ([[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] and [[Holy Ghost|God the Holy Ghost]]). This is not necessarily to be understood as a belief in (or worship of) [[Tritheism#Monotheistic tritheism|three Gods]], nor as a belief that there are [[Sabellianism|three subjectively-perceived "aspects"]] in one God, both of which the Roman Catholic Church condemns as heresy. The Catholic Church also rejects the notions that God is [[Divine simplicity#Criticism|"composed"]] of its three persons and that "God" is a [[Genus (philosophy)|genus]] containing the three persons.

===Gnosticism===
The [[Gnostic]] text [[Trimorphic Protennoia]] presents a threefold discourse of the three forms of Divine Thought: The Father, The Son, and The Mother ([[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/trimorph.html|title=Trimorphic Protennoia -- The Nag Hammadi Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Willoughby v. Stever''''', 504 F.2d 271 (D. C. Cir. 1974) was a 1973 [[United States|America]]n legal decision in a case brought by [[Evangelism|evangelist]] William Willoughby against the [[National Science Foundation]] director [[H. Guyford Stever]] and the [[Board of Regents]] of the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado]] for using taxpayer money to fund textbooks developed by the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] (BSCS) because they included evolution instruction.  Willoughby claimed the pro-evolution curriculum was by extension also promoting [[secular humanism]] as the "official religion of the United States," and thus violated the [[Establishment clause]] of the [[US Constitution]]. Willoughby accused scientists of "intellectual snobbery", and opposed tax revenues going to support education offensive to his religious views.  He argued that [[creationist]] education should be given the same tax payer funding as evolution education.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution in the courtroom: a reference guide |last=Moore |first=Randy |isbn=978-1-57607-420-6 |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward John |edition=3, revised |title=Trial and error: the American controversy over creation and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=978-0-19-515470-2 |year=2003 |pages=133, 148, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The lawsuit was dismissed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] on the grounds that the textbooks disseminated [[science]], not [[religion]]. The Court also held that the Constitution's [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] prohibited states from demanding textbook teachings align with the religious beliefs of any particular group or individual.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

The District Court ruling was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit]] on October 23, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''Willoughby
