[[File:02-Sandvig-Seeing-the-Sort-2014-WEB.png|thumb|A flow chart showing the decisions made by a recommendation engine, circa 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=us&amp;NR=7113917&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP|title=Patent #US2001021914|last=Jacobi|first=Jennifer|date=13 September 2001|website=Espacenet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Algorithmic bias''' occurs when a computer system reflects the implicit [[Value (ethics)|values]] of the humans who are involved in coding, collecting, selecting, or using data to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to search engine results and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing [[Bias|social biases]] of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect "systematic and unfair" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the 2018 European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]].

As algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise, and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.

Algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of [[online hate speech]]. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias stem from the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single "algorithm" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.

Contemporary [[Social science|social scientists]] are concerned with algorithmic processes embedded into hardware and software applications because of their political and social impact, and question the underlying assumptions of an algorithm's neutrality.&lt;ref name="Seaver"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55eb004ee4b0518639d59d9b/t/55ece1bfe4b030b2e8302e1e/1441587647177/seaverMiT8.pdf|title=Knowing Algorithms|last1=Seaver|first1=Nick|publisher=Media in Transition 8, Cambridge, MA, April 2013|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen D.N.|title=Software-sorted geographies|journal=Progress in Human Geography|date=July 2016|volume=29|issue=5|pages=562–580|doi=10.1191/0309132505ph568oa|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/194/1/194.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|563}}&lt;ref name="Tewell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tewell|first1=Eamon|date=4 April 2016|title=Toward the Resistant Reading of Information: Google, Resistant Spectatorship, and Critical Information Literacy|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/613843|journal=Portal: Libraries and the Academy|volume=16|issue=2|pages=289–310|issn=1530-7131|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data|title=The Hidden Biases in Big Data|last=Crawford|first=Kate|date=1 April 2013|website=Harvard Business Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''algorithmic bias'' describes systematic and repeatable errors that create unfair outcomes, such as privileging one arbitrary group of users over others. For example, a [[credit score]] algorithm may deny a loan without being unfair, if it is consistently weighing relevant financial criteria. If the algorithm recommends loans to one group of users, but denies loans to another set of nearly identical users based on unrelated criteria, and if this behavior can be repeated across multiple occurrences, an algorithm can be described as ''biased''.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}} This bias may be intentional or unintentional.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}}

== Methods ==
Bias can be introduced to an algorithm in several ways. During the assemblage of a [[database]], data must be collected, digitized, adapted, and entered according to human-designed [[cataloging]] criteria.&lt;ref name="Gillespie et al"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Media Technologies|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|last2=Boczkowski|first2=Pablo|last3=Foot|first3=Kristin|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262525374|location=Cambridge|pages=1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Next, programmers assign priorities, or [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]], for how a program assesses and sorts that data. This requires human decisions about how data is categorized, and which data is included or discarded.&lt;ref name="Gillespie et al" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Some algorithms collect their own data based on human-selected criteria, which can also reflect the bias of human designers.&lt;ref name="Gillespie et al" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display "relevant" data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.&lt;ref name="Gillespie et al" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Beyond assembling and processing data, bias can emerge as a result of design.&lt;ref name="TowCenter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diakopoulas|first1=Nicholas|title=Algorithmic Accountability: On the Investigation of Black Boxes {{!}}|url=https://towcenter.org/research/algorithmic-accountability-on-the-investigation-of-black-boxes-2/|website=towcenter.org|accessdate=19 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, algorithms that work by sorting, that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny (such as determining school placements), or those that classify and identify users, may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users (as in credit scores).&lt;ref name="Lipartito"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipartito|first1=Kenneth|title=The Narrative and the Algorithm: Genres of Credit Reporting from the Nineteenth Century to Today|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=6 January 2011|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1736283|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/28142/1/MPRA_paper_28142.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}} Meanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes. Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results. This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as in flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.&lt;ref name="TowCenter" /&gt; Algorithms may also display an ''uncertainty bias'', offering more confident assessments when larger [[data set]]s are available. This can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples, which may disregard data from underrepresented populations.&lt;ref name="GoodmanFlaxman2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=Bryce|last2=Flaxman|first2=Seth|title=EU regulations on algorithmic decision-making and a "right to explanation"|journal=AI Magazine|volume=38|issue=3|pages=50|arxiv=1606.08813|doi=10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

== History ==

=== Early critiques ===
[[File:Used Punchcard (5151286161).jpg|thumb|This card was used to load software into an old mainframe computer. Each byte (the letter 'A', for example) is entered by punching holes. Though contemporary computers are more complex, they reflect this human decision-making process in collecting and processing data.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|70}}&lt;ref name="Goffrey" /&gt;{{rp|16}}]]
The earliest computer programs were designed to mimic human reasoning and deductions, and were deemed to be functioning when they successfully and consistently reproduced that human logic. In his 1976 book [[Computer Power and Human Reason]], [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] pioneer [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] suggested that bias could arise both from the data used in a program, but also from the way a program is coded.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|149}}

Weizenbaum wrote that [[Computer program|programs]] are a sequence of rules created by humans for a computer to follow. By following those rules consistently, such programs "embody law,"&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weizenbaum|first1=Joseph|title=Computer power and human reason : from judgment to calculation|date=1976|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-7167-0464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}} that is, enforce a specific way to solve problems. The rules a computer follows are based on the assumptions of a computer programmer for how these problems might be solved. That means the code could incorporate the programmer's imagination of how the world works, including his or her biases and expectations.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|109}} While a computer program can incorporate bias in this way, Weizenbaum also noted that any data fed to a machine additionally reflects "human decisionmaking processes" as data is being selected.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|70, 105}}

Finally, he noted that machines might also transfer good information with [[unintended consequence]]s if users are unclear about how to interpret the results.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|65}} Weizenbaum warned against trusting decisions made by computer programs that a user doesn't understand, comparing such faith to a tourist who can find his way to a hotel room exclusively by turning left or right on a coin toss. Crucially, the tourist has no basis of understanding how or why he arrived at his destination, and a successful arrival does not mean the process is accurate or reliable.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum1976" /&gt;{{rp|226}}

An early example of algorithmic bias resulted in as many as 60 women and ethnic minorities denied entry to [[St George's, University of London|St. George's Hospital Medical School]] per year from 1982 to 1986, based on implementation of a new computer-guidance assessment system that denied entry to women and men with "foreign-sounding names" based on historical trends in admissions.&lt;ref name="LowryMacpherson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowry|first1=Stella|last2=Macpherson|first2=Gordon|date=5 March 1988|title=A Blot on the Profession|url=http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2545288&amp;blobtype=pdf|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=296|issue=6623|page=657|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary critiques and responses ===
Though well-designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally (or more) equitable than the decisions of human beings, cases of bias still occur, and are difficult to predict and analyze.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Alex P. |title=Want Less-Biased Decisions? Use Algorithms |url=https://hbr.org/2018/07/want-less-biased-decisions-use-algorithms |website=Harvard Business Review |accessdate=31 July 2018 |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of analyzing algorithmic bias has grown alongside the complexity of programs and their design. Decisions made by one designer, or team of designers, may be obscured among the many pieces of code created for a single program; over time these decisions and their collective impact on the program's output may be forgotten.&lt;ref name="Introna1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Introna|first1=Lucas D.|date=2 December 2011|title=The Enframing of Code|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=28|issue=6|pages=113–141|doi=10.1177/0263276411418131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} In theory, these biases may create new patterns of behavior, or "scripts," in relationship to specific technologies as the code [[Cybernetics|interacts]] with other elements of society.&lt;ref name="Bogost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-cathedral-of-computation/384300/|title=The Cathedral of Computation|last1=Bogost|first1=Ian|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 November 2017|date=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biases may also impact how society shapes itself around the [[data point]]s that algorithms require. For example, if data shows a high number of arrests in a particular area, an algorithm may assign more police patrols to that area, which could lead to more arrests.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Introna|first1=Lucas|last2=Wood|first2=David|date=2004|title=Picturing algorithmic surveillance: the politics of facial recognition systems|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-200675|journal=Surveillance &amp; Society|volume=2|pages=177–198|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180}}

The decisions of algorithmic programs can be seen as more authoritative than the decisions of the human beings they are meant to assist,&lt;ref name="Introna2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Introna|first1=Lucas D.|date=21 December 2006|title=Maintaining the reversibility of foldings: Making the ethics (politics) of information technology visible|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–25|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-9133-z|citeseerx=10.1.1.154.1313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} a process described by author [[Clay Shirky]] as "algorithmic authority".&lt;ref name="ShirkyAuthority"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/11/a-speculative-post-on-the-idea-of-algorithmic-authority/|title=A Speculative Post on the Idea of Algorithmic Authority Clay Shirky|last1=Shirky|first1=Clay|website=www.shirky.com|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirky uses the term to describe "the decision to regard as authoritative an unmanaged process of extracting value from diverse, untrustworthy sources," such as search results.&lt;ref name="ShirkyAuthority" /&gt; This neutrality can also be misrepresented by the language used by experts and the media when results are presented to the public. For example, a list of news items selected and presented as "trending" or "popular" may be created based on significantly wider criteria than just their popularity.&lt;ref name="Gillespie et al" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

Because of their convenience and authority, algorithms are theorized as a means of delegating responsibility away from humans.&lt;ref name="Introna2" /&gt;{{rp|16}}&lt;ref name="Ziewitz1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziewitz|first1=Malte|title=Governing Algorithms: Myth, Mess, and Methods|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|date=1 January 2016|volume=41|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1177/0162243915608948|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/30/0162243915608948.abstract|accessdate=22 November 2017|language=en|issn=0162-2439}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} This can have the effect of reducing alternative options, compromises, or flexibility.&lt;ref name="Introna2" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Sociologist [[Scott Lash]] has critiqued algorithms as a new form of "generative power", in that they are a virtual means of generating actual ends. Where previously human behavior generated data to be collected and studied, powerful algorithms increasingly could shape and define human behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lash"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lash|first1=Scott|date=30 June 2016|title=Power after Hegemony|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=55–78|doi=10.1177/0263276407075956}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

Concerns over the impact of algorithms on society have lead to the creation of working groups in organizations such as [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]], which have co-created a working group named Fairness, Accountability,
and Transparency in Machine Learning.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia |first1=Megan |title=Racist in the Machine |journal=World Policy Journal |date=1 January 2016 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=111–117 |doi=10.1215/07402775-3813015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} Ideas from Google have included community groups that patrol the outcomes of algorithms and vote to control or restrict outputs they deem to have negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

== Types ==

=== Pre-existing ===
Pre-existing bias in an algorithm is a consequence of underlying social and institutional [[Ideology|ideologies]]. Such ideas may influence or create personal biases within individual designers or programmers. Such prejudices can be explicit and conscious, or implicit and unconscious.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|334}}&lt;ref name="Tewell" /&gt;{{rp|294}} Poorly selected input data will influence the outcomes created by machines.&lt;ref name="Goffrey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goffrey|first1=Andrew|editor1-last=Fuller|editor1-first=Matthew|title=Software studies: a lexicon|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-1-4356-4787-9|pages=15–20|chapter=Algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} Encoding pre-existing bias into software can preserve social and institutional bias, and without correction, could be replicated in all future uses of that algorithm.&lt;ref name="Introna1" /&gt;{{rp|116}}&lt;ref name="Ziewitz1" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

An example of this form of bias is the British Nationality Act Program, designed to automate the evaluation of new UK citizens after the 1981 [[British Nationality Act]].&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|341}} The program accurately reflected the tenets of the law, which stated that "a man is the father of only his legitimate children, whereas a woman is the mother of all her children, legitimate or not."&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|341}}&lt;ref name="SergotEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sergot|first1=MJ|last2=Sadri|first2=F|last3=Kowalski|first3=RA|last4=Kriwaczek|first4=F|last5=Hammond|first5=P|last6=Cory|first6=HT|title=The British Nationality Act as a Logic Program|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=May 1986|volume=29|issue=5|pages=370–386|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs227/Readings/BritishNationalityAct.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|375}} In its attempt to transfer a particular logic into an algorithmic process, the BNAP inscribed the logic of the British Nationality Act into its algorithm, which would perpetuate it even if the act was eventually repealed.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|342}}

=== Technical ===
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|Facial recognition software used in conjunction with surveillance cameras was found to display bias in recognizing Asian and black faces over white faces.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|191}}]]
Technical bias emerges through limitations of a program, computational power, its design, or other constraint on the system.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}} Such bias can also be a restraint of design, for example, a search engine that shows three results per screen can be understood to privilege the top three results slightly more than the next three, as in an airline price display.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|336}} Another case is software that relies on [[randomness]] for fair distributions of results. If the [[random number generation]] mechanism is not truly random, it can introduce bias, for example, by skewing selections toward items at the end or beginning of a list.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}}

A ''decontextualized algorithm'' uses unrelated information to sort results, for example, a flight-pricing algorithm that sorts results by alphabetical order would be biased in favor of American Airlines over United Airlines.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}} The opposite may also apply, in which results are evaluated in contexts different from which they are collected. Data may be collected without crucial external context: for example, when facial recognition software is used by surveillance cameras, but evaluated by remote staff in another country or region, or evaluated by non-human algorithms with no awareness of what takes place beyond the camera's [[Visual field|field of vision]]. This could create an incomplete understanding of a crime scene, for example, potentially mistaking bystanders for those who commit the crime.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;{{rp|574}}

Lastly, technical bias can be created by attempting to formalize decisions into concrete steps on the assumption that human behavior works in the same way. For example, software weighs data points to determine whether a defendant should accept a plea bargain, while ignoring the impact of emotion on a jury.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|332}} Another unintended result of this form of bias was found in the plagiarism-detection software [[Turnitin]], which compares student-written texts to information found online and returns a probability score that the student's work is copied. Because the software compares long strings of text, it is more likely to identify non-native speakers of English than native speakers, as the latter group might be better able to change individual words, break up strings of plagiarized text, or obscure copied passages through synonyms. Because it is easier for native speakers to evade detection as a result of the technical constraints of the software, this creates a scenario where Turnitin identifies foreign-speakers of English for plagiarism while allowing more native-speakers to evade detection.&lt;ref name="Introna2" /&gt;{{rp|21–22}}

=== Emergent ===
[[Emergent properties|Emergent]] bias is the result of the use and reliance on algorithms across new or unanticipated contexts.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|334}} Algorithms may not have been adjusted to consider new forms of knowledge, such as new drugs or medical breakthroughs, new laws, business models, or shifting cultural norms.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|334,336}} This may exclude groups through technology, without providing clear outlines to understand who is responsible for their exclusion.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Tewell" /&gt;{{rp|294}} Similarly, problems may emerge when [[training data]] (the samples "fed" to a machine, by which it models certain conclusions) do not align with contexts that an algorithm encounters in the real world.&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2014/06/algorithm-draft-digitalkeyword/|title=Algorithm [draft] [#digitalkeywords] – Culture Digitally|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|website=culturedigitally.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, an example of emergent bias was identified in the software used to place US medical students into residencies, the National Residency Match Program (NRMP).&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|338}} The algorithm was designed at a time when few married couples would seek residencies together. As more women entered medical schools, more students were likely to request a residency alongside their partners. The process called for each applicant to provide a list of preferences for placement across the US, which was then sorted and assigned when a hospital and an applicant both agreed to a match. In the case of married couples where both sought residencies, the algorithm weighed the location choices of the higher-rated partner first. The result was a frequent assignment of highly preferred schools to the first partner and lower-preferred schools to the second partner, rather than sorting for compromises in placement preference.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|338}}&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A. E. 1524–1528.|title=New physicians: A natural experiment in market organization|journal=Science|date=14 December 1990|volume=250|issue=4987|pages=1524–1528|url=https://stanford.edu/~alroth/science.html|accessdate=18 November 2017|bibcode=1990Sci...250.1524R|doi=10.1126/science.2274783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional emergent biases include:

==== Correlations ====
Unpredictable correlations can emerge when large data sets are compared to each other. For example, data collected about web-browsing patterns may align with signals marking sensitive data (such as race or sexual orientation). By selecting according to certain behavior or browsing patterns, the end effect would be almost identical to discrimination through the use of direct race or sexual orientation data.&lt;ref name="GoodmanFlaxman2016" /&gt;{{rp|6}} In other cases, the algorithm draws conclusions from correlations, without being able to understand those correlations. For example, one triage program gave lower priority to asthmatics who had pneumonia than asthmatics who did not have pneumonia. The program algorithm did this because it simply compared survival rates: asthmatics with pneumonia are at the highest risk. Historically, for this same reason, hospitals typically give such asthmatics the best and most immediate care.&lt;ref name="Kuang"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuang|first1=Cliff|title=Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/magazine/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The New York Times|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unanticipated uses ====
Emergent bias can occur when an algorithm is used by unanticipated audiences. For example, machines may require that users can read, write, or understand numbers, or relate to an interface using metaphors that they do not understand.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|334}} These exclusions can become compounded, as biased or exclusionary technology is more deeply integrated into society.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|179}}

Apart from exclusion, unanticipated uses may emerge from the end user relying on the software rather than their own knowledge. In one example, an unanticipated user group lead to algorithmic bias in the UK, when the British National Act Program was created as a [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] by computer scientists and immigration lawyers to evaluate suitability for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. The designers had access to legal expertise beyond the end users in immigration offices, whose understanding of both software and immigration law would likely have been unsophisticated. The agents administering the questions relied entirely on the software, which excluded alternative pathways to citizenship, and used the software even after new case laws and legal interpretations lead the algorithm to become outdated. As a result of designing an algorithm for users assumed to be legally savvy on immigration law, the software's algorithm indirectly lead to bias in favor of applicants who fit a very narrow set of legal criteria set by the algorithm, rather than by the more broader criteria of UK immigration law.&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" /&gt;{{rp|342}}

==== Feedback loops ====
Emergent bias may also create a [[feedback loop]], or recursion, if data collected for an algorithm results in real-world responses which are fed back into the algorithm.&lt;ref name="JouvenalPredPol"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|title=Police are using software to predict crime. Is it a 'holy grail' or biased against minorities?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-are-using-software-to-predict-crime-is-it-a-holy-grail-or-biased-against-minorities/2016/11/17/525a6649-0472-440a-aae1-b283aa8e5de8_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamma"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chamma|first1=Maurice|title=Policing the Future|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/02/03/policing-the-future?ref=hp-2-111#.UyhBLnmlj|website=The Marshall Project|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, simulations of the [[predictive policing]] software (PredPol), deployed in Oakland, California, suggested an increased police presence in black neighborhoods based on crime data reported by the public.&lt;ref name="LumIsaac"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lum|first1=Kristian|last2=Isaac|first2=William|title=To predict and serve?|journal=Significance|date=October 2016|volume=13|issue=5|pages=14–19|doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation showed that the public reported crime based on the sight of police cars, regardless of what police were doing. The simulation interpreted police car sightings in modeling its predictions of crime, and would in turn assign an even larger increase of police presence within those neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="JouvenalPredPol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithPredPol"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jack|title=Predictive policing only amplifies racial bias, study shows|url=https://mic.com/articles/156286/crime-prediction-tool-pred-pol-only-amplifies-racially-biased-policing-study-shows|website=Mic|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LumIsaacFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lum|first1=Kristian|last2=Isaac|first2=William|title=FAQs on Predictive Policing and Bias|url=https://hrdag.org/2016/11/04/faqs-predpol/|website=HRDAG|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en|date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Data Analysis Group]], which conducted the simulation, warned that in places where racial discrimination is a factor in arrests, such feedback loops could reinforce and perpetuate racial discrimination in policing.&lt;ref name="Chamma" /&gt;

== Impact ==

=== Commercial influences ===
Corporate algorithms could be skewed to invisibly favor financial arrangements or agreements between companies, without the knowledge of a user who may mistake the algorithm as being impartial. For example, [[American Airlines]] created a flight-finding algorithm in the 1980s. The software presented a range of flights from various airlines to customers, but weighed factors that boosted its own flights, regardless of price or convenience. In testimony to the [[United States Congress]], the president of the airline stated outright that the system was created with the intention of gaining competitive advantage through preferential treatment.&lt;ref name="Sandvig1" /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Helen|title=Bias in Computer Systems|journal=ACM Transactions on Information Systems|date=July 1996|volume=14|issue=3|pages=330–347|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/biasincomputers.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

In a 1998 paper describing [[Google]], it was shown that the founders of the company adopted a policy of transparency in search results regarding paid placement, arguing that "advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers."&lt;ref name="BrinPage98"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|last2=Page|first2=Lawrence|title=The Anatomy of a Search Engine|url=http://www7.scu.edu.au/1921/com1921.htm|website=www7.scu.edu.au|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias would be an "invisible" manipulation of the user.&lt;ref name="Sandvig1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandvig|first1=Christian|last2=Hamilton|first2=Kevin|last3=Karahalios|first3=Karrie|last4=Langbort|first4=Cedric|title=Auditing Algorithms: Research Methods for Detecting Discrimination on Internet Platforms|journal=64th Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association|date=22 May 2014|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/research/Auditing%20Algorithms%20--%20Sandvig%20--%20ICA%202014%20Data%20and%20Discrimination%20Preconference.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

=== Voting behavior ===
A series of studies about undecided voters in the US and in India found that search engine results were able to shift voting outcomes by about 20%. The researchers concluded that candidates have "no means of competing" if an algorithm, with or without intent, boosted page listings for a rival candidate.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert|last2=Robertson|first2=Ronald E.|title=The search engine manipulation effect (SEME) and its possible impact on the outcomes of elections|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=18 August 2015|volume=112|issue=33|pages=E4512–E4521|doi=10.1073/pnas.1419828112|pmid=26243876|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/E4512.full?sid=0176389d-5a8b-4955-8a8e-43d25e0332b0|accessdate=19 November 2017|bibcode=2015PNAS..112E4512E|pmc=4547273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook users who saw messages related to voting were more likely to vote. A 2010 [[randomized trial]] of Facebook users showed a 20% increase (340,000 votes) among users who saw messages encouraging voting, as well as images of their friends who had voted.&lt;ref name="Bond-etal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Robert M.|last2=Fariss|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Jones|first3=Jason J.|last4=Kramer|first4=Adam D.

=== Gender discrimination ===
In 2016, the professional networking site [[LinkedIn]] was discovered to recommend male variations of women's names in response to search queries. The site did not make similar recommendations in searches for male names. For example, "Andrea" would bring up a prompt asking if users meant "Andrew," but queries for "Andrew" did not ask if users meant to find "Andrea". The company said this was the result of an analysis of users' interactions with the site.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Day|first1=Matt|title=How LinkedIn's search engine may reflect a gender bias|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/how-linkedins-search-engine-may-reflect-a-bias/|website=The Seattle Times|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the department store franchise [[Target (company)|Target]] was cited for gathering data points to infer when women customers were pregnant, even if they had not announced it, and then sharing that information with marketing partners.&lt;ref name="CrawfordSchultz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Kate|last2=Schultz|first2=Jason|title=Big Data and Due Process: Toward a Framework to Redress Predictive Privacy Harms|journal=Boston College Law Review|date=2014|volume=55|issue=1|pages=93–128|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol55/iss1/4/|accessdate=18 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;ref name="Duhigg"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Duhigg|first1=Charles|title=How Companies Learn Your Secrets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the data had been predicted, rather than directly observed or reported, the company had no legal obligation to protect the privacy of those customers.&lt;ref name="CrawfordSchultz" /&gt;{{rp|98}}

Web search algorithms have also been accused of bias. Google's results may prioritize pornographic content in search terms related to sexuality, for example, "lesbian". This bias extends to the search engine showing popular but sexualized content in neutral searches. For example, "Top 25 Sexiest Women Athletes" articles displayed as first-page results in searches for "women athletes".&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noble|first1=Safiya|title=Missed Connections: What Search Engines Say about Women|journal=Bitch Magazine|date=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} In 2017, Google adjusted these results along with others that surfaced hate groups, racist views, child abuse and pornography, and other upsetting and offensive content.&lt;ref name="Guynn2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guynn|first1=Jessica|title=Google starts flagging offensive content in search results|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/03/16/google-flags-offensive-content-search-results/99235548/|accessdate=19 November 2017|work=USA TODAY|agency=USA Today|date=16 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the display of higher-paying jobs to male applicants on job search websites.&lt;ref name="SimoniteMIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/539021/probing-the-dark-side-of-googles-ad-targeting-system/|title=Study Suggests Google's Ad-Targeting System May Discriminate|last1=Simonite|first1=Tom|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|language=en|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Amazon.com]] turned off a system it developed to screen job applications when they realized it was biased against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dastin |first1=Jeffrey |title=Amazon scraps secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G |work=Reuters |date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial and ethnic discrimination ===
Algorithms have been criticized as a method for obscuring racial prejudices in decision-making.&lt;ref name="Nakamura1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The new media of surveillance|last1=Nakamura|first1=Lisa|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56812-8|editor1-last=Magnet|editor1-first=Shoshana|location=London|pages=149–162|editor2-last=Gates|editor2-first=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} [[Lisa Nakamura]] has noted that [[census]] machines were among the first to adopt the [[Punched card|punch-card]] processes that lead to contemporary computing, and that their use as categorization and sorting machines for race has been long established and socially tolerated.&lt;ref name="Nakamura1" /&gt;{{rp|158}}

One example is the use of [[risk assessment]]s in [[criminal sentencing in the United States]] and [[Parole board|parole hearings]], judges were presented with an algorithmically generated score intended to reflect the risk that a prisoner will repeat a crime.&lt;ref name="ProPublica" /&gt; For the time period starting in 1920 and ending in 1970, the nationality of a criminals's father was a consideration in those risk assessment scores.&lt;ref name="Harcourt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=Bernard|title=Risk as a Proxy for Race|journal=Criminology and Public Policy, Forthcoming|date=16 September 2010|ssrn=1677654}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Today, these scores are shared with judges in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. An independent investigation by [[ProPublica]] found that the scores were inaccurate 80% of the time, and disproportionately skewed to suggest blacks to be at risk of relapse, 77% more often than whites.&lt;ref name="ProPublica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|last2=Larson|first2=Jeff|last3=Mattu|first3=Surya|last4=Kirchner|first4=Lauren|title=Machine Bias — ProPublica|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing|website=ProPublica|accessdate=18 November 2017|language=en-us|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Google apologized when black users complained that an image-identification algorithm in its Photos application identified them as [[Ethnic stereotype|gorillas]].&lt;ref name="Guynn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guynn|first1=Jessica|title=Google Photos labeled black people 'gorillas'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/01/google-apologizes-after-photos-identify-black-people-as-gorillas/29567465/|accessdate=18 November 2017|work=USA TODAY|agency=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|date=1 July 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Nikon]] cameras were criticized when image-recognition algorithms consistently asked Asian users if they were blinking.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Adam|title=Are Face-Detection Cameras Racist?|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1954643,00.html|journal=Time|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such examples are the product of bias in [[biometric data]] sets.&lt;ref name="Guynn" /&gt; Biometric data is drawn from aspects of the body, including racial features either observed or inferred, which can then be transferred into data points.&lt;ref name="Nakamura1" /&gt;{{rp|154}}

Biometric data about race may also be inferred, rather than observed. For example, a 2012 study showed that names commonly associated with blacks were more likely to yield search results implying arrest records, regardless of whether there is any police record of that individual's name.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney|first1=Latanya|title=Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery|journal=SSRI|date=28 January 2013|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2208240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online hate speech ====
In 2017 a [[Facebook]] algorithm designed to remove online hate speech was found to advantage white men over black children when assessing objectionable content, according to internal Facebook documents.&lt;ref name="AngwinGrassegger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms|title=Facebook's Secret Censorship Rules Protect White Men From Hate Speech But Not Black Children — ProPublica|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|last2=Grassegger|first2=Hannes|date=28 June 2017|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm, which is a combination of computer programs and human content reviewers, was created to protect broad categories rather than specific subsets of categories. For example, posts denouncing "Muslims" would be blocked, while posts denouncing "Radical Muslims" would be allowed. An unanticipated outcome of the algorithm is to allow hate speech against black children, because they denounce the "children" subset of blacks, rather than "all blacks," whereas "all white men" would trigger a block, because whites and males are not considered subsets.&lt;ref name="AngwinGrassegger" /&gt; Facebook was also found to allow ad purchasers to target "Jew haters" as a category of users, which the company said was an inadvertent outcome of algorithms used in assessing and categorizing data. The company's design also allowed ad buyers to block African-Americans from seeing housing ads.&lt;ref name="AngwinVarnerTobin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters|title=Facebook Enabled Advertisers to Reach ‘Jew Haters’ — ProPublica|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|date=14 September 2017|work=ProPublica|accessdate=20 November 2017|last2=Varner|first2=Madeleine|language=en-us|last3=Tobin|first3=Ariana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surveillance ====
Surveillance camera software may be considered inherently political because it requires algorithms to distinguish normal from abnormal behaviors, and to determine who belongs in certain locations at certain times.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;{{rp|572}} The ability of such algorithms to recognize faces across a racial spectrum has been shown to be limited by the racial diversity of images in its training database; if the majority of photos belong to one race or gender, the software is better at recognizing other members of that race or gender.&lt;ref name="Furl2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furl|first1=N|date=December 2002|title=Face recognition algorithms and the other-race effect: computational mechanisms for a developmental contact hypothesis|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=26|issue=6|pages=797–815|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(02)00084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 analysis of software used to identify individuals in [[CCTV]] images found several examples of bias when run against criminal databases. The software was assessed as identifying men more frequently than women, older people more frequently than the young, and identified Asians, African-Americans and other races more often than whites.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|190}} Additional studies of facial recognition software have found the opposite to be true when trained on non-criminal databases, with the software being the least accurate in identifying darker-skinned females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buolamwini|first=Joy|last2=Gebru|first2=Timnit|date=2018|title=Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf|journal=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research|volume=81|page=1|via=MLR Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual discrimination ===
In 2011, users of the gay hookup application [[Grindr]] reported that the [[Google Play|Android store]]'s recommendation algorithm was linking Grindr to applications designed to find sex offenders, which critics said inaccurately related homosexuality with pedophilia. Writer Mike Ananny criticized this association in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', arguing that such associations further stigmatized [[History of gay men in the United States|gay men]].&lt;ref name="Ananny"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ananny|first1=Mike|title=The Curious Connection Between Apps for Gay Men and Sex Offenders|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/the-curious-connection-between-apps-for-gay-men-and-sex-offenders/237340/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] de-listed 57,000 books after an algorithmic change expanded its "adult content" blacklist to include any book addressing sexuality or gay themes, such as the critically acclaimed novel ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''.&lt;ref name="Kafka2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kafka|first1=Peter|title=Did Amazon Really Fail This Weekend?

== Obstacles to research ==

Several problems impede the study of large-scale algorithmic bias, hindering the application of academically rigorous studies and public understanding.&lt;ref name="Seaver" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Lack of transparency ===
Commercial algorithms are proprietary, and may be treated as [[trade secrets]].&lt;ref name="Seaver" /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Sandvig2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandvig|first1=Christian|last2=Hamilton|first2=Kevin|last3=Karahalios|first3=Karrie|last4=Langbort|first4=Cedric|editor1-last=Gangadharan|editor1-first=Seeta Pena|editor2-last=Eubanks|editor2-first=Virginia|editor3-last=Barocas|editor3-first=Solon|title=An Algorithm Audit|journal=Data and Discrimination: Collected Essays|date=2014|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/research/An%20Algorithm%20Audit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|183}} Treating algorithms as trade secrets protects companies, such as [[Web search engine|search engines]], where a transparent algorithm might reveal tactics to manipulate search rankings.&lt;ref name="Granka"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Granka|first1=Laura A.|title=The Politics of Search: A Decade Retrospective|journal=The Information Society|date=27 September 2010|volume=26|issue=5|pages=364–374|doi=10.1080/01972243.2010.511560|url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36914.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|366}} This makes it difficult for researchers to conduct interviews or analysis to discover how algorithms function.&lt;ref name="Kitchin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=Thinking critically about and researching algorithms|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=25 February 2016|volume=20|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154087}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} Critics suggest that such secrecy can also obscure possible unethical methods used in producing or processing algorithmic output.&lt;ref name="Granka" /&gt;{{rp|369}}

=== Complexity ===
Algorithmic processes are [[Complex system|complex]], often exceeding the understanding of the people who use them.&lt;ref name="Seaver" /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Sandvig2" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Large-scale operations may not be understood even by those involved in creating them.&lt;ref name="LaFrance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaFrance|first1=Adrienne|title=The Algorithms That Power the Web Are Only Getting More Mysterious|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/not-even-the-people-who-write-algorithms-really-know-how-they-work/406099/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 November 2017|date=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and processes of contemporary programs are often obscured by the inability to know every permutation of a code's input or output.&lt;ref name="IntronaWood" /&gt;{{rp|183}}

Social scientist [[Bruno Latour]] has identified this process as [[blackboxing]], a process in which "scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pandora's hope: essays on the reality of science studies|author=Bruno Latour|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1999|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have critiqued the black box metaphor, suggesting that current algorithms are not one black box, but a network of interconnected ones.&lt;ref name="KubitschkoKaun"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdzMDQAAQBAJ|title=Innovative Methods in Media and Communication Research|last1=Kubitschko|first1=Sebastian|last2=Kaun|first2=Anne|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-40700-5|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}

An example of this complexity can be found in the range of inputs into customizing feedback. The social media site Facebook factored in at least 100,000 data points to determine the layout of a user's social media feed in 2013.&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGee|first1=Matt|title=EdgeRank Is Dead: Facebook's News Feed Algorithm Now Has Close To 100K Weight Factors|url=https://marketingland.com/edgerank-is-dead-facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-now-has-close-to-100k-weight-factors-55908|website=Marketing Land|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, large teams of programmers may operate in relative isolation from one another, and be unaware of the cumulative effects of small decisions within connected, elaborate algorithms.&lt;ref name="Introna1" /&gt;{{rp|118}} Not all code is original, and may be borrowed from other libraries, creating a complicated set of relationships between data processing and data input systems.&lt;ref name="Kitchin" /&gt;{{rp|22}}

Additional complexity occurs through [[machine learning]] and the personalization of algorithms based on user interactions such as clicks, time spent on site, and other metrics. These personal adjustments can confuse general attempts to understand algorithms.&lt;ref name="Granka" /&gt;{{rp|367}}&lt;ref name="Sandvig2" /&gt;{{rp|7}} One unidentified streaming radio service reported that it used five unique music-selection algorithms it selected for its users, based on their behavior. This creates different experiences of the same streaming services between different users, making it harder to understand what these algorithms do.&lt;ref name="Seaver" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
Companies also run frequent [[A/B tests]] to fine-tune algorithms based on user response. For example, the search engine [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] can run up to ten million subtle variations of its service per day, creating different experiences of the service between each use and/or user.&lt;ref name="Seaver" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Lack of data about sensitive categories ===
A significant barrier to understanding the tackling of bias in practice is that categories, such as demographics of individuals protected by [[anti-discrimination law]], are often not explicitly considered when collecting and processing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veale|first=Michael|last2=Binns|first2=Reuben|date=2017|title=Fairer machine learning in the real world: Mitigating discrimination without collecting sensitive data|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=205395171774353|doi=10.1177/2053951717743530|ssrn=3060763|url-access=|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, there is little opportunity to collect this data explicitly, such as in [[device fingerprint]]ing, [[ubiquitous computing]] and the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]. In other cases, the data controller may not wish to collect such data for reputational reasons, or because it represents a heightened liability and security risk. It may also be the case that, at least in relation to the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], such data falls under the 'special category' provisions (Article 9), and therefore comes with more restrictions on potential collection and processing.

Algorithmic bias does not only include protected categories, but can also concerns characteristics less easily observable or codifiable, such as political viewpoints. In these cases, there is rarely an easily accessible or non-controversial [[ground truth]], and removing the bias from such a system is more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Binns|first=Reuben|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|last3=Kleek|first3=Max Van|last4=Shadbolt|first4=Nigel|date=13 September 2017|orig-year=|title=Like Trainer, Like Bot?

Furthermore, false and accidental [[correlations]] can emerge from a lack of understanding of protected categories, for example, insurance rates based on historical data of car accidents which may overlap, strictly by coincidence, with residential clusters of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Claburn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claburn|first1=Thomas|title=EU Data Protection Law May End The Unknowable Algorithm – InformationWeek|url=https://www.informationweek.com/government/big-data-analytics/eu-data-protection-law-may-end-the-unknowable-algorithm/d/d-id/1326294?|website=InformationWeek|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and tools==
There have been several attempts to create methods and tools that can detect and observe biases within an algorithm. These emergent field focuses on tools which are typically applied to the data used by the program rather than the algorithm's internal processes. These methods may also analyze a program's output and its usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/ Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1610.02413|last1=Hardt|first1=Moritz|title=Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning|last2=Price|first2=Eric|last3=Srebro|first3=Nathan|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/25/microsoft-is-developing-a-tool-to-help-engineers-catch-bias-in-algorithms/ Microsoft is developing a tool to help engineers catch bias in algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/1268520/facebook-says-it-has-a-tool-to-detect-bias-in-its-artificial-intelligence/ Facebook says it has a tool to detect bias in its artificial intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/pymetrics/audit-ai open source]) Pymetrics audit-ai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/venturebeat.com/2018/05/31/pymetrics-open-sources-audit-ai-an-algorithm-bias-detection-tool/amp/ Pymetrics open-sources Audit AI, an algorithm bias detection tool&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/dssg/aequitas open source Aequitas: Bias and Fairness Audit Toolkit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dsapp.uchicago.edu/aequitas/ open-sources Audit AI, Aequitas at University of Chocago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/02/mitigating-bias-ai-models/ Mitigating Bias in AI Models&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, a new [[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE standard]] is being drafted that aims to specify methodologies which help creators of algorithms eliminate issues of bias and articulate transparency (i.e. to authorities or [[End user|end users]]) about the function and possible effects of their algorithms. The project was approved February 2017 and is sponsored by the [https://www.computer.org/web/standards/s2esc Software &amp; Systems Engineering Standards Committee], a committee chartered by the [[IEEE Computer Society]]. A draft of the standard is expected to be submitted for balloting in June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koene|first=Ansgar|date=June 2017|title=Algorithmic Bias: Addressing Growing Concerns [Leading Edge]|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/MTS.2017.2697080|journal=IEEE Technology and Society Magazine|language=en-US|volume=36|issue=2|pages=31–32|doi=10.1109/mts.2017.2697080|issn=0278-0097|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/project/7003.html|title=P7003 - Algorithmic Bias Considerations|website=standards.ieee.org|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==

=== Europe ===
The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), the [[European Union]]'s revised data protection regime that was implemented in 2018, addresses "Automated individual decision-making, including profiling" in Article 22. These rules prohibit "solely" automated decisions which have a "significant" or "legal" effect on an individual, unless they are explicitly authorised by consent, contract, or [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] law. Where they are permitted, there must be safeguards in place, such as a right to a [[human-in-the-loop]], and a non-binding [[right to an explanation]] of decisions reached. While these regulations are commonly considered to be new, nearly identical provisions have existed across Europe since 1995, in Article 15 of the [[Data Protection Directive]]. The original automated decision rules and safeguards found in French law since the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bygrave|first=Lee A|title=AUTOMATED PROFILING|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0267364901001042|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=17|issue=1|pages=17–24|doi=10.1016/s0267-3649(01)00104-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDPR addresses algorithmic bias in profiling systems, as well as the statistical approaches possible to clean it, directly in [[Recital (law)|recital]] 71,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veale|first=Michael|last2=Edwards|first2=Lilian|date=2018|title=Clarity, Surprises, and Further Questions in the Article 29 Working Party Draft Guidance on Automated Decision-Making and Profiling|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3071679|ssrn=3071679|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10046182/1/Veale%201-s2.0-S026736491730376X-main%281%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that&lt;blockquote&gt; ... the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate ... that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like the non-binding [[right to an explanation]] in recital 71, the problem is the non-binding nature of [[Recital (law)|recitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wachter|first=Sandra|last2=Mittelstadt|first2=Brent|last3=Floridi|first3=Luciano|date=1 May 2017|title=Why a Right to Explanation of Automated Decision-Making Does Not Exist in the General Data Protection Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/idpl/article/7/2/76/3860948|journal=International Data Privacy Law|volume=7|issue=2|pages=76–99|doi=10.1093/idpl/ipx005|issn=2044-3994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been treated as a requirement by the [[Article 29 Working Party]] that advised on the implementation of data protection law,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; its practical dimensions are unclear. It has been argued that the Data Protection Impact Assessments for high risk data profiling (alongside other pre-emptive measures within data protection) may be a better way to tackle issues of algorithmic discrimination, as it restricts the actions of those deploying algorithms, rather than requiring consumers to file complaints or request changes.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=23 May 2017|title=Slave to the Algorithm?

=== United States ===
The United States has no general legislation controlling algorithmic bias, approaching the problem through various state and federal laws that might vary by industry, sector, and by how an algorithm is used.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singer|first1=Natasha|title=Consumer Data Protection Laws, an Ocean Apart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/technology/consumer-data-protection-laws-an-ocean-apart.html|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many policies are self-enforced or controlled by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="Singer" /&gt; In 2016, the Obama administration released the [[National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan]],&lt;ref name="ObamaAdmin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obama|first1=Barack|title=The Administration's Report on the Future of Artificial Intelligence|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/10/12/administrations-report-future-artificial-intelligence|website=whitehouse.gov|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=26 November 2017|language=en|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to guide policymakers toward a critical assessment of algorithms. It recommended researchers to "design these systems so that their actions and decision-making are transparent and easily interpretable by humans, and thus can be examined for any bias they may contain, rather than just learning and repeating these biases". Intended only as guidance, the report did not create any legal precedent.&lt;ref name="NSTC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=and Technology Council|first1=National Science|title=National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan|date=2016|publisher=US Government|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/national_ai_rd_strategic_plan.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

In 2017, [[New York City]] passed the first algorithmic accountability bill in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kirchner"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirchner |first1=Lauren |title=New York City Moves to Create Accountability for Algorithms — ProPublica |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/new-york-city-moves-to-create-accountability-for-algorithms |website=ProPublica |publisher=ProPublica |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en-us |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, required "the creation of a task force that provides recommendations on how information on agency automated decision systems may be shared with the public, and how agencies may address instances where people are harmed by agency automated decision systems."&lt;ref name="NYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=The New York City Council - File #: Int 1696-2017 |url=http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3137815&amp;GUID=437A6A6D-62E1-47E2-9C42-461253F9C6D0 |website=legistar.council.nyc.gov |publisher=New York City Council |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force is required to present findings and recommendations for further regulatory action in 2019.&lt;ref name="Powles"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Powles |first1=Julia |title=New York City's Bold, Flawed Attempt to Make Algorithms Accountable |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/new-york-citys-bold-flawed-attempt-to-make-algorithms-accountable |website=The New Yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''automated teller machine''' ('''ATM''') is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of [[financial institution]]s to perform [[financial transaction]]s, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfer funds, or obtaining account information, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff.

On most modern ATMs, customers are identified by inserting a plastic [[ATM card]] (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.

Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions such as [[cash]] withdrawals, check balances, or credit mobile phones. ATMs can be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's [[exchange rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schlichter |first=Sarah |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16994358/ |title=Using ATM's abroad - Travel - Travel Tips - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was operational in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;'Fast Machine With a Buck',"Pacific Star and Stripes", 7 July 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Instant Cash with a Credit Card', "ABA Banking Journal", January 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Ashfield invented the basic idea of a card combining the key and user's identity in February 1962. This was granted UK Patent 959,713 for "Access Controller" in June 1964 and assigned to W. S. Atkins &amp; Partners who employed Ashfield. He was paid ten shillings for this, the standard sum for all patents. It was originally intended to dispense petrol but the patent covered all uses.

In the US patent record, [[Luther George Simjian]] has been credited with developing a "prior art device". Specifically his 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The roll-out of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed by a couple of years, due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Match Maps Acquisition", ''The New York Times'', 22 March 1961&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental Bankograph was installed in [[New York City]] in 1961 by the [[Citibank|City Bank of New York]], but removed after six months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and did not have cash dispensing features.&lt;ref&gt;"Machine Accepts Bank Deposits", ''The New York Times'', 12 April 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/217157/From-punchcard-to-prestaging-50-years-of-ATM-innovation |title=From punchcard to prestaging: 50 years of ATM innovation |publisher=ATM Marketplace |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815222832/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/217157/From-punchcard-to-prestaging-50-years-of-ATM-innovation |archivedate=15 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed in September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe, and Malcom David Roe.

Both the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine, while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. They used principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult.

The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at [[Smiths Group]] on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to [[James Goodfellow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013n554|title=James Goodfellow, Series 2, Pioneers - BBC Radio 4 Extra|author=|date=|website=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete "currency dispenser system" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as [[NCR Corporation]] and [[IBM]] licence Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as "Prior Art Device".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/9461.html | title = Evidence from the patent record on the development of cash dispensing technology | author = B.

=== Propagation ===
Devices designed by British (i.e. Chubb, De La Rue) and Swedish (i.e. Asea Meteor) quickly spread out. For example, given its link with [[Barclays]],  [[Bank of Scotland]] deployed a DACS in 1968 under the  [http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/our-group/our-heritage/timeline/1951-1990/ 'Scotcash'] brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with £10 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.

A Chubb-made ATM appeared in [[Sydney]] in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in [[Australia]]. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.

Asea Metior's Bankomat was the first ATM installed in [[Spain]] on January 9, 1969, in downtown [[Madrid]] by [[Banesto]]. This device dispensed 1,000 [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] bills (1 to 5 max). Each user had to introduce a security personal key using a combination of the ten numeric buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/01/09/048.html | title = Bancomat (In Spanish) | author = Marino Gomez-Santos | publisher = ABC | date = 9 January 1969 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811221708/http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/01/09/048.html | archivedate = 11 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of the same year an ad with the instructions to use the Bancomat was published in the same newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/03/18/058.html | title = Bancomat Banesto (commercial ad with instructions for use in Spanish) | publisher = ABC | date = 18 March 1969 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811221714/http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/03/18/058.html | archivedate = 11 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Docutel in the United States (1969)===
After looking firsthand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the ATM was pioneered in the U.S. by [[Donald Wetzel]], who was a department head at a company called Docutel.&lt;ref name="Networld Media Group"/&gt; Docutel was a subsidiary of Recognition Equipment Inc of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which was producing optical scanning equipment and had instructed Docutel to explore automated baggage handling and automated gasoline pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Essinger  |title= ATM Networks: Their Organization, Security and Future |publisher= Elsevier International |date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1969, [[Chemical Bank]] installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in [[Rockville Centre, New York]]. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Kirkpatrick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&amp;pg=PA266 |title=1969: The Year Everything Changed |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |date=2009 |page=266 |isbn=9781602393660 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225211738/http://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&amp;pg=PA266 |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225214202/http://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;pg=PA84 |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by [[Donald Wetzel]] and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines.  Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm |title=Interview with Mr. Don Wetzel |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220214346/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]] recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm |title=Automatic teller machine |publisher=Thocp.net |work=The History of Computing Project |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215034/http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, Docutel had acquired 70 percent of the U.S. market; but as a result of the early 1970s worldwide recession and its reliance on a single product line, Docutel lost its independence and was forced to merge with the U.S. subsidiary of [[Olivetti]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Wetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3761682.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3761682&amp;RS=PN/3761682 U.S. Patent # 3,761,682]; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973. However, the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel, all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure, namely [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3662343.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3662343&amp;RS=PN/3662343 US Patent # 3,662,343], [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3651976.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3651976&amp;RS=PN/3651976 U.S. Patent # 3651976] and [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=368569.PN.&amp;OS=PN/368569&amp;RS=PN/368569 U.S. Patent # 3,68,569]. These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein, MR Karecki, TR Barnes, GR Chastian and John D. White.

===Continued improvements===
The first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, the UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]]. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a [[registered trademark]] of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK but is often used as a [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|generic trademark]] to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, [[IBM 3624]] and [[IBM 473x|473x]] series, [[Diebold 10xx]] and [[TABS 9000]] series, [[NCR 1780]] and earlier NCR 770 series.

The first switching system to enable shared automated teller machines between banks went into production operation on February 3, 1979, in Denver, Colorado, in an effort by Colorado National Bank of Denver and Kranzley and Company of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;personal knowledge of William Patterson who was there supporting the network&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest ATM at [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] allows customers to withdraw cash up to £130 without a card by inputting a six-digit code requested through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18409560 |title=ATMs to operate without a card |date=June 12, 2012 |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613035141/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18409560 |archivedate=13 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:World's Highest ATM.jpg|thumb|The world's highest ATM, located at the [[Khunjerab Pass]] in [[Pakistan]].]]
ATMs can be placed at any location but are most often placed near or inside banks, shopping centers/malls, airports, [[railway station]]s, [[metro station]]s, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, and other locations. ATMs are also found on [[cruise ship]]s and on some [[US Navy]] ships, where sailors can draw out their pay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fms.treas.gov/navycash/index.html Overview: Navy Cash/Marine Cash: Programs and Systems: Financial Management Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303190236/http://www.fms.treas.gov/navycash/index.html |date=3 March 2013 }}. Fms.treas.gov. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

ATMs may be on- and off-premises. On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive. Off-premises machines are deployed by financial institutions and Independent Sales Organisations (ISOs) where there is a simple need for cash, so they are generally cheaper single function devices.

In the US, Canada and some [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Gulf countries]], banks may have [[drive-thru]] lanes providing access to ATMs using an automobile.

In recent times, countries like India and some countries in Africa are installing ATMs in rural areas, which are solar powered.&lt;ref name="nanoATM"&gt;{{cite news |title=The nano of ATMs for rural masses comes to town |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-the-nano-of-atms-for-rural-masses-comes-to-town-1358865 |first=Balanarayan |last=NT |date=14 March 2010 |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |location=Bangalore |accessdate=May 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525014956/http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-the-nano-of-atms-for-rural-masses-comes-to-town-1358865 |archivedate=25 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial networks ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--only last paragraph is cited--&gt;
[[File:Geldautomaat.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[logo]]s of a number of [[interbank network]]s to which it is connected are shown.]]

Most ATMs are connected to [[interbank network]]s, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their accounts or in the countries where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include [[NYCE]], [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[Plus (interbank network)|PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[AFFN]], [[Interac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interac.ca/en/interac-cash-consumer.html|title=Interac Cash web page|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|access-date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], [[LINK (UK)|LINK]], [[MegaLink]], and [[BancNet]].

ATMs rely on authorization of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system.

Many banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank that operates the ATM; in other cases, they apply to all users.

In order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].

[[File:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]

ATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] on either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]].

In addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073750/http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global use ==

There are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide. Estimates developed by [[ATMIA]] place the number of ATMs currently in use at 3 million units, or approximately 1 ATM per 3000 people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmia.com/mig/globalatmclock/ |title=ATM Industry Association Global ATM Clock |publisher=Atmia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913131331/http://www.atmia.com/mig/globalatmclock/ |archivedate=13 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbrlondon.com/about/G20_Press_Release_091015.pdf|title=A million new ATMs installed in the last five years|publisher=rbrlondon.com|date=|accessdate=2016-12-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223062608/https://www.rbrlondon.com/about/G20_Press_Release_091015.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To simplify the analysis of ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed. Four regions (USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan) have high numbers of ATMs per million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interac.org/en_n3_31_abmstats.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005015130/http://www.interac.org/en_n3_31_abmstats.html |archivedate=5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss74.htm |title=Statistics on payment and settlement systems in selected countries - Figures for 2004 |publisher=Bis.org |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110117150724/http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss74.htm| archivedate= 17 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large number of ATMs, there is additional demand for machines in the Asia/Pacific area as well as in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/cpss/paysysinfo.htm |title=Central bank payment system information |publisher=Bis.org |date=2001-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110116023617/http://www.bis.org/cpss/paysysinfo.htm| archivedate= 16 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_Visa_accessing_payments_systems_Latin_America |title=EIU.com |publisher=EIU.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111073605/http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_Visa_accessing_payments_systems_Latin_America |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macau]] may have the highest density of ATMs at 254 ATMs per 100,000 adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraiser|first1=Naill|title=ATM withdrawals in Macau top HK$10 billion a month, as authorities ensure machines never run dry, source says|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2093202/atm-withdrawals-macau-top-hk10-billion-month-authorities|accessdate=5 May 2017|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=5 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505170051/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2093202/atm-withdrawals-macau-top-hk10-billion-month-authorities|archivedate=5 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ATMs have yet to reach high numbers in the Near East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/events/cbcd06e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824121535/http://www.bis.org/events/cbcd06e.pdf |archivedate=24 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's highest ATM is located at the [[Khunjerab Pass]] in [[Pakistan]]. Installed at an elevation of 15,397 feet by the [[National Bank of Pakistan]], it is designed to work in temperatures of up to -40 degree Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBP installs 'World's Highest ATM' in Pakistan|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/nbp-installs-worlds-highest-atm-in-pakistan/|website=Daily Pakistan|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427004627/https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/nbp-installs-worlds-highest-atm-in-pakistan/|archivedate=27 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==
[[File:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|upright|A block diagram of an ATM]]

An ATM is typically made up of the following devices:
* [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices)
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] or [[chip card]] reader (to identify the customer)
* [[Personal identification number|PIN]] pad EEP4 (similar in layout to a [[touch tone]] or [[calculator]] keypad), manufactured as part of a secure enclosure
* [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure
* Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction)
* [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction)
* Record printer (to provide the customer with a record of the transaction)
* [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access)
* Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to)
* Sensors and indicators

Due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of [[personal computer]]–like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.

Business owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.

New ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |title=Summary of New 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ATM Standards |publisher=firstdata.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611031808/http://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.&lt;ref&gt;

The vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. [[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault.

Mechanisms found inside the vault may include:
* Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value)
* Deposit mechanism including a cheque processing module and bulk note acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits)
* Security sensors (magnetic, thermal, seismic, gas)
* Locks (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault)
* Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on in-house standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of notes dispensed, etc. This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability.

ATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |title=ATM ATM Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Atmdepot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019065405/http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry standard vault configurations include [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [[UL-291]] "Business Hours" and Level 1 Safes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |title=Scope for UL 291 |publisher=Ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com |date=2004-12-21 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105114749/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |archivedate=5 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RAL (standards institute)|RAL]] TL-30 derivatives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122113838/http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/13.310.htm|title=Home |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |title=BSI: Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment &amp; Certification |publisher=Bsonline.bsi-global.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012163647/http://bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tritonatm.com/en/service/manuals/07100-00008F%20(9100UsrMan(5.0)).pdf |title=Triton Systems &amp;#124; ATM manufacturer |publisher=Tritonatm.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-02-11}} {{Dead link |date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.&lt;ref name=tunnel /&gt;

== Software ==
[[File:Windows XP sighted 'in the wild' on a cash point, 3 August 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Although the operating system has been off support by Microsoft for over four years as of August 2018, a significant number of cash points still use versions of [[Microsoft Windows XP|Windows XP]], as seen with this machine at a branch of [[Tesco Express]] in [[Slough]], Berkshire.]]
With the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial "off-the-shelf" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]].

[[File:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]]]]

Today, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}{{update inline|date=September 2015|reason=Are the machines still using such an old operating system?

There is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) [[real-time operating system]]s (RTOS). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine|title=Risks search results for "cash machine"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based [[Vortex Engineering]] is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux.
Common application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |title=Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language |publisher=selfserviceworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329032543/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |archivedate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.

While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's [[Write once run anywhere|"Write once, run anywhere"]] mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences among various platforms.

With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch.

With the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |title=Technology News: Security: Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern |publisher=Technewsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318100752/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{main|Security of automated teller machines}}
[[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.

=== Physical ===
[[File:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]].]]

Early ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by [[ram-raiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|title=Things to Keep in Mind when Opting for Free ATM Placements|date=|accessdate=2015-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090102/http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.

Another attack method, ''plofkraak'', is to seal all openings of the ATM with [[silicone]] and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |title=ATM bombings up 3000% |accessdate=2011-04-07 |date=2008-07-12 |publisher=News24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114174333/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theft has occurred in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|title=Dutch blaggers explode ATMs|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810130621/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |title=Attacks on banks devised in Europe - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629151743/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.

Several attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.&lt;ref name=tunnel&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |title=Thieves dig 100ft tunnel to steal cash in Levenshulme |accessdate=2012-01-02 |date=2012-01-14 |publisher=BBC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114052858/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of [[Intelligent banknote neutralisation system|Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems]].

A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.

=== Transactional secrecy and integrity ===

The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be "[[trusted system]]s".

Encryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012175105/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. [[Message Authentication Code]] (MAC) or [[Partial MAC]] may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.

=== Customer identity integrity ===
[[File:Japanese ATM Palm Scanner.jpg|thumb|A [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ|BTMU]] ATM with a [[palm scanner]] (to the right of the screen)]]

There have also been a number of incidents of fraud by [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718062007/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-18 |title=The No. 1 ATM security concern |publisher=ATM Marketplace |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |title=Diebold ATM Fraud |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930071206/http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140906/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris recognition|iris]], and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175306/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Device operation integrity ===
[[File:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|upright|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal- and weather- resistant.]]

Openings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.

To protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.

Rules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&amp;lmf=11440&amp;mode=readdoc&amp;tmf=11440|title=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto|work=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |title=Banking |publisher=Moneycentral.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417111312/http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer security ===
[[File:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|left|Dunbar armored personnel watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]]]]

In some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |title=NYSBD - Text of the ATM Safety Act |publisher=Banking.state.ny.us |date=1997-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410044556/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |archivedate=10 April 2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], The [[New York State]] Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |title=DiNapoli Calls for Better Oversight of Bank ATMs |publisher=Osc.state.ny.us |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610044250/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230352/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230332/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, July 30, 1986, Page 18232 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |title=ATM Report |publisher=Obre.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104220104/http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm Credit Union tech-talk news and technology resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073753/https://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm |date=16 October 2015 }}.

In 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an [[emergency telephone number]] switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.

In China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.

As of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html Could Reverse PIN Save Lives at ATM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013150036/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html |date=13 October 2014 }}.

===Jackpotting===
The term {{em|jackpotting}} is used to describe one method criminals utilize to steal money from an ATM.  The thieves gain physical access through a small hole drilled in the machine. They disconnect the existing hard drive and connect an external drive using an industrial endoscope. They then depress an internal button that reboots the device so that it is now under the control of the external drive. They can then have the ATM dispense all of its cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=ATM makers warn of 'jackpotting' hacks on U.S. machines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-atms-usa/atm-makers-warn-of-jackpotting-hacks-on-u-s-machines-idUSKBN1FG0WU |quote= |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=January 27, 2018 |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HDD Encryption===
In recent years, many ATMs also encrypt the hard disk. This means that actually creating the software for jackpotting is a lot more difficult to do.

ATMs were originally developed as cash dispensers, and have evolved to provide many other bank-related functions: 
* Paying routine bills, fees, and taxes (utilities, phone bills, social security, legal fees, income taxes, etc.)
* Printing or ordering [[bank statement]]s
* Updating [[passbook]]s
* [[Cash advance]]s

Videoconferencing teller machines are currently referred to as Interactive Teller Machines. Benton Smith, in the Idaho Business Review writes "The software that allows interactive teller machines to function was created by a Salt Lake City-based company called uGenius, a producer of video banking software. NCR, a leading manufacturer of ATMs, acquired uGenius in 2013 and married its own ATM hardware with uGenius' video software." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idahobusinessreview.com/2016/06/16/interactive-teller-machines-allow-tellers-to-work-remotely/|title=Interactive teller machines allow tellers to work remotely|last=Smith|first=Benton Alexander|date=June 16, 2016|work=The Idaho Business Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both [[Test Money|test money]] and the [[Front and back ends|backend]] computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |title=Barking Up the Wrong Tree – Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction in Retail Banking in the UK - Page 5 |publisher=Managementjournals.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116061441/http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |archivedate=16 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Allison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,875749,00.html |title=ATM gives out free cash and lands family in court &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2003-01-16|accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122012524/http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.

This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | work=BBC News | title=Double money in cash point error | date=2004-04-28 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115111715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | archivedate=15 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628204818/http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |archivedate=28 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Mad rush to faulty ATM in France |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044752/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s; envelope deposit mechanisms); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error.

To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.

Improper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving [[counterfeit]] banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910100650/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080511084240/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2008 |title=Materials- Bank Notes- Bank of Canada |publisher=Bankofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany]] has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/geldanlage/:Falschgeld-Bl%FCten-Geldautomat/523625.html |title=Falschgeld: Blüten aus dem Geldautomat? - Wirtschaft |publisher=Stern.De |date=2004-05-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem.
[[Bill validator|Bill validation]] technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |title=Wincor Nixdorf Germany |language=de |publisher=Wincor-nixdorf.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225656/http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, whenever a transaction fails with an ATM due to network or technical issue and if the amount does not get dispensed in spite of account being debited then the banks are supposed to return the debited amount to the customer within 7 working days from the day of receipt of complaint. Banks are also liable to pay the late fees in case of delay in repayment of funds post 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_RTI_Diclosure_Logs.aspx?fn=9&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.

The first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |title=1.05: The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |first=Phil |last=Patton |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073146/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himself—and many subsequent customers—to walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy |title=Video |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222545/http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=%2Fvideo%2Ftech%2F2006%2F09%2F14%2Fowens.va.atm.scam.wavy |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of scam was featured on the TV series ''[[The Real Hustle]]''.

ATM behaviour can change during what is called "stand-in" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html |title=Kennison v Daire [1986&amp;#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=1986-02-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Card fraud ===
In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[personal identification number]] (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.

For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.

This type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |title=ATM Security Issues &amp; ATM Fraud Issues by Geography &amp;#124; ATMSecurity.com ATM Security news ATM Security issues ATM fraud info ATM |publisher=Atmsecurity.com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024215333/http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724213440/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |archivedate=24 July 2008 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''', involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp|title=Skimming with ATM Cameras : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 March 2016|work=snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]]. Older chip-card security systems include the French [[Carte Bleue]], [[Visa Cash]], [[Mondex]], [[Blue from American Express]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |title=What the Hell Do Smart Cards Do? |publisher=Fast Company |date=2002-02-28 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223645/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[EMV 96|EMV '96 or EMV 3.11]]. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as [[EMV 2000|EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x]].

[[EMV]] is widely used in the UK ([[Chip and PIN]]) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easy–to–copy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Four more held in fake credit card racket case |publisher=The Hindu |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810232850/http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.

Card cloning and [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a "MagnePrint" or "BluPrint", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.

The concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fredric L. Rice, Organised Crime Civilian Response |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |title=Phrack Classic Volume Three, Issue 32, File #1 of XX Phrack Classic Newsletter Issue XXXII |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121231232/http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than £1&amp;nbsp;million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as £10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Castell |url=http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |title=Seeking after the truth in computer evidence: any proof of ATM fraud? — ITNOW |publisher=Itnow.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184756/http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=pepsi says: |url=http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |title=Why is there braille on drive-up ATMs? |publisher=Zidbits |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129211251/http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |archivedate=29 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].

A postal [[interactive kiosk]] may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |title=Postal Service Mailing Kiosks Now In Every State |publisher=Usps.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103030043/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |archivedate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm Automated Postal Centers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413211117/http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm |date=13 April 2016 }}.

A [[scrip cash dispenser]] may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |title=About Script ATMs: How Do Cashless ATMs Work? - What is Scrip, or Cashless ATMs? |publisher=Atmscrip.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324150807/http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |archivedate=24 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[teller assist unit]] (TAU) is  distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.

A Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a [[Card reader#Smart card readers|smart card reader]]. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in [[Taiwan]] provide these online services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |title=Megabank WebATM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319155928/https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |title=Post Office Bank WebATM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409144215/https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11722">The ''Bender Machine Works'' in Hayward, Wisconsin, is a dairy equipment manufacturer that played a major role in the history of the dairy farming business in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s, producing [[milk pipeline]] and milk transfer cart components, and washing/vacuum-releasing equipment.

The company continues to be in business but now focuses its manufacturing on [[private label]] [[electromechanical]] milk pipeline washing systems.

The '''Bender Washer/Releaser''' was a vacuum-operated device first invented and patented by Lloyd Bender of Hayward, WI, USA in the 1950s, used to both wash dairy milking equipment and to transfer milk from piping containing a vacuum, into a storage tank at normal atmospheric pressure.

As a non-electric pneumatically operated device, the washer/releaser could be used on small dairy farms without electricity that used an engine to supply milking vacuum, and used well water to cool milk.

The Washer/Releaser could be used in association with both dairy pipelines and the ''Step-Saver'', a milk transfer cart used with bucket milkers. The Step-Saver and the Washer/Releaser were once extremely common in the 1960s to 1980s on small family dairy farms in the United States, to reduce the labor of bucket milking before the [[milk pipeline]] became more popular.

[[File:Washing the Step-saver.jpg|thumb|Washing out a step-saver system in a Wisconsin dairy farm's milkhouse, probably in 1999 or 2004. The white oval above and to the left of the woman's head is a Bender washer/releaser, partially obscured by a jar that drained moisture from the system.]]
=== Purpose and Usage ===
''(Expanded topic section from [[Dairy farming]] article.)''

As barns began to increase in size from perhaps 6 to 12 cows to 30 or 40 cows, the bucket milker became a very laborious milking system. As the barn length increased, the farmer had to walk an increasing distance from the cow to the milk bulk tank to dump the collected milk. An early vacuum milk-transport system known as the Step-Saver was developed to save the farmer the trouble of carrying the heavy steel buckets of milk all the way back to the storage tank in the milkhouse. The system used a very long vacuum hose coiled around a receiver cart, and connected to a vacuum-breaker device in the milkhouse.

Following milking each cow, the bucket milker would be dumped into the receiver cart. A foot pedal on the base of the cart lifted the cover, which kept contaminating dust and debris out of the cart, and allowed the farmer to hold the heavy bucket milker with both hands while pouring. A diffuser plate in the top of the cart prevented milk from splashing out while rapidly pouring the milk, and a large filter disk under the diffuser removed any debris from the milk.

Milk collected in a chamber below the filter, and was slowly sucked through the long hose to the milkhouse. When empty, a large float ball in the bottom of the cart would settle down over the drain hole to seal the line and retain system vacuum. When milk was poured into the cart, the ball would float up, unsealing the drain.

An automatic vacuum breaker in the milkhouse cyclically pulled milk from the cart into a glass jar using system vacuum, followed by a release of vacuum to atmospheric pressure, allowing the milk to flow into the bulk tank by gravity flow. When the float level in the jar dropped to setpoint, system vacuum was reapplied to restart the process. Check valves on the vacuum breaker milk hose prevented milk from flowing backwards to the cart when the jar vacuum was released.

As the farmer milked the cows in series, the cart would be rolled further down the center aisle, the long milk hose unwrapped from the cart, and hung on open hooks along the ceiling of the aisle.

===Wisconsin legislative code references===
Use of the step saver and similar non-pipeline milk transfer systems is described in the legislative code of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/code/atcp/atcp060.pdf Wisconsin Register, April, 2009, No. 640, Page 418 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''ATCP 60.10 Milking and milk handling systems.'''

: ''(4) NON−PIPELINE SYSTEMS. If milk from milking animals is initially collected in a portable transfer receptacle and pumped to the milkhouse through a flexible tube, rather than being pumped directly to the milkhouse through a permanently mounted pipeline, the transfer receptacle and tube system shall comply with the following requirements:''

: ''(a) The portable transfer receptacle shall be constructed of stainless steel or an equally corrosion resistant metal, and shall have an overlapping self−closing cover. The receptacle shall be supported off the floor on a cart or mobile structure which can be easily cleaned.''

: ''(b) The tube used to transfer milk from the portable transfer receptacle to the milkhouse shall consist of a single length of transparent tubing material. The milk transfer tube shall be supported off the floor at all times. The interior milk contact surface of the transfer tube shall be mechanically cleaned, sanitized and dried after each use. The opening through which the milk transfer tube enters the milkhouse shall be kept closed when the tube is not in use. A milk transfer tube shall not be left suspended in a milking barn or parlor between uses, but shall be stored in the milkhouse.''

==Electromechanical pipeline washing==
The Bender Machine Works also developed some of the first automated "wash-in-place" [[milk pipeline]] systems, which is generally constructed similar to an [[automatic dishwasher]] with automated fill, drain, soap dispensing, and various wash cycles. They continue to manufacture these washing systems today.

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]], is shiny and transparent after firing, which needs only about {{convert|800|C}}.  It has been used for about 2,000 years around the Mediterranean, in Europe, and China. It includes ''[[sancai]]'' and [[Victorian majolica]].
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]].

''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M. Slimani, and A. Aoues. "Toxic Effect of Lead on Kidney Function in Rat Wistar." African Journal of Biochemistry Research 4.2 (2010): 21–27. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
As of 2012, over 650 ceramic manufacturing establishments were reported in the United States.&lt;ref name="Division"/&gt; Floor tile, wall tile, sanitary-ware, bathroom accessories, kitchenware, and tableware are all potential ceramic-containing products that are available for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency. (February 2003) ''Economic Impact Analysis of the Clay Ceramics Manufacturing NESHAP: Final Rule'' (EPA Publication No. EPA-452/R-03-007).

=== Metal oxide chemistry ===
Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|Cr|2|O|3}} + 2CaO + {{frac|3|2}}{{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CaCrO|4}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">A '''chondrometer''' is a [[measuring instrument]] designed to determine the [[bulk density]] of [[grain]]. Grain density is measured in kilograms per hectolitre (Imp. pounds per [[bushel]]). It is thus also referred to as the hectolitre mass.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.measurement.gov.au/Publications/CertificateOfApproval/GeneralCertificates/GrainDensityMeasuringInstruments/Documents/4-10-0A.pdf Australian Measurement Institute Grain- Density Measuring Instruments] accessdate=21 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[Density]] is a guide to [[wheat]] quality and determines the price and the space required to store and transport the crop.&lt;ref name=maas&gt;{{cite web|title=History week: science delivers our daily bread|url=https://maas.museum/inside-the-collection/2011/09/06/history-week-science-delivers-our-daily-bread/|website=Inside the Collection|publisher=Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences|accessdate=21 October 2017|location=New South Wales|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A chondrometer consists of a filling hopper, a measuring container, a straightedge, a weighing instrument. The filling hopper allows the grain to fall into the measuring container in a reproducible pattern as several measurements are taken, and all readings need to be within a strict degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt; The measuring cylinder has flat top edge to it can levelled using the straightedge (a strickle) to give a set volume. Today, the measuring instrument can be a set of [[digital scale]]s with an accuracy greater than 0.1 g, though in the past it was a [[steelyard]] balance with the measuring cylinder hooking directly onto the scales.

==Calculation==
* ''Bulk Density (kg/hL)= Mass of Grain Captured (in kg) /Volume of measuring container (in L) x 100''
:The measuring container will usually be 1L or 0.5L to make the calculations easy.

&lt;!-- WARNING --
EDITING the following section changes this text on other articles
CHECK "What links here" for transclusions
--&gt;&lt;section begin=cf defn /&gt;'''Climbing formwork''' is a special type [[formwork]] for vertical [[concrete]] structures that rises with the building process. While relatively complicated and costly, it can be an effective solution for buildings that are either very repetitive in form (such as towers or skyscrapers) or that require a seamless wall structure (using '''gliding formwork''', a special type of climbing formwork).

Various types of climbing formwork exist, which are either relocated from time to time, or can even move on their own (usually on hydraulic jacks, required for self-climbing and gliding formworks).&lt;section end=cf defn /&gt;

== Process ==

Best known in the construction of [[tower]]s, [[skyscraper]]s and other tall vertical structures, it allows the reuse of the same formwork over and over and over for identical (or very similar) sections / [[Storey|stories]] further up the structure. It can also enable very large concrete structures to be constructed in one single pour (which may take days or weeks as the formwork rises with the process), thus creating seamless structures with enhanced strength and visual appearance, as well as reducing construction times and material costs (at the joints which would otherwise require extra reinforcement / connectors).&lt;ref name="ART"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NSX/is_7_48/ai_106389510 Chicago high-rise with self-climbing formwork]". ''Concrete Construction'', July 2003, via 'findarticles.com'. Accessed 2008-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The climbing formwork structure normally does not only contain the formwork itself, but also usually provides working space / [[scaffold]]s for construction crews. It may also provide areas for machinery and screens for weather protection, up to being fully enclosed while yet staying modular around a changing building structure.&lt;ref name="CN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunnebeck.no/pages/3629/news/detail/201 New „Tour Granite“ building in the Paris financial district]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (from a [[Hünnebeck]] press release. Accessed 2008-06-16.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Kletterschalung Detail.jpg|thumb|Crane-Climbing formwork: The working platform and the formwork are a unit]] 
* '''Climbing formwork (crane-climbing)''': in this type of climbing formwork, the formwork around the structure is displaced upwards with the help of one or more [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s&lt;ref name="AZO"/&gt; once the hardening of the concrete has proceeded far enough. This may entail lifting the whole section, or be achieved segmentally.
*'''Climbing formwork (self-climbing)''': In this type of formwork, the structure elevates itself with the help of mechanic leverage equipment (usually [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]]). To do this, it is usually fixed to sacrificial cones or rails emplaced in the previously cast concrete.&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;"Building towers over Auckland's North Shore". ''NZ Construction News'', Volume 2, Issue 3, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AZO"&gt;"[http://www.azobuild.com/details.asp?ArticleID=2967 Beetham Tower, Liverpool - innovation in climbing formwork]" (abstract from the AZoBuild.com building and construction knowledge base website. Accessed 2008-06-16.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gliding formwork''': This type of formwork is similar to the self-climbing type above. However, the climbing process is continuous instead of intermittent, and is usually only interrupted for a very short time (for example to fix the mounting mechanisms to new anchoring points). The advantage is that it will produce seamless structures, but it requires a continuous, uninterrupted process throughout, with serious potential quality and stability problems if the pour has to be stopped.

'''Compact Video Cassette''' ('''CVC''') was one of the first [[analog recording]] [[Videocassette#Cassette_formats|videocassette]] formats to use a tape smaller than its earlier predecessors of [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]], and was developed by [[Funai]] Electronics of [[Japan]] for portable use. The first model of VCR for the format was the Model 212, introduced in 1980 by both [[Funai]] and [[Technicolor]] as they had created a joint venture to manufacture and introduce the format to the [[home movies|home movie]] market. The system, which included the VCR and a hand held video camera, was very small and lightweight for its time.

== Design ==
The CVC format used a cassette slightly larger than an [[audio cassette]] (approximately 105x66x13mm) and was loaded with 6.5mm [[magnetic tape]]. Unlike most other video cassette formats that have two spools of fixed diameter, being so small in size CVC's were designed to operate in a manner similar to a standard audio cassette: as the magnetic tape vacated one spool it would pass over the head of the player and be fed to the second spool of the cassette filling it out. Initially only V30 tapes were available which ran for 30 minutes, then later V45 (45 minute) and V60 (60 minute) models were introduced. The format was released for [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] television systems (with cassettes labelled "VExx") and, like most analogue systems, tapes had to be played on machines using the same TV system as the recording.

==CVC camera and players==
[[Image:CVC-1980-Technicolor.jpg|thumb|Technicolor CVC Videocassette recorder with monitor at DC Video [http://www.dcvideo.com/],]]
Funai 212 came with a [[JVC]] model GX-44E hand held [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|Vidicon]] [[Video camera tube|tube]] camera with a [[zoom lens]]. Model 212D was the [[NTSC]] version and 212E was [[PAL]] for Europe. The deck and electronics from the 212 were also used to build the model 335 Technicolor Video Showcase, which included a colour [[video monitor]], speaker and contained an internal 12V battery. A lightweight [[television tuner]] pack was available to enable the 212 to record off-air [[television program]]ming, but since it contained no timer it was not possible to set it for unattended recordings. [[Grundig]] also produced a CVC-format VCR for the PAL market, the VP100, based on the 212E but smaller.  The VP100 weighed only 2.3&amp;nbsp;kg with [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], and had a separate power pack.  Model 212 was also available in France as a SECAM recorder, the variant letter for this model is unknown.  SECAM tapes play in monochrome on PAL players.

==Technical issues==
Technicolor hoped that CVC would compete with [[Super 8 mm film|8mm]] [[film]], but the Vidicon tube used for the bundled camera had poor low-light sensitivity, limiting its usefulness for home indoor use. An even worse attribute of the cassettes was the low quality of the tape stock which was prone to dropouts (appearing as lines of white snow) during video playback.  These dropouts would show much more prominently than on wider tape formats. A drawback of the CVC player resulted in the mechanism's loading ring frequently failing to complete its intended travel as the decks aged. The load ring failure would render the unit unusable.

According to international organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), '''cultural industries''' (sometimes also known as "[[creative industries]]") combine the creation, production, and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that are [[cultural]] in nature and usually protected by [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;. "Exploring The Cultural and Creative Industries Debate". Culture Action Europe. Retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
The notion of cultural industries generally includes textual, [[music]], [[television]], and [[film]] production and [[publishing]], as well as crafts and design. For some countries, [[architecture]], the visual and [[performing arts]], [[sport]], [[advertising]], and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance.

Cultural industries worldwide have adapted [[To The New]] digital technologies and to the arrival of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global [[oligopoly]].

'''Dalian Hi-tech Zone''' ({{zh|s=大连高新技术产业园区}} or {{zh|s=大连高新区|labels=no}}) or '''DHZ''' is an [[industrial district]] in the western suburb of [[Dalian City]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]].  It spreads about 30 kilometers along [[Lushun South Road]] and Guoshui Highway in [[Shahekou District]] and [[Lushunkou District]], where the world's [[high technology]] companies and organizations are situated.

==General Information==
The construction of DHZ started in 1991.  [[Dalian Software Park]] was added in 1998.  The second phase of Dalian Software Park was kicked off in 2003 at the site of Dalian Ascendas IT Park, which officially opened in 2007.  DHZ is often called "Lushun South Road Software Industry Belt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/2096747.htm Dalian Hi-tech Zone (Baidu Encyclopedia)] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudong.com/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E8%BF%9E%E9%AB%98%E6%96%B0%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%9A%E5%9B%AD%E5%8C%BA Dalian Hi-tech Zone (Hudong Encyclopedia)] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''diagrid''' (a [[portmanteau]] of '''diagonal grid''') is a framework of diagonally intersecting metal, concrete or wooden beams that is used in the construction of buildings and roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ian Volner|title=Dissecting Diagrid|journal=Architect|date=5 October 2011|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/structure/dissecting-diagrid.aspx|publisher=American Institute of Architects|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119015948/http://www.architectmagazine.com/structure/dissecting-diagrid.aspx|archivedate=19 November 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires less [[structural steel]] than a conventional [[steel frame]]. [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]] in New York City, designed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman, Lord Foster]], uses 21 percent less steel than a standard design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/07/nyregion/hearst-tower-echoes-trade-center-plan.html|title=Hearst Tower Echoes Trade Center Plan|author=David W. Dunlap|date=7 October 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagrid obviates the need for columns and can be used to make large column-free expanses of roofing.&lt;ref name="Boake2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terri Meyer Boake|title=Diagrid Structures: Systems, Connections, Details|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H67mBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=23 January 2014|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-03821-482-3|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another iconic building designed by Lord Foster, [[30 St Mary Axe]], known as "The Gherkin", also uses the diagrid system.

British architect [[Ian Ritchie (architect)|Ian Ritchie]] wrote in 2012: {{cquote|The origin of 'diagonal' structures is surely the Russian genius Vladimir Shukhov. He pioneered new analytical methods in many different fields, and I have been fortunate to visit some of his constructed projects more than once. Shukhov left a lasting legacy to early Soviet Russia constructivism, and as the leading engineer and mathematician during the late 19th and early 20th century he created hyperboloid, thin shell and tensile structures of extraordinary refinement and elegance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/articles/diagonal_structures.htm|title=Diagonal Structures, Diagrid Structure|author=Ian Ritchie|publisher=e-architect|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Digifold''' is a new generation of four and six corner folding device for box [[Adhesive|gluers]] and associated [[machinery]]. Development began in the late 1990s, and was first exhibited at [[IPEX (trade show)|IPEX]] 2002 trade show. A system using Siemens S7-200 [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] and Siemens Servo controllers was developed throughout the late 1990s, into the year 2000. It was the first system, in the box folding industry, to use [[carbon fibre]] as a construction material (used in the drive shafts), and advanced [[aluminium]] (aluminum) alloys in the clamping devices. Although it was not the first servo driven backfolding system, it used advanced materials to improve speed and reduce cost over comparable systems (notably from Jagenberg, Bobst and others)

The '''ELM327''' is a programmed [[microcontroller]] produced by [[ELM Electronics]] for translating the [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD) interface found in most modern cars. The ELM327 command protocol is one of the most popular PC-to-OBD interface standards and is also implemented by other vendors.

The original ELM327 is implemented on the [[PIC microcontroller|PIC18F2480]] microcontroller from [[Microchip Technology]].

ELM327 is one of a family of OBD translators from ELM Electronics. Other variants implement only a subset of the OBD protocols.

== Uses ==
{{Main|On-Board Diagnostics#OBD Applications}}

The ELM327 abstracts the low-level protocol and presents a simple interface that can be called via a [[UART]], typically by a hand-held diagnostic tool or a computer program connected by [[USB]], [[RS-232]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. New applications include smartphones.

There are a large number of programs available that connect to the ELM327.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELM327 Compatible Software|url=http://scantool.imechatronics.com/downloads.htm|website=imechatronics.com|publisher=IMechatronics|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of such software may include
* [[On-Board Diagnostics#Driver.27s Supplementary Vehicle Instrumentation|Supplementary vehicle instrumentation]]
* Reporting of error codes
* Clearing error codes

ELM327 Functions

== Pirate clones ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Elm327 clone.jpg|thumb|Typical cheap ELM327 clone without label on the controller]]
The ELM327 is a [[PIC microcontroller]] that has been customized with ELM Electronics' proprietary code that implements the testing protocols. When ELM Electronics sold version 1.0 of its ELM327, it did not enable the [[copy protection]] feature of the PIC microcontroller. Consequently, anyone could buy a genuine ELM327, and read ELM's proprietary binary microcontroller software using a [[Programmer (hardware)|device programmer]]. With this software, pirates could trivially produce ELM327 clones by purchasing the same microcontroller chips and programming them with the copied code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=83427-elm327-usb-vehicle-obd-2-scanner-tool|url=http://priuschat.com/forums/gen-iii-2010-prius-audio-electronics/83427-elm327-usb-vehicle-obd-2-scanner-tool.html|publisher=Priuschat forum|accessdate=6 May 2012}}{{dubious|reason=Forum|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ebay ELM327 mini guide|url=http://reviews.ebay.co.uk/ELM327-mini-guide-Read-Before-Buying?ugid=10000000009829308|publisher=eBay|work=User review|accessdate=6 May 2012}}{{dubious|reason=Forum|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELM327 clones were widely sold in devices claiming to contain an ELM327 device, and problems have been reported with the clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why you shouldn’t buy an Elm327 Clone|url=https://www.scantool.net/forum/index.php?topic=2379.0|publisher=Scantool|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems reflect bugs that were present in ELM's version 1.0 microcode; those making the clones may continue to sell the old version.

Although these pirate clones may contain the ELM327 v1.0 code, they may falsely report the version number as the current version provided by the genuine ELM327, and in some cases report an as-yet non-existent version.&lt;ref name=ELM327-product-info&gt;{{cite web|title=ELM327 Product Information|url=http://www.elmelectronics.com/obdic.html#ELM327|publisher=ELM Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released software versions for the ELM327 are 1.0, 1.3a, 1.4b, 2.1 and 2.2 only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELM327 SW versions|url=http://www.elmelectronics.com/obdic.html#ELM327|publisher=ELM Electronics|accessdate=31 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual function of these pirate clones is nonetheless limited to the function of the original ELM327 v1.0, with inherent deficiencies.

Most of the clones are reporting [ELM327 v1.5], despite the fact that Elm Electronics does not have a version 1.5.

We note that a free Android app "ELM327 Identifier" tests 103 different AT codes and uses this information to determine which version of the ELM327 chip is actually present (or is being emulated by a pirate chip).  Most of the pirated adapters that claim to be "v.1.5" or "v.2.1" actually fail most of the AT codes beyond v.1.4 and will not execute codes characteristic of ELM327 v.1.4b, 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2.  Further, many of the pirated clone adapters do not even have OBDII port pins 2 and 10 connected, rendering them incapable of connecting to the ECU of many Ford and GM vehicles using the SAE J1850-PWM or -VPW protocols.&lt;ref&gt;https://timyouard.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/disection-of-a-counterfeit-elm327-obdii-adapter-from-china/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ECS''' (Engineering Code Snippets) is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[project]] for [[engineering]] software codes and programs, developed at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. ECS was started in order to provide code snippets, and complete programs which can prove useful to engineers, scientists and technologists worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Engineering Code Snippets | author = Amar Kumar Behera | year = 2010 | url = https://sites.google.com/site/engineeringcodesnippets | publisher = Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code snippets in different platforms such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB, PHP, C#, and HTML are being made available through this project. All submitted codes are reviewed to ensure that they run without errors, and only then, they are published. The project uses a unique [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] feature for each code snippet which include a title, brief description about the code, specific instructions for running the code, and the creation date.

== Motivation and History ==

The web is cluttered with snippets of code, which often serve no meaningful purpose. This makes the life of a programmer very difficult, with unreliable codes that do not compile being inserted into large [[software]] projects resulting in [[Software bug|bug]]s that go undetected until reported by users. As such, this project aims to provide a comprehensive framework where code snippets are well categorized, and serve the specific function of engineering projects. The attempt made in this project is to be able to organize code snippets by category, and provide an [[Open-source software|open source]] framework, which makes it easy for programmers to access a growing, uncluttered database online and use it for the purposes of their own software development efforts. This [[open-source software|open-source]] resource also aims to facilitate the ease of use of snippets for the purposes of education of engineering principles, by providing examples that fit the [[curricula]] of [[engineering schools]].

The foundations of this project were laid in November 2009, and an [[intranet]] effort was launched as a start up point. Later this project was moved to the [[world wide web]] to facilitate global access. The project pages are licensed with a Creative Commons Attribution license, and the project aims to fulfill the [[GNU Project]] aims of freedom to run the program, freedom to access the code, freedom to redistribute the program to anyone, and freedom to improve the software,.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html Philosophy of the GNU Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gnu.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6709">The '''Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act''' ({{USBill|112|HR|1084}}, {{USBill|112|S|587}}, dubbed as the '''FRAC Act''') is a legislative proposal in the [[United States Congress]] to define [[hydraulic fracturing]] as a federally regulated activity under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. The proposed act would require the energy industry to disclose the chemical additives used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid.  The gas industry opposes the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |url=http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/07/14/gas/ |title=The FRAC Act under attack - Environment |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was introduced to both houses of the [[111th United States Congress]] on June 9, 2009.  The House bill was introduced by representatives [[Diana DeGette]], D-Colo., [[Maurice Hinchey]] D-N.Y., and [[Jared Polis]], D-Colo. The Senate version was introduced by senators [[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]], D-Pa., and [[Chuck Schumer]], D-N.Y. The bill was re-introduced to both houses of the [[112th United States Congress]] on March 15, 2011, by representative Diana DeGette and senator Bob Casey.

==Background==	 
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) blames the lack of information about the contents of hydraulic fracturing fluid on the 2005 Energy Policy Act because it exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal water laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntergasactiongroup.com.au/hgfracc.html Environmental Effects of Hydraulic Fracturing], Hunter Valley Protection Alliance, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014230033/http://www.huntergasactiongroup.com.au/hgfracc.html |date=October 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act calls for the "chemical constituents (but not the proprietary chemical formulas) used in the fracturing process."{{cn|date=January 2013}} Once these constituents are determined the information must be revealed to the public through the Internet.{{cn|date=January 2013}}  The FRAC Act states that in any case where a physician or the State finds that a medical emergency exists, and that the chemical formulas are needed to treat the ailing individual, the firm must disclose the chemical identity to the State or physician—even if that proprietary formula is a trade-secret chemical.{{cn|date=January 2013}}  Material Safety Data Sheets, required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.1200 are developed and made available to first responders and other emergency planning and response officials.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

The drilling industry does not agree with this pending policy. They see it as "an additional layer of regulation that is unneeded and cumbersome."&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Resources International. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/natural_gas/oil_gas_environ_proposals_report_jan2009.pdf Potential Economic and Energy Supply Impacts of Proposals to Modify Federal Environmental Laws Applicable to the U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Industry]. Prepared for U.S. Department of Energy. January, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Independent Petroleum Association of America]] believes that states already sufficiently regulate hydraulic fracturing. Their research suggests that federal regulation could result in the addition of about $100,000 to each new natural gas well.&lt;ref name="propublica.org"&gt;Lustgarten, Abraham. [https://www.propublica.org/feature/frac-act-congress-introduces-bills-to-control-drilling-609 FRAC Act&amp;nbsp;— Congress Introduces Twin Bills to Control Drilling and Protect Drinking Water]. ProPublica. June 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy in Depth, a lobbying group, says the new regulation would be an "unnecessary financial burden on a single small-business industry, American oil, and natural gas producers." This group also claims that the FRAC Act could result in half of the United States oil wells and one third of the gas wells being closed. Also, the bill could cause domestic gas production to drop by 245 billion cubic feet per year along with four billion dollars in lost revenue to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Tronche, John Laurent. "U.S. Representatives Unveil FRAC Act to close 'Halliburton Loophole.'" Fort Worth Business Press. June 9, 2009. www.fwbusiness.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency claims that the Safe Drinking Water Act is flexible in that it defers regulation of fracturing and drilling to the state. According to an industry-funded study, since most states currently have regulations on fracturing, they would most likely agree with the state's policy and there would not be much change.&lt;ref name="propublica.org"/&gt;

==Current status==
The [[111th United States Congress]] adjourned on January 3, 2011, without taking any significant action on the FRAC Act. The FRAC Act was re-introduced in both houses of the [[112th United States Congress]]. In the Senate, Sen. [[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]] (D-PA) introduced S. 587 on March 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-587 H.R. 1084: S. 587: FRAC Act]&lt;/ref&gt; In the House, Rep. [[Diana DeGette]] (D-CO) introduced H.R. 1084 on March 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1084 H.R. 1084: Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The FRAC Act was reintroduced by Senator Casey to the [[113th United States Congress]] as S. 1135 on Jun 11, 2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1135 S. 1135: Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and again as S. 785 on March 18, 2015 to the [[114th United States Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s785 S. 785: Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version was introduced to the [[115th United States Congress]] by Senator Casey on April 6, 2017 as S. 865&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s865 S. 865: Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works where it awaits discussion.

A '''fruit press''' is a device used to separate [[fruit]] solids - [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[Peel (fruit)|skin]]s, [[seed]]s, pulp, leaves, and [[detritus]] - from [[fruit juice]].

==History==

In the United States, [[Madeline Turner]] invented the Turner's Fruit-Press, in 1916.&lt;ref name=CSU1&gt;{{cite web|title=Madeline M.

==Cider press==
A '''cider press''' is used to crush [[apple]]s or [[pear]]s. In North America, the unfiltered juice is referred to as [[Apple cider|cider]], becoming known as apple juice once filtered; in Britain it is referred to as juice regardless of whether it is filtered or not (the term [[cider]] is reserved for the fermented (alcoholic) juice). Other products include [[Apple cider vinegar|cider vinegar]], (hard) cider, [[Apfelwein|apple wine]], [[apple brandy]], and [[Applejack (beverage)|apple jack]].

The traditional cider press is a [[ram press (food)|ram press]]. Apples are ground up and placed in a cylinder, and a [[piston]] exerts pressure. The cylinder and/or piston is "leaky"{{clarify|date=June 2015}} and the juice is forced from the solids. The traditional cider press has not changed much since the early modern period. The only difference being that in earlier versions of the press horses were used to power the machine. Diderot's Encyclopedie offers a portrayal of the traditional cider press,

"This is how the cider mill is made. Imagine a circular trough made of wood connected to two wooden millstones like those used in a windmill, but fixed differently. In a windmill, they are horizontal, but in the cider mill they are placed in the trough vertically. They are fixed to a vertical piece of wood that turns on itself and which is placed in the centre of the circular part of the trough; a long axle passes through them; the axle is joined to the vertical axis; its other end juts out from the trough; a horse → is harnessed to it; the ← horse → pulls the axle by walking round the trough, which also moves the pressing stones in the trough where the apples are pounded. When they are judged to be sufficiently crushed, that is to say, enough for all the juice to be extracted from them, the apples are removed with a wooden spade and put into a large vat nearby. Enough apples are pounded to make a pulp or pomace." &lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.844/--cider?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=horse quod.lib.umich.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cider presses often have attachments to grind the apples prior to pressing. Such combination devices are commonly referred to as cider mills.

In communities with many small [[orchard]]s, it is common for one or more persons to have a large cider mill for community use. These community mills allow orchard owners to avoid the capital, space, and maintenance requirements for having their own mill. These larger mills are typically powered by electrical or gasoline engines. Mill operators also deal with the solids, which attract [[wasp]]s or [[hornet]]s. Cider mills typically give patrons a choice between paying by the gallon/litre or splitting the cider with the mill operator.

Larger orchardists may prefer to have their own presses because it saves on fees, or because it reduces cartage. Orchardists of any size may believe their own sanitation practices to be superior to that of community mills, as some patrons of community mills may make cider from low quality fruit (windfall apples, or apples with worms). Those making speciality ciders, such as [[pear cider]], may want to have their own press.

The world's largest cider press is located in Berne, Indiana USA.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Wine press==
{{main|Wine press}}
A [[wine press]] is a device used to [[press (wine)|press]] [[grape]]s during [[wine making]].

== Oil press ==
{{main|Oil press}}
An [[oil press]] is a device used to extract oil from plants and fruits.

==DIY fruit press==
Given the simplicity of the design, and high usability with some people (e.g. those owning an orchard), some people have started building their own do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) fruit press and have uploaded detailed instructions on how to do so.

'''G.9972''' (also known as '''G.cx''') is a Recommendation developed by ITU-T that specifies a coexistence mechanism for networking transceivers capable of operating over electrical power line wiring. It allows [[G.hn]] devices to coexist with other devices implementing G.9972 and operating on the same power line wiring.&lt;ref name="BERGU14b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Berger, Lars T.|author2=Schwager, Andreas|author3=Galli, Stefano and Pagani, Pascal|author4=Schneider, Daniel M.|author5=Lioe, Hidayat.|date=February 2014|title=Current Power Line Communication Systems: A Survey|publisher=CRC Press|editor1=Berger, Lars T. |editor2=Schwager, Andreas |editor3=Pagani, Pascal and Schneider, Daniel M.|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|chapter=10|pages=253–270|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/b16540-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G.9972 received consent during the meeting of ITU-T Study Group 15, on October 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/news_events/pr/10_09_09/ UNITED NATIONS ITU-T RATIFIES G.HN STANDARD FOR WIRED HOME NETWORKING], HomeGrid Forum Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; and final approval on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/United-Nations-ITU-Ts-Ghn-Approved-as-Global-Standard-for-Wired-Home-Networking-1274797.htm United Nations ITU-T's G.hn Approved as Global Standard for Wired Home Networking]&lt;/ref&gt;

G.9972 specifies two mechanisms for coexistence between [[G.hn]] home networks and [[broadband over power lines]] (BPL) [[Internet access]] networks:
* [[Frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM), in which the available spectrum is divided in two parts: frequencies below 10 or 14&amp;nbsp;MHz (specific value can be selected by the access network) are reserved for the access network, while frequencies above them are reserved for the in-home network.
* [[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM), in which the available channel time is split equally between both networks. 50% of time slots are allocated for the access network, and 50% are allocated to the in-home network.

[[File:George foreman grill.jpg|thumb|A George Foreman Grill]]

The '''George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine''', commonly known as the '''George Foreman Grill''', is a portable electrically heated [[grill (cooking)|grill]] manufactured by [[Spectrum Brands]]. It is promoted by former [[boxing]] champion [[George Foreman]]. Since its introduction in 1994, over 100 million George Foreman grills have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

==History==
The concept for the grill was created by Michael Boehm of [[Batavia, Illinois]].  The original intention was to create an indoor grill that would provide a unique benefit of cooking on both sides at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/11/07/soho/q_foreman/|title=An Inventor's Success Story|publisher=CNN Money|author=Hope Hamashige|date=November 7, 2000|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second key benefit was to reduce the fat content of hamburgers and other meats by draining away the fat into a separate reservoir.  Michael Boehm designed the product with a [[floating hinge]] and slanted grilling surface to accommodate foods of different thicknesses and drain fat away from the food. Engineering work was done by Bob Johnson. Bob and Mike brought a JVC camcorder and a sample of the product in bright yellow to the office of Barbara Westfield at Salton.  The video was played showing fat dripping down from the grill into the collection tray.  They presented the product as:  THE FAJITA EXPRESS.  The fajita grill had been promoted at industry trade shows in the early 1990s, but received little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=160|title=Celebrity Endorsements Reach for the Stars|publisher=Brand Channel|author=A. K. Cabell|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slanted grill concept was pitched by Tsann Kuen to Salton Inc. After 1 year, and several trade shows, Salton sent samples of the grill to George Foreman's colleagues who then sent the grill to Foreman to test out. Boehm was not involved in teaming up the grill and Foreman. Salton made several changes to the technical function of the product including removing the 4 'risers' which Mike and Bob had so that the user could lift up the grill, slide in the tray (two were included) and fill taco shells.  One tray was for grease of fajita meat, and the second tray was to hold a taco shell.  This is the exact demo shown to Barbara Westfield at the original presentation at the Salton office in Mt. Prospect Illinois.

The Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, as it became known, was introduced in 1994 and promoted with distinctive [[infomercial]]s which featured Foreman. A combination of his affable personality and the unique features of the product made it a huge success. Such was the popularity of these infomercials that Foreman's famous [[tagline]], "It's so good I put my name on it!",&lt;ref name="Marketing" /&gt; is now part of [[popular culture]]. In Asia, the grill is endorsed and promoted by both George Foreman and [[Jackie Chan]].

==Design==
The product has a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design which simultaneously heats the top and bottom surfaces of the food, eliminating the need to flip it.&lt;ref name="Money" /&gt; Each heating surface is grooved to reduce contact area, and covered in a [[Non-stick surface|non-stick]] coating. The lower heating surface is angled to allow melted fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a removable drip tray, which clearly shows the amount removed from the food. This arrangement has been marketed as a way to "knock out the fat", suggesting a healthier way to cook. 

The grill is offered in various sizes for cooking individual or multiple servings.  In 2006, the George Foreman "Next Grilleration" Health Grill was launched, which features detachable grilling plates for easier cleaning. It has gone through several other versions, differing in their control interfaces and design.

In 2014, an updated Foreman Grill was released called the "Evolve Grill". The Evolve grill features interchangeable ceramic (Teflon-free) plates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://easykitchenappliances.com/george-foreman-grp4842p-multi-plate-evolve-grill-with-ceramic-grilling-plates-and-waffle-plates-review/|title=George Foreman Multi-Plate Evolve Grill With Ceramic Grilling Plates {{!}} Easy Kitchen Appliances|last=|first=|date=|website=easykitchenappliances.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the well known clam-shell design that simultaneously heats the top and bottom surfaces. The plates available are the traditional grill plates, waffle plates, a bake dish, mini burgers, a flat griddle, and a muffin pan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgeforemancooking.com/products/premium-grills/grp4842mb-evolve-grill-with-ceramic-grill-plates-and-waffle-plates-black.aspx|title=5-Serving Evolve Grill with Waffle Plates and Ceramic Grill Plates - Black {{!}} George Foreman|website=www.georgeforemancooking.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The worldwide popularity of the George Foreman grill has resulted in sales of over 100 million units since it was first launched, a feat that was achieved in a little over 15 years. Although Foreman has never confirmed exactly how much he has earned from the endorsement, [[Russell Hobbs Inc|Salton Inc]] paid him $138 million in 1999 in order to buy out the right to use his name. Previous to that he was being paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), so it is estimated he has made a total of over $200 million from the endorsement, a sum that is substantially more than he earned as a boxer.&lt;ref name="Businessweek"/&gt;

==Competition==
The success of the George Foreman Grill spawned a variety of similar [[Testimonial|celebrity-endorsed]] products such as the [[Evander Holyfield]] Real Deal Grill, for which Holyfield starred in a 2007 infomercial,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark (October 1, 2007). [https://gizmodo.com/305520/evander-holyfield-announces-real-deal-grill "Evander Holyfield Announces Real Deal Grill"]. [[Gizmodo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geek.com/gadgets/evander-holyfield-v-george-foreman-whos-got-the-better-grill-1373961/ "Evander Holyfield v. George Foreman: Who’s Got the Better Grill?"]. [[Geek.com]]. October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Carl Lewis]] Health Grill. (The [[Jackie Chan]] Grill is the same grill, but targets the Asian market, and is endorsed by both Jackie Chan and George Foreman.) None of these imitators, however, achieved the level of success of the Foreman Grill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaser |first1=Ken |title=Advertising and Sales Promotion |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=307 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVP7CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT326&amp;lpg=PT326&amp;dq="Carl+Lewis+Health+Grill"&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7C8ojFF7mL&amp;sig=fvDvrwO9HiqIMDpEGpsnsdNS5WU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUj_DZ5eLNAhVM7oMKHQG8AesQ6AEIQTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q="CarlLewisHealthGrill"&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* On the [[Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]'', it was parodied as the [[Gary Coleman]] grill.
* In U.S. version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] steps on a George Foreman Grill in "[[The Injury]]".
* On the animated television series ''[[King of the Hill]]'', the grill is a pivotal subject of the episode "Boxing Luanne", in which lead character, [[Hank Hill]], insults George Foreman by referring to the grill as a "novelty grill", leading to a livid Foreman to call for the fight between Foreman's daughter, Freeda, and Hank's niece, Luanne.
A Play-Doh set was created to look like a George Foreman grill.

[[Glass-to-metal seal]]s have been around for many years, with one of the most common uses being lamp bulb seals. A more recent invention is '''glass-ceramic-to-metal seals'''.

==Properties==
''Glass-ceramics'' are polycrystalline [[ceramic]] materials prepared by the controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally [[silicate]]s. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat-treatment schedule adopted, glass-ceramics can be prepared with tailored [[thermal expansion]] characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing to a variety of different metals, ranging from low expansion [[Tungsten|tungsten (W)]] or [[Molybdenum|molybdenum (Mo)]] to high expansion [[stainless steel]]s and [[nickel]]-based [[superalloys]].

Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer superior properties over their glass equivalents including more [[refractory]] behaviour, in addition to their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as [[vacuum]] interrupter envelopes and pyrotechnic [[actuator]]s, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with [[glass-to-metal seal]]s is required, including solid [[oxide]] [[fuel cell]]s.

==Process==
In the formation of a glass-ceramic-to-metal seal, the parts to be joined are first heated, normally under [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, in order to melt the glass and allow it to wet and flow into the metal parts, in much the same way as when preparing a more conventional [[glass-to-metal seal]]. The temperature is then normally reduced into a temperature regime where many microscopic nuclei are formed in the glass. The temperature is then raised again into a regime where the major [[crystallinity|crystalline]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s can form and grow to create the polycrystalline ceramic material with thermal expansion characteristics matched to that of the particular metal parts.

== Examples ==
The white opaque "glue" between the panel and the funnel of a colour TV [[cathode ray tube]] is a
devitrified [[solder glass]] based on the system {{chem|PbO}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}. While
this is a glass-ceramic-to-glass seal, the basic patent of S.A. Claypoole considers
glass-ceramic-to-metal seals as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3799">'''Global Mapper''' is a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software package currently developed by Blue Marble Geographics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper.php&lt;/ref&gt; that runs on [[Microsoft Windows]]. The GIS software competes with [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[GeoMedia]], [[Manifold System]], and [[MapInfo Corporation|MapInfo]] GIS products. Global Mapper handles both vector, raster, and elevation data, and provides viewing, conversion, and other general GIS features&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper-formats.php&lt;/ref&gt;. Global Mapper has an active user community with a mailing list and online forums&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalmapperforum.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History==
In 1995 the [[USGS]] was in need of a Windows viewer for their data products, so they developed the dlgv32 application for viewing their DLG (Digital Line Graph) vector data products. Between 1995 and 1998 the dlgv32 application was expanded to include support for viewing other [[USGS]] data products, including DRG (topographic maps) and DEM (digital elevation model) and SDTS-DLG and SDTS-DEM data products&lt;ref&gt;http://gisuser.com/2004/02/dlgv32-pro/&lt;/ref&gt;. The development process is described in detail in the [[USGS]] paper titled 'A Programming Exercise'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper-dlgv32.php&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1998 the [[USGS]] released the source code for '''dlgv32 v3.7''' to the public domain. In 2001, the source code for '''dlgv32''' was further developed by a private individual into the commercial product '''dlgv32 Pro v4.0''' and offered for sale via the internet. Later that same year the product was renamed to '''Global Mapper''' and become a commercial product of the company Global Mapper Software LLC&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=8402718&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[USGS]] was distributing a version of the software under the name '''dlgv32 Pro (Global Mapper)'''.

On November 2, 2011 [[Blue Marble Geographics]], at the annual user conference, announced they had purchased Global Mapper LLC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leaders-llc.com/blue-marble-geographics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hypersonic Gun Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic drawing showing principles of operation of original '''gun tunnel''']]
A '''gun tunnel''' is an intermediate altitude [[hypersonic wind tunnel]] that can be configured to produce hypersonic flows at roughly 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;km altitude. This uses a piston for isentropic compression. The hypersonic facility at [[Indian Institute of Science|IISC Bangalore]], India has a high enthalpy gun tunnel, which can produce [[Schlieren imaging]] and produce up to 8 megajoules of energy. Using a piston can be very tricky due to reflecting of shocks. At the facility, they use aluminium diaphragm to produce shocks and paper diaphragm to avoid shocks and pass through the hypersonic chamber. The pressure used is significantly higher like 30 times the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aero.iisc.ernet.in/~lhsr/web/shocktunnels.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">'''Headspace technology''' is a technique developed in the 1980s to elucidate the odor compounds present in the air surrounding various objects.  Usually the objects of interest are odoriferous objects such as plants, flowers and foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omar|first=Jone|last2=Olivares|first2=Maitane|last3=Alonso|first3=Ibone|last4=Vallejo|first4=Asier|last5=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first5=Oier|last6=Etxebarria|first6=Nestor|date=2016-04-01|title=Quantitative Analysis of Bioactive Compounds from Aromatic Plants by Means of Dynamic Headspace Extraction and Multiple Headspace Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.13257/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=81|issue=4|pages=C867–C873|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.13257|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar techniques are also used to analyze the interesting scents of locations and environments such as tea shops and saw mills. After the data is analyzed, the scents can then be recreated by a [[perfumer]].

One of the early pioneers of this technology includes [[Roman Kaiser]] who used it to measure and characterize the scents of tropical rainforest. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Roman |last=Kaiser |title=Environmental Scents at the Ligurian Coast |journal=Perfumer &amp; Flavorist |year=1997 |volume=22 |pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headspace techniques have since been used extensively to sample [[in vivo]] floral headspace of a large variety of numerous taxa and their aromatic compounds such as [[fatty acid]] derivatives ([[aldehyde]]s, [[alcohol]]s and [[ketone]]s), [[benzenoid]]s and [[isoprenoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Jette T. |last=Knudsen|first2=Lars |last2=Tollsten|first3=L.Gunnar |last3=Bergström |title=Floral scents—a checklist of volatile compounds isolated by head-space techniques |journal=Phytochemistry |year=1993 |volume=33 |number=2 |pages=253–280 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(93)85502-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The headspace equipment involves a hollow dome or sphere-like objects which forms an airtight seal and surrounds the objects of interest.

An '''icemaker''', '''ice generator''', or '''ice machine''' may refer to either a consumer device for making [[ice]], found inside a home [[freezer]]; a stand-alone appliance for making ice, or an industrial machine for making ice on a large scale. The term "ice machine" usually refers to the stand-alone appliance.

The ''ice generator'' is the part of the ice machine that actually produces the ice. This would include the evaporator and any associated drives/controls/subframe that are directly involved with making and ejecting the ice into storage. When most people refer to an ice generator, they mean this ice-making subsystem alone, minus refrigeration.

An ''ice machine'', however, particularly if described as 'packaged', would typically be a complete machine including refrigeration, controls, and dispenser, requiring only connection to power and water supplies.

The term ''icemaker'' is more ambiguous, with some manufacturers describing their packaged ice machine as an icemaker, while others describe their generators in this way.

==History==
In 1748, the first known artificial refrigeration was demonstrated by William Cullen at the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blrefrigerator.htm|title=The History of the Refrigerator and Freezers|newspaper=About.com Money|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Cullen never used his discovery for any practical purposes. This may be the reason why the history of the icemakers begins with [[Oliver Evans]], an American inventor who designed the first refrigeration machine in 1805. In 1834, [[Jacob Perkins]] built the first practical refrigerating machine using ether in a vapor compression cycle. The American inventor, mechanical engineer and physicist received 21 American and 19 English patents (for innovations in steam engines, the printing industry and gun manufacturing among others) and is considered today the father of the refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-processing/jacob-perkins|title=Jacob Perkins: Inventor of the Bathometer &amp; Pleometer|last=Mark|first=Crawford|date=June 2012|website=asme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, an American physician, [[John Gorrie]], built a refrigerator based on Oliver Evans' design to make ice to cool the air for his yellow fever patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.info/refrigerators/|title=Refrigerators|website=The Physics Hypertextbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plans date back to 1842, making him one of the founding fathers of the refrigerator. Unfortunately for John Gorrie, his plans of manufacturing and selling his invention were met with fierce opposition by [[Frederic Tudor]], the Boston “Ice King”. By then, Tudor was shipping ice from the United States to Cuba and was planning to expand his business to India. Fearing that Gorrie’s invention would ruin his business, he began a smearing campaign against the inventor. In 1851, John Gorrie was awarded ''[https://www.google.com/patents/US8080 U.S. Patent 8080]'' for an ice machine. After struggling with Tudor's campaign and the death of his partner, John Gorrie also passed away, bankrupt and humiliated. His original icemaker plans and the prototype machine are held today at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_846192|title=Gorrie Ice Machine, Patent Model|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, [[Alexander Twining]] was awarded [https://www.google.com/patents/US10221 ''U.S. Patent 10221''] for an icemaker. Twining’s experiments led to the development of the first commercial refrigeration system, built in 1856. He also established the first artificial method of producing ice.  Just like Perkins before him, James Harrison started experimenting with ether vapor compression. In 1854, [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]] successfully built a refrigeration machine capable of producing 3,000 kilograms of ice per day and in 1855 he received an icemaker patent in Australia, similar to that of Alexander Twining. Harrison continued his experiments with refrigeration. Today he is credited for his major contributions to the development of modern cooling system designs and functionality strategies. These systems were later used to ship refrigerated meat across the globe. 
[[File:AndrewMuhlPatent01.png|thumb|Icemaker Patent by Andrew Muhl, dated December 12, 1871]]
In 1867, Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine in San Antonio, Texas, to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dqr01|title=Refrigeration|work=tshaonline.org|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19270604&amp;id=pw9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lUwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6841,3361295|title=(Title obscured in source) |work=St. Petersburg Times|date=June 4, 1927|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the world's first commercial icemakers. William Riley Brown served as its president and George Jasper Golden served as its superintendent.

In 1876, German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] patented the process of liquefying gas that would later become an important part of basic refrigeration technology ([https://www.google.com/patents/US1027862 U.S. Patent 1027862]). In 1879 and 1891, two African American inventors patented improved refrigerator designs in the United States (Thomas Elkins – [https://www.google.com/patents/US221222 U.S. patent #221222]  and respectively John Standard – [https://www.google.com/patents/US455891 U.S. patent #455891]).

In 1902, the Teague family of Montgomery purchased control of the firm.  Their last advertisement in ''Ice and Refrigeration'' appeared in March 1904.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Columbus Iron Works, 1853, Historic American Engineering Record, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Department of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, controlling interest in the Columbus Iron Works passed from the Teague family to W.C. Bradely of W.C. Bradley, Co.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Professor Jurgen Hans is credited with the invention of the first ice machine to produce edible ice in 1929. In 1932 he founded a company called Kulinda and started manufacturing edible ice, but by 1949 the business switched its central product from ice to central air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuelinda.de/en/About-Us.html|title=Külinda &amp; Company - Home Page|website=www.kuelinda.de|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice machines from the late 1800s to the 1930s used toxic gases such as [[ammonia]] (NH3), [[methyl chloride]] (CH3Cl), and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) as refrigerants. During the 1920s, several fatal accidents were registered. They were caused by the refrigerators leaking methyl chloride. In the quest of replacing dangerous refrigerants – especially methyl chloride – collaborative research ensued in American corporations. The result of this research was the discovery of [[Freon]]. In 1930, General Motors and DuPont formed [[Kinetic Chemicals]] to produce Freon, which would later become the standard for almost all consumer and industrial refrigerators. The Freon produced back then was [[chlorofluorocarbon]], a moderately toxic gas causing ozone depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_1.2_Control_measures/Annex_A_-_Group_I.shtml|title=Handbook for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer - 7th Edition|last=United Nations Environment Programme|first=- Ozone Secretariat|date=2007|website=Ozone.unep.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of ice making==
All [[refrigeration]] equipments are made of four key components; the [[evaporator]], the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], the [[gas compressor|compressor]] and the [[throttle valve]]. Ice machines all work the same way. The function of the compressor is to compress low-pressure refrigerant vapor to high-pressure vapor, and deliver it to the condenser.  Here, the high-pressure vapor is condensed into high-pressure liquid, and drained out through the throttle valve to become low-pressure liquid. At this point, the liquid is conducted to the evaporator, where heat exchanging occurs, and ice is created. This is one complete refrigeration cycle.

==Consumer icemakers==

=== Freezer icemakers ===
[[File:Icemaker.jpg|right|thumb|Icemaker (for hotel customers)]]
Automatic icemakers for the home were first offered by the Servel company around 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ice "Cubes" Drop in Basket in Automatic Refrigerator|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=February 1953|volume=99|issue=2|page=300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=A8Z4tPZowm&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pulos|first=Arthur J.|title=The American design adventure, 1940–1975|year=1988|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262161060|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAlz-7XgpjwC&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;ots=Pw1KRW2HRy&amp;dq=servel%20ice%20maker&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually found inside the freezer compartment of a [[refrigerator]].  They produce crescent-shaped ice cubes from a metal [[Molding (process)|mold]].  An electromechanical or electronic [[timer]] first opens a [[solenoid valve]] for a few seconds, allowing the mold to fill with water from the [[Tap water|domestic cold water]] supply.  The timer then closes the valve and lets the ice freeze for about 30 minutes.  Then, the timer turns on a low-power electric [[heating element]] inside the mold for several seconds, to melt the ice cubes slightly so they will not stick to the mold.  Finally, the timer runs a rotating arm that scoops the ice cubes out of the mold and into a bin, and the cycle repeats.  If the bin fills with ice, the ice pushes up a [[limit switch|wire arm]], which shuts off the icemaker until the ice level in the bin goes down again.  The user can also lift up the wire arm at any time to stop the production of ice.

Later automatic icemakers in [[Samsung]] refrigerators use a flexible plastic mold. When the ice cubes are frozen, which is sensed by a [[Thermistor]], the timer causes a motor to invert the mold and twist it so that the cubes detach and fall into a bin.

Early icemakers dropped the ice into a bin in the freezer compartment; the user had to open the freezer door to obtain ice.  In 1965, Frigidaire introduced icemakers that dispensed from the front of the freezer door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brazeau|first=Mike|title=The Frigidaire Story|url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/The_Frigidaire_Story|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these models, pressing a glass against a cradle on the outside of the door runs a motor, which turns an [[screw conveyor|auger]] in the bin and delivers ice cubes to the glass.  Most dispensers can optionally route the ice through a [[mill (grinding)|crushing mechanism]] to deliver crushed ice.  Some dispensers can also dispense chilled water.

=== Portable icemakers ===
[[File:AI-120S Portable-Ice-Maker.jpg|thumb|Portable icemaker (for home use)]]
Portable icemakers are units that can fit on a countertop. They are the fastest and smallest icemakers on the market. The ice produced by a portable icemaker is bullet shaped and has a cloudy, opaque appearance. The first batch of ice can be made within 10 minutes of turning the appliance on and adding water.  The water is pumped into a small tube with metal pegs immersed in the water. Because the unit is portable, water must be filled manually. The water is pumped from the bottom of the reservoir to the freeze tray. The pegs use a heating and cooling system inside to freeze the water around them and then heat up so the ice slips off the peg and into the storage bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newair.com/articles/how-a-portable-ice-maker-works/|title=How a Portable Ice Maker Works|last=|first=|date=|website=NewAir|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice begins to form in a matter of minutes, however, the size of ice cubes depends on the freezing cycle - a longer cycle results in thicker cubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icemakerpro.com/best-portable-ice-makers/|title=10 Best Portable Ice Makers|last=Cook|first=Stella|date=2017-01-10|website=IceMakerPro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portable icemakers will not keep the ice from melting, but the appliance will recycle the water to make more ice. Once the storage tray is full, the system will turn off automatically.

=== Built-in and freestanding icemakers ===
Built-in icemakers are engineered to fit under a kitchen or bar counter, but they can be used as freestanding units. Some produce crescent-shaped ice like the ice from a freezer icemaker; the ice is cloudy and opaque instead of clear, because the water is frozen faster than in others which are clear cube icemakers. In the process, tiny air bubbles get trapped, causing the cloudy appearance of the ice. However, most under-counter ice makers are clear ice makers which in which the ice is missing the air bubbles, and therefore the ice is clear and melts much slower.

== Industrial icemakers ==

Commercial ice makers improve the quality of ice by using moving water.  The water is run down a high nickel content stainless steel evaporator. The surface must be below freezing. Salt water requires lower temperatures to freeze and will last longer. Generally used to package seafood products. Air and undissolved solids will be washed away to such an extent that in horizontal [[evaporator]] machines the water has 98% of the solids removed, resulting in very hard, virtually pure, clear ice.  In vertical evaporators the ice is softer, more so if there are actual individual cube cells. Commercial ice machines can make different sizes of ice like flakers, crushed, cube, octagon, and tube.

When the sheet of ice on the cold surface reaches the desired thickness, the sheet is slid down onto a grid of wires, where the sheet's weight causes it to be broken into the desired shapes, after which it falls into a storage bin.

===Flake ice machine===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:flakeice.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Flake ice]] --&gt;
Flake ice is made of the mixture of brine and water (max {{convert|500|g|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} salt per ton of water), in some cases can be directly made from brine water. Thickness between {{convert|1|and|15|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}}, irregular shape with diameters from {{convert|12|to|45|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}}.

The evaporator of the flake ice machine is a vertically placed drum-shape stainless steel container, equipped with the rotating blade which spins and scratches the ice off the inner wall of the drum. When operating, the principal shaft and blade spins anti-clockwise pushed by the reducer. Water is sprayed down from the sprinkler; ice is formed from the water brine on the inner wall. The water tray at the bottom catches the cold water while deflecting Ice and re-circulates it back into the sump. The sump will typically use a float valve to fill as needed during production. Flake machines have a tendency to form an ice ring inside the bottom of the drum. Electric heaters are in wells at the very bottom to prevent this accumulation of ice where the crusher does not reach. Some machines use scrapers to assist this. This system utilizes a low temperature condensing unit; like all ice machines. Most manufactures also utilize an E.P.R.V. (Evaporator pressure regulating valve.)

====Applications====
Sea water flake ice machine can make ice directly from the sea water. This ice can be used in fast cooling of fish and other sea products. The fishing industry is the largest user of flake ice machines. Flake ice can lower the temperature of cleaning water and sea products, therefore it resists the growth of bacteria and keeps the seafood fresh.

Because of its large contact and less damage with refrigerated materials, it is also applied in vegetable, fruit and meat storing and transporting.

In baking, during the mixing of flour and milk, flake ice can be added to prevent the flour from self-raising.

In most cases of biosynthesis and chemosynthesis, flake ice is used to control the reaction rate and maintain the liveness. Flake ice is sanitary, clean with rapid temperature reduction effect.

Flake ice is used as the direct source of water in concrete cooling process, more than 80% in weight. Concrete will not crack if has been mixed and poured in constant and low temperature.

Flake ice is also used for artificial snowing, so it is widely applied in ski resorts and entertainment park.

===Cube icemaker===
Cube ice machines are classified as small ice machines, in contrast to tube ice machines, flake ice machines, or other ice machines. Common capacities range from {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1755|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Since the emergence of cube ice machines in the 1970s, they have evolved into a diverse family of ice machines.

Cube ice machines are commonly seen as vertical modular devices. The upper part is an [[evaporator]], and the lower part is an ice bin. The refrigerant circulates inside pipes of self-contained evaporator{{explain|date=October 2015}}, where it conducts the heat exchange with water, and freezes the water into ice cubes. When the water is thoroughly frozen into ice, it is automatically released, and falls into the ice bin.

Ice machines can have either a self-contained refrigeration system where the compressor is built into the unit, or a remote refrigeration system where the refrigeration components are located elsewhere, often the roof of the business.  

====Compressor====
Most compressors are either positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently the most efficient type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit ({{nowrap|400–2500 RT}}){{elucidate|date=March 2012}}. They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be {{nowrap|380 V}}, {{nowrap|1000 V}}, or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor.

Screw compressors can yield the largest refrigerating effect among positive displacement compressors, with their refrigerating capacity normally ranging from {{nowrap|50 RT}} to {{nowrap|400 RT}}{{elucidate|date=March 2012}}. Screw compressors also can be divided to single-screw type and dual-screw type. Dual-screw type is more often seen in use because it is very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topicemakers.com/category/guides-by-type/|title=Guides by type Archives - Top Ice Makers|website=Top Ice Makers|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolling piston compressors and reciprocating compressors have similar refrigerating effects, and maximum refrigerating effect can reach {{nowrap|600 kW}}.{{elucidate|date=March 2012}}

Reciprocating compressors are the most common type of compressor because the technology is mature and reliable. Their refrigerating effect ranges from {{nowrap|2.2 kW}} to {{nowrap|200 kW}}.{{elucidate|date=March 2012}} They compress gas by utilizing a piston pushed by a crank shaft.

Rotary compressors, mainly used in air conditioning equipment, have a very low refrigerating effect, normally not exceeding {{nowrap|5 kW}}. They work by compressing gas using a piston pushed by a rotor, which spins in an isolated compartment.

====Condenser====
All condensers can be classified as one of three types: air cooling, water cooling, or evaporative cooling.

* An air cooling condenser uses air as the heat conducting media by blowing air through the surface of condensers, which carries heat away from the high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant vapor.
* A water cooling condenser uses water as the heat conducting media to cooling refrigerant vapor to liquid.
* An evaporative condenser cools the refrigerant vapor by using heat exchange between the evaporator pipes and the evaporated water which is sprayed on the surface of the pipes. This type of condenser is capable of working in warm environments; they are also very efficient and reliable.

===Tube ice generator===
[[File:tubeice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=tubeice alt text|Tube ice]]
A tube ice generator is an ice generator in which the water is frozen in tubes that are extended vertically within a surrounding casing—the freezing chamber. At the bottom of the freezing chamber there is a distributor plate having apertures surrounding the tubes and attached to the separate chamber into which a warm gas is passed to heat the tubes and cause the ice rods to slide down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3759061.html|title=TUBE ICE GENERATOR - STAL Refrigeration AB|work=freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tube ice can be used in cooling processes, such as temperature controlling, fresh [[fish]] freezing, and beverage [[bottle]] freezing. It can be consumed alone or with food or beverages.

== Global  Applications and Impact of Refrigeration ==
Today, there are around 2 billion household refrigerators and over 40 million square meters of cold-storage facilities operating worldwide. In the U.S. alone, over '''8 million''' ''refrigerators'' are sold each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sroc/|title=Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System|last=IPCC/TEAP Special Report|first=|date=2005|website=IPCC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond our homes, restaurants and supermarkets, refrigeration has global applications with positive impact upon the economy, technology, social dynamics, health, and the environment.

=== Global Economic Applications ===
The refrigeration industry employs more than '''2 million people worldwide''', especially in the service sectors. Refrigeration is necessary for the implementation of many current or future energy sources (hydrogen liquefying for [[alternative fuel]]s in the automotive industry and [[thermonuclear fusion]] production for the alternative energy industries). 
* The petro-chemical and pharmaceutical industries also need refrigeration, as it is used to control and moderate many types of reactions.
* Heat pumps, operating based on refrigeration processes, are frequently used as an energy-efficient way of producing heat. 
* The production and transport of cryogenic fuels (liquid hydrogen and oxygen) as well as the long-term storage of these fluids is necessary for the space industry.
* In the transportation industry, refrigeration is used in marine containers, reefer ships, refrigerated rail cars, road transport, liquefied gas tankers etc.

=== Global Health Applications ===
In the food industry, refrigeration contributes to reducing post-harvest losses while supplying safe, foods to consumers by enabling perishable foods to be preserved at all stages from production to consumption by the end-user.

In the medical sector, refrigeration is used for vaccine, organs, stem cells’ and others’ storage, while [[Cryogenics|cryotechnology]] is used in surgery and other medical research courses of action.

=== Global Environmental Applications ===
Refrigeration is used in biodiversity maintenance based on the [[cryopreservation]] of genetic resources (cells, tissues, and organs of plants, animals and micro-organisms);

Refrigeration enables the liquefaction of CO2 for underground storage, allowing the potential separation of CO2 from fossil fuels in power stations via cryogenic technology.

== The Environmental Dimension of Refrigeration ==
At an environmental level, the impact of refrigeration is due to: atmospheric emissions of refrigerant gases used in refrigerating installations and the energy consumption of these refrigerating installations which contribute to CO2 emissions – and consequently to global warming – thus reducing '''global energy resources'''. The [[Air pollution|atmospheric emissions]] of refrigerant gases are based on the leaks occurring in insufficiently leak-tight refrigerating installations or during maintenance-related refrigerant-handling processes.

Depending on the refrigerants used, these installations and their subsequent leaks can lead to: [[ozone depletion]] (chlorinated refrigerants like CFCs and HCFCs) and/or [[global warming]], by exerting an additional [[greenhouse effect]] (fluorinated refrigerants: CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs). From a consumption point of view, it is necessary to remember that households are responsible for about '''26.2% of the global energy consumption'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geode-eu.org/uploads/Presentations%20Stockholm/Energy%20Efficiency%20Directive%20-%20Eva%20Hoos.pdf|title=Energy Efficiency Directive: Making energy efficiency a priority|last=Hoos|first=Eva|date=2012-05-10|website=Geode-eu|format=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Montreal Protocol]] banned the use of CFCs followed by HCFCs, the global efforts aimed at reducing the environmental impact of refrigeration have taken three courses of action: 
# Reduction in direct emissions of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere based on better containment of refrigerants, 
# Refrigerant charge reduction and development of alternative refrigerants with negligible or no climate impact; 
# Reduction in energy consumption due to the increasing energy efficiency of refrigerating plants.

=== Alternative Refrigerants ===
In their continuous research of methods to replace ozone-depleting refrigerants and greenhouse refrigerants (CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, respectively) the scientific community together with the refrigerant industry came up with alternative all-natural refrigerants which are eco-friendly. According to a report issued by the UN Environment Programme, “''the increase in HFC emissions is projected to offset much of the climate benefit achieved by the earlier reduction in the emissions of Ozone depleting substances''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2011/11/hfc-emissions-threaten-climate-says-un/|title=HFC Emissions Threaten Climate, says UN|last=Walker|first=Leon|date=2011-11-22|website=Environmental Leader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among non-HFC refrigerants found to successfully replace the traditional ones are ammonia, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide.

==== Ammonia ====
The history of refrigeration began with the use of [[ammonia]]. After more than 120 years, this substance is still the preeminent refrigerant used by household, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. The major problem with ammonia is its '''toxicity at relatively low concentrations.''' On the other hand, ammonia has zero impact on the ozone layer and very low global warming effects. While deaths caused by ammonia exposure are extremely rare, the scientific community has come up with safer and technologically solid mechanisms of preventing ammonia leakage in modern refrigerating equipment. This problem out of the way, ammonia is considered an eco-friendly refrigerant with numerous applications.

==== Carbon Dioxide (CO2) ====
[[Carbon dioxide]] has been used as a refrigerant for many years. Just like ammonia, it has fallen in almost complete disuse due to its low critical point and its high operating pressure. Carbon dioxide has zero impact on the ozone layer and the global warming effects of the quantities required for use as a refrigerant are also negligible. Modern technology is solving such issues and CO2 is widely used today as an alternative to traditional refrigeration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emersonclimate.com/en-us/Market_Solutions/By_Solutions/CO2_solutions/Documents/Commercial-CO2-Refrigeration-Systems-Guide-to-Subcritical-and-Transcritical-CO2-Applications.pdf|title=Commercial CO2 Refrigeration Systems - Guide for Subcritical and Transcritical CO2  Applications|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Emerson Climate Technologies|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in several fields: industrial refrigeration (CO2 is usually combined with ammonia, either in [[Cascade filling system|cascade systems]] or as a volatile brine), the food industry (food and retail refrigeration), heating (heat pumps) and the transportation industry (transport refrigeration).

==== Hydrocarbons ====
[[Hydrocarbon]]s are natural products with high thermodynamic properties, zero ozone-layer impact and negligible global warming effects. One issue with hydrocarbons is that they are highly flammable, restricting their use to specific applications in the refrigeration industry.

In 2011, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has approved three alternative refrigerants to replace hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in commercial and household freezers via the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/eed8a9f289e19d3f85257966005dbf51?OpenDocument|title=12/14/2011: EPA Approves Three Alternative Refrigerants to Replace Hydrofluorocarbons in Commercial and Household Freezers/First time that hydrocarbon substitutes will be widely used in the U.S.|website=yosemite.epa.gov|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three alternative refrigerants legalized by the EPA were hydrocarbons propane, isobutane and a substance called HCR188C&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hydrocarbons21.com/articles/5135/multi-blend_hc_refrigerants_hcr188c_r441a_and_hcr188c_r443a|title=Multi-blend HC refrigerants HCR188C/R441A and HCR188C/R443A|website=hydrocarbons21.com|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a hydrocarbon blend (ethane, propane, isobutane and n-butane). HCR188C is used today in commercial refrigeration applications (supermarket refrigerators, stand-alone refrigerators and refrigerating display cases), in refrigerated transportation, automotive air-conditioning systems and retrofit safety valve (for automotive applications) and residential window air-conditioners.

=== The Future of Refrigeration ===
In October 2016, negotiators from 197 countries have reached an agreement to reduce emissions of chemical refrigerants that contribute to global warming, re-emphasizing the historical importance of the Montreal Protocol and aiming to increase its impact upon the use greenhouse gases besides the efforts made to reduce ozone depletion caused by the chlorofluorocarbons. The agreement, closed at a United Nations meeting in Kigali, Rwanda set the terms for a rapid phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/world-leaders-discuss-ban-of-climate-busting-refrigerants-1.20768|title=World leaders discuss ban of climate-busting refrigerants|last=Boyd|first=Robynne|date=2016-10-10|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be stopped from manufacturing altogether and have their uses reduced over time.

The UN agenda and the Rwanda deal aims to find a new generation of refrigerants to be safe from both an ozone layer and greenhouse effect point of view. The legally binding agreement could reduce projected emissions by as much as 88% and lower global warming with almost 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit) by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/agreement-on-refrigerant-chemicals-to-help-limit-global-warming/|title=New agreement will end use of refrigerants that enhance climate change|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Industrial sociology''', until recently a crucial research area within the field of '''sociology of work''', examines
{{quote|the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.{{sfn|Watson|2008|p=392}}}}

== Labour process theory ==
One branch of industrial sociology is [[labour process theory]] (LPT). In 1974, [[Harry Braverman]] wrote ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'', which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic production|productive]] relations from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Meiksins |first=Peter |year=1994 |title='Labor and Monopoly Capital' for the 1990s: A Review and Critique of the Labor Process Debate |magazine=Monthly Review |volume=46 |issue=6 |location=New York |issn=0027-0520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.

Braverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory [[blue-collar]] and clerical [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] labour force.
His key contribution is his "[[deskilling]]" thesis.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} and ensure higher productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers' lack of direct engagement in the production process.{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.

Braverman's contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Braverman's thesis has, however, been contested, {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=notably}} by Andrew Freidman in his work ''Industry and Labour'' (1977).{{sfn|Friedman|1977|pp=80–82}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of "responsible autonomy" can be granted to unionized or "core" workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) has been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie{{sfn|Gallie|1991}} has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual worker felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This means that Braverman's claims can't be applied to all social classes.

The notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by [[Robert Blauner]].{{sfn|Blauner|1964}} He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement.{{sfn|Blauner|1964|pp=15–16}} Individuals are powerless when they can't control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.

Blauner's claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and [[performance appraisal]] policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms.{{sfn|Jenkins|1994}} The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner's characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers' sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers' job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.

'''Information Technology Specialist''' or '''lnformation Systems Operator-Analyst''' is a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) in the [[United States Army]]. Information Technology Specialists have the responsibility of maintaining, processing and troubleshooting [[military computer]] systems and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gordon.army.mil/sigbde15/signal_battalions/447/25bait.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830023134/http://www.gordon.army.mil/sigbde15/signal_battalions/447/25bait.htm |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/enlistedjobs/a/25b.htm |title=25B - Information Technology Specialist |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Soldiers training to perform the duties of an Information Technology Specialists will attend the IT Specialists course at [[Fort Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Fort Gordon provides training for Initial Entry Training (IET) Soldiers, as well as Reclassifying Soldiers, from other Occupational Specialties, or Prior Service members. For training purposes, though all Soldiers in the course will receive the same training, they are separated as MOS-I for Initial Training, and MOS-T for re-class.

The Information Technology Specialists course is approximately 20 weeks long, and soldiers in training will be classed into one of the several phases during training. This is a continuation of the phases started in Army [[basic training]], and all service members in training regardless of rank or time in service will participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itupdate.com.au ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803031159/http://www.gordon.army.mil/sigbde15/ |date=August 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase 4===
Phase IV (weeks 1 - 3 of AIT) begins with the first week of AIT and ends when the Soldier demonstrates proficiency to move up in phase. The first opportunity to phase-up will be provided at 15 days with subsequent opportunities provided weekly thereafter. Use, possession or purchase of alcohol is prohibited during all Phases except as religious sacrament.

In order for an MOS-I Soldier to move from Phase IV to Phase V privileges, the Soldier must pass Knowledge Exam, recite the Soldier’s Creed, sing their branch song and army song, and pass Class A, Wall Locker, and Room Inspections.  Additionally, Soldiers must demonstrate proper discipline, pass all academic requirements, and pass their APFT with 60 points in each event.

===Phase 5===
Phase V (weeks 3-10 of AIT). Soldiers are authorized to wear civilian clothes, on-post pass privileges, Company Commanders can authorize extended weekend off-post pass privileges to Phase V Soldiers, however, members are subject to unit recall. Phase V Soldiers are allowed to use personal linen on their beds in accordance with policies established throughout each battalion.

Soldiers are not authorized to ride in a POV or rental car without Company Commander approval, and alcohol consumption by MOS-I Soldiers is prohibited

Married Soldiers in Phase V with PCS orders to Fort Gordon or Fort Meade may be authorized to live off-post or in GMH managed post housing, if the spouse and/or children are in the immediate area, and upon approval from their Battalion Commander.

In order for an MOS-I Soldier to move from Phase V to Phase V+ privileges the Soldier must recite the Soldier’s Creed, sing their branch song and the army song, and pass Class A, Wall Locker, and Room Inspections, complete the first level of the Structured Self Development course (SSD1)

===Phase 5+===
Phase V+ (weeks 11 through the end of AIT). Company Commanders may authorize the use of rental cars.  Company Commanders may authorize Soldiers to purchase, register, and/or possess a privately owned vehicle (POV) once Soldiers complete 21 weeks of training. Since the training is no longer 22 weeks we are not authorized to have privately owned vehicles unless on a holiday block leaves such as Christmas. They also have other privileges

==Course Information==

The '''Institute of Food Technologists''' (IFT) is an international, non-profit scientific society of professionals engaged in food science, food technology, and related areas in academia, government and industry. It has more than 17,000 members from more than 95 countries.

==History==

===Early history===
As food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the [[slaughterhouse]] for meat and poultry processing, the [[cannery]] for canned foods, and bakeries for bread, the need to have personnel trained for the food industry did also. Literature such as [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) later that year. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblith, S.A. (1993). ''Pioneers in Food Science, Volume 1: Samuel Cate Prescott – M.I.T. Dean and Pioneer Food Technologist.'' Trumball, Connecticut: Food &amp; Nutrition Press, Inc. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935, two MIT professors, [[Samuel C. Prescott]] and [[Bernard E. Proctor]] decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this.&lt;ref name="Goldblith p101"&gt;Goldblith. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President [[Karl Taylor Compton]] in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 to July 2, 1937 with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with "fifty or sixty people." 500 people actually attended the event.&lt;ref name="Goldblith p101"/&gt;

This meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by [[George J. Hucker]] of the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]] (part of [[Cornell University]]) in [[Geneva, New York]], a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this.&lt;ref name="Goldblith p102"&gt;Goldblith. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session [[Fred C. Blanck]] of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the '''Institute of Food Technologists.''' This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, [[Roy C. Newton]] of [[Swift &amp; Company]] in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer.&lt;ref name="Goldblith p102"/&gt; By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members.

===Growth===
Regional sections were established in IFT as early as 1940 in northern California (San Francisco, [[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/sections/ncift/oldguard.htm Northern California IFT Section Chairs]&lt;/ref&gt; The first IFT Award, the [[Nicholas Appert Award]] was established in 1942 by IFT's Chicago section with additional awards being established since then. For the first ten years, IFT officers were President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. In 1949, IFT moved into offices in Chicago and created a permanent position of Executive Secretary to run daily organizational operations. Retired [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Charles S. Lawrence]] was named the first Executive Secretary, a position he would hold until 1961 when he was replaced by [[Calvert L. Willey]]. During Willey's term as Executive Director (Executive Secretary 1961–1966), IFT would grow from 6,000 members in 1961 to 23,000 members in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;"In Memoriam: Calvert L. Willey." ''Food Technology'' June 1994. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, IFT Divisions were established in 1971 with the [[Refrigeration|Refrigerated]] and [[Frozen Foods]] Division being the first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/divisions/food_eng/comm/april2006/IFT-FED%20Webletter%20May%202006.htm Heldman, Dennis R. "Proposed Changes in IFT Divisions." ''IFT-FED Webletter''. May 2006. Accessed October 7, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.iftsa.org/ IFT Student Division] was established in 1975, and was reorganized in 1984 to be the IFT Student Association with the chairperson serving as a member of the IFT Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iftsa.org/whoweare/history.php IFT Student Association history]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
The governing body of IFT consists of a Board of Directors made up of the President, President-Elect, Immediate Past-President, Treasurer, Student Association President, Student Association Immediate Past President, IFT Foundation Chair, and Executive Vice President, along with twelve board members. IFT also communicates with the news media, using sixty scientists to discuss the scientific perspective on food issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/newsroom.aspx IFT-News Room]&lt;/ref&gt; IFT is also active in the international level by its membership in the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]], headquartered in [[Oakville, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iufost.org/home IUFoST links with IFT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heldman, D.R. "IFT and International Food Science." ''Food Technology.'' November 2006: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Education has always been a focus of IFT, going as far back as 1941, with the desire to have uniform education standards in food technology.&lt;ref name="HeldmanFoodScience"&gt;Heldman, D. R. "IFT and the Food Science Profession." ''Food Technology.'' October 2006. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Education standards for undergraduate students were approved by IFT in 1966 for food science and technology. These standards were revised and updated in 1977, 1992, 2001, and 2011. Today, IFT sits on the advisory council for the [[International Food Protection Training Institute]].

===IFT Annual Meeting &amp; Food Expo===
IFT largest in-person gathering is IFT’s Annual Meeting &amp; Food Expo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.am-fe.ift.org/&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which offers more than 100 scientific and applied education sessions and an expo featuring 1,000+ exhibiting companies, regularly attracts 23,000 food professionals from more than 90 countries.

===Certification===
IFT offers the Certified Food Scientist (CFS) designation. The CFS is the only globally-recognized certification for food scientists, and has more than 1600 certificants in 55 countries. The CFS program is officially endorsed by the Australian Institute of Food Science Technology (AIFST) as well as the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology (CIFST). Earning the CFS consists of meeting certain academic and work experience requirements and passing an exam in the following content areas:
* Product Development 
* Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
* Food Chemistry and Food Analysis 
* Regulatory 
* Food Microbiology 
* Food Safety 
* Food Engineering 
* Sensory Evaluation and Consumer Testing

It was designed to meet the International Standards Organization (ISO) 17024 standards for certification programs.

===Global Food Traceability Center===
IFT’s Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) is the global resource and authoritative voice on food traceability. Supported by its Founding Sponsors and guided by its Advisory Council, GFTC is designed to accelerate adoption and implementation of practical traceability solutions across the global food system.

The Center works to deliver events, research, and support services that will help to increase understanding of food traceability across four business platforms:
* Research
* Protocols &amp; Standards
* Education &amp; Training
* Technology Transfer

==Concerns==
One constant that IFT has concern with is [[food safety]], mainly with [[pathogens]] in food (see [[food microbiology]]) and how to counter these harmful bacteria. The global trade of food is also concerned with food safety and food security, specifically with ingredient availability and consumer tastes worldwide. Food traceability, food fraud, obesity, and how science and technology will help feed the world’s projected 9 billion-plus people in 2050 have all become main issues for IFT.

The '''International Small Group and Tree Planting Program''', or TIST, is a comprehensive [[sustainable development]] program for [[developing-world]] locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Case study: The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program |title=Rural development through carbon finance |last=Scholz |first=Sebastian M. |pages=27–70 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]] |isbn=978-3-631-59250-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TIST was started in 2000 and exists in [[Africa]] ([[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]]) and [[India]]. The TIST program has three separate but related aims: development, commercial opportunity, and replication.
 
The development goal of the TIST program is to empower and equip subsistence farmers to restore their natural environment, increase [[soil fertility]], create jobs, strengthen the local community, and move from [[famine]] to surplus.

==Program summary==

TIST trains and encourages small groups to develop and share "[[best practice]]s." TIST introduces improved farming and land use techniques to isolated [[subsistence farmers]] who are now planting millions of new trees. Using a combination of small group development and training programs and providing small stipends to groups, TIST helps local farmers meet their economic needs, even during severe [[dry season]]s.

Small groups agree to meet the program requirements and assure tree survival and use of improved, sustainable land use techniques for years to come. The improved farming practices and tree planting will improve local welfare by stabilizing the [[local food]] supply and by providing families with additional income from TIST tree benefits and payments.

TIST small groups are also educated about [[HIV/AIDS]] and equipped to formulate a response to this [[pandemic]] at the group and village level. Adopting conservation farming techniques increases food and decreases annual physical effort after the first [[seedbed]]s are created. Family members can continue to plant in these seedbeds year after year and have food.

Many of the 86,000 TIST farmer participants were currently using the traditional 3-stone cook stoves or handmade mud stoves.   Through work with [[Envirofit International]], TIST has been able to bring healthy cook stoves and the training necessary for an effective replacement for their traditional stoves to many of TIST members.

*TIST has made large, long-term corporate investments in engaging 50,000 Kenyan farmers in a carbon enterprise.  This private enterprise model, alongside the donor/philanthropic one, is clearly a valid and useful approach to pioneering forest carbon activities that can bring livelihood benefits to local communities.

* A striking feature of TIST is its scale and rapid growth with more than 50,000 farmer participants and six million trees planted (in Kenya) at the time of the study field work. (page 22)  http://www.tist.org/i2/kenyagrowth.php
* Aggregate benefits are the incentive package that motivates carbon sequestration activities in both the immediate and long-term.  At current carbon prices, carbon revenues seem insufficient to provide adequate inventive for tree-planting.  Co-benefits alone seem to provide sufficient rewards to compensate and exceed tree-planting costs for many, but carbon revenue is important as an organizing principle and a behavioral incentive to each tree-grower.

The '''International Software Testing Qualifications Board''' ('''ISTQB''') is a [[software testing]] qualification [[certification]] organisation that operates internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/16/stories/2008041650470200.htm|title=Emerging trends in IT-Software testing|date=16 April 2008|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in Edinburgh in November 2002, ISTQB is a non-profit association legally registered in Belgium.

ISTQB Certified Tester is a standardized qualification for software testers and the certification is offered by the ISTQB. The qualifications are based on a syllabus, and there is a hierarchy of qualifications and guidelines for accreditation and examination. The ISTQB is a software testing qualification certification organization having over 500,000 certifications issued; the ISTQB consists of 58 member boards worldwide representing 81 countries (date: May 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISTQB facts and figures|url=http://www.istqb.org/about-as/facts-figures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product portfolio ==

Current ISTQB product portfolio follows a Matrix approach characterized by
* Levels, that identify progressively increasing learning objectives
** Foundation
** Advanced
** Expert
* Streams, that identify clusters of certification modules:
** Core
** Agile
** Specialist

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Agile !! Core !! Specialist
|-
| Expert ||  || X || 
|-
| Advanced || X || X || X
|-
| Foundation || X || X || X
|-
|}

ISTQB streams focus on:
* Core – these modules correspond to the “historical” ISTQB certifications and so they:
** Cover software testing topic in a breadth-first, broad, horizontal way,
** Are valid for any technology/ methodology/ application domain
** Allow for a common understanding
* Agile – these modules address testing practices specifically for the Agile SDLC
* Specialist – these modules are new in the ISTQB product portfolio and address specific topics in a vertical way:
** They can address specific quality characteristics (e.g.: Usability; Security; Performance; etc.)
** They can address technologies that involve specific test approaches (e.g.: model based testing; mobile testing; etc.)
** They can also be related to specific test activities (e.g.: test automation; test metrics management; etc.)

==Content of exams==

The exam for the Foundation Level has a theoretical nature and requires knowledge of software development - especially in the field of software testing.

The different Advanced Level exams are more practical and require deeper knowledge in special areas. Test Manager deals with planning and control of the [[test process]]. Test Analyst concerns, amongst other things, [[review]]s and [[black box testing]] methods. Technical Test Analyst includes [[component test]]s (also called [[unit test]]), requiring knowledge of [[white box testing]] and non-functional testing methods – this section also includes [[test tool]]s.

==Pre-conditions among certifications==
Pre-conditions relate to certification exams and provide a natural progression through the ISTQB Scheme which helps people pick the right certificate and informs them about what they need to know.

The ISTQB Core Foundation is a pre-condition for any other certification.

Additional rules for ISTQB pre-conditions are summarized in the following:

* Foundation Core shall be required for Advanced Level Core;
* Foundation Core is the default pre-requisite for Foundation Level Specialist certifications unless differently stated in the specific module; as of date, all Foundation Level Specialist certifications require Foundation Core as a pre-requisite;
* Any Advanced Level Specialist or Expert Level Specialist module which is linked to a lower level Specialist module shall require certification at the lower level;
* Expert Level modules shall require certification at the corresponding Advanced Level;
* Any Advanced Level Specialist module which is not linked to a lower level Specialist module shall require the Foundations Core as a pre-condition;
Such rules are depicted from a graphical point of view in the ISTQB Product Portfolio map.

== Exam ==
The Foundation and Advanced exams consist of a [[multiple choice]] tests.&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;

Certification is valid for life (Foundation Level and Advanced Level), and there is no requirement for recertification.

Testing boards are responsible for the quality and the auditing of the examination. Worldwide there are testing boards in 57 countries (date: May 2017). In the United States, the corresponding organisation is the [[American Software Testing Qualifications Board]] (ASQTB); in Britain, the UK Testing Board (UKTB); and in India, the Indian Testing Board (ITB).&lt;ref name="Prasad"&gt;Prasad, Dr. K.V.K.K.

The first practical {{nihongo|'''Japanese [[typewriter]]'''|和文タイプライター|wabun taipuraitā|lead=yes}} was invented by [[Kyota Sugimoto]] in 1915. Out of the thousands of [[kanji]] characters, Kyota's original typewriter used 2,400 of them. He obtained the patent rights to the typewriter that he invented in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpo.go.jp/index.htm Japan Patent Office] , ''[http://www.jpo.go.jp/seido_e/rekishi_e/kyota_sugimoto.htm Kyota Sugimoto (Japanese Typewriter)]'', 28 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the popularization of [[word processor]] technology, the Japanese typewriter contributed greatly to increased efficiency of document preparation at Japanese companies and government offices.

A '''mallet''' is a kind of [[hammer]], often made of [[rubber]] or sometimes [[wood]], that is smaller than a [[Splitting maul|maul]] or beetle, and usually has a relatively large head. The term is descriptive of the overall size and proportions of the tool, and not the materials it may be made of, though most mallets have striking faces that are softer than steel.

Mallets are used in various industries, such as [[upholstery]] work, and a variety of other general purposes. It is a tool of preference for wood workers using chisels with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a positive drive. It is the most commonly used mallet.
* '''Wooden mallets''' are usually used in [[carpentry]] to knock wooden pieces together, or to drive [[dowel]]s or [[chisel]]s. A wooden mallet will not deform the striking end of a metal tool, as most metal hammers would. It is also used to reduce the force driving the cutting edge of a chisel, giving better control. Hardwood mallets are also used to knock in [[cricket bat]]s.
* '''[[Copper]], [[brass]] and [[lead]]en mallets''' are typically used on machinery to apply force to parts with a reduced risk of damaging them, and to avoid [[Spark (fire)|sparks]]. As these metals are softer than steel, the mallet is deformed by any excessive force, rather than any steel object it is hitting.
* '''Meat mallets''' [[tenderizing|tenderise]] or flatten meat. Made from wood or metal, they are typically two-sided, one flat or with slight bumps, and the other with more pronounced protrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missvickie.com/howto/meat/cubesteak.htm |title=The Truth About Cube Steaks - Pressure Cooker Knowledge |publisher=Missvickie.com |date=2001-09-05 |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913074827/http://missvickie.com/howto/meat/cubesteak.htm |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has been reduced with the invention of [[cube steak]] machines and other electric tenderisers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} but they can still be readily found at cookery stores and in professional use.

Less common mallets include:

* '''[[Plastic]] mallets''', made of [[nylon]], [[polycarbonate]], or [[polystyrene]] are used especially in leatherwork and jewellery.
* '''Split head mallets''' have removable faces which can be changed to an appropriate material for the job.
* '''Beetle mallets''' are large mallets with a circular wood or plastic head, with rounded ends about {{convert|15|to|18|in}} in diameter, and a handle about {{convert|3|ft|m}} long. It is used by paviours for tapping paving stones into position when bedding them. Beetles are also used in jobs such as [[timber framing]] to shift the bases of large wooden posts, to fit joints, and to drive in pegs.&lt;ref&gt;An illustration of the mallet can be found in Charles F. Mitchell's Building Construction, 11th edition, printed in 1930 by B.T. Batford, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Dead blow hammer|Dead blow mallets]]''' typically have an internal cavity partially filled with [[steel shot]], [[lead shot]], or loose sand. This modification evens out the time-[[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] curve of the impact, enabling a more powerful blow to be delivered without risk of marring the target.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}}

Mallets of various types are some of the oldest forms of [[tool]]s, and have been found in [[stone age]] gravesites.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Musical instruments==
{{Main|Percussion mallet}}
Mallets used as [[drum stick|drumsticks]] are often used to strike a [[marimba]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[metallophone]], or [[vibraphone]], collectively referred to as [[mallet percussion]]. The sticks usually have shafts made of [[rattan]], [[birch]], or [[fiberglass]]. Rattan shafts are more flexible than the other materials. Heads vary in size, shape, and material; they may be made of metal, plastic, rubber, or wood, and some are wrapped with [[felt]], [[Rope|cord]], or [[yarn]]. Heavier heads produce louder sounds, while harder heads produce sharper and louder sounds, with more [[overtones]].

==Toys==
Mallets are commonly used as children's toys. Lightweight wooden mallets are used for peg toys. Toy mallets are also used in games such as [[Whac-A-Mole]]. Another type of toy mallet is a plastic mallet made of soft, hollow [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], with [[bellows]] and a built-in whistle, so that when the mallet is struck, it produces a sharp, chirping sound.

==Cartoons==
The misuse of wooden mallets in the workplace became a classic gag in the [[Looney Tunes]], [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney]], and [[MGM]] cartoons, including some more recent 3D animations. Characters like [[List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters|Roger Rabbit]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Tom and Jerry]] and [[Screwy Squirrel]] made use of mallets as part of their arsenal in the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of animation.]]

On the British daytime shows [[TV-AM]] and [[GMTV]], and in the spinoff children's shows hosted by [[Timmy Mallet]], a game was played called "Mallet's Mallet" where a participant had to associate words in a certain time period. Failing contestants were hit on the head by Mallet, using a soft pink and yellow mallet with black "Mallet's Mallet" writing on both sides. The person who got hit then had a [[sticking plaster]] affixed to their head by Mallet.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

In [[slapstick]] [[anime]] and [[manga]], it is a common gag for an angry character to pull a large mallet out of [[hammerspace|thin air]], and strike the person or thing that is angering him/her.

[[File:Super-carrier_Mobile_Offshore_Base.jpeg|thumb|right|Mobile offshore base super-carrier]]
'''Mobile offshore base''' (MOB), sometimes called a '''joint mobile offshore base''' (JMOB), is a concept for supporting [[Military operation|military operations]] beyond the home shores, where conventional land bases are not available, by deploying on the high seas or in coastal waters, in-[[Theater (warfare)|theater]] multipurpose floating base assembled from individual platforms. In essence, a MOB is a multipurpose modular self-propelled floating platform, or several interconnected platforms, that can perform multiple functions of a sea base including [[Military strike|strike]], [[Military deployment|deployment]] and [[Military logistics|logistics]]. An ocean-wise  semi-submersible wave and wind resistant platform capable to move at one-half the speed of conventional prepositioning monohull cargo ship has been researched and proposed, but never built.

==Concept==
The Mobile offshore base concept emerged during a search for a more cost effective option of sustaining in-theater strike, flight, maintenance, supply and other forward logistics support needs compared with utilizing traditional joint logistics approaches including [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[Aircraft carrier|aircraft carriers]] and ''large medium speed roll-on/roll-off'' (LMSR) [[sealift]] ships. MOB modules were projected as [[semi-submersible]] units having significantly smaller wave-induced motions compared to conventional hulls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b88DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3_nhdCvC8U&amp;sig=q5HVlVPup-0I_f0d4RV_JGt45L8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BoITUMiiLdLxqQHNiIGoDg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Battle Island] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 2003, pp. 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the modularity of a MOB allows the full spectrum of [[Close air support|air support]], ranging from vertical/short takeoff and landing ([[VSTOL]]) aircraft using a single platform to conventional takeoff and landing ([[CTOL]]) aircraft utilizing several serially aligned modules approaching 2&amp;nbsp;km (6,000&amp;nbsp;feet) in length. The cluster could have an air strip that could hold a large aircraft such as [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] or [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]]. In addition, a MOB accepts ship-borne cargo, provides nominally 280,000&amp;nbsp;m² (3 million square feet) for equipment storage and maintenance, stores 40 million litres (10 million gallons) of fuel, houses up to 3,000 troops (an Army heavy [[brigade]]), and discharges resources to the shore via a variety of [[landing craft]]. It was argued, that once positioned, the MOB would operate as a sea base for an extended period, so it would need to have port-like facilities for unloading and loading conventional container and [[roll-on/roll-off]] ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/documents/goodwin/MOB_Crane_Requirements.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cargo Container Transfer Requirements for the Mobile Offshore Base |accessdate=2006-06-18 |date=1998-04-01 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of the MOB was first seriously considered when the [[United States]] entered [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] (1990–91). The U.S. was forced to request the use of allied bases, which, besides strictly military considerations, proved to be [[United States withdrawal from Saudi Arabia|politically sensitive]] in the case of [[Saudi Arabia]]. With the MOB concept the U.S. could have a base anywhere in the world in as little as a month. The base as conceived would have had virtually unlimited capabilities, and most of its creators did not envision just a floating air strip, but a town-sized base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greer|first=W.|title=Mobile Offshore Base Operational Utility and Cost Study|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA387250|publisher=[[Institute for Defense Analyses]]|date=January 2001|website=[[Defense Technical Information Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''joint mobile offshore base'' (JMOB) was a MOB concept for [[expeditionary warfare]] and humanitarian and commercial operations developed in the 1990s by [[McDermott International, Inc.]] of [[Arlington, Virginia]]. The JMOB was to be composed of five self-propelled units creating a one-mile long runway that could accommodate a fully loaded [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]]. [[NATO]] was thought to be interested in the concept at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jim (2003), [http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1281531.html "Military Joint Mobile Offshore Base"], Cover story in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April issue. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109082910/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1281531.html |date=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical report presented to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in April 2000 identified that such a base was technologically feasible and could be built by the [[List of United States defense contractors|defense industry]] of the [[United States]].

==Criticism==
In December 1999, the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR) in response to a congressional mandate issued a report which delineated the impracticality of MOBs, "the largest floating offshore structure ever conceived by maritime engineers",&lt;ref name="Paul Nagy"&gt;Paul Nagy. [http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2001/August/Pages/Setting_the6984.aspx Setting the Record Straight On Mobile Offshore Bases,] ''National Defense'', August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds of high cost and vulnerability to threats such as missile attack. In January 2001, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA) stated that MOB "would not be capable of effectively replacing conventional sealift"&lt;ref name="Paul Nagy" /&gt; because it provides an inferior delivery capability to the existing ''joint logistics over the shore'' (JLOTS) system. The report concluded that the estimated US$5 billion to US$8 billion MOB project was less cost effective than other existing at the time solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/mob.htm |title=Mobile Offshore Base |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA387250 |title=Mobile Offshore Base Operational Utility and Cost Study |accessdate=2016-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oyster''' is a [[hydro-electric]] [[wave energy]] device that uses the motion of ocean waves to generate [[electricity]]. It is made up of a Power Connector Frame (PCF), which is bolted to the seabed, and a Power Capture Unit (PCU). The PCU is a hinged buoyant flap that moves back and forth with movement of the waves. The movement of the flap drives two hydraulic pistons that feed high-pressured water to an onshore hydro-electric turbine, which drives a generator to make electricity. Oyster is stationed at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] (EMEC) at its Billia Croo site in [[Orkney]], Scotland.

Aquamarine Power installed Oyster at the EMEC in August 2009. On 20 November 2009, Oyster was officially launched and connected to the [[National Grid (UK)]] by the [[First Minister of Scotland]], [[Alex Salmond]].&lt;ref name="oyster1"&gt;[http://www.aquamarinepower.com/technologies/oyster-1 "Oyster 1".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129195443/http://www.aquamarinepower.com/technologies/oyster-1/ |date=29 November 2010 }} Aquamarine Power. Retrieved 2011-01-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Current developments are underway to build a more efficient and powerful second-generation device, Oyster 2.&lt;ref name="oyster1"/&gt;

==History==
Oyster was developed by Edinburgh-based [[Aquamarine Power]], a company that focuses on wave energy. The concept originated from research at [[Queen’s University, Belfast]], led by professor Trevor Whittaker, Head of the Wave Power Research Centre at Queen's.&lt;ref name="Queens"&gt;[http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/TheUniversity/GeneralServices/News/ArchivesPressReleases-CampusNews/2009PressReleases/02-2009PressReleases/#d.en.137560 "Queen's Energy Partnership Makes Waves for UK"]. Queen's University Belfast. Retrieved 2011-01-31&lt;/ref&gt; Aquamarine Power also teamed up with Renewable Technology Ventures Ltd (STVL),&lt;ref name="scottish-southern.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.scottish-southern.co.uk/SSEInternet/uploadedFiles/SSE_CaseStudy_AquaMarinePower.pdf "Investment Case Study: Aquamarine Power Limited"]. Scottish and Southern Energy. Retrieved 2011-01-31&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] (SEE), to fund the Oyster project. Aquamarine Power was able to secure a £6.3m investment from Scottish Enterprise. In addition, Scottish Enterprises awarded Aquamarine Power a £3.15 million grant from the Wave and Tidal Energy: Research, Development and Demonstration Support fund (WATERS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/news/2010/07/waters-grants-announced.aspx "Winners of WATERS Grant Announced".

[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6926321.ece "Wave Machine to Power Homes"]. The Sunday Times (UK). Retrieved 2011-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Aquamarine Power signed a £2.5 million contract with Fugro Seacore to install the Oyster device at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] test site at Billia Croo. Oyster was installed 400 metres offshore, west of the Orkney mainland, in 12 metre-deep water.&lt;ref name="seacore"/&gt; Oyster was installed in August 2009; however it was officially launched on 20 November 2009 by the [[First Minister of Scotland]], [[Alex Salmond]]. That same day, Oyster was connected the [[National Grid (UK)]] and began generating electricity.&lt;ref name="minister"/&gt;

Aquamarine Power hopes to commercialize Oyster and has already signed an agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy to develop up to 1000MW of wave farms by 2020.&lt;ref name="sunday times"/&gt;

==Operation==
Oyster harnesses the energy of near-shore ocean waves; it was designed to operate in water 10 to 12 metres deep. The Oyster is made up of a Power Connector Frame (PCF) and a Power Capture Unit (PCU). The 36-ton PCF is bolted to the [[seabed]] by 1-by-4 meter [[concrete piles]] that are drilled 14 metres deep into the seabed. The PCF requires careful and accurate positioning and leveling to compensate for the uneven, rocky seabed. The PCU is a 200-ton, 18-by-12-by-4 metre buoyant flap that is hinged to the PCF. In order to lower the PCU into the water to hinge it to the PCF, 120 tons of seawater must be pumped into ballast tanks within the PCU to provide sufficient negative buoyancy to aid its descent into the water. The PCU is almost entirely submerged underwater; only 2 metres of the device poke above the water. The PCU sways back and forth with the movement of the waves,&lt;ref name="seacore"&gt;[http://www.seacore.com/News/Oysternews "Oyster Wave Energy Converter Installation"]. Fugro Seacore. Retrieved 2011-01-01&lt;/ref&gt; and this movement of the flap drives two [[hydraulic]] [[piston]]s that pump high-pressured water through three sub-sea pipeline to an onshore [[hydro-electric]] [[water turbine]]. The turbine then drives a 315&amp;nbsp;kW [[electrical generator]], which converts the wave energy into electricity.&lt;ref name="tech profile"&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydrokinetic/information.aspx?type=tech&amp;id=53268cd8-74be-4a4c-bc7a-851e93bc0d06 "Technology Profile".] US Department of Energy. Retrieved 2011-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Marine Energy Centre]] classifies Oyster as an Oscillating Wave Surge Converter:

:'' This device extracts the energy caused by wave surges and the movement of water particles within them. The arm oscillates as a pendulum mounted on a  pivoted joint in response to the movement of water in the waves.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emec.org.uk/wave_energy_devices.asp " Wave Energy Devices"]. European Marine Energy Centre. Retrieved 2011-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential==
There are several advantages to using a device like the Oyster:
* Oyster itself has few moving parts underwater. Its simplicity allows for survivability: in extreme weather conditions, Oyster’s hinged flap can simply move and duck under large waves.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.aquamarinepower.com/technologies/ "Oyster Wave Power -- How It Works"]. Aquamarine Power. Retrieved 2011-01-25&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because all of Oyster’s electrical components are located onshore, the hydro-electric generator is accessible for maintenance 24/7. The actual Oyster device is near shore, making it easily accessible, as well.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;
* Oyster uses renewable energy from ocean waves to generates clean, zero-emission electricity. This minimizes the environmental risks involved compared to electricity that is produced from fossil fuels. The Carbon Trust estimates that each Oyster device can avoid over 500 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere annually.&lt;ref name="new design"&gt;Bayani, Oliver M. [http://www.ecoseed.org/en/water-power/wave-and-tidal-energy/article/64-wave-and-tidal-energy/7199-new-oyster-design-promises-more-wave-energy-output "New Oyster Device Promises More Wave Energy Output"]. Ecoseed. Retrieved 2011-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aquamarine Power estimates that a farm of 20 Oyster units could produce enough energy to power 9,000 homes.&lt;ref name="new design"/&gt;
* According to the Aquamarine Power's CEO Martin McAdam:

::''"A successful Oyster project would unlock £3-4 million of capital expenditure per MW installed, of which a significant proportion would be invested in the Orkney economy.  A commercial wave farm could therefore represent a significant boost to the local economy and would provide long-term skilled jobs for local residents. Ongoing operations and maintenance would generate a further £150,000 per annum to the local economy."'' &lt;ref name="economy"&gt;[http://www.aquamarinepower.com/news-and-events/news/latest-news/view/111/oyster-generates-1m-for-orkney-economy/ "Oyster Generates £1M for Orkney Economy"]. Aquamarine Power --News and Events. Retrieved 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

:It is estimated that advances in the marine energy industry could provide as many as 12,500 jobs, contributing £2.5 billion to the UK economy by 2020.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

*Aquamarine Power hopes to commercialize and expand the Oyster technology. Ronan Doherty, Chief Technical Officer of Aquamarine Power, found that coastlines off Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Britain, United States, South Africa, Australia and Chile have great wave energy potential and would be ideal places to install Oyster. Doherty predicts that the Oyster market has a £50 billion potential.&lt;ref name="new design"/&gt;

==Challenges==
There are also many disadvantages to using a device like the Oyster:

* The installation and production of Oyster is difficult and expensive.
**Oyster weighs over 200 tons; it must be carried out to sea in a large flat-top barge and installed in several stages. First, the PCF is lowered and bolted in the seabed, and it must be accurately positioned and leveled to compensate for the uneven seabed. Then, 120 tons of seawater must be pumped into ballast tanks within the PCU to provide sufficient negative buoyancy to aid its descent into the water to be hinged to the PCF. This complex process involves employing many workers and using expensive equipment.&lt;ref name="seacore"/&gt;
**To deploy more Oyster units, new cables will be needed to install the devices into the National Grid.&lt;ref name="renewable energy"/&gt;
* Oyster's offshore turbine and generator can produce [[noise pollution]], thereby disturbing onshore wildlife. However, most of this noise is expected to be masked by the surrounding noise generated by the wind and waves.&lt;ref name="cruz"&gt;Cruz, Joao (2008). ''Ocean Wave Energy: Current Status and Future Perspectives'', p.409-411. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. {{ISBN|978-3-540-74894-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The installation and operation of the Oyster could interfere with marine mammal life and fish life. The movement of the Oyster device produces underwater noise and vibrations. The noise can mask natural sounds (thus disturbing communication between marine wildlife), produce stress, and cause hearing loss in marine species.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt;
* Deploying several Oyster units could result in loss of habitat for marine species.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt;

==Oyster Version 2==
Current developments are underway to construct an improved, second-generation Oyster device, Oyster 2. In December 2010, Aquamarine Power signed a £4 million contract with Scotland’s leading fabrication contractor Burntisland Fabrications Ltd (BiFab).&lt;ref name="bifab"&gt;[http://www.aquamarinepower.com/news-and-events/news/latest-news/view/162/aquamarine-power-awards-4-million-oyster-2-contract-to-bifab/ "Aquamarine Power Awards £4 million Oyster 2 Contract to BiFab"]. Aquamarine Power – News and Events. Retrieved 2011-01-30&lt;/ref&gt; BiFab began manufacturing Oyster 2 at its manufacturing plant in [[Methil, Fife]], Scotland,&lt;ref name="bifab"/&gt; and the device is expected to be in full operation by the summer rine Energy Centre]].&lt;ref name="renewable energy"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/7047/aquamarine-power-51m-for-wave-device-oyster-2/ "Aquamarine Power: £5.1m for wave device Oyster 2"]. Renewable Energy Focus. Retrieved 2011-01-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquamarine Power has secured funding from many sources for the development of Oyster 2:

*In February 2010, Aquamarine Power received a grant of £5.1 million from the Marine Renewables Proving Fund (MRPF), which is funded by the United Kingdom’s [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] and managed by the [[Carbon Trust]].&lt;ref name="oyster2"&gt;[http://www.aquamarinepower.com/technologies/oyster-2/ "Oyster 2"]. Aquamarine Power. Retrieved 2011-01-25&lt;/ref&gt;
*Renewable Technology Ventures Ltd (STVL),&lt;ref name="scottish-southern.co.uk"/&gt; a subsidiary of [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] (SEE), has invested an additional £2.7 million, bringing its total investment in Aquamarine Power to £19.8 million over the last three years.&lt;ref name="sse"&gt;[http://www.scottish-southern.co.uk/SSEInternet/index.aspx?id=23488&amp;terms=oyster+2&amp;searchtype=1&amp;fragment=True "Investment in Aquamarine Power"].

*[[ABB Group|ABB]], the automation and power technology company, has invested £8 million in Aquamarine Power.&lt;ref name="sse"/&gt;

Oyster 2 will employ the same basic technology of the original Oyster; however, it will feature a different shape that will maximize the amount of energy that the device is able to capture from the waves.&lt;ref name="oyster2"/&gt; Oyster 2 will consist of three 800&amp;nbsp;kW flaps that will all be linked to one pipeline leading to an onshore 2.4 MW hydro-electric generator.&lt;ref name="oyster2"/&gt; Each flap will measure 26 metres, making it 50% larger than the original Oyster.&lt;ref name="bifab"/&gt; Oyster 2 will also have a 250% greater power output.&lt;ref name="bifab" /&gt; Aquamarine Power estimates that a small farm of 20 Oyster 2 devices will be capable of supplying enough electricity for over 12,000 homes, compared to the 9,000 homes the original Oyster is capable of powering.&lt;ref name="smart planet"&gt;Nusca, Andrew.

'''Payments as a service''' (PaaS) is a marketing phrase used to describe a [[software as a service]] to connect a group of international [[payment systems]].  The architecture is represented by a layer – or overlay – that resides on top of these disparate systems and provides for two-way communications between the payment system and the PaaS.  Communication is governed by standard APIs created by the PaaS provider.

==History==
[[File:Payments_as_a_Service_Model.png|right|500px|Payment as a platform diagram]]
Since the 1980s, credit cards and international [[wire transfer]] systems like the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT)&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 9362]], Also known as SWIFT-BIC, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT code)&lt;/ref&gt; were primary methods for making and receiving electronic cross-border payments.  Within individual countries, payers and payees have used various electronic systems to make such payments.  In the United States, for instance, the Federal Reserve Bank operates the automated clearing house (ACH) system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fms.treas.gov/ach/index.html ACH overview] on the Fed website&lt;/ref&gt; In most EU countries [[direct debit]] is the preferred method of facilitating electronic payments.  

With the advent of the World Wide Web, it became necessary to provide alternative payment systems.  At first, consumers were hesitant to use their credit cards on the Web due to security concerns.  Entrepreneurs tried to market an "electronic wallet".  As early as 1994, CyberCash allowed consumers to make secure purchases over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4TJtnkaWpp0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=1994+CyberCash&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V5tmFQc5o2&amp;sig=yhqGPz86gWHkjDpwCaslYl2Kn-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h4qGT4jLOsfBhAfLn7m1CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=1994%20CyberCash&amp;f=false Cybercash: the coming era of electronic money] – Robert Guttmann – 2003 – Business &amp; Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

CyberCash eventually failed.  In March of 2000, [[PayPal]] was formed and became a predominant electronic wallet in the U.S.  Similar regional services include [[WebMoney]] and [[Yandex.Money]] in Russia and Alipay in China.  While popular in their own countries, these do not have significant global reach.  PayPal and [[Moneybookers]] (Skrill)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PO7RM7gMrhUC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=moneybookers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dI6GT6T3DorJhAez67TQCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moneybookers&amp;f=false EOctopus in Hong Kong – A Feasibility Study] &amp;mdash; Ben Beiske, Leslie Lee, Iris Yim, David Yu&lt;/ref&gt; became regional electronic wallets, providing greater liquidity, but still do not provide for the free flow of funds between all popular electronic wallet solutions.

==PaaS layer==

PaaS is designed to allow merchants and other market participants to utilize local, regional and global payments options through a single interface.  The complexity of moving funds between providers is handled by the PaaS layer and is hidden from the user.  Generally speaking, there is only one interface between a merchant and PaaS.  Because only one interface is required, merchants or users are only required to maintain one financial repository.

[[Image:Pin_index_dimensions.JPG|right]][[Image:Pin_numbers.JPG|right]]
The '''Pin Index Safety System,''' or PISS, is a safety system that uses geometric features on the yoke to ensure that [[pneumatic]] connections between a gas cylinder and a machine that uses pressurized gases are not connected to the wrong gas yoke. This system can be seen on an [[anesthesia machine]]s and portable oxygen administration sets. It has no purpose other than a physical barrier to connecting the wrong cylinder.

==Concept==

The pin index safety system uses a face seal between the cylinder valve and the associated yoke clamp. There are two holes in specific positions on the cylinder valve body below the outlet port , in positions associated with the gas mixture, which prevent connection of the cylinder to a yoke or pressure regulator with a mis-matched set of pins. The holes accept pins 4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter by 6&amp;nbsp;mm long which are correctly aligned with the holes.&lt;ref name="Srivastava" /&gt;

==Pin index configurations==
Each gas cylinder has a pin configuration to fit its respective gas yoke. Refer to the diagram for pin numbers; dimensions are in [[millimeter]]s.

* [[Nitrous oxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]: 3,5&lt;ref name="pin code" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pin code 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Srivastava" /&gt;
* Mixture of [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nitrous oxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (50% / 50%), commonly called [[Entonox]]: 7 (a single pin, located in the centre)

==International Standards==
*International ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) and European ([[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]]) Standard
:*EN ISO 407 : Small medical gas cylinders - Pin-index yoke-type valve connections

The pin index system is a safety system (PISS) designed to ensure the correct gas is filled into the correct cylinder, and that the cylinder will only connect to the correct equipment. The positions of the holes on the cylinder valve correspond with the pins fitted to the yoke attached to the equipment. The pin positions for each medical gas are unique. If an attempt is made to fit the wrong gas cylinder to the yoke a tight seal will not be made, as the pins cannot locate.

The system requires a seal between the yoke and valve to prevent leakage. This is called a [[Bodok seal]], and is a moulded rubber washer (or [[Neoprene]]) supported by a metal rim.&lt;ref name="Srivastava" /&gt;

== Safety ==
It is possible to bypass the pin-index system if the pins are removed, damaged or corroded, if extra washers are used, or on some valves with a short face above the orifice, by inverting the gas cylinder. There is one report of the cylinder being painted the wrong colour leading to error.&lt;ref name="Naithani et al"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Betkekar|first2=Sneha Arun |last1=Naithani|first1=Udita|last3=Verma|first3=Devendra |last4=Gehlot |first4=Ravindra K |last5=Sundararaj |first5=Rajkumar |date=1 October 2016|title=Pin index safety system and color coding: is it enough?|url=http://www.asja.eg.net/text.asp?2016/9/4/626/198257|journal=Ain-Shams Journal of Anaesthesiology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=626|doi=10.4103/1687-7934.198257|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Healy and Knight 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uh-0XJkj-C8C&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=pin%20index%20system%20attached%20upside%20down&amp;pg=PA471#v=onepage&amp;q=pin%20index%20system%20attached%20upside%20down&amp;f=false|title=Wylie Churchill-Davidson's A Practice of Anesthesia 7th Edition|last=Healy|first=Thomas EJ|last2=Knight|first2=Paul R.|date=31 October 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780340731307|language=en|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goho and Kittle 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goho|first=C.|last2=Kittle|first2=P.|date=July 1991|title=Override of an N2O/O2 machine fail-safe mechanism: case report|url=http://www.aapd.org/assets/1/25/Goho-13-04.pdf|journal=Pediatric Dentistry|volume=13|issue=4|pages=234–235|issn=0164-1263|pmid=1886828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawstron and McNeill 1962"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rawstron|first=R.

==Alternative systems==

Large cylinders are more likely to be fitted with threaded connectors. One such system are the American [[Compressed Gas Association|CGA fittings]].&lt;ref name="CGA" /&gt; In Europe there are [[British Standard]] (BS), [[German Standard]] (DIN) and French (AFNOR) connections, and Japan has the Japanese Standard (JIS).

== Blanking Plugs ==

Blanking plugs (dummy cylinder heads) can be inserted into empty yokes to ensure that there is no leak out of the yoke when not in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/802047752|title=Ward's anaesthetic equipment.|last=Davey|first=Andrew|last2=Diba|first2=Ali|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|others=Davey, Andrew J., Diba, Ali., Ward, C.

'''Polyvinyl nitrate''' ('''PVN''') is a [[polymer]]ic  [[explosive material]], an [[ester]] of [[nitric acid]] and [[polyvinyl alcohol]]. It is prepared by [[nitration]] of polyvinyl alcohol or [[transesterification]] of [[polyvinyl acetate]]. It is a [[thermoplastic]] substance with softening zone between 30-45 °C, depending on the molecular weight of the starting polyvinyl alcohol.

Polyvinyl nitrate can be used in some moldable [[propellant]]s and [[explosive]]s.

Conventional ROIC technology stores the signal charge at each pixel and then routes the signal onto output taps for readout. This requires storing large signal charge at each pixel site and maintaining signal-to-noise ratio (or dynamic range) as the signal is read out and digitized.

==History==
The first robo-advisors were launched in 2008 during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008|financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/fund-industry-wakens-from-slumber-to-take-on-digital-advice-upstarts/ | title=As Robo Advisors Go Viral, Where Do Traditional Money Managers Go? | first=APARNA | last=NARAYANAN | work=[[Investor's Business Daily]] | date=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Jon Stein, a 30-year old entrepreneur, launched [[Betterment (company)|Betterment]], and robo-advisors increased in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/robo-advisors-take-on-wall-street-1432349473 | title=Robo Advisors Take On Wall Street | first=ALEXANDER | last=EULE | work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | date=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first robo-advisers were used as online interface to manage and balance client's assets by financial managers. Robo-adviser technology was not new to this field, as this kind of software has been in use by financial advisers and managers since early 2000's. But they were made publicly available in 2008 for the first to general public who were in dire need to manage their assets personally. By the end of 2015, robo-advisers from almost 100 companies around the globe were managing $60 billion assets of clients and it is estimated that it will hit $2 trillion by the end of 2020.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.algonest.com/site/robo-content/|title=https://www.algonest.com/site/robo-content/|website=www.algonest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, robo-advisor [[Wealthfront]] announced a partnership with the [[Nevada State Treasurer]] to offer a [[529 plan]] for college savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.financial-planning.com/news/wealthfront-leads-robo-expansion-into-college-savings | title=Wealthfront leads robo expansion into college savings plans | first=Andrea | last=Davis | date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Betterment raised $70 million of financing and Personal Capital raised $40 million of financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniemacconnell/2017/09/12/robo-advisors-and-the-great-money-movement/ | title=Rating the Robo-Advisors | first=ALEX | last=EULE | work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, Hong Kong based 8 Securities launched one of Asia's first robo-advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/8-securities-stock-trading-virtual-broker|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=www.techinasia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Singapore based [[StashAway]] received a capital markets services license from the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/mas-proposes-moves-to-support-growth-of-robo-advisory-firms-0|title=MAS proposes moves to support growth of robo advisory firms|last=Cua|first=Genevieve|work=The Business Times|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A robo-advisor can be defined as "a self-guided online wealth management service that provides automated investment advice at low costs and low account minimums, employing portfolio management algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.heg-fr.ch/EN/School-of-Management/Communication-and-Events/events/Pages/EventViewer.aspx?Event=patrick-schuffel.aspx|title=The Concise Fintech Compendium|last=Schueffel|first=Patrick|publisher=School of Management Fribourg/Switzerland|year=2017|isbn=|location=Fribourg|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legally, the term "financial advisor" applies to any entity giving advice about securities. Most robo-advisor services are instead limited to providing portfolio management (i.e. allocating investments among asset classes) without addressing issues such as estate and retirement planning and cash-flow management, which are also the domain of financial planning.

Other designations for these [[financial technology]] companies include "automated investment advisor", "automated investment management", "online investment advisor" and "digital investment advisor."

==Areas served==
While robo-advisors are most common in the [[United States]], they are also present in [[Europe]],&lt;ref name=robo/&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/asics-greg-medcraft-says-robo-advice-can-reduce-fees-and-conflicts-20151105-gkrmxw.html|title=ASIC's Greg Medcraft says 'robo advice' can reduce fees and conflicts}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/DOnQjdoOqd38ijz30HgtGM/Robo-advisory-could-change-distribution.html | title=Robo advisory could change distribution | first=Kayezad E. | last=Adajania | publisher=LiveMint | date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ledevoir.com/economie/actualites-economiques/452848/investissement-preparer-sa-retraite-un-texto-a-la-fois|title=Préparer sa retraite, un texto à la fois|date=October 17, 2015|newspaper=[[Le Devoir]]|pages=|language=French|trans-title=Preparing your retirement, one SMS at a time|author=François Desjardins|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wealth-summit-mesitis/singapore-start-up-to-launch-robo-adviser-to-tap-tech-savvy-rich-idUSKCN0Z10S7 | title=Singapore start-up to launch robo adviser to tap tech-savvy rich | work=[[Reuters]] | date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, [[Bmo smartfolio]] and [[Wealthsimple]] are examples of robo-advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://youngandthrifty.ca/complete-guide-to-canadas-robo-advisors/| title=Complete Guide to Canada's Robo Advisors | publisher= Kyle | date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aston|first1=David|title=Find out if you should go robo|url=http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/etfs/which-robo-advisor-is-right-for-you/ | work=[[MoneySense]] | date=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The tools they employ to manage client portfolios differ little from the portfolio management software already widely used in the profession. The main difference is in distribution channel. Until recently, portfolio management was almost exclusively conducted through human advisors and sold in a bundle with other services. Now, consumers have direct access to portfolio management tools, in the same way that they obtained access to brokerage houses like Charles Schwab and stock trading services with the advent of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T023-S002-best-of-the-online-investment-advisers-2014/index.html  |title=Best of the Online Investment Advisers | date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robo-advisors are extending into newer business avenues.

The customer acquisition costs and time constraints faced by traditional human advisors have left many middle-class investors underadvised or unable to obtain portfolio management services because of the minimums imposed on investable assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitces.com/blog/the-real-hidden-cost-that-has-been-inhibiting-financial-planning-for-the-masses/|title=The Real Hidden Cost That Has Been Inhibiting Financial Planning For The Masses | date=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average financial planner has a minimum investment amount of $50,000,&lt;ref name="AdvisorCost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.advisoryhq.com/articles/financial-advisor-fees-wealth-managers-planners-and-fee-only-advisors/ | title=How Much Does a Financial Advisor Cost? (Average RIA &amp; Financial Advisor Fees in 2016)}}&lt;/ref&gt; while minimum investment amounts for robo-advisors start as low as $500 in the United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentzen.com/best-robo-advisors#account-minimums|title=What is the Best Robo Advisor?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as low as £1 in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.off3r.com/compare/best-robo-advisors|title=Robo-Advisors Comparison with OFF3R|website=www.off3r.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to having lower minimums on investable assets compared to traditional human advisors, robo-advisors charge fees ranging from 0.2% to 1.0% of Assets Under Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/financial-services/Robo-Advisory-in-Wealth-Management.pdf | title=Cost-Income Ratios and Robo-Advisory | publisher=Deloitte Consulting GmbH |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while traditional financial planners charged average fees of 1.35% of Assets Under Management according to a survey conducted by AdvisoryHQ News.&lt;ref name="AdvisorCost" /&gt;

In the United States, robo-advisors must be [[registered investment advisor]]s, which are regulated by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. In the United Kingdom they are regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]].

==Total assets under management==
As of October 2017, robo-advisors had $224 billion in [[assets under management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/slideshows/9-things-to-know-about-robo-advisors | title=9 Things to Know About Robo Advisors | first=Wayne | last=Duggan | work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8560">'''Software craftsmanship''' is an approach to [[software development]] that emphasizes the coding skills of the [[software developer]]s themselves. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the mainstream [[software industry]], including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer accountability.

Historically, programmers have been encouraged to see themselves as practitioners of the well-defined statistical analysis and mathematical rigor of a  [[Computer Science|scientific approach]] with computational theory. This has changed to an [[Software Engineering|engineering approach]] with connotations of precision, predictability, measurement, risk mitigation, and professionalism. Practice of engineering led to calls for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading engineering knowledge and maturing the field.

The [[Agile Manifesto]], with its emphasis on "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" questioned some of these assumptions. The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto extends and challenges further the assumptions of the Agile Manifesto, drawing a metaphor between modern software development and the [[apprenticeship]] model of [[medieval Europe]].

==Overview==
The movement traces its roots to the ideas expressed in written works. [[The Pragmatic Programmer]] by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas and [[Software Craftsmanship (book) |Software Craftsmanship]] by Pete McBreen explicitly position software development as heir to the guild traditions of medieval Europe. The philosopher [[Richard Sennet]] wrote about software as a modern craft in his book The Craftsman. [[Freeman Dyson]], in his essay [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5366/1014?view=full "Science as a Craft Industry"], expands software crafts to include mastery of using software as a driver for economic benefit:
:"In spite of the rise of Microsoft and other giant producers, software remains in large part a craft industry. Because of the enormous variety of specialized applications, there will always be room for individuals to write software based on their unique knowledge. There will always be niche markets to keep small software companies alive. The craft of writing software will not become obsolete. And the craft of using software creatively is flourishing even more than the craft of writing it."

Following initial discussion, conferences were held in both London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/ |work= Parlez UML |title= Software Craftsmanship Conference |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090206204320/http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/ |archivedate= 2009-02-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ |title= Software Craftsmanship North America | work = Software Craftsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which, a manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ | work = Software Craftsmanship |title= Software Craftsmanship Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; was drafted and put online to gather signatories. This was followed by the development of practices to further develop the movement including the exchange of talent in "Craftsman Swaps" and the assessment of skills in "Craftsmanship Spikes"

==History==
In 1992, Jack W. Reeves' essay "What Is Software Design?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design.html | title = What Is Software Design? | first = Jack W | last = Reeves | publisher = Developer Dot Star | date = 2005-02-23 | accessdate = 2015-06-24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that software development is more a craft than an engineering discipline. Seven years later, in 1999, ''[[The Pragmatic Programmer]]'' was published. Its sub-title, "From Journeyman to Master", suggested that programmers go through stages in their professional development akin to the medieval guild traditions of Europe.

In 2001, Pete McBreen's book ''[[Software Craftsmanship (book) |Software Craftsmanship]]'' was published. It suggested that software developers need not see themselves as part of the engineering tradition and that a different metaphor would be more suitable.

In his August keynote at [http://agile2008.org/ Agile 2008], [[Robert Cecil Martin|Uncle Bob]] proposed a fifth value for the [[Agile Manifesto]], namely "Craftsmanship over Crap".  He later changed his proposal to "Craftsmanship over Execution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = Aug 2008 | url = http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/manifesto-fifth-craftsmanship | title = Craftsmanship – the Fifth Agile Manifesto Value? | newspaper = Infoq |  accessdate = 2015-06-24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, a number of aspiring software craftsmen met in [[Libertyville, Illinois]] with the intent of establishing a set of principles for Software Craftsmanship. Three months later, a summary of the general conclusions was decided on. It was presented publicly, for both viewing and signing, in the form of a [http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship].

In April 2009, two of the companies in the software craftsmanship movement, 8th Light and [[Obtiva]], experimented with a "Craftsman Swap."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Employee swap gives two firms new perspectives | date = 13 Jul 2009 | newspaper = Ventura county star | url = http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/Jul/13/employee-swap-gives-two-firms-new-perspectives/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120917144520/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/Jul/13/employee-swap-gives-two-firms-new-perspectives/ | archivedate = 2012-09-17 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago Tribune|The Chicago Tribune]] covered this event on 15 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/1746535841.html?dids=1746535841:1746535841&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+15,+2009&amp;author=Wailin+Wong&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=19&amp;desc=Open+to+the+competition | work= Chicago Tribune | title=Open to the competition | first=Wailin | last= Wong | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, a second Craftsman Swap was held between [[Obtiva]] and Relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://8thlight.com/blog/colin-jones/2010/07/07/relevance-craftsman-swap-day-1.html|title=Relevance Craftsman Swap Day 1 {{!}} 8th Light|website=8thlight.com|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2013, [http://codurance.com/2014/03/03/craftsmanship-book-released/ Software Craftsmanship : Professionalism Pragmatism Pride] was published by [https://twitter.com/sandromancuso Sandro Mancuso]
In Sandro's own words this -
''"Proposing a very different mindset for developers and companies, a strong set of technical disciplines and practices, mostly based on Extreme Programming, and with a great alignment with Agile methodologies, Software Craftsmanship promises to take our industry to the next level, promoting professionalism, technical excellence, the death of the production line and factory workers attitude."''

''Sonic interaction design: sound, information and experience''. In: CHI '08 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Florence, Italy, April 05 – 10, 2008). CHI '08. ACM, New York, NY, 3969–3972. {{doi|10.1145/1358628.1358969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rocchesso and Stefania Serafin, (2009). "Sonic Interaction Design". Editorial of Special Issue. ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;905–906. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonic interaction design is at the intersection of [[interaction design]] and [[sound and music computing]]. If [[interaction design]] is about designing objects people interact with, and such interactions are facilitated by computational means, in sonic interaction design, sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an input medium.

== Research areas ==

=== Perceptual, cognitive, and emotional study of sonic interactions ===
[[Research]] in this area focuses on experimental scientific findings about human sound reception in [[Interactivity|interactive]] contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Yon Visell, Karmen Franinović, Nicolas Misdariis, and Patrick Susini, (2009). "Toward the design and evaluation of continuous sound in tangible interfaces: The Spinotron". ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;976–993. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During closed-loop interactions, the users manipulate an interface that produces sound, and the sonic feedback affects in turn the users’ manipulation. In other words, there is a  tight coupling between auditory [[perception]] and action.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore M. Aglioti and Mariella Pazzaglia (2010). "Representing actions through their sound". "Experimental Brain Research" 206(2):&amp;nbsp;141–151. {{doi|10.1007/s00221-010-2344-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to sounds might not only activate a representation of how the  sound was made: it might also prepare the listener to react to the sound.&lt;ref&gt;Marzia De Lucia, Christian Camen, Stephanie Clarke, and Micah M. Murray (2009). "The role of actions in auditory ob ject discrimination". "Neuroimage" 48(2):&amp;nbsp;475–485. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cognitive [[Representation (psychology)|representations]] of sounds might be associated with action-planning  schemas, and sounds can also unconsciously cue a further reaction on the part  of the listener. 

Sonic interactions have the potential to influence the users’ [[emotion]]s: the quality of the sounds affects the pleasantness  of the interaction, and the difficulty of the manipulation influences whether the user feels in control or not.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Karmen Franinović, Yon Visell, and Patrick Susini (2009). "The Flops glass: a device to study the emotional reactions arising from sonic interactions". In Proc. Sound and Music Computing Conference, Porto,  Portugal.  Available: [http://smc2009.smcnetwork.org/programme/pdfs/281.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product sound design ===
Product design in the context of sonic interaction design is dealing with methods and experiences for designing interactive products having a salient sonic behaviour. Products, in this context, are either tangible and functional objects that are designed to be manipulated,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hug (2008). ''Genie in a Bottle: Object–Sound Reconfigurations for Interactive Commodities''. In: Proceedings of Audiomostly 2008, 3rd Conference on Interaction With Sound (2008). Available: [http://www.citeulike.org/group/10826/article/7009573 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karmen Franinović, Daniel Hug and Yon Visell (June 2007). ''Sound Embodied: Explorations of Sonic Interaction Design for Everyday Objects in a Workshop Setting''.  In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Auditory Display, Montréal, Canada, June 26 – 29, 2007,  pp. 334–341. Available:  [http://www.icad.org/Proceedings/2007/FraninovicHug2007.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; or usable simulations of such objects as in [[virtual prototyping]]. Research and development in this area relies on studies from other disciplines, such as:
* product [[sound quality]];&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Lyon, (2003). "Product sound quality-from perception to design". ''Sound and Vibration'' 37(3):&amp;nbsp;18–22. Available: [http://www.sandv.com/downloads/0303lyon.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[acoustic ecology]], ''i.e.'' the relationship, mediated through sound, between living beings and their [[Ecosystem|environment]];
* [[film]] sound;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://filmsound.org/ filmsound.org: Learning Space dedicated to the Art of Film Sound Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Video game|Computer and video game]] sound;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gamesound.org/ About gamesound.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[sound culture]], ''i.e.'' the study of how the production and consumption of sound have changed throughout history and within different societies.

In [[design research]] for sonic products a set of practices have been inherited from a variety of fields. Such practices have been tested in contexts where research and pedagogy naturally intermix. Among these practices it suffices to mention:
* [[bodystorming]], especially when combined with vocal sketching,&lt;ref&gt;Inger Ekman and Michal Rinott, (2010). ''Using vocal sketching for designing sonic interactions'', Aarhus, Denmark: Designing Interactive Systems archive,

=== Interactive art and music ===

In the context of sonic interaction design, interactive art and music projects are designing and researching aesthetic experiences where sonic interaction is in the focus. The creative and expressive aspects – the aesthetics – are more important than conveying information through sound. Practices include installations, performances, public art and interactions between humans through digitally-augmented objects/environments. These often integrate elements such as embedded technology, gesture-sensitive devices, speakers or context-aware systems. 

The experience is in the focus, addressing how humans are affected by the sound, and vice versa. Interactive art and music allows us to question existing paradigms and models of how we interact with technology and sound, going beyond paradigms of control (human controlling a machine). Users are part of a loop which includes action and perception. 

Interactive art and music projects invite explorative actions and playful engagement. There is also a multi-sensory aspect, especially haptic-audio&lt;ref&gt;The fifth International Workshop on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design (HAID) on September 16–17, 2010 in Copenhagen, Denmark. http://media.aau.dk/haid10/?page_id=46&lt;/ref&gt; and audio-visual projects are popular. Amongst many other influences, this field is informed by the development of the roles of instrument-maker, composer and performer merging.&lt;ref&gt;International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression http://www.nime.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic research in sonic interaction design is about productions in the [[interactive art]]s and [[performing arts]], exploiting the role of [[enactive]] engagement with sound–augmented interactive objects.&lt;ref&gt;John Thompson, [[JoAnn Kuchera-Morin]], Marcos Novak, Dan Overholt, Lance Putnam, Graham Wakefield, and Wesley Smith, (2009). "The Allobrain: An interactive, stereographic, 3D audio, immersive virtual world". ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;934–946. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonification ===

[[Sonification]] is the data-dependent generation of sound, if the transformation is systematic, objective and reproducible, so that it can be used as scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Sonification – A Definition http://sonification.de/son/definition&lt;/ref&gt;

For sonic interaction design, sonification provides a set of methods to create interaction sounds that encode relevant data, so that the user can perceive or interpret the  conveyed information.   Sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound, but may only convey one or few data values in a sound. To give an example, imagine a light switch that, on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable: more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds. This example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound. 

The integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes: 
*  to allow the users to refine their actions via auditory feedback. Example: the sonification-enhanced drilling machine&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Grosshauser and Thomas Hermann, (2010). "Multimodal closed-loop Human Machine Interaction" Proc. Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached.
* to create a sonic [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action.
* to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses).

Within the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human [[interaction]] for understanding and using auditory [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). "Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification". ''IEEE MultiMedia'' 12(2):&amp;nbsp;20-24. {{doi|10.1109/MMUL.2005.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within sonic interaction design, sonification can help and offer solutions, methods, and techniques to inspire and guide the design of  products or interactive systems.

A '''squash ball machine''' is a mechanical device that automatically throws out [[Squash (sports)|squash]] balls at different speeds and angles. Its main purpose is to help players to develop their ball hitting technique.

==Overview==
The features of squash ball machines are modeled after the rules of squash and the constituency of squash balls.

Squash is a ballgame that is played by hitting a ball with a [[Racket (sports equipment)|racket]] against a wall, similar to a [[backboard (tennis)|backboard]], so that the ball bounces off the wall. The opponent player has to hit the ball back against the wall without letting the ball bounce more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussquash.com/officiate/rules-of-squash/ Rules of Squash] U.S. Squash. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The game can be played either by two people (the "singles" version), or by four people (the [[Squash Doubles|doubles]] version), in either a smaller court (singles and softball doubles) or a larger one ([[hardball squash|hardball doubles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hickok [http://www.hickoksports.com/rules/rsquashr.shtml Sports rules: Squash rackets] Hickok Sports. Retrieved 2013-02-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The balls used in squash are small rubber [[Squash (sport)#Playing equipment|balls]] that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;[http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/squash_balls.htm Squash balls] Squashplayer.co.uk. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-255005/hardball-squash-rackets Hardball squash rackets] Encyclopædia Britannica Online, Retrieved on 2013-02-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Because squash balls bounce with different amplitude and frequency depending on their temperature,&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; squash ball machines need to encompass this feature and allow for heating the balls first to give the right feel. The heating system makes squash ball machines different from tennis ball machines which only pump out balls at different speeds and angles.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bronstein [http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/globalgallery22.htm Global Gallery: Monthly Views on the World of Squash] Squashtalk.com, June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The heating function of the machine can be turned down or off, e.g.  for slower balls in beginner practices. In higher-end machines, the heat is thermostatically controlled to automatically keep the balls at game temperature.

The currently available models have ball capacities of 50-60 balls. Both ball speed range and ball frequencies are adjustable and vary from 30 to 150&amp;nbsp;km/h and 1.5-12 balls per second, respectively, with the .75 second interval suitable for quick volleys and 10 second interval for other strokes.&lt;ref name="rbssk"&gt;Richard Millman, Georgetta Morque (2006) ''Raising Big Smiling Squash Kids''. Mansion. {{ISBN|1932421432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the speed and frequency of the ball coming out of the machine is intended to help the player to visualize real-game situations where the ball does not always come back into play at the same speed. The adjustable speed is also useful for increasing the speed as the player becomes more skillful.

The machines have different modes and functions for practicing forehands and backhands, fixed, random, decay, [[interval training]], vertical swing, lob and drop. They are powered by electrical [[AC power|AC]] and [[Direct current|DC]] power supplies and can be [[Remote control|controlled remotely]]. [[Protective eyewear]] is recommended while using the machine.&lt;ref name="wsf6"&gt;Mike Way  and Dan Martyna [http://www.worldsquash.org/ws/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wsfconf2006.pdf The Cannon - Squash Training with a ball machine] 7th [[World Squash Federation]] Coaching and Development Conference, 8–11 September 2006, Malmo, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squash ball machines cannot be used for [[squash tennis]] which is played with [[tennis ball]]s that are considerably bigger than squash balls.

==Uses==
Squash ball machines are used as training aids both by solo players and by coaches in squash practices.

Individual players use the machine as a feeding ([[Serve (tennis)|serving]]) device in the absence of other players to practice their swinging technique and to develop footwork and timing.&lt;ref name="rbssk"/&gt;

In connection with coaching, the following benefits have been mentioned:&lt;ref name="rbssk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsf6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;Mark Allen [http://lobtohisbackhand.com/squashcannon.htm The Squash Cannon] Lobtohisbackhand.com. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bacon [http://scienceofcoachingsquash.wordpress.com/tag/squash-ball-machine/ Coaching Squash Front-Court Tactics with a Ball Machine] Science of Coaching Squash, December 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of the machine leaves the coach free from feeding the ball and allows closer observation of the student from different angles.
* The coach is able to demonstrate correct technique more frequently and effectively by doing alternate hitting with the student, with the coach hitting and the student trying to imitate the swing.
* The machine allows the coach to physically manipulate the students' swing, by holding the racket in the correct position.
* It allows for realistic hitting angles and positions, and to establish a continuous rhythm of play. Continuous, flowing practices are more enjoyable for the student, however they often result in an unrealistic hitting angles. For example when feeding for a drop volley, coaches often stand in a position in front of the pupil. If the coach is skillful then this allows the practice to flow and be continuous, but unfortunately means the pupil is learning to hit the ball short off of a drive from the front court with their opponent in front of them - when in the game this shot is almost always played off of a length ball with the opponent behind. With a machine, coaches can set up continuous practices that are always using realistic angles and positions.
* In a group practice, the coach is able to give advice specific to one player without having to stop the practice for other students, something he would have to do if he were the one doing the feeding.
* If used in combination with a drilling partner, the ball machine can be used to develop front-court tactics.
* Students acquire technique more easily if they are able to learn in rhythm. The machines allows for a continuous rhythm to be established. The student can miss, miss-hit, or hit the ball down/out and the next ball will still arrive in the rhythm that has been set. Without the machine the rhythm is broken while the misdirected ball is fetched.

==Limitations==
The main limitation of the ball machine is the same as its main benefit, that of excluding a human partner. Because competitive games are played against another person, the singular use of the machine would mean that a player would not learn to anticipate and react to the movement of the ball from the opponent player based on "pre-impact cues"  that precede the time the ball is struck, missing valuable time for planning his or her own response,&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt; and would not develop [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] skills.&lt;ref name="scs2"&gt;Tim Bacon [http://scienceofcoachingsquash.wordpress.com/2010/09/07/why-i-purchased-a-ping-pong-robot-but-wont-buy-a-squash-ball-machine/ Why I Purchased a Ping Pong Robot but Won’t Buy a Squash Ball Machine!] Science of Coaching Squash, September 7th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because balls that are thrown by the machine are independent of player's own strokes, the player would also not develop self-reflection and awareness about his or her role in directing the game.&lt;ref name="scs2"/&gt;

'''Switch adapted toys''' are [[toy]]s which have been adapted so that their original [[switch]]es are redirected to a larger switch that is easier for the child to interact with.  Many children with limited fine and gross motor skills cannot play with regular [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-operated toys.

For children or young people who have profound and extremely limiting physical and intellectual disabilities, operating a switch adapted toy may be the first independent thing they can do, which builds confidence and enjoyment as well as intellectual stimulation and potential learning.

Depending on the user's abilities, different switches are available for different purposes, including: finger switches, foot switches and button switches of many different sizes and varieties. Some switches have special textural coverings - soft fabric, "squishy" latex, pom pom, or "bump" patterned for the visually impaired. Use of switches depends on the user's muscle tone, spasticity, visual ability, cognitive function and interests. Switch adapted toys can generate blinking or changing lights and music, speaking, vibration, noises, fans, aromatherapy, massage, songs with number, alphabet or nursery rhyme content and even voice recording and playback.

A number of suppliers exist in Australia but they use imported switch adapted toys which means the toys are expensive to buy. Toy libraries like Noah's Ark in Perth, Western Australia stock a good range of switch adapted toys so that families can borrow to explore the best type of switch and the most interesting toys for their child.

Toy libraries import switch adapted toys or have volunteer helpers who are able to take an existing battery operated toy and convert it to switch adapted. Toys which have only one function are perfect for adaptation but more complex, multi-function toys may not be so easy. Adapting a battery toy at home can be achieved with the use of a small number of tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5320">'''TechAmerica''' is a US-based technology trade association. It was formed from the merger of [[AeA]] (formerly known as the America Electronics Association), the Cyber Security Industry Alliance (CSIA), the Government Electronics &amp; Information Technology Association (GEIA), and the [[Information Technology Association of America]] (ITAA) in 2009.  The organization claims to be the "high-tech industry's leading trade association".&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techamerica.org/about-techamerica|title=About TechAmerica|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TechAmerica represents 1,200 companies within the public and commercial sectors of the economy.  TechAmerica's stated goal is to provide "grassroots to global" representation for its members.  To this end, the organization maintains an advocacy program in all 50 US state capitals, in Washington, DC, and in several international locations.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; In May 2014, [[CompTIA]], a nonprofit trade association that serves [[Information technology|IT]] professionals, announced it had acquired TechAmerica in a move to expand its public-sector presence.&lt;ref name="acquired"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/government/leadership/tech-advocacy-groups-comptia-techamerica-merge/d/d-id/1235082|title=CompTIA TechAmerica merge|accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2009, AeA and ITAA merged to form TechAmerica.[[File:Tech-america-logo.gif|frame|right|TechAmerica logo]]

===AeA===

AeA started as the West Coast Electronics Manufacturing Association (WCEMA), formed by David Packard and 25 of Hewlett-Packard's suppliers in 1943.  Within 20 years, the association had gathered over 200 members.  In 1969, WCEMA was rebranded the Western Electronic Manufacturers Association (WEMA).  Less than two years following that rebranding, membership reached to over 600.  Once again, the association was renamed in 1977 to the American Electronics Association. In 2001, the branding was shortened to AeA.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techamerica.org/history|title=TechAmerica History|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ITAA===

The Association of Data Processing Services Organization (ADAPSO) was formed in 1961.  This association was renamed in 1991 to the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA). In 2008, ITAA merged with the Cyber Security Industry Alliance (CSIA) and the Government Electronics Industry Association (GEIA).&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===2012 Cyber Attack===

The organization's website was attacked in April 2012 for their support of the controversial [[CISPA]] bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/482929-TechAmerica_We_Were_Victim_of_Cyber_Attack_NCTA_Site_Has_Troubles_Too.php|title=TechAmerica: We Were Victim of Cyber Attack; NCTA Site Has Troubles Too|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of standards program===
In July 2013, TechAmerica sold its standards program to [[SAE International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=July 20, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four lobbyists depart, TechAmerica sues for breach of employee contract===
On November 4, 2013 it was announced that four TechAmerica lobbyists: Trey Hodgkins, Pam Walker, Erica McCann and Carol Henton had resigned, lured to the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) which was able to raise $50,000 each from more than a dozen of its members to fund the acquisition of the four TechAmerica lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/tech-industry_n_4214558.html | work=Huffington Post | title='Revenge Of The Nerds': Tech Lobbyists Walk Off Job In Dramatic Shakeup | date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TechAmerica filed a lawsuit against ITI and three of the departing lobbyists in D.C. Superior Court. TechAmerica's complaints include that the defecting lobbyists conspired in their new positions to use old contacts and other information acquired while at TechAmerica to help ITI find new clients for its neophyte effort focused on government procurement &lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/techamerica-iti-lawsuit-99612.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7620">[[File:Im18891213Eng-Wells1.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement, c. 1890]]
A '''Wells light''' was a large paraffin-fuelled ([[kerosene]]) [[blowlamp]] used for engineering work, particularly for illumination, in Victorian times. At a time before widespread electrical lighting, they were the most common form of high-powered portable illumination used for construction work, particularly railways, civil engineering, shipyards and ironworks.

== Operation ==
The Wells light was a typical [[blowlamp]] in principle, consisting of a floor-standing fuel tank with the burner on a tall post above it. It was distinguished by its large size, the more common plumber's blow lamp being a hand-held tool of about a pint in capacity. Wells lights were made in a number of sizes, the smallest Nº1{{efn-lr|These are the numbers and sizes quoted for the Canadian market.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt; Other sizes, somewhat larger and smaller, have been quoted in other adverts for the UK market.}} being of 800&amp;nbsp;[[candlepower]] with a 15 inch flame. Weighing {{convert|75|lb|kg}} when filled, it was advertised as "can be carried by a boy".&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=The Wells light : Wallwork &amp; Wells' patents 
  |year=1890
  |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_90213
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Nº3 produced 2,000&amp;nbsp;candlepower, weighed 240&amp;nbsp;lbs, and was available with barrow wheels for portability.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt;

The burner of the Wells light used a vaporiser that heated the oil before it escaped the nozzle, so vaporising immediately.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt; As the lamp was intended for use with heavy, sooty oils as well, this vaporiser was constructed of a square frame of straight tubes. Each tube was closed with a screwed plug that could be removed for cleaning. For initial lighting, the vaporiser would be preheating by burning a little oil in a tray beneath the burner. The burners were mounted horizontally, although some models were produced with a flexible hose to the burner that allowed it to be rotated vertically.

Pressure was provided by a hand-worked [[stirrup pump]] on the tank. Once pressurised, a large lamp could burn for some hours before the pressure fell enough to require more pumping. A particular feature of the Wells design was that the tank could be refilled whilst the lamp was still burning (i.e. without releasing the pressure in the tank) by using this same pressurisation pump as a fuel pump to suck in oil from another container.

== Illumination ==
The major use of the Wells light was for the illumination of outdoor construction work. They were portable and simple to operate. Their fuel was cheap and commonly available, especially as the Wells' pressure burner could burn a much lower and cheaper grade of oil than the [[lamp oil|lamp paraffin]] that was pure enough to not clog a wick lamp. Oil fuels were still more expensive than [[coal gas]] though, so fixed lighting, such as in factories, remained on town mains gas.

=== Comparisons to electric lighting ===
The Wells light pre-dated [[mains electricity]] but was contemporaneous with early use of the [[arc lamp]].

Electricity had two disadvantages: firstly it required an on-site generating plant. This was expensive and also represented a long-term capital investment that took time simply to build it beforehand. In some cases, the use of a [[semi-portable engine]] could provide a generating plant more quickly. Where the need for lighting was mobile, as for the construction of railways or canals, the Wells light had a clear advantage.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt;

Secondly, although the carbon arc lamp was bright, and relatively economical for the illumination produced, individual lamps were expensive and complicated, although powerful. This encouraged their use as the minimum number of large lamps to cover an entire work site. As the arc lamp also has a very small source of light, this gave a particularly harsh lighting. There was a sudden contrast between the illuminated and shadow areas, especially where a point was only in sight of a single lamp. This was recognised as a trip and obstacle hazard, as well as making even the light areas difficult to work under. The Wells light was specifically contrasted with the point-source of the arc lamp and the relatively shadow-free illumination was cited as an advantage in their adverts.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt; Because the smaller Wells lights were so portable, they could be carried into the best position to illuminate a deep shaft or inside a ship's hull.

=== Other uses ===
[[File:Wells light nr. 236 og 247 - fo30141512090018.jpg|thumb|Wells lights in Norway|alt=A pair of unlit Wells lights, on a wooden jetty]]
As well as illumination, the Wells light was also used where a large portable blowlamp was required for heating. They were sometimes used for heating iron [[rivet]]s, inserted red hot, during the assembly of [[structural steel|structural ironwork]]. Although such rivets were normally heated in small portable [[coke (fuel)|coke]] [[brazier]]s (which also used a cheaper fuel), the Wells light was favoured for some final assembly work at height, as the smaller lights were considered lighter and easier to lift into place high atop a bridge.

Wells lights were also used in the erection and repair of large [[stationary steam engine]]s. Typically this was for the [[shrink-fitting]] of components such as large [[crankpin]]s in crankshafts or flywheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
  |title=Replacing a mill engine crankpin
  |journal=[[Model Engineer]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crankshaft web would be heated to expand it until the pin could be slid or gently hammered into place. On cooling, the pin would be securely held in place.

  |journal=The Engineer 
  |date=27 January 1888

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lamp was not very bright and their limited light has been blamed for several engineering failures and losses of life, where an inspection was poorly carried out, owing to poor light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hither Green railway station#Freight yards and motive power depot|Hither Green]] boiler explosion, 1947, in {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wells light, with its pressure burner, was an attempt to produce the first really bright portable lighting. It was an immediate success, working well and having no significant competition from other makers. The name "Wells light" soon became a [[genericized]] name for this type of light, even though almost all were Wells' own, or licensed, products.

Wells lights were also produced [[licence-built|under licence]] in Canada, by James Cooper of [[Montreal]], and sold as 'Wallwork &amp; Wells' patent lights.&lt;ref name="Wallwork_Wells" /&gt;

In later years, Wells used their knowledge of small pressure vessels and pumps to produce a range of paint spraying equipment. Up to the 1960s, they also produced waste oil filtration equipment.&lt;ref name="Graces" /&gt;
