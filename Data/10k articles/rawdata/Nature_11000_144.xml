==Early life==
Born into a family of six as the last child, A-Q real name Gilbert Bani was raised in Surulere where he has lived for most of his life.

A-Q attended Kings College Lagos, and had his tertiary education at the University of Lagos. At a young age he started collecting hip-hop tracks, learning the lyrics and miming them. It didn’t take long before he started writing his own lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130714002417/http://9jaolofofo.com.ng/super-sunday-9jaolofofo-meets-rapper-aq-exclusive-interview/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-14 |title=9jaolofofo Meets Rapper ‘A-Q’ (Exclusive Interview) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
A-Q signed his first record deal in 2001 with Big Leaf Records where he was for two years before he started working on his own in 2003. His first single "(W)rap Nigeria", produced by kraftmatics, debuted in 2004 followed by a music video. He subsequently released a full compilation album ''Listen and Understand'' in 2005 followed by another single, "Things That We Do", which got him an international online distribution deal. In 2006 A-Q put out a mixtape titled ''Maga Must Pay vol 1.''

A-Q took a break from music to finish his education in [[University of Lagos]] but still managed to release a single, "Make Money", and accompanying video in 2008 produced by Laylow and featuring Morachi and Xtrim off an online mixtape titled ''Love and Money.''

A-Q graduated in 2010 and returned to the entertainment industry, this time co-floating a record label, Hustle Inc, on whose platform he started Black Friday Twitter Freestyles, a weekly free download release. This got him online acknowledgement including from producer Don Jazzy who styled him “one of the sickest rappers alive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.underdarock.com/blog/don-jazzy-calls-a-q-one-of-the-sickest-rapper-alive/|title= one of the sickest rappers alive (Don Jazzy calls A-Q one of the sickest rapper alive)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded and released ''The Past Present and Future'' album in December 2010 which had the singles "Names" and "Champagne and Rum". He released more music including "Distractions" featuring Vector in 2012, "Machine Gun Flow", "555 (5beats 5verses and 5blessings)", and "Why" featuring Pamela.

He released an EP in December 2012 titled ''Make Your Best Rapper Look Stupid.'' He is currently working on his sophomore album titled ''G.I.L.B.E.R.T (Grace and Glory).''

'''Año Nuevo State Park''' is a [[state park]] of [[California]], USA, encompassing [[Año Nuevo Island]] and Año Nuevo Point, which are known for their [[pinniped]] rookeries.  Located in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], the low, rocky, windswept point juts out into the Pacific Ocean about {{convert|55|mi|km}} south of San Francisco and the [[Golden Gate]].  '''Año Nuevo State Natural Reserve''', formerly a separate unit of the California state park system, was merged into Año Nuevo State Park in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = California State Park System Statistical Report: Fiscal Year 2009/10 | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/795/files/09-10%20statistical%20report%20final%20online.pdf | publisher = California State Parks | page = 5 | accessdate =September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coastal geographic center, or coastal-midpoint of California is located at the Northern end of this park at N 37°09′58″, W 122°21'40", as the [[North_Fork,_California#Geography|absolute geographic center of California]] falls at N 37°09′58″, W 119°26′58″W.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sierranevadageotourism.org/content/exact-center-of-california-north-fork/sie6d7dfceab85ab661f Exact Center of California: North Fork] National Geographic/ Sierra Nevada Geotourism.

The reserve contains a diversity of plant communities, including [[old growth forest]], [[freshwater marsh]], [[red alder]] [[riparian forest]] and [[knobcone pine]] forest. Its four perennial streams support [[rainbow trout|steelhead]] and [[salmon|coho salmon]], and its wetlands are habitat to the rare [[San Francisco garter snake]] and [[California red-legged frog]]. Cultural resources include the remnants of a prehistoric Native American village site and a number of structures from the 19th century Cascade Ranch. In conjunction with adjacent and nearby public lands, the unit permits the protection of important regional ecological corridors.

The point remains undeveloped, much as [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] saw it from his passing ship in 1603.

==History==
The [[Quiroste]] [[Ohlone people]] were the first known to inhabit the Año Nuevo area. After [[Mission Santa Cruz]] was founded in 1791, the Quiroste population plunged due to the various diseases that the Spanish had brought with them.

The Spanish maritime [[List of explorers|explorer]] Sebastian Vizcaino sailed by the point on January 3, 1603. His diarist and chaplain of the expedition, Father Antonio de la Ascensión, named it Punta de Año Nuevo (New Year's Point) for the day on which they sighted it in 1603.&lt;ref name="BrightGudde1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Bright|author2=Erwin Gustav Gudde|title=1500 California place names: their origin and meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CET4QodMZysC|accessdate=January 20, 2012|date=November 30, 1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21271-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had recently stopped in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and had passed Año Nuevo while heading north.

The first European land exploration of [[Alta California]] was the Spanish [[Portolà expedition]] of 1760-70. Guided by Vizcaino's landmarks as it traveled north along the coast in 1769, the explorers recognized Point Año Nuevo. On the return journey to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the party camped at Año Nuevo Creek on November 19. [[Franciscan]] missionary [[Juan Crespi]] noted in his diary, "We...halted on a steep rock, in sight of the point which we judged to be Año Nuevo, on the bank of an arroyo which empties into the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=238–243 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |deadurl= |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |accessdate=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mid-19th century, developments occurred, including the development of Año Nuevo Island and agriculture in the surrounding region. Once home to a large population of elephant seals, hunters greatly reduced the seal population by overhunting the species. Since the mid-20th century, the seal population has had a rebound and multiplied greatly. Elephant seals can be seen today on the wildlife reserve.

==Pinniped colonies==
[[File:Ano Nuevo seals.jpg|thumb|200px|Elephant seals at Año Nuevo during the mating season in early February]]

[[Northern elephant seal]]s, [[California sea lion]]s, [[sea otter]]s, and other marine mammals come ashore to rest, mate, and give birth in the sand dunes or on the beaches and offshore islands. Hundreds of thousands of people come to witness it each year.

Año Nuevo State Park is the site of one of the largest mainland breeding colonies for the northern elephant seal (another is in [[Piedras Blancas State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area]]—{{convert|100|mi|km}} south near the town of Cambria and the San Simeon approach to Hearst Castle). The seals attracted so much interest  that early reservations are needed during the winter breeding season. The males battle for mates on the beaches and the females give birth to their pups on the dunes.

From mid-December through late March, daily access to the reserve is available on guided walks only. Most of the adult seals are gone by mid-March, leaving behind the weaned pups who remain through April. The elephant seals return to Año Nuevo's beaches during the spring (females) and summer (males) months to molt and can be observed during this time through a permit system.  Reservations for a guided walk during the breeding season are available by phone.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=523|title=Año Nuevo State Park|publisher=[[California State Park System]]|work=official web page|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
A Visitor Center features natural history exhibits and a bookstore offering educational items such as books, postcards and posters. Restrooms, drinking water and picnic tables are available near the Visitor Center only. Food and beverages are not sold at the reserve, although drinking water is available.

The parking lot is just west of [[California State Route 1|California Route 1]] at {{coord |37|7|10|N|122|18|25|W |type:landmark_region:US-CA |display=inline}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Año Nuevo State Reserve, California State Parks, San Mateo County |work= Bay Area Hiker web site |date= April 5, 2005 |url= http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/anonuevo2.html |accessdate=August 31, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Cascade Ranch unit of the reserve includes steep unmarked hikes in the coastal hills inland of the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cascade Ranch Unit, Año Nuevo State Reserve, California State Parks, San Mateo County |work= Bay Area Hiker web site |date= November 16, 2001 |url= http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/anonuevo.html |accessdate=August 31, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjacent attractions==
[[Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area]] and [[Greyhound Rock State Marine Conservation Area]] are two adjoining marine protected areas off the coast of Año Nuevo State Park. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

[[Pigeon Point Light Station State Historic Park]], [[Butano State Park]] and numerous other parks and beaches are within {{convert|5|mi|km}} of Año Nuevo.&lt;ref name="park"/&gt;

The '''Biefeld–Brown effect''' is an electrical phenomenon that produces an [[ionic wind]] that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles. It describes a force observed on an asymmetric [[capacitor]] when high voltage is applied to the capacitor's electrodes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bahder|first=Thomas|last2=Fazi|first2=Christian|date=June 2003|title=Force on an Asymmetric Capacitor|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA416740|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once suitably charged up to high [[Direct current|DC]] potentials, a thrust from the negative terminal to the positive terminal is generated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tajmar|first=Martin|date=February 2004|title=Biefeld-Brown Effect: Misinterpretation of Corona Wind Phenomena|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245425484|journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|volume=42|issue=2|pages=315–318|via=ResearchGate|bibcode=2004AIAAJ..42..315T|doi=10.2514/1.9095}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was named by inventor [[Thomas Townsend Brown]] who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy [[Paul Alfred Biefeld]], a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at [[Denison University]] in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;The present day Denison University claims they have no record of such experiments being carried out, or of any association between Brown and Biefeld.[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.

The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more [[thrust]] to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canning|first=Francis|last2=Melcher|first2=Cory|last3=Winet|first3=Edwin|date=1 October 2004|title=Asymmetrical Capacitors for Propulsion|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040171929|journal=NASA Technical Reports Server|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biefeld–Brown effect can be observed in [[ionocraft]]s and [[Lifter (ionic propulsion device)|lifters]], which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his 1960 patent titled "Electrokinetic Apparatus," Brown refers to [[electrokinesis]] to describe the Biefeld–Brown effect, linking the phenomenon to the field of [[electrohydrodynamics]] (EHD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Brown also believed the Biefeld–Brown effect could produce an anti-gravity force, referred to as "[[electrogravitics]]" based on it being an electricity/gravity phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/64_PipeDreams.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.

== History ==
{{Further|Thomas Townsend Brown}}

The "Biefeld–Brown effect" was the name given to a phenomenon observed by Thomas Townsend Brown while he was experimenting with [[X-ray tube]]s during the 1920s while he was still in high school. When he applied a high voltage electrical charge to a [[Coolidge tube]] that he placed on a scale, Brown noticed a difference in the tubes mass depending on orientation, implying some kind of [[net force]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/apr/17/science.highereducation|title=TT Brown's Electrogravitics|last=Pilkington|first=Mark|date=16 April 2003|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery caused him to assume that he had somehow influenced gravity electronically and led him to design a propulsion system based on this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chipdesignmag.com/carter/2012/12/10/thomas-townsend-brown-part-iv-of-the-holiday-serial/|title=Thomas Townsend Brown: Part IV of the Holiday Serial|last=|first=|date=|website=Systems Design Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 1927, he applied for a patent, entitled "Method of Producing Force or Motion," that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1929, Brown published an article for the popular American magazine ''Science and Invention'', which detailed his work. The article also mentioned the "gravitator," an invention by Brown which produced motion without the use of electromagnetism, gears, propellers, or wheels, but instead using the principles of what he called "electro-gravitation." He also claimed that the asymmetric capacitors were capable of generating mysterious fields that interacted with the Earth's [[Gravity|gravitational pull]] and envisioned a future where gravitators would propel ocean liners and even space cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/HowIControl.html|title=How I Control Gravitation|last=Brown|first=Thomas|date=August 1929|work=Science and Invention|access-date=27 August 2018|archive-url=http://blog.lege.net/content/Gravitator_1926.pdf|archive-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point this effect also gained the moniker "Biefeld–Brown effect", probably coined by Brown to claim [[Denison University]] professor of physics and astronomy [[Paul Alfred Biefeld]] as his mentor and co-experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/12_biefeld-brown.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 12: The "Biefeld-Brown" Effect  (online excerpts) "Townsend Brown himself wrote (in 1977): The basic Biefeld-Brown effect is quite simple."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alienscientist.com/brown.html alienscientist.com, Biefeld–Brown Effect Controversy, Tajmar ESA Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown attended Denison for a year before he dropped out and records of him even having an association with Biefeld are sketchy at best.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 13: Notes from the Rabbit Hole #3: "He Made Things Up" (online excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the Biefeld–Brown effect, making the following claims:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# There is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect, where the shorter the distance, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect, where the higher the strength, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the area of the conductors and the strength of the effect, where the greater the area, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the voltage difference between the capacitor plates and the strength of the effect, where the greater the voltage, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the mass of the dielectric material and the strength of the effect, where the greater the mass, the greater the effect.

In 1965, Brown filed a patent that claimed that a net force on the asymmetric capacitor can exist even in a [[vacuum]]. However, there is little experimental evidence that serves to validate his claims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effect analysis==
[[File:Asymm-capacitor.svg|right]]

The effect is generally believed to rely on [[corona discharge]], which allows air molecules to become [[ion]]ized near sharp points and edges. Usually, two [[electrodes]] are used with a high voltage between them, ranging from a few kilovolts and up to megavolt levels, where one electrode is small or sharp, and the other larger and smoother. The most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kV/cm, which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points, at a current density level usually referred to as the saturated corona current condition. This creates a high field gradient around the smaller, positively charged electrode. Around this electrode, ionization occurs, that is, [[electron]]s are stripped from the atoms in the surrounding medium; they are literally pulled right off by the electrode's charge.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

This leaves a cloud of positively charged [[ion]]s in the medium, which are attracted to the negative smooth electrode by [[Coulomb's Law]], where they are neutralized again. This produces an equally scaled opposing force in the lower electrode. This effect can be used for propulsion (see [[EHD thruster]]), [[fluid]] [[pump]]s and recently also in EHD cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kocik|first=Marek|title=A System for Liquid Cooling of Electronic Elements with EHD Pumping Mechanism|url=http://www.iesj.org/html/service/ijpest/vol10_no1_2016/PDF/IJPEST_Vol10_No1_10_pp047-050.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The velocity achievable by such setups is limited by the momentum achievable by the ionized air, which is reduced by ion impact with neutral air. A theoretical derivation of this force has been proposed (see the external links below).

However, this effect works using either polarity for the electrodes: the small or thin electrode can be either positive or negative, and the larger electrode must have the opposite polarity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On many experimental sites it is reported that the thrust effect of a lifter is actually a bit stronger when the small electrode is the positive one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is possibly an effect of the differences between the ionization energy and electron affinity energy of the constituent parts of air; thus the ease of which ions are created at the 'sharp' electrode.

As air pressure is removed from the system, several effects combine to reduce the force and momentum available to the system. The number of air molecules around the ionizing electrode is reduced, decreasing the quantity of ionized particles. At the same time, the number of impacts between ionized and neutral particles is reduced. Whether this increases or decreases the maximum momentum of the ionized air is not typically measured, although the force acting upon the electrodes reduces, until the glow discharge region is entered. The reduction in force is also a product of the reducing breakdown voltage of air, as a lower potential must be applied between the electrodes, thereby reducing the force dictated by Coulomb's Law.

During the glow discharge region, the air becomes a conductor.  Though the applied voltage and current will propagate at nearly the speed of light, the movement of the conductors themselves is almost negligible. This leads to a Coulomb force and change of momentum so small as to be zero.

Below the glow discharge region, the breakdown voltage increases again, whilst the number of potential ions decreases, and the chance of impact lowers. Experiments have been conducted and found to both prove and disprove a force at very low pressure. It is likely that the reason for this is that at very low pressures, only experiments which used very large voltages produced positive results, as a product of a greater chance of ionization of the extremely limited number of available air molecules, and a greater force from each ion from Coulomb's Law; experiments which used lower voltages have a lower chance of ionization and a lower force per ion. Common to positive results is that the force observed is small in comparison to experiments conducted at standard pressure.

==Disputes surrounding electrogravity and ion wind==
Brown believed that his large, high voltage, high capacity capacitors produced an electric field strong enough to marginally interacted with the Earth's gravitational pull, a phenomenon he labeled [[electrogravitics]]. Several researchers claim that conventional physics cannot adequately explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has become something of a [[cause célèbre]] in the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] community, where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than [[electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]]. [[Charles Berlitz]] devoted an entire chapter of his book ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment]]'' to a retelling of Brown's early work with the effect, implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by UFOs.  Today, the [[Internet]] is filled with sites devoted to this interpretation of the effect.

There have been follow-ups on the claims that this force can be produced in a full vacuum, meaning it is an unknown anti-gravity force, and not just the more well known [[ion wind]]. As part of a study in 1990, [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] researcher R. L. Talley conducted a test on a Biefeld–Brown-style capacitor to replicate the effect in a vacuum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite attempts that increased the driving DC voltage to about 19 kV in vacuum chambers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr, Talley observed no thrust in terms of static DC potential applied to the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Talley|first=R. L.|date=May 1991|title=Twenty First Century Propulsion Concept|url=http://www.otherhand.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Talley-paper-propulsion-concept.pdf|journal=Air Force Systems Command|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[NASA]] scientist Jonathan Campbell tested a lifter in a vacuum at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; torr with a voltage of up to 50 kV, only to observe no movement from the lifter. Campbell pointed out to a [[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]] reporter that creating a true vacuum similar to space for the test requires tens of thousands of dollars in equipment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Around the same time in 2003, researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] tested the Biefeld–Brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the Internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kV to them. According to their report, the researchers claimed that the effects of ion wind was at least three orders of magnitude too small to account for the observed force on the asymmetric capacitor in the air. Instead, they proposed that the Biefeld–Brown effect may be better explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around ten years later, researchers from the [[Technical University of Liberec]] conducted experiments on the Biefeld–Brown effect that supported ARL's claim that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik|first=M.|last2=Primas|first2=J.|last3=Vopecky|first3=V.|last4=Svoboda|first4=M.|date=January 2014|title=Calculation and measurement of a neutral air flow velocity impacting a high voltage capacitor with asymmetrical electrodes|journal=AIP Advances|volume=4|issue=1|pages=017137|doi=10.1063/1.4864181|bibcode=2014AIPA....4a7137M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Martin Tajmar]] published a paper that also failed to replicate Brown's work and suggested that Brown may have instead observed the effects of a [[corona wind]] triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1499">The '''China Geological Survey (CGS)'''  ({{zh|s=中国地质调查局}}) is a government-owned, [[not-for-profit]], [[China|Chinese]] organization researching China's [[mineral resources]]. It is the largest [[Geoscience]] agency in China since being reinstated in 1999.

==History==
The China Geological Survey originated in the early days of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (when it had control over [[mainland China]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=J. G.|date=1921-01-01|title=The National Geological Survey of China|jstor=519444|journal=Geografiska Annaler|volume=3|pages=305–310|doi=10.2307/519444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many prominent geologists and paleontologists worked with the Survey in the early days, such as [[Davidson Black]] or [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. It was disbanded after the [[People's Republic of China]] gained control over mainland China and reinstated in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">During [[Seismology|seismic]] exploration, [[P-waves]] (also known as primary or compressive waves) penetrate down into the earth.  When a P-wave hits an interface (e.g., solid-liquid), it can reflect upwards as an [[S-wave]] (also known as a secondary, shear or transverse wave).  Other P-wave to S-wave (P-S) conversions can occur, but the down-up conversion is the primary focus.  Unlike P-waves, converted shear waves are largely unaffected by fluids.&lt;ref name="ProbertRobinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Probert|first1=T.|last2=Robinson|first2=J.P.|last3=Ronen|first3=S.|last4=Hoare|first4=R.|last5=Pope|first5=D.|last6=Kommedal|first6=J.|last7=Crook|first7=H.|last8=Law|first8=A.|title=Imaging Through Gas Using 4-Component, 3D Seismic Data: A Case Study From The Lomond Field|year=2013|doi=10.4043/11982-MS}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing the original and converted waves, seismologists obtain additional subsurface information, especially due to (1) differential velocity (V&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), (2) asymmetry in the waves' angles of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incidence]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and (3) [[Amplitude versus offset|amplitude variations]].

As opposed to analysis of P-wave to P-wave (P-P) reflection, c-wave (P-S) analysis is more complex.  C-wave analysis requires at least three times as many measurement channels per station.  Variations in reflection depths can cause significant analytic problems.  Gathering, mapping, and [[Data binning|binning]] c-wave data is also more difficult than P-P data.  However, c-wave analysis can provide additional information needed to create a three-dimensional depth image of rock type, structure, and saturant.  For example, changes in V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to V&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; suggest changing [[lithology]] and [[porosity|pore geometry]].&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;

A '''deep-cycle battery''' is a [[lead-acid battery]] designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity. In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most [[Automotive battery|automotive batteries]]) are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts for cranking the engine, thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity. While a deep-cycle battery can be used as a starting battery, the lower "cranking current" implies that an oversized battery may be required.

A deep-cycle battery is designed to discharge between 45% and 75% of its capacity, depending on the manufacturer and the construction of the battery. Although these batteries can be cycled down to 20% charge, the best lifespan vs cost method is to keep the average cycle at about 45% discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm |title=Deep Cycle Battery FAQ |publisher=Windsun.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an inverse correlation between the [[depth of discharge]] (DOD) of the battery, and the number of charge and discharge cycles it can perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdbatteries.com/images/lifelinelifecycles.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707215834/http://www.bdbatteries.com/images/lifelinelifecycles.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

Deep-cycle lead-acid batteries generally fall into two distinct categories; flooded (FLA) and [[VRLA battery|valve-regulated lead-acid]] (VRLA), with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types, [[VRLA battery#AGM (Absorbed glass mat)|Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM)]] and [[VRLA battery#Gel battery|Gel]]. The reinforcement of absorbed glass mat separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations.&lt;ref name="Are “Deep Cycle” batteries constructed differently?"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marshallbatteries.com.au/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=35980 |title= Are "Deep Cycle" batteries constructed differently?|author=Marshall Batteries |accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, flooded deep-cycle batteries can be divided into subcategories of Tubular-plated [[Opzs]] or flat plated. The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell. The structural difference between deep-cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the lead battery plates. Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates, with higher-density active paste material and thicker separators. Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more [[antimony]] than that of starting batteries.&lt;ref name=Linden02&gt;David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). ''Handbook Of Batteries 3rd Edition''. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2002 {{ISBN|0-07-135978-8}},  pages 25-44 to 23-53&lt;/ref&gt; The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended [[Charge cycle|charge and discharge cycles]].

== Applications ==
* [[Cathodic protection]], which might include marine use
* Other marine use, especially on a sailboat lacking power generation capability, generally smaller vessels
* [[Trolling motor]]s for recreational fishing boats
* Industrial electrically-propelled [[forklift]]s and floor sweepers
* [[Motorized wheelchair]]s
* Off-grid energy storage systems for [[solar power]] or [[wind power]], especially in small installations for a single building or [[motorhome]]
* Power for instruments or equipment at remote sites
* Recreational vehicles
* [[Traction battery|Traction batteries]] to propel vehicles, such as golf carts, and other highway [[electric vehicle]]s
* [[Traffic signals]]
* [[Uninterruptible power supply]] ('UPS'), usually for computers and associated equipment, but also [[sump pump]]s
* [[Audio equipment]], similarly to a UPS but also in certain 'clean power' devices to supply clean DC power isolated from the public electric supply for inversion to AC to maximize audio signal reproduction

== Flooded ==

The term "flooded" is used because this type of battery contains a quantity of electrolyte fluid so that the plates are completely submerged. The electrolyte level should be above the tops of plates which serves as a reservoir to make sure that water loss during charging does not lower the level below the plate tops and cause damage. Flooded batteries will decompose some water from the electrolyte during charging, so regular maintenance of flooded batteries requires inspection of electrolyte level and addition of water. Major modes of failure of deep-cycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the plates, and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material. The capacity of a deep cycle battery is usually limited by electrolyte capacity and not by the plate mass, to improve life expectancy.&lt;ref name=Linden02/&gt;

== Recycling ==

The vast majority of deep cycle batteries on the market today are lead acid batteries. Lead acid batteries are recycled 98% by volume, 99.5% by weight. The plastic cases, lead plates, sulfuric acid, solder, and other metals are 100% recovered for reuse. The only part of a battery that is not recyclable is the paper separators that wrap the plates. Due to the acid bath the paper sits in, the fiber length is reduced so far that it cannot be rewoven.

Industry wide, there is a greater than 98% rate of recovery on all lead acid batteries sold in the United States, resulting in a virtually closed manufacturing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batterycouncil.org/?page=Battery_Recycling |title=Battery Recycling |publisher=Batterycouncil.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Destratification''' is a process in which the air or water is mixed in order to eliminate [[Lake stratification|stratified layers]] of temperature, plant, or animal life. The first example of destratification was in 1919, in a small reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp Effects of Destratification] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906100952/http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp |date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pond]]'s condition deteriorates when the [[Benthic zone|bottom environment]] cannot support animal life. The bottom is the area that runs out of oxygen first, it is where the most oxygen is used, and it is the farthest from the surface where it is replenished. Without oxygen a lake or pond's self-purification capability is not only reduced, it is reversed. The small animals, snails, worms, bacteria, etc., which help keep a pond clean cannot live, and the pond's nutrients are then recycled from the [[sediment]]. This forms a layer of [[Muck (soil)|muck]] at the bottom which serves as a fertilizer for weed and excessive [[algae]] growth. It can also cause large [[fish kill]]s.

The primary products of petroleum fuel combustion in air are carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen.  The other components exist primarily from incomplete combustion and [[pyrosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Lippmann2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=P. T.|last2=Bos|first2=R.

While the distribution of the individual components of raw (untreated) diesel exhaust varies depending on factors like load, engine type, etc., the adjacent table shows a typical composition.

The physical and chemical conditions that exist inside any such [[diesel engine]]s under any conditions differ considerably from spark-ignition engines, because, by design, diesel engine power is directly controlled by the fuel supply, not by control of the air/fuel mixture, as in conventional gasoline engines.&lt;ref name="CRC Press2"&gt;{{cite book | author=Song, Chunsham | date= 2000 | title=Chemistry of Diesel Fuels | place=Boca Raton, FL, USA| publisher=CRC Press  | page=4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1560328452 | accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these differences, diesel engines generally produce a different array of pollutants than spark-driven engines, differences that are sometimes qualitative (what pollutants are there, and what are not), but more often quantitative (how much of particular pollutants or pollutant classes are present in each). For instance, diesel engines produce one-twenty-eighth the carbon monoxide that gasoline engines do, as they burn their fuel in excess air even at full load.&lt;ref name="JABFM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jabfm.org/content/21/1/55.full | title=The Toxicity of Diesel Exhaust: Implications for Primary Care | publisher=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine | work=Medical Journal | date=January 2008| accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Krivoshto, Irina N. | author2=Richards, John R. | author3 = Albertson, Timothy E. | author4=Derlet, Robert W. | last-author-amp=yes | pages=55–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC Press"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5VTXj_got4C&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;ots=riwgogJLF0&amp;dq=diesels%20burn%20their%20fuel%20in%20%22excess%20air%20even%20at%20full%20load%22&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q=diesels%20burn%20their%20fuel%20in%20%22excess%20air%20even%20at%20full%20load%22&amp;f=false | title=Alternative Transportation Fuels: Utilisation in Combustion Engines | publisher=CRC Press | work=Book | date=18 June 2013 | accessdate=24 October 2015 |author1=Gajendra Babu, M.K. |author2=Subramanian, K.A. | pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DieselCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dieselnet.com/tech/emi_intro.php|title=What Are Diesel Emissions|date=2012|publisher=Ecopoint Inc.|accessdate=5 June 2015|author=Majewski, W.

However, the lean-burning nature of diesel engines and the high temperatures and pressures of the combustion process result in significant production of gaseous [[nitrogen oxide]]s ([[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]), an [[air pollutant]] that constitutes a unique challenge with regard to their reduction.{{citation needed lead|date=October 2015}} While total nitrogen oxides from petrol cars have decreased by around 96% through adoption of exhaust catalytic converters as of 2012, diesel cars still produce nitrogen oxides at a similar level to those bought 15 years earlier under real-world tests; hence, diesel cars emit around 20 times more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/08/pollutionwatch-diesel-petrol-electric-cars|title=Diesel cars emit more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars|date=Jul 8, 2012|work=The Guardian|quote=New diesels produce similar nitrogen oxides to those bought 15 years ago.

Auxiliary diesel systems designed to remediate the nitrogen oxide pollutants are described in a separate section below.

Moreover, the [[fine particle]]s (fine particulate matter) in diesel exhaust (e.g., [[soot]], sometimes visible as opaque dark-colored smoke) has traditionally been of greater concern, as it presents different health concerns and is rarely produced in significant quantities by [[spark-ignition engine]]s. These especially harmful particulate contaminants are at their peak when such engines are run without sufficient oxygen to fully combust the fuel; when a diesel engine runs at idle, enough oxygen is usually present to burn the fuel completely.&lt;ref name="OmidvaRev15"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Recent Studies on Soot Modeling for Diesel Combustion|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115002890|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=48|pages=635–647|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.019|author1=Omidvarbornaa, Hamid|author2=Kumara, Ashok|author3=Kim, Dong-Shik}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The oxygen requirement in non-idling engines is usually mitigated using [[turbodiesel|turbocharging]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}). From the particle emission standpoint, exhaust from diesel vehicles has been reported to be significantly more harmful than those from petrol vehicles.

Diesel exhausts, long known for their characteristic smells, changed significantly with the reduction of [[sulfur]] content of diesel fuel, and again when [[catalytic converter]]s were introduced in exhaust systems.{{citation needed lead|date=October 2015}} Even so, diesel exhausts continue to contain an array of inorganic and organic pollutants, in various classes, and in varying concentrations (see below), depending on fuel composition and engine running conditions.

To rapidly reduce particulate matter from heavy-duty diesel engines in California, the [[California Air Resources Board]] created the [[Carl Moyer Program]] to provide funding for upgrading engines ahead of emissions regulations. In 2008 the California Air Resources Board also implemented the [[2008 California Statewide Truck and Bus Rule]] which requires all heavy-duty diesel trucks and buses, with a few exceptions, that operate in California to either retrofit or replace engines in order to reduce diesel particulate matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The US [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) issued a health standard in January 2001 designed to reduce diesel exhaust exposure in underground metal and nonmetal mines; on September 7, 2005, MSHA published a notice in the [[Federal Register]] proposing to postpone the effective date from January 2006 until January 2011.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Occupational health effects===
[[File:Diesel particulate matter monitors.png|alt=Two handheld instruments with screens and wires on a white background|thumb|Two diesel particulate matter monitors]]
Exposure to diesel exhaust and '''diesel particulate matter''' (DPM) is an occupational hazard to [[truckers]], [[railroad]] workers and occupants of residential homes in vicinity of a [[rail yard]], and [[miners]] using diesel-powered equipment in underground mines. Adverse health effects have also been observed in the general population at ambient atmospheric particle concentrations well below the concentrations in occupational settings.

In March 2012, U.S. government scientists showed that underground miners exposed to high levels of diesel fumes have a threefold increased risk for contracting lung cancer compared with those exposed to low levels. The $11.5 million Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS) followed 12,315 miners, controlling for key carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, radon, and asbestos. This allowed scientists to isolate the effects of diesel fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Attfield|first=M. D.|author2=Schleiff, P. L.|author3=Lubin, J. H.|author4=Blair, A.|author5=Stewart, P.

===Concerns regarding particulates{{anchor|Concerns_regarding_particulates}}===
[[File:Diesel-smoke.jpg|thumb|Heavy truck, with visible particulate soot]]
'''Diesel particulate matter''' (DPM), sometimes also called '''diesel exhaust particles''' (DEP), is the [[particulate]] component of diesel exhaust, which includes diesel [[soot]] and [[aerosols]] such as ash particulates, metallic abrasion particles, [[sulfates]], and [[silicates]]. When released into the [[atmosphere]], DPM can take the form of individual particles or chain aggregates, with most in the invisible sub-micrometre range of 100 [[nanometer]]s, also known as [[ultrafine particles]] (UFP) or PM0.1.

The main particulate fraction of diesel exhaust consists of [[fine particles]]. Because of their small size, inhaled particles may easily penetrate deep into the lungs.&lt;ref name="Lippmann2009" /&gt;  The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the exhaust stimulate nerves in the lungs, causing reflex coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170522080928.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The rough surfaces of these particles makes it easy for them to bind with other [[toxin]]s in the [[Natural environment|environment]], thus increasing the hazards of particle inhalation.&lt;ref name=OmidvaRev15/&gt;{{verify source|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="Lippmann2009" /&gt;

A study of [[particulate]] matter (PM) emissions from transit buses running on [[ULSD]] and a mixture of [[biodiesel]] and conventional diesel (B20) was reported by Omidvarborna and coworkers, where they conclude PM emissions appeared lower in cases of mixed diesel/biodiesel use, where they were dependent on the [[engine]] model, cold and hot [[idle]] modes, and fuel type, and that [[heavy metals]] in PM emitted during hot idling were greater than those from cold idling; reasons for PM reduction in biodiesel emissions were suggested to result from the oxygenated structure of biodiesel fuel, as well as arising from changes in technology (including the use of a [[catalytic converter]] in this test system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Omidvarbornaa, Hamid |author2=Kumara, Ashok |author3=Kim, Dong-Shik | year = 2014 | title=Characterization of Particulate Matter Emitted from Transit Buses Fueled with B20 in Idle Modes|journal=Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering|volume=2|issue=4, December|pages=2335–2342|doi=10.1016/j.jece.2014.09.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343714002140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies concluded that while in certain specific cases (i.e. low loads, more saturated feedstocks, ...), NOx emissions can be lower than with diesel fuel, in most cases NOx emissions are higher, and the NOx emissions even go up as more biofuel is mixed in. Pure biodiesel (B100) even ends up having 10-30% more NOx emissions compared to regular diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dieselnet.com/tech/fuel_biodiesel_emissions.php#pm Studies on PM emissions from biodiesel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of nanoparticles and [[nanotoxicology]] is in its infancy, and health effects from nanoparticles produced by all types of diesel engines are still being uncovered. It is clear, that diesel [[Fine particles#Health effects|health detriments of fine particle emissions]] are severe and pervasive. Although one study found no significant evidence that short-term exposure to diesel exhaust results in adverse [[extrapulmonary]] effects, effects that are correlated with an increase in [[cardiovascular]] disease,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/isth2005/abstract.asp?id=46528] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130091058/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/isth2005/abstract.asp?id=46528 |date=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2011 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' concluded that traffic exposure is the single most serious preventable trigger of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in the general public, as the cause of 7.4% of all attacks.&lt;ref name = "NPKMMN" &gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Public health importance of triggers of myocardial infarction: comparative risk assessment | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2962296-9/abstract | journal = The Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9767| pages = 732–740 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62296-9 | pmid=21353301 | last1 = Nawrot | first1 = TS | last2 = Perez | first2 = L | last3 = Künzli | first3 = N | last4 = Munters | first4 = E | last5 = Nemery | first5 = B}}: "Taking into account the OR and the prevalences of exposure, the highest PAF was estimated for traffic exposure (7.4%)...

Since the study of the detrimental health effects of nanoparticles ([[nanotoxicology]]) is still in its infancy, and the nature and extent of negative health impacts from diesel exhaust continues to be discovered. There is little controversy, however, that the public health impact of diesels is higher than that of petrol-fuelled vehicles despite the wide uncertainties.&lt;ref name="Intpanis"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Int Panis  | first = L  | title = Diesel or Petrol ?

===Variation with engine conditions===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The types and quantities of nanoparticles can vary according to operating temperatures and pressures, presence of an open flame, fundamental fuel type and fuel mixture, and even atmospheric mixtures. As such, the resulting types of [[nanoparticles]] from different engine technologies and even different fuels are not necessarily comparable. One study has shown that 95% of the volatile component of diesel nanoparticles is unburned lubricating oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On-line measurements of diesel nanoparticle composition and volatility |date= |doi=10.1016/S1352-2310(02)01017-8 | volume=37 |journal=Atmospheric Environment |pages=1199–1210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term effects still need to be further clarified, as well as the effects on susceptible groups of people with cardiopulmonary diseases.

Diesel engines can produce [[black carbon|black soot]] (or more specifically diesel particulate matter) from their exhaust. The black smoke consists of carbon compounds that have not burned because of local low temperatures where the fuel is not fully atomized. These local low temperatures occur at the cylinder walls, and at the surface of large droplets of fuel. At these areas where it is relatively cold, the mixture is rich (contrary to the overall mixture which is lean). The rich mixture has less air to burn and some of the fuel turns into a carbon deposit. Modern car engines use a [[diesel particulate filter]] (DPF) to capture carbon particles and then intermittently burn them using extra fuel injected directly into the filter. This prevents carbon buildup at the expense of wasting a small quantity of fuel.

The full load limit of a diesel engine in normal service is defined by the "black smoke limit", beyond which point the fuel cannot be completely burned. As the "black smoke limit" is still considerably lean of stoichiometric, it is possible to obtain more power by exceeding it, but the resultant inefficient combustion means that the extra power comes at the price of reduced combustion efficiency, high fuel consumption and dense clouds of smoke. This is only done in high performance applications where these disadvantages are of little concern.

When starting from cold, the engine's combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat out of the cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic governor control to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled [[glow plug]]s, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.

===General===
With [[emissions standards]] tightening, [[diesel engines]] are having to become more efficient and have fewer pollutants in their [[exhaust gas|exhaust]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} For instance, light duty truck must now have [[NOx]] emissions less than 0.07 g/mile,{{when|date=October 2015}}{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and in the U.S., by 2010, NOx emissions must be less than 0.03 g/mile.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Moreover, in recent years the United States, Europe, and Japan have extended emissions control regulations from covering on-road vehicles to include farm vehicles and locomotives, marine vessels, and stationary generator applications.&lt;ref name="Guan"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Guan, B|author2=Zhan, R|author3=Lin, H|author4=Huang, Z.|date=2014|title=Review of state of the art technologies of selective catalytic reduction of NOx from diesel engine exhaust|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|volume=66|pages=395–414|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431114001112|accessdate=22 October 2015|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.02.021}} {{subscription needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternative_fuel_vehicle|Changing to a different fuel]] (i.e. [[dimethyl ether]], and other [[Biofuel#Bioethers|bioethers]] as [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258176856_Simultaneous_reduction_of_NOx_and_smoke_from_a_direct-injection_diesel_engine_with_exhaust_gas_recirculation_and_diethyl_ether Simultaneous reduction of NOx and smoke from a direct-injection diesel engine with exhaust gas recirculation and diethyl ether]&lt;/ref&gt; ) tends to be a very effective means to reduce pollutants such as NOx and CO. When running on dimethyl ether (DME) for instance, particulate matter emissions are near-nonexistent, and the use of diesel particulate filters could even be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/emerging_dme.html Dimethyl Ether]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given that DME can be made from animal, food, and agricultural waste, it can even be [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] (unlike regular diesel).

In addition to changing the fuel, US engineers have also come up with two other principles and distinct systems to all on-market products that meet the U.S. 2010 emissions criteria,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{update after|2015|10|22}} [[selective non-catalytic reduction]] (SNCR), and [[exhaust gas recirculation]] (EGR). Both are in the exhaust system of diesel engines, and are further designed to promote efficiency.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Selective catalytic reduction===
[[Selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) injects a [[reductant]] such as ammonia or urea — the latter aqueous, where it is known as [[diesel exhaust fluid]], DEF) — into the exhaust of a diesel engine to convert nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) into gaseous [[nitrogen]] and water. SNCR systems have been prototyped that reduce 90% of the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in the exhaust system, with commercialized systems being somewhat lower.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} SCR systems do not necessarily need particulate matter (PM) filters; when SNCR and PM filters are combined, some engines have been shown to be 3-5% more fuel efficient.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A disadvantage of the SCR system, in addition to added upfront development cost (which can be offset by compliance and improved performance),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} is the need to refill the reductant, the periodicity of which varies with the miles driven, load factors, and the hours used.&lt;ref name="DieselForum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselforum.org/about-clean-diesel/what-is-scr- |title=What is SCR? &amp;#124; Diesel Technology Forum |publisher=Dieselforum.org |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}} {{better source|date=October 2015}}{{third-party-inline|date=October 2015}} The SNCR system is not as efficient at higher revolutions per minute ([[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} SCR is being optimized to have higher efficiency with broader temperatures, to be more durable, and to meet other commercial needs.&lt;ref name="Guan"/&gt;

===Exhaust gas recirculation===
{{Main article|Exhaust gas recirculation#In diesel engines}}
{{See also|Water injection (engine)}}

Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), on diesel engines, can be used to achieve a richer fuel to air mixture and a lower peak combustion temperature. Both effects reduce [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions, but can negatively impact efficiency and the production of soot particles. The richer mix is achieved by displacing some of the intake air, but is still lean compared to petrol engines, which approach the [[stoichiometric]] ideal. The lower peak temperature is achieved by a [[heat exchanger]] that removes heat before re-entering the engine, and works due to the exhaust gases' higher [[specific heat|specific heat capacity]] than air. With the greater soot production, EGR is often combined with a particulate matter (PM) filter in the exhaust.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;Bennett, Sean (2004). Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Engines, Fuel &amp; Computerized Management Systems 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|1401814999}}.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}} In turbocharged engines, EGR needs a controlled pressure differential across the exhaust manifold and intake manifold, which can be met by such engineering as use of a variable geometry turbocharger,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} which has inlet guide vanes on the turbine to build exhaust backpressure in the exhaust manifold directing exhaust gas to the intake manifold.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; It also requires additional external piping and valving, and so requires additional maintenance.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-2741/|title=Behaviour Study of Particulate Matter and Chemical Composition with Different Combustion Strategies|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined systems===
[[John Deere]], the farm equipment manufacturer is implementing such a combined SCR-EGR design, in a 9-liter "inline 6" diesel engine that involves both system types, a PM filter and additional oxidation catalyst technologies.&lt;ref name=JohnDeerePromoWhoKnowsWhen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/pdfs/emissions/large_engine_technology_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Technology to Reduce Emissions in Large Engines |publisher=Deere.com |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2015}}{{third-party-inline|date=October 2015}} The combined system incorporates two [[turbochargers]], the first on the exhaust manifold, with variable geometry and containing the EGR system; and a second a fixed geometry turbocharger. Recirculated exhaust gas and the compressed air from the turbochargers have separate coolers, and air merges before entering the intake manifold, and all subsystems are controlled by a central [[engine control unit]] that optimizes minimization of pollutants released in the exhaust gas.&lt;ref name=JohnDeerePromoWhoKnowsWhen/&gt;

'''Energy rate density''' is the amount of [[Thermodynamic_free_energy|free energy]] per unit [[time]] per unit [[mass]] (in CGS metric units erg/s/g; in MKS units joule/s/kg).  It is terminologically (but not always numerically) equivalent to [[power density]] when measured in SI units of W/kg.  Regardless of the units used, energy rate density describes the flow of energy through any system of given mass, and has been proposed as a measure of system complexity. The more complex the system, the more energy flows per second through each gram. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver | url = https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Complexity | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 27–40 | doi = 10.1002/cplx.20323 | bibcode = 2011Cmplx..16c..27C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chaisson2014&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; {{DOI|10.1155/2014/384912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in astronomy it is called the luminosity-to-mass ratio (the inverse of the [[mass-luminosity ratio]]), in physics the power density, in geology the specific [[radiant flux]] (where “specific” denotes per unit mass), in biology the specific [[metabolic rate]], and in engineering the [[power-to-weight ratio]].  Interdisciplinary researchers prefer to use the general term, energy rate density, not only to stress the intuitive notion of energy flow (in contrast to more colloquial connotations of the word "power"), but also to unify its potential application among all the natural sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] In ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), Cambridge Univ.

Research concerning the relationship between the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] quantity [[entropy]] and the [[evolution]] of [[life]] began around the turn of the 20th century.  In 1910, American historian [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] printed and distributed to university libraries and history professors the small volume ''A Letter to American Teachers of History'' proposing a theory of [[history]] based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and on the principle of entropy.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1986). History of the United States of America During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson (pg. 1299). Library of America.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1910). A Letter to American Teachers of History.

Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]'' by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] stimulated research in the field.  In his book, Schrödinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, or [[negentropy]] as it is sometimes called, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated the true source is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  More recent work has restricted the discussion to [[Gibbs free energy]] because biological processes on Earth normally occur at a constant temperature and pressure, such as in the atmosphere or at the bottom of an ocean, but not across both over short periods of time for individual organisms.

==Origin==
In 1863, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published his noted memoir "On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of Its Action" wherein he outlined a preliminary relationship, as based on his own work and that of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]], between his newly developed concept of entropy and life.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  Building on this, one of the first to speculate on a possible thermodynamic perspective of [[evolution]] was the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].  In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned:

{{quote|The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials – these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available – nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a ''struggle for [negative] entropy'', which becomes available through the transition of energy from the ''hot sun'' to the ''cold earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig  | title = The second law of thermodynamics (Theoretical physics and philosophical problems)| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--Anyone know what this image is supposed to be illustrating?--&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Solar-gradient.jpg|650px|center|thumb|The [[solar system]] from a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic systems]] perspective.]]--&gt;

==Early views==
In 1876, American civil engineer [[Richard Sears McCulloh]], in his ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam-Engine'', which was an early thermodynamics textbook, states, after speaking about the laws of the physical world, that "there are none that are established on a firmer basis than the two general propositions of [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]; which constitute the fundamental laws of our subject."  McCulloch then goes on to show that these two laws may be combined in a single expression as follows:

::&lt;math&gt; S = \int { dQ \over \tau } &lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt; S = &lt;/math&gt; entropy
::&lt;math&gt; dQ = &lt;/math&gt; a differential amount of [[heat]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]
::&lt;math&gt; \tau = &lt;/math&gt; [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]

McCulloch then declares that the applications of these two laws, i.e. what are currently known as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], are innumerable.  He then states:

{{quote|When we reflect how generally physical phenomena are connected with thermal changes and relations, it at once becomes obvious that there are few, if any, branches of [[natural science]]  which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration.  Nor should it, therefore, be a matter of surprise that already, in the short space of time, not yet one generation, elapsed since the [[Theory of heat|mechanical theory of heat]] has been freely adopted, whole branches of physical science have been revolutionized by it.&lt;ref name="McCulloch1876"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Richard Sears|title=Treatise on the mechanical theory of heat and its applications to the steam-engine, etc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96AAAAAAMAAJ|location=New York|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 267}}}}

McCulloch then gives a few of what he calls the “more interesting examples” of the application of these laws in extent and utility.  The first example he gives is [[physiology]], wherein he states that “the body of an animal, not less than a steamer, or a locomotive, is truly a [[heat engine]], and the consumption of food in the one is precisely analogous to the burning of fuel in the other; in both, the [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is the same: that called [[combustion]].”  He then incorporates a discussion of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]’s theory of respiration with cycles of digestion and excretion, perspiration, but then contradicts Lavoisier with recent findings, such as internal heat generated by friction, according to the new [[theory of heat]], which, according to McCulloch, states that the “heat of the body generally and uniformly is diffused instead of being concentrated in the chest”.  McCulloch then gives an example of the second law, where he states that [[friction]], especially in the smaller blooded-vessels, must develop heat.  Without doubt, animal heat is thus in part produced. He then asks: “but whence the expenditure of energy causing that friction, and which must be itself accounted for?"

To answer this question he turns to the mechanical theory of heat and goes on to loosely outline how the heart is what he calls a “force-pump”, which receives blood and sends it to every part of the body, as discovered by [[William Harvey]], that “acts like the piston of an engine and is dependent upon and consequently due to the cycle of nutrition and excretion which sustains physical or organic life.”  It is likely, here, that McCulloch was modeling parts of this argument on that of the famous [[Carnot cycle]].  In conclusion, he summarizes his first and second law argument as such:

{{quote|Everything physical being subject to the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], it follows that no physiological action can take place except with expenditure of [[energy]] derived from food; also, that an animal performing [[mechanical work]] must from the same quantity of food generate less heat than one abstaining from exertion, the difference being precisely the [[Mechanical equivalent of heat|heat equivalent]] of that of work.&lt;ref name="McCulloch1876"/&gt;{{Rp|p. 270}}}}

==Negative entropy==
In the 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]'', [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] theorizes that [[life]], contrary to the general tendency dictated by the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], decreases or maintains its entropy by feeding on negative entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schrödinger | first = Erwin  | title = [[What is Life – the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell]] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1944 | isbn = 0-521-42708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his note to Chapter 6 of ''What is Life?'', however, Schrödinger remarks on his usage of the term negative entropy:

{{quote|Let me say first, that if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

This is what is argued to differentiate life from other forms of [[matter]] organization.  In this direction, although life's dynamics may be argued to go against the tendency of second law, which states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase, it does not in any way conflict or invalidate this law, because the principle that entropy can only increase or remain constant applies only to a [[closed system]] which is adiabatically isolated, meaning no [[heat]] can enter or leave.  Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law.&lt;ref name="Denbigh"&gt;The common justification for this argument, for example, according to renowned chemical engineer Kenneth Denbigh, from his 1955 book ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', is that "living organisms are [[open system (systems theory)|open]] to their environment and can build up at the expense of foodstuffs which they take in and degrade."&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of organization in living systems increasing despite the second law is known as the Schrödinger paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Eric D.|last2=Sagan|first2=Dorion|title=Into the Cool: Energy Flow Thermodynamics and Life|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, United States|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[James Lovelock]] was among a group of scientists who were requested by [[NASA]] to make a theoretical life detection system to look for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] during the upcoming space mission.  When thinking about this problem, Lovelock wondered “how can we be sure that Martian life, if any, will reveal itself to tests based on Earth’s lifestyle?”&lt;ref name="gaia"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lovelock | first = James | title = GAIA – A New Look at Life on Earth | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-19-286218-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Lovelock, the basic question was “What is life, and how should it be recognized?”  When speaking about this issue with some of his colleagues at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he was asked what he would do to look for life on Mars. To this, Lovelock replied "I’d look for an entropy reduction, since this must be a general characteristic of life."&lt;ref name="gaia" /&gt;

==Gibbs free energy and biological evolution==
In recent years, the thermodynamic interpretation of evolution in relation to entropy has begun to utilize the concept of the [[Gibbs free energy]], rather than entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Moroz |first= Adam |title= The Common Extremalities in Biology and Physics |publisher= Elsevier |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-0-12-385187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because biological processes on earth take place at roughly constant temperature and pressure, a situation in which the Gibbs free energy is an especially useful way to express the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The Gibbs free energy is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G \equiv \Delta H-T \, \Delta S &lt;/math&gt;

The minimization of the Gibbs free energy is a form of the [[principle of minimum energy]], which follows from the [[entropy maximization principle]] for closed systems.  Moreover, the Gibbs free energy equation, in modified form, can be utilized for [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] when [[chemical potential]] terms are included in the energy balance equation. In a popular 1982 textbook, ''Principles of Biochemistry'', noted American biochemist [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] argues that the order produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the disorder they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division.  In short, according to Lehninger, "living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lehninger | first = Albert  | title = Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-87901-711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, according to the chemist [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], from his 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', we find a presentation in which the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution, as well as human cultural evolution, has its basis in the background of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]].  The (apparent) paradox between the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems, according to Avery, has its resolution "in the information content of the [[Gibbs free energy]] that enters the biosphere from outside sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avery | first = John  | title = Information Theory and Evolution | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 981-238-399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of natural selection responsible for such local increase in order may be mathematically derived directly from the expression of the second law equation for connected non-equilibrium open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0178 |title=Natural selection for least action |author1=Kaila, V. R.  |author2=Annila, A.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=8 November 2008 |volume=464 |issue=2099 |pages=3055–3070|bibcode = 2008RSPSA.464.3055K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entropy and the origin of life==
The second law of thermodynamics applied on the [[origin of life]] is a far more complicated issue than the further development of life, since there is no "standard model" of how the first biological lifeforms emerged; only a number of competing hypotheses. The problem is discussed within the area of [[abiogenesis]], implying gradual pre-Darwinian ''chemical evolution''. In 1924, [[Alexander Oparin]] suggested that sufficient energy was provided in a ''primordial soup''. The Belgian scientist [[Ilya Prigogine]] was awarded with a Nobel prize in 1977 for an analysis in this area. A related topic is the probability that life would emerge, which has been discussed in several studies, for example by [[Russell Doolittle]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell Doolittle, "The Probability and Origin of Life" in ''Scientists Confront Creationism'' (1984) Ed. Laurie R. Godfrey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entropy and the search for life elsewhere in the Universe==
In 2013 Azua-Bustos and Vega argued that disregarding the type of lifeform that could be envisioned both on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe, all should share in common the attribute of being entities that decrease their internal entropy at the expense of free energy obtained from its surroundings. As entropy allows the quantification of the degree of disorder in a system, any envisioned lifeform must have a higher degree of order than its supporting environment. These authors showed that by using fractal mathematics analysis alone, they could readily quantify the degree of structural complexity difference (and thus entropy) of living processes as distinct entities separate from their similar abiotic surroundings. This approach may allow the future detection of unknown forms of life both in the Solar System and on recently discovered exoplanets based on nothing more than entropy differentials of complementary datasets (morphology, coloration, temperature, pH, isotopic composition, etc.).

==Entropy in psychology==

The notion of entropy as disorder has been transferred from thermodynamics to [[psychology]] by [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] [[Antoni Kępiński]], who admitted being inspired by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name="kepinski1972c"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Rhythm of life (in Polish)|date=1972|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Kraków}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theoretical framework devised to explain [[mental disorder]]s (the [[information metabolism]] theory), the difference between living organisms and other systems was explained as the ability to maintain order. Contrary to inanimate matter, organisms maintain the particular order of their bodily structures and inner worlds which they impose onto their surroundings and forward to new generations. The life of an organism or the [[species]] ceases as soon as it loses that ability.&lt;ref name="pietrak2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietrak|first1=Karol|title=The foundations of socionics - a review.|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=47|year=2018|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/J.COGSYS.2017.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining of that order requires continual exchange of information between the organism and its surroundings. In higher organisms, [[information]] is acquired mainly through [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] and metabolised in the [[nervous system]]. The result is action - some form of [[motion (physics)|motion]], for example [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], [[speech]], internal motion of organs, [[secretion]] of hormones etc. The reaction of organism becomes an informational signal to other organisms. [[Information metabolism]], which allows to maintain the order, is possible only if a hierarchy of value exists, as the signals coming to the organism must be structured. In humans that hierarchy has three levels i.e. biological, emotional and sociocultural.&lt;ref name="schochow2016"&gt; {{cite journal|last1=Schochow|first1=Maximilian|last2=Steger|first2=Florian|title=Antoni Kepiński (1918–1972), pioneer of post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=208|issue=6|year=2016|pages=590|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/antoni-kepinski-19181972-pioneer-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder/CD3EE07A09F7EEABC49DE0D927804F6E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kępiński explained how various mental disorders are caused by distortions of that hierarchy and the return to mental health is possible through its restoration.&lt;ref name="bulaczek2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulaczek|first1=Aleksandra|title=Relations patient – doctor in axiological psychiatry of Antoni Kępiński (in Polish)|journal=Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae UKSW|date=2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=9–28|url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-37c5d3a1-9ee9-49e4-b9d1-287df1ef3a58/c/tom_11_2_1_aleksandra_bulaczek_relacje_pacjent_lekarz_w_psychiatrii_aksjologicznej_antoniego_kepinskiego.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was continued by Struzik who proposed that Kępiński's information metabolism theory may be seen as an extension of [[Léon Brillouin|Brilluoin]]'s [[Negentropy#Brillouin's_negentropy_principle_of_information|negentropy principle of information]].&lt;ref name="struzik1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Struzik|first1=Tadeusz|title=Kepiński's Information Metabolism, Carnot's Principle and Information Theory|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|date=1987|volume=36|issue=1-2|pages=105–111|doi=10.3109/00207458709002144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the notion of ''psychological entropy'' has been reintroduced to psychologists by Hirsh et al.&lt;ref name="hirsh2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh|first1=Jacob B.|last2=Mar|first2=Raymond A.|last3=Peterson|first3=Jordan B.|title=Psychological Entropy: A Framework for Understanding Uncertainty-Related Anxiety|journal=Psychological Review|date=2012|issue=Advance online publication|doi=10.1037/a0026767|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan_Peterson2/publication/221752816_Psychological_Entropy_A_Framework_for_Understanding_Uncertainty-Related_Anxiety/links/0912f50e6ba7e533b1000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simiraly to Kępiński, these authors noted that [[uncertainty]] management is a critical ability for any organism. Uncertainty, arising due to the conflict between competing [[perception|perceptual]] and [[behavior|behavioral]] [[affordance|affordances]], is experienced subjectively as [[anxiety]]. Hirsh and his collaborators proposed that both the perceptual and behavioral domains may be conceptualized as [[probability distribution|probability distributions]] and that the amount of uncertainty associated with a given perceptual or behavioral experience can be quantified in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|Claude Shannon’s entropy formula]].

==Other terms==
For nearly a century and a half, beginning with Clausius' 1863 memoir "On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of its Action", much writing and research has been devoted to the relationship between thermodynamic entropy and the [[evolution]] of [[life]]. The argument that life feeds on negative entropy or [[negentropy]] was asserted by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in a 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]''.  He posed, "How does the living organism avoid decay?" The obvious answer is: "By eating, drinking, breathing and (in the case of plants) assimilating." Recent writings have used the concept of [[Gibbs free energy]] to elaborate on this issue.&lt;ref name="Higgs.P"&gt;Higgs, P. G., &amp; Pudritz, R. E. (2009). "A thermodynamic basis for prebiotic amino acid synthesis and the nature of the first genetic code" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:0904.0402 Accepted for publication in Astrobiology]&lt;/ref&gt;
While energy from nutrients is necessary to sustain an organism's order, there is also the Schrödinger prescience: "An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a stream of order on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos – of drinking orderliness from a suitable environment – seems to be connected with the presence of the aperiodic solids..."  We now know that the 'aperiodic' crystal is DNA and that the irregular arrangement is a form of information. "The DNA in the cell nucleus contains the master copy of the software, in duplicate.  This software seems to control by "specifying an algorithm, or set of instructions, for creating and maintaining the entire organism containing the cell."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, P. (2004). Biological Physics, Energy, Information, Life. W.H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-4372-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA and other macromolecules determine an organism's life cycle: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death.  Nutrition is necessary but not sufficient to account for growth in size as genetics is the governing factor.  At some point, organisms normally decline and die even while remaining in environments that contain sufficient nutrients to sustain life. The controlling factor must be internal and not nutrients or sunlight acting as causal exogenous variables.  Organisms inherit the ability to create unique and complex biological structures; it is unlikely for those capabilities to be reinvented or be taught each generation. Therefore, DNA must be operative as the prime cause in this characteristic as well.  Applying Boltzmann's perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered and high entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy seen in biological ordering calls for a function like that known of DNA.  DNA's apparent information processing function provides a resolution of the paradox posed by life and the entropy requirement of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Jacob,  Understanding the Thermodynamics of Biological Order, The American Biology Teacher,  74, Number 1, January 2012, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, American biochemist [[Albert Lehninger]] argued that the "order" produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the "disorder" they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division. "Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as [[heat]] and entropy."&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lehninger|first=Albert|title=Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87901-711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study titled "Natural selection for least action" published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society A.'', Ville Kaila and Arto Annila of the [[University of Helsinki]] describe how the second law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation of motion to describe evolution, showing how natural selection and the principle of least action can be connected by expressing natural selection in terms of chemical thermodynamics. In this view, evolution explores possible paths to level differences in energy densities and so increase entropy most rapidly. Thus, an organism serves as an energy transfer mechanism, and beneficial mutations allow successive organisms to transfer more energy within their environment.&lt;ref name="evo2lot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news137679868.html|title=Evolution as Described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics|author=Lisa Zyga|date=11 August 2008|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entropy is defined for equilibrium systems,&lt;ref&gt;Callen, Herbert B (1985). Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; so objections to the extension of the second law and entropy to biological systems, especially as it pertains to its use to support or discredit the theory of evolution, have been stated.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Naim, Arieh (2012). Entropy and the Second Law. World Scientific Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Live systems and indeed much of the systems and processes in the universe operate far from equilibrium, whereas the second law succinctly states that isolated systems evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium — the state of maximum entropy.

However, entropy is well defined much more broadly based on the [[Entropy (information theory)|probabilities]] of a system's states, whether or not the system is a dynamical one (for which equilibrium could be relevant).  Even in those physical systems where equilibrium could be relevant, (1) live systems cannot persist in isolation and (2) the second principle of thermodynamics does not require that free energy be transformed into entropy along the shortest path: live organisms absorb energy from sunlight or from energy-rich chemical compounds and finally return part of such energy to the environment as entropy (heat and low free-energy compounds such as water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

The term "ethical consumer", now used generically, was first popularised by the UK magazine ''[[Ethical Consumer]]'', first published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/AboutUs/20thBirthday.aspx |title=20th Birthday! |publisher=Ethicalconsumer.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ethical Consumer'' magazine's key innovation was to produce 'ratings tables', inspired by the criteria-based approach of the then emerging [[ethical investment]] movement. ''Ethical Consumer'''s ratings tables awarded companies negative marks (and from 2005 overall scores) across a range of ethical and environmental categories such as 'animal rights', 'human rights' and 'pollution and toxics', empowering consumers to make ethically informed consumption choices and providing campaigners with reliable information on corporate behaviour. Such criteria-based ethical and environmental ratings have subsequently become commonplace both in providing consumer information and in business-to-business [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[sustainability]] ratings such as those provided by Innovest, [[Calvert Investments#The Calvert Foundation|Calvert Foundation]], Domini, IRRC, [[TIAA–CREF]] and KLD Analytics. Today, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] and [[Reuters]] provide "environmental, social and governance" ratings direct to the financial data screens of hundreds of thousands of stock market traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is ESG Data Going Mainstream? |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/leadinggreen/2009/05/is-esg-data-going-mainstream.html|publisher=Blogs.hbr.org|accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The not-for-profit Ethical Consumer Research Association continues to publish ''Ethical Consumer'' and its associated website, which provides free access to ethical ratings tables.

===Global morality===
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An [[cable reel|electric wire reel]] reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. When consumers choose and reuse environmentally friendly material like this, they are practicing ethical consumerism.]]
In ''Unequal Freedoms: The Global Market As An Ethical System'' (1998), [[John McMurtry]] argues that no purchasing decision exists that does not itself imply some moral choice, and that there is no purchasing that is not ultimately moral in nature.  This mirrors older arguments, especially by the [[Anabaptists]], e.g. [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability of all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one's own choices.  It is often suggested that [[Judeo-Christian]] scriptures further direct followers towards practising good stewardship of the Earth, under an obligation to a God who is believed to have created the planet for us to share with other creatures. A similar argument presented from a [[secular]] [[humanism|humanist]] point of view is that it is simply better for human beings to acknowledge that the planet supports [[life]] only because of a delicate balance of many different factors.

===Spending as morality===
Some trust criteria, e.g. [[creditworthiness]] or [[implied warranty]], are considered to be part of any purchasing or sourcing decision. However, these terms refer to broader systems of guidance that would, ideally, cause any purchasing decision to disqualify offered products or services based on non-price criteria that affect the moral rather than the functional liabilities of the entire production process. [[Paul Hawken]], a proponent of [[Natural Capitalism]], refers to "comprehensive outcomes" of production services as opposed to the "culminative outcomes" of using the product of such services.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Often, moral criteria are part of a much broader shift away from [[commodity markets]] towards a deeper [[service economy]] where all activities, from growing to harvesting to processing to delivery, are considered part of the [[value chain]] and for which consumers are "responsible".

Andrew Wilson, Director of the UK's Ashridge Centre for Business and Society, argues that "Shopping is more important than voting", and that the disposition of [[money]] is the most basic role we play in any system of [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/sustainability/2013/06/19/ethicalspending/|title=Ethics is in the eye of the spender|website=Sustainability at LSE|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists believe that it is the clearest way that we express our actual moral choices, i.e., if we say we care about something but continue to buy from parties that have a high probability of risk of harm or destruction of that thing, we don't really care about it, we are practicing a form of simple [[hypocrisy]].

In an effort by churches to advocate moral and ethical consumerism, many have become involved in the [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] movement:

==Standards and labels==
A number of standards, labels and marks have been introduced for ethical consumers, such as the following:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[B Corporation (certification)|B corporation]]
* [[Cooperative|Co-op Marque]]
* [[Cetacean bycatch|Dolphin safe]]
* [[EKOenergy]] for electricity agreements
* [[Equal Exchange]]
* [[Ethical Consumer]] Best Buy label
* [[Fairtrade]]
* [[Free-range]] poultry
* [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC-certified]] sustainably sourced wood
* [[Grass fed beef]]
* [[Green America]] Seal of Approval
* [[Halal]] (religious standard)
* [[Kosher]] (religious standard)
* [[Local food]]
* [[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC-certified]] sustainably sourced seafood
* No Pork No Lard (semi-religious standard)
* [[Organic food]]
* [[Organic Trade Association]]
* [[Product Red]]
* [[Rainforest Alliance|Rainforest Alliance certified]]
* [[Recycling|Recycled/recyclable]]
* [[Respects Your Freedom]]
* [[Shade-grown coffee]]
* [[SA8000|Social Accountability 8000]]
* [[Union label|Union-made]]
* [[Vegan]]
{{div col end}}
Along with disclosure of ingredients, some [[mandatory labelling]] of origins of clothing or food is required in all [[developed nations]]. This practice has been extended in some [[developing nations]], e.g., where every item carries the name, phone number and fax number of the factory where it was made so a buyer can inspect its conditions.  And, more importantly, to prove that the item was not made by "[[prison labor]]", use of which to produce export goods is banned in most developed nations. Such labels have also been used for boycotts, as when the merchandise mark [[Made in Germany]] was introduced in 1887.

These labels serve as tokens of some reliable validation process, some [[instructional capital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://identity.coop/|title = Coop Marque|date = |access-date = |website = Coop|publisher = International Cooperative Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; much as does a brand name or a nation's flag. They also signal some [[social capital]], or trust, in some community of auditors that must follow those instructions to validate those labels.

[[File:Verus Carbon Neutral Sign.JPG|right]]
Some companies in the United States, though currently not required to reduce their [[carbon footprint]], are doing so voluntarily by changing their energy use practices, as well as by directly funding (through [[carbon offset]]s), businesses that are already sustainable—or are developing or improving [[Environmental technology|green technologies]] for the future.

In 2009, [[Atlanta]]'s [[Virginia-Highland]] neighborhood became the first Carbon-Neutral Zone in the United States. Seventeen merchants in Virginia-Highland allowed their carbon footprint to be audited.

Over time, some{{Who|date=February 2016}} theorists suggest, the amount of [[social capital]] or trust invested in nation-states (or "flags") will continue to decrease, and that placed in corporations (or "brands") will increase. This can only be offset by retrenched [[national sovereignty]] to reinforce shared national standards in [[tax, trade, and tariff]] laws, and by placing the trust in civil society in such "moral labels". These arguments have been a major focus of the [[anti-globalization movement]], which includes many broader arguments against the amoral nature of markets as such. However, the economic school of [[Public Choice Theory]] pioneered by [[James M. Buchanan]] has offered counter-arguments based on economic demonstration to this theory of 'amoral markets' versus 'moral governments'.

==Areas of concern==
[[Ethical Consumer|Ethical Consumer Research Association]], the alternative consumer organisation, collects and categorises information of more than 30,000 companies according to their performance in five main areas, composing the Ethiscore:
*Environment: Environmental Reporting, Nuclear Power, Climate Change, Pollution &amp; Toxics, Habitats &amp; Resources
*People: Human Rights, Workers' Rights, Supply Chain Policy, Irresponsible Marketing, Armaments
*Animals: Animal Testing, Factory Farming, Other Animal Rights
*Politics: Political Activity, Boycott Call, Genetic Engineering, Anti-Social Finance, Company Ethos
*Product Sustainability: Organic, Fairtrade, Positive Environmental Features, Other Sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Gray, Dave Owen and Carol Adams, "Accounting and accountability : changes and challenges in corporate social and environmental reporting"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[GfK NOP]], the market research group, has made a five-country study of consumer beliefs about the ethics of large companies. The report was described in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' article published on February 20, 2007 entitled "Ethical consumption makes mark on branding",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grande |first=Carlos |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d54c45ec-c086-11db-995a-000b5df10621.html |title=Ethical consumption makes mark on branding |publisher=FT.com |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up by an online debate/discussion hosted by FT.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d54c45ec-c086-11db-995a-000b5df10621.html|title= entitled 'Ethical consumption makes mark on branding'|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries surveyed were Germany, the United States, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], France and Spain. More than half of respondents in Germany and the US believed there is a serious deterioration in standards of corporate practice. Almost half of those surveyed in Britain, France and Spain held similar beliefs.

About a third of respondents told researchers they would pay higher prices for ethical brands though perception of various companies' ethical or unethical status varied considerably from country to country.

The most ethically perceived brands were The [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] (in the UK), [[Coca-Cola]] (in the US), [[Danone]] (in France), [[Adidas]] (in Germany) and [[Nestlé]] (in Spain). Coca-Cola, Danone, Adidas and Nestlé did not appear anywhere in the UK's list of 15 most ethical companies. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] appeared in the lists of the other four countries but not in the UK's list.

In the UK, [[The Co-operative Bank]] has produced an Ethical Consumerism Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwithmoney.co.uk/ethicalconsumerismreport|title= Ethical Consumerism Report|publisher=Co-operative Bank|accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the Ethical Purchasing Index) since 2001. The report measures the market size and growth of a basket of 'ethical' products and services, and valued UK ethical consumerism at [[GBP]]36.0 billion (~[[USD]]54.4 billion) in 2008, and [[GBP]]47.2 billion ([[USD]]72.5 billion) in 2012.

A number of organisations provide research-based evaluations of the behavior of companies around the world, assessing them along ethical dimensions such as [[human rights]], the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[animal welfare]] and [[politics]]. [[Green America]] is a not-for-profit membership organization founded in 1982 that provides the ''Green American Seal of Approval'' and produces a "Responsible Shopper" guide to "alert consumers and investors to problems with companies that they may shop with or invest in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopamerica.org/programs/responsibleshopper/about.cfm |title=Coop American: Responsible Shopping: About |publisher=Coopamerica.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethical Consumer Research Association is a not-for-profit workers' co-operative founded in the UK in 1988 to "provide information on the companies behind the brand names and to promote the ethical use of consumer power"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecritic.org/info/about/ethicalconsumer.aspx |title=Ethical Consumer Research Association: About |publisher=Corporatecritic.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides an online searchable database under the name Corporate Critic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatecritic.org/info/rr/ethiscore.aspx |title=Research &amp; Ratings: About the Ethiscore |publisher=Corporate Critic |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Ethiscore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiscore.org/info.aspx?info=research |title=Research and ratings |publisher=Ethiscore |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiscore is a weightable numerical rating designed as a quick guide to the ethical status of companies, or brands in a particular area, and is linked to a more detailed ethical assessment. "alonovo" is an online shopping portal that provides similar weightable ethical ratings termed the "Corporate Social Behavior Index".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alonovo.com/community/SRI Aalonovo Corporate Social Behavior Index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624160954/http://www.alonovo.com/community/SRI |date=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conscientious consumption===
&lt;!-- "Conscientious consumption" redirects here --&gt;
The consumer rationalizes unnecessary and even unwanted consumption by saying that "it's for a good cause".&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book |author=Gayle A. Sulik |title=Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |year=2010 |pages=111–132 |isbn=0-19-974045-3 |oclc= 535493589}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the consumer buys [[pink ribbons]] during [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]], [[greenwashing|green products]] to support the environment, candy and popcorn from school children, greeting cards and gift wrap from charities, and many other, often unwanted objects. The consumer avoids considering whether the price offered is fair, whether a small cash donation would be more effective with far less work, or even whether selling the item is consistent with the ostensible mission, such as when sports teams sell candy.

Some of these efforts are based on [[concept brand]]s: the consumer is buying an association with women's health or environmental concerns as much as she or he is buying a tangible product.&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

===Alternative giving===
{{main|Alternative giving}}
In response to an increasing demand for ethical consumerism surrounding gift giving occasions, charities have promoted an alternative gift market, in which charitable contributions are made on behalf of the gift "recipient". The "recipient" receives a card explaining the selected gift, while the actual gift item (frequently agricultural supplies or domestic animals) is sent to a family in a poor community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/christmas2005/story/0,,1672350,00.html|title=Giving well is hard to do: so here's my seasonal guide|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2007-05-03 | location=London | date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics argue that the ability to effect structural change is limited in ethical consumerism. Some cite the preponderance of [[Niche marketing|niche markets]] as the actual effect of ethical consumerism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devinney|first1=Timothy|title=Value vs. Values: The Myth of the Ethical Consumer|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000199|website=Policy Innovations|publisher=Policy Innovations|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that information is limited regarding the outcomes of a given purchase, preventing consumers from making informed ethical choices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Critics have also argued that the uneven distribution of wealth prevents consumerism, ethical or otherwise, from fulfilling its democratic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Tim|title=When did fair trade become a consumerist concept?|url=http://newint.org/blog/2014/03/26/fair-trade-and-global-justice/|accessdate=11 June 2015|agency=New Statesman|publisher=New Statesman|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study suggests that "Buying Green" serves as a license for unethical behavior – in their 2009 paper, "Do Green Products Make Us Better People?",&lt;ref&gt;Do Green Products Make Us Better People? ([[Psychological Science]], April, 2010) Nina Mazar, Chen-Bo Zhong&lt;/ref&gt; Nina Mazar, Chen-Bo Zhong state the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products. However, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products. Together, the studies show that consumption is more tightly connected to our social and ethical behaviors in directions and domains other than previously thought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2010 ''[[The Guardian]]'' article, British environmental writer and activist [[George Monbiot]] argued that green consumers who do not articulate their values are part of "a catastrophic mistake" on the grounds that such consumerism "strengthens extrinsic values" (those that "concern status and self-advancement"), thereby "making future campaigns less likely to succeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=It goes against our nature; but the left has to start asserting its own values|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/oct/11/left-values-progressive-self-interest|accessdate=29 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolution]] has been an important theme in fiction, including [[speculative evolution]] in [[science fiction]], since the late 19th century, though it began before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views as well as Darwin's.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.

==Context==

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], as set out in his 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', is the dominant theory in modern biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archivedate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism ([[orthogenesis]]) and [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]], is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=69 | issue=| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressionism==
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]]'s allegorical 1781 story ''{{ill|La découverte Australe par un homme volant|fr|La Découverte australe}}'' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man).&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; 

The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', where the villain Faora states: "The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins." She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardwick |first1=Kayla M. |title=Natural selection at the movies: Only the bad guys evolve |url=https://nothinginbiology.org/2014/10/22/natural-selection-at-the-movies-only-the-bad-guys-evolve/ |website=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense [except in the light of evolution] |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of "bad-guy traits" the [[Morlock]]s in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 ''[[The Time Machine]]'', the bugs' [[caste (insect)|caste system]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1959 ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and the effective colonisation by [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' aliens.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014/&gt;

==Lamarckism==
{{see|Lamarckism}}

In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'' and his 1894 ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'', [[J.-H. Rosny]]'s 1887 ''Les Xipéhuz'' and his 1910 ''La mort de la terre'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s 1901 ''La grande forêt, le village aérien''. The Lamarckist philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s creative evolution driven by the supposed [[élan vital]] likely inspired [[J. D. Beresford]]'s English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 ''[[The Hampdenshire Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

==Darwinism==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for a 1906 edition of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 "[[The War of the Worlds]]" by [[Henrique Alvim Corréa]]]]
{{see|Speculative evolution}}

Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer "[[survival of the fittest]]" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's ''The Time Machine'' already mentioned, his 1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'', and his 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; More broadly, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899 ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[R. L. Stevenson]]'s 1886 ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote an optimistic tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. This influenced [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 ''[[Last and First Men]]'', which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]''. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or [[intelligent machine]]s. For instance, [[Olof Johannesson]]'s 1966 ''The Great Computer'' gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 ''Galapagos'' is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

'''Fibre modification''' is a research field in which researchers aim at developing and applying technologies to impart new properties to natural fibres such as those in [[paper]], in order to increase their functionality. Research areas in this field include many different technologies, amongst which the chemical modifications of fibres are widely used. One important sector of application of the chemical modifications is the treatment of [[wood]] for giving it enhanced properties such as higher mechanical properties, water impermeability, less [[hygroscopic]]ity, bacterial and fungal resistance. Transferring and adapting the technical knowledge on fibre modification available for the wood sector to the recycled paper sector is an innovative use of these chemical treatments which has been the subject of studies that have been carried out within an EU co-funded project called Fibre+.&lt;ref&gt;7th Framework Program – SME-AGs funding scheme – Grant Agreement n° 315633 – http://www.fibreplus.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The project Consortium included members representing Paper and Packaging European Associations ([[Confederation of European Paper Industries|CEPI]], FEFCO), and research institutes specialized in the wood and paper for [[packaging industry|packaging sector]] and paper and packaging companies. The focus of the project was on chemical modification of the paper made recycled fibres, investigating the possibility to transfer wood fibre modifications technique from the wood sector to paper and packaging sector. The aim was to enhance the properties of papers and of the packaging, as the recycling process causes the deterioration of fibres.

The chemical modification of recycled fibres aimed at the creation of a new generation of packaging papers characterized for being more recyclable, less hygroscopic, stiff and durable. The high [[recycling]] rate of papers in Europe (which is at the level of 72%) and the consequent importance that recycling has for the circular economy, were at the basis of this study. Paper products form part of an integrated carbon cycle based on the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] conversion of water, [[carbon dioxide]], nutrients and solar energy into renewable wood-based [[biomass]]. Once consumed, paper may be recovered and used again either as a source of secondary fibres, to produce recycled paper or as [[bio-fuel]]. Fibre packages or corrugated containers made from [[corrugated board]] were the ones that were dealt with in the project, as they are considered as being the most prominent structural application of paper.

==Chemical modification attempts==

Fibre modification with chemicals or [[enzyme]]s had been investigated in the production of [[fibreboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krzysik, A.M., J.A. Youngquist, R.M. Rowell, J.H. Muehl, P. Chow and S.R. Shook|year= 1993|title=Feasibility of using recycled newspapers as a fiber source for dry-process hardboards|journal=For. Prod. J.|volume=43|pages=53–58|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6276892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Bueso et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing [[thermoplastic]] composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takatani, M., Itoh, H,. Ohsugi, S,. Kitayama, T., Saegusa, M., Kawai, S. and Okamoto, T.|year=2000|title=Effect of lignocellulosic material on the properties of thermoplastic polymer/wood composites,

|volume=54
|pages=197–200
|doi=10.1515/HF.2000.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the [[hydrogen bonding]] model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of [[cellulose]] fibres using [[polymer]]s targeted on [[entropy]] controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. [[carboxymethyl cellulose]]) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented.&lt;ref&gt;Laine at al. 2002, Gustavsson 2003, Danielsson 2006, Erhard 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would not solve the problem of raw material availability.

==Objective==

Based on this state-of-the-art, the objective of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and corrugated board properties also is needed.

From wood fibre modification to paper technology chemical wood modification aims at altering the structure of the cell wall matrix. Wood
properties are improved considerably by converting [[hydrophilic]] OH-groups into larger more [[hydrophobic]] groups. Also the physical fixation of modifying chemicals in the cell wall matrix can considerably change the wood properties. In addition to a hydrophobing effect, the treatments reduce the volume of [[cell wall]] nano-pores and thus decrease the incorporation of water molecules into the cell wall matrix. On a macroscopic scale, wood modification can change important properties of the wood including biological durability (resistance against fungi), dimensional stability, [[hardness]] and [[UV-stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hill CAS|year=2006|title=Wood modification. Chemical, thermal and other processes|publisher=Wiley, Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-02172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since paper is produced from wood fibres, it was possible to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, [[polyelectrolyte]]s, functional polymers based on cellulose, [[hemicellulose]]s and [[starch]]) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and [[University of Goettingen]], Germany; [[Kungliga Tekniska högskolan]] (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and [[glutaraldehyde]] with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos and Mai (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the Fibre+ project is to build on the existing knowledge on fibre modification for adapting, implementing and disseminating this innovative technology in European paper SMEs.

Results of the Fibre+ project on recycled fibres for packaging paper and information on potential developments of the Fibre+ concept can be found on the Fibre+ website including scientific articles that have been published as a consequence of the RTD work that has been carried out during the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hosseinpourpia, R., Adamopoulos, S. and C.

'''Fillers''' are particles added to material ([[plastics]], [[composite material]], [[concrete]]) to lower the consumption of more expensive [[Binder (material)|binder]] material or to better some properties of the mixtured material. Worldwide, more than 53 million tons of fillers (with a total sum of approximately EUR16 billion) are used every year in different application areas, such as paper, plastics, rubber, paints, coatings, adhesives and sealants. As such, fillers, produced by more than 700 companies, rank among the world's major raw materials and are contained in a variety of goods for daily consumer needs.&lt;ref name=Ceresana&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Study: Fillers (3rd edition)|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/fillers/|publisher=Ceresana|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of fillers==
In the past, fillers were used predominantly to cheapen end products, in which case they were called extenders. Among the 21 most important fillers, [[calcium carbonate]] holds the largest market volume and is mainly used in the plastics sector.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Hans-Georg Elias "Plastics, General Survey" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a20_543}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the plastic industry mostly consumes ground calcium carbonate (GCC), the paper industry primarily uses precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) that is derived from natural minerals. [[Wood flour]] and [[saw dust]] are used as filler in [[thermosetting]]{{cn|date=April 2014}} plastic. 

In some cases, fillers also enhance properties of the products, e.g. in composites. In such cases, a beneficial chemical interaction develops between the host material and the filler. As a result, a number of optimized types of fillers, nano-fillers or surface treated goods have been developed.

'''Gavin Maxwell''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]], FIAL, FZS (Sc.), [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]]&lt;ref name="Rocks"&gt;''The Rocks Remain'', Gavin Maxwell, Longmans, 1963, ASIN: B0000CLY9N&lt;/ref&gt; (15 July 1914{{spaced ndash}}7 September 1969) was a Scottish [[Natural history|naturalist]] and author, best known for his [[nonfiction]] writing and his work with [[European otter|otter]]s. He wrote the book ''[[Ring of Bright Water]]'' (1960) about how he brought an otter back from [[Iraq]] and raised it in Scotland. The otter was of a previously unknown sub-species which was subsequently named after Maxwell. ''Ring of Bright Water'' sold more than a million copies and was made into [[Ring of Bright Water (film)|a film]] starring [[Bill Travers]] and [[Virginia McKenna]] in 1969. The title ''Ring of Bright Water'' was taken from the poem "The Marriage of Psyche" by [[Kathleen Raine]], who said in her autobiography that Maxwell had been the love of her life.

==Biography==
[[File:Elrig House - geograph.org.uk - 545963.jpg|thumb|left|The 'House of Elrig' - Gavin Maxwell's childhood home. Arylick farm to right and [[Elrig Loch]] in the background.]]

Gavin Maxwell was the youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Aymer Maxwell and Lady Mary Percy, fifth daughter of the [[Henry Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland|seventh Duke of Northumberland]]. His paternal grandfather, [[Sir Herbert Maxwell]], was an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], politician and natural historian.&lt;ref name="Rocks" /&gt;

Maxwell was raised in the small village of [[Elrig]], near [[Port William, Scotland|Port William]], in [[Wigtownshire]], south-western Scotland. Maxwell's relatives still live in the area and the family's ancient [[Estate (house)|estate and grounds]] are in nearby [[Monreith House|Monreith]].

Maxwell's education took place at a succession of [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory]] and [[Public School (United Kingdom)|public school]]s, including the sporty [[Heddon Court School]]&lt;ref name="Brendon2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brendon |first=Vyvyen |title=Prep School Children: A Class Apart Over Two Centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7sNA32_K5rwC&amp;pg=PA93 |date=2009 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-84706-287-1 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[East Barnet]], [[St Cyprian's School]], where he found encouragement for his interest in [[natural history]], and [[Stowe School]]. In ''The Rocks Remain'', he relates how family pressure led him to take a degree in Estate Management at [[Hertford College, Oxford]], where he spent his time pursuing sporting and leisure activities instead of studying. He cheated his way through the intermediate exams but passed the [[final examination]]s honestly, having [[Cramming (education)|crammed]] the entire three-year course in six weeks.&lt;ref name="Rocks" /&gt;

[[Image:Soaybaskingsharkfisheries.jpg|thumb|Former HQ of The Island of [[Soay, Skye|Soay]] Shark Fisheries Ltd, started by Maxwell]]
[[File:Exterior of 9 Paultons Square, London.jpg|thumb|A blue plaque commemorating Maxwell as a writer and naturalist at the house where he lived in Paultons Square, London]]

During [[World War II]], Maxwell served as an instructor with the [[Special Operations Executive]]. After the war, he purchased the Isle of [[Soay, Skye|Soay]] off [[Isle of Skye|Skye]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]], Scotland. According to his book ''Harpoon at a Venture'' (1952), bad planning and a lack of finance meant his attempt to establish a [[basking shark]] fishery there between 1945-48 proved unsuccessful and the island was sold on to his business partner, [[Tex Geddes]]. He became a close friend of [[Elias Canetti]].

In 1956, Maxwell toured the [[Tigris-Euphrates river system|reed marshes]] of [[Southern Iraq]] with explorer [[Wilfred Thesiger]]. Maxwell's account of their trip appears in ''A Reed Shaken By The Wind'', later published under the title ''People of the Reeds''. It was hailed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "near perfect".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{cite book |last=Stott |first=Louis |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Maxwell, Gavin |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/34959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell next moved to [[Sandaig]]&lt;ref&gt;At {{coord|57|10|06|N|5|41|06|W}}, to a house which had been a croft and home to the local lighthouse keeper of the Sandaig Light southwest of [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]].&lt;/ref&gt; (which he called ''Camusfeàrna'' in his books), a small community opposite [[Isleornsay]] on a remote part of the Scottish mainland. This is where his "otter books" are set. After ''Ring of Bright Water'' (1960), he wrote ''The Rocks Remain'' (1963), in which the otters Edal, Teko, Mossy and Monday show great differences in personality. ''The Rocks Remain'' is a sequel to ''Ring of Bright Water'', and demonstrates the difficulty Maxwell was having, possibly as a result of his mental state, in remaining focused on one project and the impact that had on his otters, Sandaig and his own life.

In 1966, he travelled to [[Morocco]], tracing the dramatic lives of the last rulers of Morrakesh under the French. His account of the trip was published as ''Lords of the Atlas: The Rise and Fall of the House of [[T%27hami_El_Glaoui|Glaoua]] 1893-1956''. During the Moroccan [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]], the regime there considered his book subversive and banned its importation.

In ''The House of Elrig'' (1965), Maxwell describes his family history and his passion for the calf-country, Galloway, where he was born. It was during this period that he met [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Peter Scott]] and the young [[Terry Nutkins]], who later became a children's television presenter. Privately homosexual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frere |first=Richard |title=Maxwell's Ghost |publisher=[[Victor Gollancz]] |year=1976 |pages=65–66 |isbn=0-575-02044-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell married Lavinia Renton (daughter of [[Alan Lascelles|The Right Honourable Sir Alan Lascelles]] and granddaughter of [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viscount Chelmsford]], Wilfred Thesiger's uncle) on 1 February 1962. The marriage lasted little more than a year and they divorced in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1762.htm#i17617 |title=thePeerage.com |authorlink=Darryl Lundy |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell also lived in [[Paultons Square]] in [[London]].

In 1968, Maxwell's Sandaig home was destroyed by fire and he moved to the lighthouse keepers' cottages on [[Eilean Bàn, Lochalsh|Eilean Bàn (White Island)]], an island between the Isle of Skye and the Scottish mainland by Kyleakin. He invited [[John Lister-Kaye]] to join him on Eilean Bàn and help him build a zoo on the island and work on a book about British wild mammals. Lister-Kaye accepted the invitation, but both projects were abandoned when Maxwell died from cancer the following year.&lt;ref name="Lister-Kaye"&gt;{{cite book| author=Lister-Kaye, John |title=The White Island |publisher=Longman |year=1972 |isbn=0-582-10903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eilean Bàn now supports a pier of the [[Skye Bridge]], built during the 1990s. Despite modern traffic a hundred feet or so above it, the island is a commemorative otter sanctuary and houses a museum dedicated to Maxwell. Another memorial is a bronze otter erected at Monreith near to St Medan's Golf Club.

According to [[Douglas Botting]], Maxwell suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Botting"&gt;Douglas Botting, ''Gavin Maxwell, A Life'', HarperCollins 1993 ({{ISBN|0-246-13046-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's literary agent was Peter Janson-Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frere |first=Richard |title=Maxwell's Ghost |publisher=[[Victor Gollancz]] |year=1976 |page=71 |isbn=0-575-02044-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also agent for [[James Bond]] author [[Ian Fleming]].

==Maxwell's otter==
[[File:Maxwell's Otter looks over Front bay - geograph.org.uk - 605696.jpg|thumb|Statue of Maxwell's otter at [[Monreith, Scotland|Monreith]]]]
Maxwell's book ''[[Ring of Bright Water]]'' describes how, in 1956, he brought a [[smooth-coated otter]] back from [[Iraq]] and raised it in "Camusfearna" (Sandaig) on the west coast of Scotland.  He took the otter, called Mijbil, to the [[London Zoological Society]], where it was decided that this was a previously unknown [[sub-species]] of smooth-coated otter. It was therefore named ''Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli'' (or, [[Colloquialism|colloquially]], "Maxwell's otter") after him. While it was thought to have become extinct in the [[Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh|alluvial salt marshes of Iraq]] as a result of the large-scale drainage of the area that started in the 1960s, newer surveys suggest large populations remain throughout its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Omer|first1=Sawsan A.|title=Evidence for persistence and a major range  extension of the smooth-coated otter ( Lutrogale  perspicillata maxwelli ; Mustelidae, Carnivora) in Iraq|journal=Folia Zool. |date=2012 |volume=61|issue=2 |pages=172-176 |url=http://www.ivb.cz/folia/61/2/9_079.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Sheikhly |first1=Omar F.|last2=Nader|first2=Iyad A.|title=The Status of Iraq Smooth - Coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli Hayman  195 6 and Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra Linnaeus 1758 in Iraq |journal=IUCN Otter Spec.

In his book ''The Marsh Arabs'', [[Wilfred Thesiger]] wrote:

{{quote|[I]n 1956, Gavin Maxwell, who wished to write a book about the Marshes, came with me to Iraq, and I took him round in my ''tarada'' for seven weeks. He had always wanted an otter as a pet, and at last I found him a baby European otter which unfortunately died after a week, towards the end of his visit. He was in Basra preparing to go home when I managed to obtain another, which I sent to him. This, very dark in colour and about six weeks old, proved to be a new species. Gavin took it to England, and the species was named after him.}}

The otter became woven into the fabric of Maxwell's life. [[Kathleen Raine]]'s relationship with Maxwell deteriorated after 1956 when she indirectly caused the death of Mijbil. Raine held herself responsible not only for losing Mijbil but for a curse she had uttered shortly beforehand, frustrated by Maxwell's homosexuality: "Let Gavin suffer in this place as I am suffering now."  Raine blamed herself thereafter for all Maxwell's misfortunes, beginning with Mijbil's death and ending with the cancer that took his life in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janet Watts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/08/guardianobituaries.books |title="Kathleen Raine: Obituary", '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, London, 8/7/2003 |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dani Garavelli |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/dani-garavelli-gavin-maxwell-s-love-of-nature-1-3452667 |title="Gavin Maxwell's Love of Nature", Edinburgh, 22/6/2014 |publisher=Scotland on Sunday |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell's ashes were scattered on the site of his house ''Camusfeàrna''.

The '''geochemistry of carbon''' is the study of the transformations involving the element [[carbon]] within the systems of the Earth. To a large extent this study is organic geochemistry, but it also includes the very important carbon dioxide. Carbon is transformed by life, and moves between the major phases of the Earth, including the water bodies, atmosphere, and the rocky parts. Carbon is important in the formation of organic mineral deposits, such as coal, petroleum or natural gas. Most carbon is cycled through the atmosphere into living organisms and then respirated back into the atmosphere. However an important part of the carbon cycle involves the trapping of living matter into [[sediment]]s. The carbon then becomes part of a [[sedimentary rock]] when [[lithification]] happens.
Human technology or natural processes such as weathering, or underground life or water can return the carbon from sedimentary rocks to the atmosphere. From that point it can be transformed in the rock cycle into metamorphic rocks, or melted into igneous rocks. Carbon can return to the surface of the Earth by volcanoes or via uplift in tectonic processes. Carbon is returned to the atmosphere via [[volcanic gas]]es.
Carbon undergoes transformation in the mantle under pressure to diamond and other minerals, and also exists in the Earth's outer core in solution with iron, and may also be present in the inner core.&lt;ref name="kilo9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Killops|first1=Stephen|last2=Killops|first2=Vanessa|title=Introduction to organic geochemistry|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden|isbn=978-0-632-06504-2|pages=1–9|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon can form a huge number of different stable compounds. It is an essential component of living matter.
Living organisms can live in a limited range of conditions on the Earth that are limited by temperature and the existence of liquid water. The potential habitability of other planets or moons can also be assessed by the existence of liquid water.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

Carbon makes up only 0.08% of the combination of the [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[atmosphere]]. Yet it is the twelfth most common element there. In the rock of the lithosphere, carbon commonly occurs as carbonate minerals containing calcium or magnesium. It is also found as fossil fuels in coal and petroleum and gas. Native forms of carbon are mcuh rarer, requiring pressure to form. Pure carbon exists as graphite or diamond.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

The deeper parts of Earth such as the mantle are very hard to discover.  Few samples are known, in the form of uplifed rocks, or xenoliths. Even fewer remain in the same state they were in where the pressure and temperature is much higher.  Some diamonds retain inclusions held at pressures they were formed at, but the temperature is much lower at the surface. [[Iron meteorite]]s may represent samples of the core of an asteroid, but it would have formed under different conditions to the Earth's core. Therefore experimental studies are conducted in which minerals or substances are compressed and heated to determine what happens in similar conditions to the planetary interior.

The two common [[isotopes of carbon]] are stable. On Earth, [[carbon 12]], &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is by far the most common at 98.894%. [[Carbon 13]] is much rarer averaging 1.106%.  This percentage can vary slightly and its value is important in [[isotope geochemistry]] whereby the origin of the carbon is suggested.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

==Origins==
===Formation===
Carbon can be produced in stars at least as massive as the Sun by fusion of three [[helium-4]] nuclei: &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He --&gt; &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. This is the [[triple alpha process]].
In stars as massive as the Sun, carbon 12 is also converted to [[carbon 13]] and then onto [[nitrogen]] 14 by fusion with protons. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H --&gt; &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H --&gt; &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N. In more massive stars, two carbon nuclei can fuse to [[magnesium]], or a carbon and an oxygen to [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

===Astrochemistry===
In [[molecular cloud]]s, simple carbon molecules are formed, including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[dicarbon]]. Reactions with the [[trihydrogen cation]] of the simple carbon molecules yield carbon containing ions that readily react to form larger organic molecules. Carbon compounds that exist as ions, or isolated gas molecules in the [[interstellar medium]], can condense onto dust grains. Carbonaceous dust grains consist mostly of carbon. Grains can stick together to form larger aggregates.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

===Earth formation===
[[Meteorite]]s and [[interplanetary dust]] shows the composition of solid material at the start of the Solar System, as they have not been modified since its formation. [[Carbonaceous chondrite]]s are meteorites with around 5% carbon compounds. Their composition resembles the Sun's minus the very volatile elements like hydrogen and noble gases.
The Earth is believed to have formed by the gravitational collapse of material like meteorites.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

Important effects on Earth in the first [[Hadian Era]] include strong [[solar wind]]s during the [[T-Tauri stage]] of the Sun. The Moon forming impact caused major changes to the surface. Juvenile volatiles outgased from the early molten surface of the Earth. These included carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The emissions probably did not include methane, but the Earth was probably free of molecular oxygen. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] was between 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago (Ga). To start with, the Earth did not have a [[earth crust|crust]] as it does today. [[Plate tectonics]] in its present form commenced about 2.5 Ga.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

Early [[sedimentary rocks]] formed under water date to 3.8 Ga. [[Pillow lava]]s dating from 3.5 Ga prove the existence of oceans. Evidence of early life is given by fossils of stromatolites, and later by chemical tracers.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

Organic matter continues to be added to the Earth from space via interplanetary dust, which also includes some interstellar particles. The amounts added to the Earth were around 60,000 tonnes per year about 4 Ga.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

==Isotope==
[[Biological sequestration]] of carbon causes enrichment of carbon-12, so that substances that originate from living organisms have a higher carbon-12 content. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, chemical reactions can happen faster with lighter isotopes, so that photosynthesis fixes lighter carbon-12 faster than carbon-13. Also lighter isotopes diffuse across a biological membrane faster. Enrichment in carbon 13 is measured by delta &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C(o/oo) = [(&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C)sample/(&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C)standard - 1] * 1000.
The common standard for carbon is Cretaceous Peedee formation belemnite.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

==Stereoisomers==
Complex molecules, in particular those containing carbon can be in the form of [[stereoisomer]]s. With abiotic processes they would be expected to be equally likely, but in carbonaceous chondrites this is not the case.  The reasons for this are unknown.&lt;ref name="kilo9"/&gt;

==Crust==
The outer layer of the Earth, the crust along with its outer layers contain about 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg of carbon.  This is enough for each square meter of the surface to have 200 tons of carbon.&lt;ref name="wacit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Bernard J.|last2=Pawley|first2=Alison|last3=Frost|first3=Daniel R.|title=Water and Carbon in the Earth's Mantle|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1996|volume=354|issue=1711|pages=1495–1511|jstor=54617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sedimentation==
Carbon added to sedimentary rocks can take the form of carbonates, or organic carbon compounds. In order of source quantity the organic carbon comes from phytoplankton, plants, bacteria and zooplankton. However terrestrial sediments may be mostly from higher plants, and some oxygen deficient sediments from water may be mostly bacteria. Fungi and other animals make insignificant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Killops page 24&lt;/ref&gt; On the oceans the main contributor of organic matter to sediments is plankton, either dead fragments or [[faecal pellet]]s termed marine snow. Bacteria degrade this matter in the water column, and the amount surviving to the ocean floor is inversely proportional to the depth. This is accompanied by [[biomineral]]s consisting of silicates and carbonates. The particulate organic matter in sediments is about 20% of known molecules 80% of material that cannot be analysed. [[Detritivore]]s consume some of the fallen organic materials. Aerobic bacteria and fungi also consume organic matter in the oxic surface parts of the sediment. Coarse-grained sediments are oxygenated to about half a meter, but fine grained clays may only have a couple of millimetres exposed to oxygen. The organic matter in the oxygenated zone will become completely mineralized if it stays there long enough.&lt;ref name="kilo99"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Killops|first1=Stephen|last2=Killops|first2=Vanessa|title=Introduction to organic geochemistry|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden|isbn=978-0-632-06504-2|pages=91–99|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper in sediments where oxygen is exhausted, anaerobic biological processes continue at a slower rate.  These include anaerobic mineralization making [[ammonium]], [[phosphate]] and [[sulfide]] ions; [[fermentation]] making short chain alcohols, acids or methyl amines; [[acetogenesis]] making [[acetic acid]]; [[methanogenesis]] making methane, and sulfate, nitrite and nitrate reduction. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen are also outputs. Under freshwater, sulfate is usually very low, so methanogensis  is more important.  Yet other bacteria can convert methane, back into living matter, by oxidising with other substrates. Bacteria can reside at great depths in sediments.  However sedimentary organic matter accumulates the indigestible components.&lt;ref name="kilo99"/&gt;

Deep bacteria may be [[lithotrophe]]s, using hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as a carbon source.&lt;ref name="kilo99"/&gt;

In the oceans and other waters there is much [[Dissolved organic carbon|dissolved organic materials]].  These are several thousand years old on average, and are called [[gelbstoff]] (yellow substance) particularly in fresh waters. Much of this is [[tannin]]s. The nitrogen containing materials here appear to be amides, perhaps from [[peptidoglycan]]s from bacteria. Microorganisms have trouble consuming the high molecular weight dissolved substances, but quickly consume small molecules.&lt;ref name="kilo99"/&gt;

From terrestrial sources black carbon produced by charring is an important component. Fungi are important decomposers in soil.&lt;ref name="kilo99"/&gt;

===Macromolecules===
Proteins are normally hydrolysed slowly even without enzymes or bacteria, with a half life of 460 years, but can be preserved if they are desiccated, pickled or frozen. Being enclosed in bone also helps preservation. Over time the amino acids tend to racemize, and those with more functional groups are lost earlier. Protein still will degrade on the timescale of a million years. DNA degrades rapidly, lasting only about four years in water. Cellulose and chitin have a half life in water at 25° of about 4.7 million years. Enzymes can accelerate this by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;. About 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; tons of chiting are produced each year, but it is almost all degraded.&lt;ref name="kilo00"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Killops|first1=Stephen|last2=Killops|first2=Vanessa|title=Introduction to organic geochemistry|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden|isbn=978-0-632-06504-2|pages=100–105|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lignin is only efficiently degraded by fungii, white rot, or brown rot. These require oxygen.&lt;ref name="kilo00"/&gt;

Lipids are hydrolysed to fatty acids over long time periods. Plant cuticle waxes are very difficult to degrade, and may survive over geological time periods.&lt;ref name="kilo00"/&gt;

===Preservation===
More organic matter is preserved in sediments if there is high primary production, or the sediment is fine-grained. The lack of oxygen helps preservation greatly, and that also is caused by a large supply of organic matter. Soil does not usually preserve organic matter, it would need to be acidified or water logged, as in the bog. Rapid burial ensures the material gets to an oxygen free depth, but also dilutes the organic matter. A low energy environment ensures the sediment is not stirred up and oxygenated. [[Salt marsh]]es and [[mangrove]]s meet some of these requirements, but unless the sea level is rising will not have a chance to accumulate much. Coral reefs are very productive, but are well oxygenated, and recycle everything before it is buried.&lt;ref name="kilo00"/&gt;

===Sphagnum bog===
In dead ''[[Sphagnum]]'', [[sphagnan]] a polysaccharide with [[D-lyxo-5-hexosulouronic acid]] is a major remaining substance. It make the bog very acidic, so that bacteria cannot grow.  Not only that, the plant ensures there is no available nitrogen. [[Holocellulose]] also absorbs any digestive enzymes around. Together this leads to major accumulation of [[peat]] under sphagnum bogs.

==Mantle==
Earth's mantle is a significant reservoir of carbon. The mantle contains more carbon than the crust, oceans, biosphere, and atmosphere put together. The figure is estimated to be very roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="wacit"/&gt;  Carbon concentration in the mantle is very variable, varying by more than a factor of 100 between different parts.&lt;ref name=mac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carnegie Institution for Science|title=Deep mantle chemistry surprise: Carbon content not uniform|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-deep-mantle-chemistry-carbon-content.html|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form carbon takes depends on its oxidation state, which depends on the [[oxygen fugacity]] of the environment. Carbon dioxide and carbonate are found where the oxygen fugacity is high. Lower oxygen fugacity results in diamond formation, first in [[eclogite]], then [[peridotite]], and lastly in fluid water mixtures. At even lower oxygen fugacity, methane is stable in contact with water, and even lower, metallic iron and nickel form along with carbides. Iron carbides include Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C and Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="dag"/&gt;

Minerals that contain carbon include calcite and its higher density polymorphs. Other significant carbon minerals include magnesium and iron carbonates. [[Dolomite]] is stable above 100&amp;nbsp;km depth. Below 100&amp;nbsp;km, dolomite reacts with orthopyroxine (found in peridotite) to yield [[magnesite]] (an iron magnesium carbonate).&lt;ref name="wacit"/&gt; Below 200&amp;nbsp;km deep, carbon dioxide is reduced by ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), forming diamond, and ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). Even deeper pressure induced disproportionation of iron minerals produces more ferric iron, and metallic iron. The metallic iron combines with carbon to form the mineral [[cohenite]] with formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C. Cohenite also contains some nickel substituting for iron. This form or carbon is called "carbide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Isotope Fractionation in Earth's Mantle {{!}} Deep Carbon Observatory Portal|url=https://deepcarbon.net/feature/carbon-isotope-fractionation-earth’s-mantle|website=deepcarbon.net|language=en|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond forms in the mantle below 150&amp;nbsp;km deep, but because it is so durable, it can survive in eruptions to the surface in [[kimberlite]]s, [[lamproite]]s, or [[ultramafic]] [[lamprophyre]]s.&lt;ref name="dag"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shirey|first1=S. B.|last2=Cartigny|first2=P.|last3=Frost|first3=D. J.|last4=Keshav|first4=S.|last5=Nestola|first5=F.|last6=Nimis|first6=P.|last7=Pearson|first7=D. G.|last8=Sobolev|first8=N. V.|last9=Walter|first9=M.

[[Xenolith]]s can come from the mantle, and different compositions come from different depths. Above 90&amp;nbsp;km (3.2&amp;nbsp;GPa) spinel peridotite occurs, below this garnet peridotite is found.&lt;ref name="wacit"/&gt;

Inclusions trapped in diamond can reveal the material and conditions much deeper in the mantle. Large gem diamonds are usually formed in the transition zone part of the mantle, (410 to 660&amp;nbsp;km deep) and crystallise from a molten iron-nickel-carbon solution, that also contains sulfur and trace amounts of hydrogen, chromium, phosphorus and oxygen. Carbon atoms constitute about 12% of the melt (about 3% by mass). Inclusions of the crystallised metallic melt are sometimes included in diamonds. Diamond can be caused to precipitate from the liquid metal, by increasing pressure, or by adding sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Evan M.|last2=Shirey|first2=Steven B.|last3=Nestola|first3=Fabrizio|last4=Bullock|first4=Emma S.|last5=Wang|first5=Jianhua|last6=Richardson|first6=Stephen H.|last7=Wang|first7=Wuyi|title=Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth's deep mantle|journal=Science|date=16 December 2016|volume=354|issue=6318|pages=1403–1405|doi=10.1126/science.aal1303|pmid=27980206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluid inclusions in crystals from the mantle have contents that most often are [[liquid carbon dioxide]], but which also include [[carbon oxysulfide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]]&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deines|first1=Peter|title=Early Organic Evolution|date=1992|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642768866|pages=133–146|language=en|chapter=Mantle Carbon: Concentration, Mode of Occurrence, and Isotopic Composition|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-76884-2_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material is added by subduction from the crust. This includes the major carbon containing sediments such as limestone, or coal. Each year 2×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is transferred from the crust to the mantle by subduction. (1700 tons of carbon per second).&lt;ref name="wacit"/&gt;

Upwelling mantle material can add to the crust at mid oceanic ridges. Fluids can extract carbon from the mantle and erupt in volcanoes. At 330&amp;nbsp;km deep a liquid consisting of carbon dioxide and water can form.  It is highly corrosive, and dissolves [[incompatible element]]s from the solid mantle.  These elements include uranium, thorium, potassium, helium and argon. The fluids can then go on to cause [[metasomatism]] or extend to the surface in [[carbonatite]] eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Rajdeep|last2=Hirschmann|first2=Marc M.|title=Melting in the Earth's deep upper mantle caused by carbon dioxide|journal=Nature|date=30 March 2006|volume=440|issue=7084|pages=659–662|doi=10.1038/nature04612|pmid=16572168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total mid oceanic ridge, and hot spot volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide match the loss due to subduction: 2×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.&lt;ref name="wacit"/&gt;

In slowly convecting mantle rocks, diamond that slowly rises above 150&amp;nbsp;km will slowly turn into graphite or be oxidised to carbon dioxide or carbonate minerals.&lt;ref name=dag/&gt;

==Core==
Earth's core is believed to be mostly and alloy of iron and nickel. The density indicates that it also contains a significant amount of lighter elements. Elements such as hydrogen would be stable in the Earth's core, however the conditions at the formation of the core would not be suitable for its inclusion. Carbon is a very likely constituent of the core.&lt;ref name=cic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=B. J.|last2=Li|first2=J.|last3=Shahar|first3=A.|title=Carbon in the Core: Its Influence on the Properties of Core and Mantle|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|date=13 February 2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=231–250|doi=10.2138/rmg.2013.75.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferential partitioning of the carbon isotope&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C into the metallic core, during its formation, may explain why there seems to be more &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C on the surface and mantle of the Earth compared to other solar system bodies (−5‰ compared to -20‰). The difference can also help to predict the value of the carbon proportion of the core.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt;

The outer core has a density around 11&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a mass of 1.3×10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;kg. It contains roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg of carbon.
Carbon dissolved in liquid iron affect the solution of other elements. Dissolved carbon changes lead from a siderophile to a lithophile. It has the opposite effect on tungsten and molybdenum, causing more tungsten or molybdenum to dissolve in the metallic phase.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt; The measured amounts of these elements in the rocks compared to the Solar System can be explained by a 0.6% carbon composition of the core.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt;

The inner core is about 1221&amp;nbsp;km in radius. It has a density of 13 g&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a total mass of 9×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg and a surface area of 18,000,000 square kilometers. Experiments with mixtures under pressure and temperature attempt to reproduce the known properties of the inner and outer core. Carbides are among the first to precipitate from a molten metal mix, and so the inner core may be mostly iron carbides, Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt; At atmospheric pressure (100 kpa)the iron-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C eutectic point is at 4.1% carbon.  This percentage decreases as pressure increases to around 50&amp;nbsp;GPa. Above that pressure the percentage of carbon at the eutectic increases.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt; The pressure on the inner core ranges from 330&amp;nbsp;GPa to 360&amp;nbsp;GPa at the centre of the Earth. The temperature at the inner core surface is about 6000&amp;nbsp;K. The material of the inner core must be stable at the pressure and temperature found there, and more dense than that of the outer core liquid. Extrapolations show that either Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C or Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; match the requirements.&lt;ref name=cic/&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is 8.4% carbon, and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C is 6.7% carbon. The inner core is growing by about 1&amp;nbsp;mm per year, or adding about 18 cubic kilometres per year. This is about 18×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;kg of carbon added to the inner core every year. It contains about 8×10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon.

==High pressure experimentation==
In order to determine the fate of natural carbon containing substances deep in the Earth, experiments have been conducted to see what happens when high pressure, and or temperatures are applied. Such substances include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, graphite, methane, and other hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon dioxide water mixtures and carbonate minerals such as [[calcite]], [[magnesium carbonate]], or [[ferrous carbonate]]. Under super high pressures carbon may take on a higher coordination number than the 4 found in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compounds like diamond, or the 3 found in carbonates. Perhaps carbon can substitute into silicates, or form a [[silicon oxycarbide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=S.|last2=Widgeon|first2=S. J.|last3=Navrotsky|first3=A.|last4=Mera|first4=G.|last5=Tavakoli|first5=A.|last6=Ionescu|first6=E.|last7=Riedel|first7=R.|title=Carbon substitution for oxygen in silicates in planetary interiors|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=16 September 2013|volume=110|issue=40|pages=15904–15907|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312771110|pmid=24043830|pmc=3791772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbides may be possible.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

===Carbon===
At 15 Gpa graphite changes to a [[M-carbon|hard transparent form]], that is not diamond. Diamond is very resistant to pressure, but at about 1&amp;nbsp;TPa (1000 Gpa) transforms to a [[Superdense carbon allotropes|BC-8 form]].&lt;ref name=sbm&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oganov|first1=A. R.|last2=Hemley|first2=R. J.|last3=Hazen|first3=R. M.|last4=Jones|first4=A. P.|title=Structure, Bonding, and Mineralogy of Carbon at Extreme Conditions|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|date=13 February 2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=47–77|doi=10.2138/rmg.2013.75.3|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1388053/1/Jones_Structure%2C%20Bonding%2C%20and%20Mineralogy%20of%20Carbon%20at%20Extreme%20Conditions_RIM075_C03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbides===
Carbides are predicted to be more likely lower in the mantle as experiments have shown a much lower oxygen fugacity for high pressure iron silicates. Cohenite remains stable to over 187 Gpa, but is predicted to have a denser orthorhombic ''Cmcm'' form in the inner core.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

===Carbon dioxide===
Under 0.3&amp;nbsp;GPa pressure, carbon dioxide is stable at room temperature in the same form as dry ice. Over 0.5&amp;nbsp;GPa carbon dioxide forms a number of different solid forms containing molecules. At pressures over 40&amp;nbsp;Gpa and high temperatures, carbon dioxide forms a covalent solid that contains CO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, and has the same structure as β-[[cristobalite]]. This is called phase V or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-V. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-V is subjected to high temperatures, or higher pressures, experiments show it breaks down to form diamond and oxygen. In the mantle the geotherm would mean that carbon dioxide would be a liquid till a pressure of 33&amp;nbsp;GPa, then it would adopt the solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-V form till 43 Gpa, and deeper than that would make diamond and fluid oxygen.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

===Carbonyls===
High pressure carbon monoxide forms the high energy [[polycarbonyl]] covalent solid, however it is not expected to be present.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

===Hydrocarbons===
Under 1.59 GPa pressure at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, methane converts to a cubic solid. The molecules are rotationally disordered. But over 5.25 GPa the molecules become locked into position and cannot spin. Other hydrocarbons under high pressure have hardly been studied.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

===Carbonates===
Calcite changes to calcite-II and calcite-III at pressures of 1.5, and 2.2&amp;nbsp;GPa. Siderite undergoes a chemical change at 10&amp;nbsp;GPa at 1800K to form Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Dolomite decomposes 7GPa and below 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to yield [[aragonite]] and [[magnesite]]. However there are forms of iron containing dolomite stable at higher pressures and temperatures. Over 130&amp;nbsp;GPa aragonite undergoes a transformation to a SP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedrally connected carbon, in a covalent network in a ''C''222&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structure. [[Magnesite]] can survive 80&amp;nbsp;GPa, but with more than 100&amp;nbsp;GPa (as at a depth of 1800&amp;nbsp;km it changes to forms with three-member rings of CO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;). If iron is present in this mineral, at these pressures it will convert to magnetite and diamond. Melted carbonates with SP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon are predicted to be very viscous.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

Some minerals that contain both silicate and carbonate exist, [[spurrite]] and [[tilleyite]]. But high pressure forms have not been studied.  There have been attempts to make [[silicon carbonate]].&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt; Six coordinated silicates mixed with carbonate should not exist on Earth, may exist on more massive planets.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

The German '''Climate Action Plan 2050''' ({{lang-de|Klimaschutzplan 2050}}) is a [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policy document approved by the German government on 14{{nbsp}}November 2016.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan outlines measures by which Germany can meet its various national [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction goals through to 2050 (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and service its international commitments under the 2016 [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]].  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB), under minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]], led the development of the plan.  The plan was progressively watered down since a draft was first leaked in {{nowrap|early-May}} 2016.  Projections from the environment ministry in September 2016 indicate that Germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

The Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 should not be confused with an earlier document, the Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}''), approved in December 2014 and which only covers the period until 2020.  In early 2017 it was agreed that the 2020 Programme would be scrapped.

== Climate Action Programme 2020 ==

The Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}'') is an attempt by Germany to help meet its official 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reductions target after a 'climate gap' had been identified.{{efn|Official translations use the British spelling of programme.}}  Projections from 2013 show Germany may miss its 40% reductions target by about {{nowrap|7%-points}} without additional measures.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first draft of the programme was released in {{nowrap|mid-November}} 2014.  How best to control the contribution from coal-fired generation remained controversial, but economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) dismissed plans aired in his ministry in October 2014 to retire 10{{nbsp}}GW of coal capacity.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014b"&gt;

The most significant part of the new package is a pledge to cut electricity sector emissions substantially by 2020.  To do so, the government proposes to cap emissions from the sector at 22{{nbsp}}million tonnes between 2016 and 2020 or 4.4{{nbsp}}million tonnes each year.  Once the cap is in place, energy companies will be allocated allowances based on their current emissions.  If they cut their emissions by a greater amount, they may be able to sell their surplus to other companies.  The package also contains measures to improve energy efficiency and the transport sector.&lt;ref name="hope-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However a government report, released on 30{{nbsp}}September 2016, shows that Germany will meet its 2020 greenhouse gas commitments only under "a best case scenario".&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"/&gt;  The report, prepared for the European Union, is available in German.&lt;ref name="projection-report-2015"&gt;

== Development of the Climate Action Plan 2050 ==

The history of the Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 is quite involved.  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) is the lead agency for the plan, under the direction of environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).  A novel [[public consultation]] process was utilized to collect ideas from state and city governments, [[advocacy groups]], and [[citizenship|citizens]] and these ideas were then used to help create the first version.  Internal drafts of the plan were leaked three times to the media in 2016, the first in {{nowrap|early-May}}, the second in {{nowrap|late-June}}, and the third in {{nowrap|early-November}}.

=== Coalition agreement: 2013 ===

The notion of a climate action plan arose from the coalition agreement between the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] parties in 2013.  The agreement stated:

{{quote|[I]n Germany we want to define an emissions reduction pathway with a final target of 80{{nbsp}}to 95{{nbsp}}percent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 by 2050.  We will augment this target with concrete measures, drawn up through a broad dialogue (Climate Action Plan).&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

=== Public consultation: 25 June 2015 – 19 March 2016 ===

A public consultation with stakeholders began on {{nowrap|25–26 June}} 2015 with a Kick-off Conference in Berlin.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the result of consolidating a long catalog of measures from the consultation process.  The leaked plan included proposals for:&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"/&gt;

* [[ecotax|ecological tax reform]] and the internalization of [[externality|environmental costs]]
* climate friendly investment
* reducing emissions from coal and a [[Fossil-fuel phase-out#Germany|phase-out of coal]] (''{{lang|de|Kohleausstieg}}'') well before 2050
* making both old and new buildings [[carbon neutrality|climate-neutral]]
* the digitalisation and electrification of the transport sector
* a floor price for carbon and climate-aware investment
* a reduction in the numbers of ruminant animals and for the public to eat less meat
* the use forests as [[carbon sink]]s and the renaturalisation of [[moorland]]s for the same purpose
* the investigation of a new national welfare index
* the embedding of climate protection in local and regional public services

The plan also suggested a "pluralistic" (meaning diverse groups are represented) commission be established, tasked with developing a coal phase-out plan by {{nowrap|mid-2017}}.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the first leak, this draft was compiled after consultation with the economics and energy ministry (BMWi).&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The new draft shows that individual sectors may escape specific emissions targets and that an end date for coal-fired generation has been omitted.  Earlier versions had contained sector-specific targets for energy, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture.  The energy sector which was previously slated to make a "considerable" contribution is now required to make an "adequate" contribution.  Rather than saying that coal-fired generation must "end well before 2050" the new draft emphasizes that "the importance of power production from coal will decrease" and that there will be a "step-by-step reduction".  The previous draft stated that the transport sector would need to deliver "disproportionately high" emissions reductions (on account of the poor performance of the sector to date), that has now diminished to an "ambitious" contribution.  Other proposals remain, including the development of ecological tax reform.  The plan also includes targets for modernizing the heating and cooling systems in buildings, including no new fossil-fueled heating systems in houses after 2030.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"&gt;

The proposal for a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende'' (''{{lang|de|Kommission "Klimaschutz, Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Vollendung der Energiewende"}}'') remains, but now without the specific task of developing a roadmap for the phase-out of coal.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"/&gt;

The weakening of the plan is also a result of industry associations repeatedly criticizing sector targets and itemized measures, which they fear would harm Germany's economic performance and international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"/&gt;

An official draft was released on 6{{nbsp}}September 2016 and is available in German.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016c"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  This draft retains a provision for the establishment of a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende''.

The content however has been watered down considerably.  Concrete emissions reductions targets were removed altogether.  The previously leaked June 2016 draft stated that by 2030 "a large majority of newly registered cars" would need to be powered by either electricity or [[biofuel]]s.  But the new draft merely states that "the government aims to significantly lower car emissions by 2030" and that electric cars can contribute to that goal.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

[[Environmental movement|Environmental groups]] have become increasingly critical of the plan as each iteration led to a watering down of its climate protection provisions.  The [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] were particularly concerned about the lack of detail concerning a [[Fossil-fuel phase-out#Germany|coal phase-out]].  On 24 September 2016, Greenpeace Germany issued a report critical of the watering down of the results of the consultation process.&lt;ref name="greenpeace-press-release-2016"&gt;

=== Cabinet deliberations: late-2016 ===

In {{nowrap|late-2016}}, the plan went to the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskanzleramt}}'') to coordinate the final version to be agreed by the [[Cabinet of Germany|German cabinet]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskabinett}}'').

Media reports in {{nowrap|late-October}} 2016 suggest a deepening rift between the economics and energy ministry (BMWi) and the environment ministry (BMUB) over the plan and the exit process for coal-fired generation (''{{lang|de|Kohleausstieg}}'').  Economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] opposes the setting of a coal exit date before job alternatives for [[lignite]] workers have been determined.&lt;ref name="amelang-2006"&gt;

A revised draft plan, circulated by the environment ministry on 4{{nbsp}}November 2016, was obtained by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''.  The plan has become more stringent and now includes passages that had earlier been removed during the negotiations between ministries.  The new plan also precludes new coal-fired generation and the expansion of existing [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] and calls on the government to lobby for an EU-wide [[Price floor|floor price]] for auctioned [[European Union Emission Trading System|EU ETS]] emissions allowances.&lt;ref name="clew-2016b"&gt;

On 7{{nbsp}}November 2016, over 40 German companies, including energy suppliers [[EnBW]] and [[MVV Energie]] and network operator [[50Hertz Transmission GmbH|50Hertz]], together with [[Commerzbank]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[IKEA]], and [[Hochtief]], are lobbying for a more ambitious program, one which ensures that Germany's [[Paris Agreement]] commitments are met.  The companies want sector-specific emissions targets for 2030 and state that "only in this way can new business models and concrete plans for decarbonisation be developed".  They want the  goal to be the "rapid switch to 100% renewable energy".  British economist [[Nicholas Stern]] also backs a more ambitious plan.&lt;ref name="clew-2016c"&gt;

On 8{{nbsp}}November 2016, economy and energy minister Gabriel vetoed the plan amid concerns by trade union [[IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie|IG BCE]] and supported by the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|BDI]] industry group.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan is to be supplemented by a program of policy measures, developed by the German parliament (''{{lang|de|Bundestag}}''), with the first such program to be in place in 2018.  Annual reporting will track progress and should facilitate specific policy adjustments where needed.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

=== Preamble ===

The plan begins with a preamble that states that the document is an evolving work in progress and "cannot and does not want to be a detailed masterplan".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  It adds that there will be "no rigid provisions" and that the plan is technology neutral and open to innovation.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The preamble stresses that the government will simultaneously maintain German competitiveness:

{{quote|We want to advance the upcoming changes without structural ruptures. It's about using the strength and creativity of the German market economy, as well as the forces of competition to reach existing national, European and international climate protection targets.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The preamble also reiterates Germany's 2010 climate targets (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and its 2016 [[Paris Agreement]] commitment.{{efn|Germany's 2015 intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) became its nationally determined contribution (NDC) when it ratified the Paris Agreement on 5{{nbsp}}October 2016.}}&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Sector targets ===

Sector targets remained controversial during the development of the plan.  Notwithstanding, the official document now specifies sector targets for the first time under a national climate protection policy.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The initial sector targets will be subject to a comprehensive impact assessment and consultation and may well be adjusted as a result in 2018.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Commission for growth, structural change, and regional development ===

The plan establishes a commission for growth, structural change, and regional development.  But unlike earlier versions, the commission will not be tasked with setting a date for an exit from coal.  Instead, the commission will "support the structural changes" resulting from transformation and will "develop a mix of instruments that will bring together economic development, structural change, social acceptability and climate protection".  The commission will be based at the economics and energy ministry, but will consult with other ministries, federal states, municipalities, and unions, as well as with representatives of "affected" companies and regions.  The commission is scheduled to start work at the beginning of 2018 and to report at the end of 2018.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

=== EU Emissions Trading System ===

{{main article|European Union Emission Trading System}}

The plan stresses to role of the [[European Union Emission Trading System]] (EU{{nbsp}}ETS) as the primary climate protection instrument covering the energy sector and parts of industry in central Europe.  The government wants to strengthen price signaling and will campaign to make the EU{{nbsp}}ETS "effective" at a European level.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  Earlier provisions to set a floor price for emissions allowances were removed.

=== Energy sector ===

{{main article|Energy in Germany|Energiewende in Germany}}

The energy sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|175–183 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 61–62% relative to 1990.  The energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

If "possible and economically sensible", renewable energy will be used directly in all sectors, and electricity from renewable sources will be used efficiently for heating, transport, and industry.  The utilization of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste.  The plan states that transitioning to a power supply based on renewables while ensuring supply security is "technically feasible".  During the transition, "less carbon-intensive natural gas power plants and the existing most modern coal power plants play an important role as interim technologies".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

The plan states that "the climate targets can only be reached if coal-fired power generation is reduced step-by-step".  Moreover, the German government "in its development cooperation does not lend support to new coal power plants".  Regions which depend on coal, like the ''[[Lusatia|Lausitz]]'', need special consideration: "we must succeed in establishing concrete perspectives for the future of the affected regions, before concrete decisions on the step-by-step withdrawal from the lignite industry can be taken".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

Notwithstanding, a coal phase-out for Germany is implied in the plan, environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] said in an interview on 21{{nbsp}}November 2016.  "If you read the Climate Action Plan carefully, you will find that the exit from coal-fired power generation is the immanent consequence of the energy sector target.{{nbsp}}... By 2030{{nbsp}}... half of the coal-fired power production must have ended, compared to 2014", Hendricks said.&lt;ref name="clew-2016e"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan also establishes a regional fund to foster new businesses in lignite mining regions. The government will need to ensure that EU competition law does not inhibit the operation of the fund.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Building sector ===

The building sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|70–72 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 66–67% relative to 1990.  Under the plan, Germany's building stock will be largely carbon-neutral by 2050 and their limited energy needs will be met through renewables.  Due to the slow turnover of buildings, the groundwork for this goal must be laid by 2030.  The government will invest heavily in programs to implement high energy standards for buildings.  Heating, cooling, and electricity supply will be progressively switched to renewables.  The government will terminate support programs that rely on fossil fuels by 2020 and switch instead to support programs using renewable systems.  The aim is to "make renewables-based systems much more attractive than fossil-fuel-based ones".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Transport sector ===

The transport sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|95–98 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 40–42% relative to 1990.  Unlike earlier drafts, the plan does not now set a deadline for all new cars to be emissions free.  Rather the plan states that stricter emissions limits for new cars will be set by the European Union and that "the government will advocate [an] ambitious development of the targets" so that its 2030 goal can be met.  These cuts will derive from improved efficiencies and increasingly GHG-neutral energy.  Such cuts will require "a significant contribution by the electrification of new cars and should have priority".  The plan emphasizes the contribution that [[biofuel]]s can make, stating that "in the target scenario, the energy supply of street and rail traffic, as well as parts of air and maritime traffic and inland shipping is switched to biofuels – if ecologically compatible – and otherwise largely to renewable electricity as well as other GHG-neutral fuels".  The need to support public transport, rail transport, and cycling is stressed in the plan.  The plan states a next step is to determine the framework needed to ensure that new [[powertrain]] technologies and [[Energy carrier|energy forms]] will be adopted at scale.  This then "involves the question of when, at the latest, they should be introduced into the market, and what penetration rate they should achieve by what date".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Industry ===

The industry [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|140–143 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 49–51% relative to 1990.  Good progress has been made and, {{as of|lc=yes|2016}}, the sector must reduce its emissions by about another 20%.  Notwithstanding, the plan emphasizes the need to maintain international competitiveness:

{{quote|With our modernizing strategy for the economy, the correct political framework, and active regional and structural policy that supports structural change, we want to create dependable framework conditions for the German economy, to adjust to this transformational process early, and use the possibilities connected to it.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The plan continues that, despite the costs and challenges, climate protection could become an "innovation motor" for a modern high-tech economy.  The plan acknowledges that some industrial emissions cannot be avoided – for instance, those from steel production or chemical plants.  Such emissions should be reduced as far as possible by developing new processes and replacing old ones – or through the use of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) or [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The government will launch a [[research and development]] program to advance these and other low-carbon processes.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Agricultural sector ===

The agricultural sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|58–61 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 31–34% relative to 1990.  The plan acknowledges that agriculture cannot reach zero emissions, due to the biological processes inherent in plant cultivation and livestock farming.  Instead the plan will focus on reducing emissions as much as possible and on the more efficient use of resources.  About one third of agricultural emissions are due to [[nitrous oxide]] from fertilizer use.  The government wants to reduce these emissions through better management and through [[research and development]].  Another one third of emissions derive from ruminant animals.  The government will develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from livestock farming by 2021.  The plan states that 20% of agricultural land by 2030 "should be used for [[organic farming]]", compared with 6.3% in 2014.  The government also advocates the use of financial instruments under a reformed EU [[Common Agricultural Policy]] to reduce GHG emissions from the sector."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Land use and forestry sector ===

The land use and forestry sector offers opportunities for [[carbon sequestration]].  The government will prioritize improving the performance of forests as carbon sinks.  Sustainable forest management will also be promoted and permanent grasslands and marshes are to be preserved.  The expansion of settlements and transport infrastructure is to be reduced to {{val|30|ul=ha}} per day by 2020 and to zero by 2050.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Financial matters ===

Under the plan, the government will consider how to incrementally revise taxation through to 2050, on the understanding that "environmental taxes and levies can create incentives for ecological economic activity" and that "environmentally related taxes and levies can cost-efficiently trigger climate-friendly economic behavior".  The government also intends to reduce environmentally harmful subsidies.  In addition, the government will support efforts to reconcile global finance flows with climate protection goals, for instance through its role on the [[G20]] [[Financial Stability Board]].&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Implementation and revision of the plan ===

The plan is predicated on a gradual transformation, achieved through a learning process involving the scientific community and accompanied by public dialogue.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}  It is therefore intended that the plan can and should respond to changing technological, political, and social conditions.  The plan will be reviewed every five years to align it with the evolution of Germany's [[Paris Agreement#Nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contribution]] (NDC) under the [[Paris Agreement]].  The first update is therefore slated for {{nowrap|late-2019}} or {{nowrap|early-2020}}.  As early as 2018, the government intends to strengthen the plan by quantifying the various emission reduction efforts and their associated ecological, social, and economic impacts.  The sector targets may be modified as a result.  Annual reporting should help the government to evaluate and adjust its specific climate protection measures in the short-term.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

== Reactions ==

Thilo Schaefer, climate and energy expert at the [[Cologne Institute for Economic Research]] (IW) comments that "it looks like the government forgot that the energy sector and industry already participate in the European emissions trading system{{nbsp}}... in the end, it will simply become more expensive for the affected sectors, but they won't save a single extra ton of {{CO2}}{{nbsp}}... because the emissions saved by German sectors can be emitted by other states".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"&gt;

[[Simone Peter]], co-chair of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], said "this is not a good plan anymore, it has become an empty shell, because the ministerial colleagues of [environment minister] Hendricks have removed anything that could be of relevance – be it the coal exit, the end of the combustion engine, or a transition in agriculture".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Klaus Töpfer]], founding director of the [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] (IASS), said "this plan is certainly not yet capable of securing the German contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement.  This will require more work".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

Regine Günther, director of policy and climate at [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Germany]], said "today's climate action plan is only a fraction of what is needed. The only plus point: all sectors get precise reduction targets, which WWF welcomes. However, the list of negatives is much longer: there are no appropriate measures to reach those targets.  There is also a blank on the issue of coal.  The plan completely dropped the urgently needed ban on further extension of open cast mining.  The commission on coal will not start until 2018, after the federal elections.  A minimum price on carbon is also missing completely.  With this plan, the industry and energy lobbies have proven how well placed they are in the economy ministry.  With such a plan there can be no ambitious climate protection."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Ottmar Edenhofer]], a German climate economist and director of the [[Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change|MCC]], criticized the plan.  He said economy and energy minister "[[Sigmar Gabriel]] yielded to lobbyists and sadly put short-term interests before long-term interests".&lt;ref name="clew-2016f"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1555">'''Hugh Auchincloss Brown''' (23 December 1879 – 19 November 1975) was an electrical engineer best known for advancing a [[pole shift theory|theory of catastrophic pole shift]].  Brown claimed that massive accumulation of ice at the [[geographical pole|poles]] caused recurring tipping of the [[axis of rotation|axis]] in cycles of approximately 4000–7500 years.  Brown argued that because the earth wobbles on the axis and the crust slides on the mantle, a shift was demonstrably imminent, and suggested the use of [[nuclear explosion]]s to break up the ice to forestall catastrophe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9774">An '''intumescent''' is a substance that swells as a result of [[heat]] exposure, thus increasing in [[volume]] and decreasing in [[density]]. Intumescents are typically used in [[passive fire protection]] and require [[listing and approval use and compliance|listing, approval and compliance]] in their installed configurations in order to comply with the national building codes and [[law]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The details for individual building parts are specified in technical standards which are compiled and published by national or international standardization bodies like the British Standards Institute (BSI), the German Institute for Standardization (DIN), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or the International Standardization Organization (ISO).

Intumescent coatings for steel constructions must be approved in standardized fire tests. Some important fire test standards are listed below:

* [[European Union]]: EN 13381-8 (Replaces national Standards in Europe)
* United Kingdom: BS 476-20/21 (Commonly referred to in EU, Middle and Far East)
* United States: ASTM E119 (Equivalent to UL 263, referred to in Middle and Far East), UL 1709 (Test using the hydrocarbon fire curve)
* Russia: VNIIPO (Also used in former Soviet Union countries)
* [[Chile]]: NCh 1974
* China: GB 14907/CNS 11728
* [[South Korea]]: KS F2257 1,6,7
* [[Taiwan]]: CNS 11728

==Types==

===Soft char===
These intumescents produce a light [[char]], which is a poor conductor of [[heat]], thus retarding heat transfer. Typically the light char consist of microporous carbonaceous foam formed by a chemical reaction of three main components: [[ammonium polyphosphate]], [[pentaerythritol]] and [[melamine]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} The reaction takes place in a matrix formed by the molten binder which is typically based on [[vinyl acetate]] copolymers or [[styrene]] [[Acrylate|acrylates]].

Ablative coatings contain a significant amount of [[hydrate]]s. When the hydrates are heated, they decompose, and water vapour is released, which has a cooling effect. Once the water is spent, the insulation characteristics of the char that remains can slow down heat transfer from the exposed side to the unexposed side of an assembly.

Soft char producers are typically used in thin film intumescents for [[fireproofing]] [[structural steel]] as well as in [[firestop pillow]]s. Typically, the expansion pressure that is created for these products is very low, because the soft carbonaceous char has little substance, which is beneficial if the aim is to produce a layer of insulation.

===Hard char===
Harder chars are produced with [[sodium silicate]]s and [[graphite]]. These products are suitable for use in [[plastic]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] [[firestop]]s as well as exterior steel fireproofing. In those applications, it is necessary to produce a more substantial char capable of exerting quantifiable expansion [[pressure]]. In the case of firestops, a melting, burning plastic pipe must be squeezed together and shut so that there will be no opening for fire to propagate to an otherwise [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated]] wall or floor assembly. In the case of exterior fireproofing, a hydrocarbon fire must be held off with quite potentially more kinetic energy than a house fire. Intumescents that produce hard chars are unsuitable for interior spray fireproofing.

==Applications==
Intumescents are used to achieve passive fire protection for such applications as [[firestop]]ping, [[fireproofing]], gasketing and window casings. Such applications are relevant for [[building]]s, [[offshore construction]]s, [[ship]]s and [[aircraft]].

==Problems==
Some intumescents are susceptible to environmental influences, such as humidity, which can reduce or negate their ability to function. In Germany, the ''Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik'', DIBt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibt.de/ DIBt (Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik)], a state-level authority concerned with technical matters related to construction (building regulations, design, testing, certification, safety, building equipment, approvals, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; quantifies the ability of intumescents to stand the test of [[time]] against various environmental exposures. DIBt-approved firestops and [[fireproofing]] materials are available in Canada and the [[United States|U.S.]]

The small, orange chunk on the bottom right is capable of growing into the large black object above and to its left. This type of intumescent is typically highly [[endothermic]] and contains a considerable amount of chemically bound water in [[hydrate]]s. As this is released, it cools adjacent materials. Such intumescents are useful as ingredients in [[firestop pillow]]s and in [[paint]]s used for fireproofing purposes. They do not produce enough expansion [[force]] to be used in plastic pipe devices, where the intumescent must squeeze shut a melting plastic pipe or conduit.
File:Unitherm.jpg|[[pipe (material)|Pipe]] covered with a thin-film intumescent spray fireproofing commercial product called UniTherm. When the flame from a blow-torch is applied, the intumescent [[sodium silicate]] expands, forming a layer of insulation which slows down [[heat]] transfer to the pipe underneath. [[Hydrate]]s within the coating give up their [[water]] content, maintaining a temperature near the boiling point of water, 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The critical [[Structural steel|steel]] temperature is ca. 540&amp;nbsp;°C. Once the water is spent and enough heat has gone through the char, the [[steel]] can reach and exceed its critical temperature and then lose its strength. The time this takes determines the fire-resistance rating.

'''Leaf fibers''' or '''hard fibers''' are a type of plant fiber mainly used for cordage (producing rope). They are the toughest of the [[Fiber crop|plant fibers]] which is most likely due to their increased lignin content when compared to the other groups of [[Fiber crop|plant fibers]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants and Society|last=Levetin|first=Estelle|last2=McMahon|first2=Karen|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2012|isbn=978-0-07-352422-1|location=New York, NY|pages=297–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically characterized as being very tough and rigid lending them towards being used in rope production over clothing or paper like other [[Fiber crop|plant fibers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiber Atlas|last=Ilvessalo-Pfäffli|first=Marja-Sisko|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-3-662-07212-7|pages=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaf fibers can be found in the vascular bundles of plant leaves and therefore consist of both phloem and xylem tissues and any other vascular sheathing tissues (for example [[Ground tissue|sclerenchyma cells]]). More specifically, leaf fibers are typically found in [[Monocotyledon|monocotyledonous]] leaves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fibers are harvested from plants in long, thin bundles mainly through the process of [[decortication]] which is where the non-fibrous tissues are scraped away from the plant fibers by hand or in a machine. For the majority of cases, the leaves must be hand-picked from the plant at maturity before undergoing decortication which causes the harvesting of hard fibers to be a very energy and time intensive task.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/leaf-fiber|title=Leaf Fibre|last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1998-07-20|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sisal]] and [[Abacá|abaca]] are the primary leaf fibers that are harvested and sold. These are both mainly used to make rope or matting but, as technology continues to advance these, and other, hard fibers are being able to be broken down and pulped to be used in paper products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Not much research is being looked into the possibilities and abilities of leaf fibers as they are very hard to harvest and process so synthetic fibers are more commonly used in their place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Common fibers ==
*[[Abacá|Abaca]] (Manila Hemp) - cordage
*[[Piña]] - cloth
*[[Sisal]] - cordage, matting
*Cantala - woven fabrics
*[[Phormium]] - flax, cordage

The '''world's longest above-water mountain range''' is the [[Andes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes.htm ''Andes Mountains''  by Alan W./Knapp Gregory. 1999] Retrieve 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Windows to Universe [http://www.windows2universe.org/geography/andes.html ''The Andes Mountains'' by: Julia Genyuk.] Retrieve 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|7,000|km|abbr=on}}  long. The range stretches from north to south through seven countries in [[South America]], along the west coast of the continent: [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]]. [[Aconcagua]] is the highest peak, at about {{convert|6,962|m|abbr=on}}. 

This list does not include submarine mountain ranges. If submarine mountains are included, the longest is the global [[mid-ocean ridge]] system which extends for about {{convert|65,000|km|abbr=on}}.

==Formation==
Mountain chains are typically formed by the process of [[plate tectonics]]. [[Tectonic plate]]s slide very slowly over the [[Earth]]'s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], a lower place of rock that is heated from the Earth's interior. Several huge sections of the earth’s crust are impelled by heat currents in the mantle, producing tremendous forces that can buckle the material at the edges of the plates to form [[mountain]]s. Usually one plate is forced underneath the other, and the lower plate is slowly absorbed by the mantle. Where the two plates pass one another, heated [[Rock (geology)|rock]] from the mantle can burst through the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] to form [[volcano]]es. The movement of the plates against one another can also cause [[earthquake]]s.

'''Mauna Kea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɔː|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|aʊ|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPA-haw|ˈmɐwnə ˈkɛjə|lang}}) is a [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant volcano]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]]. Its peak is {{convert|4207|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} above sea level, making it the [[List of U.S. states by elevation|highest point in the state of Hawaii]]. Most of the mountain is under water, and when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea becomes the tallest mountain in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/highestpoint.html|title=What is the highest point on Earth as measured from Earth's center?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring over {{convert|10000|m|ft|-3|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Mauna Kea is about a million years old, and has thus passed the most active [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes#Shield stages|shield stage]] of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes#Postshield stage|post-shield]] state, its lava is more [[viscosity|viscous]], resulting in a steeper profile. Late [[volcanism]] has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes; contributing factors include the construction of [[cinder cone]]s, the decentralization of its [[rift zone]]s, the [[glacier|glaciation]] on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing [[trade wind]]s. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered [[Volcano#Dormant|dormant]].

In [[Hawaiian mythology]], the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking [[aliʻi]] to visit its peak. [[Ancient Hawaiian]]s living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial [[basalt]]s on its flanks for [[adze|tool production]]. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became [[feral]] and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an [[alpine climate]] at its summit, a ''[[Sophora chrysophylla]]''–''[[Myoporum sandwicense]]'' (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an ''[[Acacia koa]]''–''[[Metrosideros polymorpha]]'' (or koa–{{okina}}ōhi{{okina}}a) forest, now mostly cleared by [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|the former sugar industry]], at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources]] to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.

With its high elevation, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The [[Mauna Kea Observatories]] are used for scientific research across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and comprise the largest such facility in the world. Their construction on a landscape considered sacred by Native Hawaiians continues to be a topic of debate.

A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.

Mauna Kea is over {{convert|32000|km3|cumi|-1|abbr=on}} in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, [[Mauna Loa]], depress the [[oceanic lithosphere|ocean crust]] beneath it by {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="pp1557"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=E.W.|author2=Wise, W.S.|author3=Dalrymple, G.B.|title=The geology and petrology of Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii : a study of postshield volcanism|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/djvu/PP/pp_1557.djvu|series=Professional Paper 1557|year=1997|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The volcano continues to [[Slip (materials science)|slip]] and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than {{convert|0.2|mm|inch|2|abbr=on}} per year.

Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea has been created as the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific tectonic plate]] has moved over the [[Hawaiian hotspot]] in the Earth's underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref name="usgs-2007"/&gt; The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Hawaii.html|title=The Emperor and Hawaiian Volcanic Chains: How well do they fit the plume hypothesis?|author1=Foulger, G.R|author2=Anderson, Don L.

Lava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]] to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south.&lt;ref name="pp1557"/&gt; The original eruptive fissures ([[rift zone]]s) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism.&lt;ref name="usgs-database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete Report for Mauna Kea Volcano (Class B) No. 2601 |url=http://gldims.cr.usgs.gov/webapps/cfusion/sites/qfault/qf_web_disp.cfm?disp_cd=C&amp;qfault_or=5107&amp;ims_cf_cd=cf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65UZ7W6xy?url=http://gldims.cr.usgs.gov/webapps/cfusion/sites/qfault/qf_web_disp.cfm?disp_cd=C&amp;qfault_or=5107&amp;ims_cf_cd=cf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |author1=Cannon, E.C. |author2=Bürgmann, R.

Mauna Kea is home to [[Lake Waiau]], the highest lake in the [[Pacific Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stearns |first1=Harold Thornton |authorlink2=Gordon A.

[[Radiocarbon dating]] of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600&amp;nbsp;years ago. Hawaiian lava types are typically [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]], preventing the formation of lakes due to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Here, either sulfur-bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low-permeability clays, or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water ([[phreatic eruptions]]) formed exceptionally fine ash that also would reduce the permeability of the lake bed.&lt;ref name="usgs-waiau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impermeable beds trap rain and snow at Mauna Kea's Lake Waiau|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2003/03_06_19.html|publisher=[[Hawaii Volcano Observatory]] – [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=August 9, 2010|date=June 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1993, artesian water was not known to be present in the Island of Hawaii. Drilling by the [[University of Hawaii]] at that time encountered an artesian groundwater aquifer at 300 meters below sea level and 100 meters of hole depth within a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of both Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea meet (Humuula saddle region). Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at an elevation higher than 2000 meters above mean sea level. Its presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea's basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea's fresh water lens than current models may indicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University plans to drill for water beneath Mauna Kea |url=http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2012/07/26/university-plans-to-drill-for-water-beneath-mauna-kea/|accessdate=16 April 2015|agency=Big Island Video News|publisher=Big Island Video News|date=Jul 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 two more bore holes were drilled on Mauna Kea and water discovered at much higher elevations than previously believed but shallower than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and 'occupancy' of the higher elevation areas, stating: "Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo — an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Erin|title=Mauna Kea aquifers shallower than expected|url=http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/mauna-kea-aquifers-shallower-expected|accessdate=16 April 2015|agency=West Hawaii Today|publisher=Oahu Publications, Inc.|date=February 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805081528/http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/mauna-kea-aquifers-shallower-expected|archivedate=August 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future activity ===
The last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600&amp;nbsp;years ago (about 2600 BC);&lt;ref name=usgs-2007 /&gt; because of this inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a [[United States Geological Survey]] hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which is given to the [[Extinct volcano|extinct]] volcano [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]]). Twenty&amp;nbsp;percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson |first=John |title=Lava Flow Hazard Maps: Kohala and Mauna Kea |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/maunakea-kohala.html |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |date=July 18, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129201618/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/maunakea-kohala.html |archivedate=January 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its dormancy, Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again, although there would be sufficient warning to evacuate. The telescopes on Mauna Kea's summit would be the first to detect the minute amounts of deformation resulting from the volcano's swelling, acting like expensive [[tiltmeter]]s. Based on prior&lt;!-- not recent: see para *just* above--&gt; eruptions, such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano's upper flanks and would likely produce extended lava flows, mostly of [[a'a]], of {{convert|15|-|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length. Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source. Although not likely in the next few centuries, such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure.&lt;ref name="usgs-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=The next eruption of Mauna Kea|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2000/00_06_01.html|publisher=[[Hawaii Volcano Observatory]] – [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=August 10, 2010|date=June 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SaddleLele.JPG|thumb|left|A stone structure or ahu facing Mauna Kea, on Saddle Road between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa]]

The first [[Ancient Hawaiian]]s to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations.&lt;ref name="nasa-outrigger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Environmental Statement for the Outrigger Telescopes Project: Volume II|url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421000952/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archivedate=April 21, 2009|format=PDF|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=August 22, 2010|page=C–9|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture: The First Arrivals: Native Hawaiian Uses |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/5_culture.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C1EsVlfS?url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/5_culture.pdf |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |format=PDF |work=Mauna Kea Mountain Reserve Master Plan |publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] |accessdate=August 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion.&lt;ref name="ps-1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirch|first=Patrick V.|title=The Impact of the Prehistoric Polynesians on the Hawaiian Ecosystem|journal=[[Pacific Science]]|date=January 1982|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/406|accessdate=October 24, 2010|publisher=[[University of Hawaiʻi Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the [[Rattus exulans|Polynesian (or Pacific) rat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Athens|first=Stephen|author2=Tuggle, H.

The five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as [[sacred mountains]]; and Mauna Kea's summit, the highest, is the most sacred.&lt;ref name="GrayHancock2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Gray|author2=Graham Hancock|title=Sacred Earth: Places of Peace and Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmBcIDvf6XEC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2007|publisher=Sterling Pub.Company|isbn=978-1-4027-4737-3|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YamamotoTarbell2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luci Yamamoto|author2=Alan Tarbell|title=Hawai'i: The Big Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T83kOvN6aTYC&amp;pg=PA137|year=2005|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-691-6|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a ''[[kapu]]'' (ancient Hawaiian law) restricted visitor rights to high-ranking aliʻi. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In [[Hawaiian mythology]], the summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the "region of the gods", a place where benevolent spirits reside. [[Poliahu|Poli{{okina}}ahu]], deity of snow, also resides there.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt; In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], Mauna Kea is a shortened form of ''Mauna a Wakea'' which denotes the mountain's connection to the sky father Wakea;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/culture/the-white-mountain.html |title=The White Mountain |publisher=Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station |date=n.d. |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the English translation of Mauna Kea is "white mountain" in reference to its seasonally snow-capped summit.&lt;ref name=Pukui1986&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pukui|first1=Mary Kawena|last2=Elbert|first2=Samuel H.|title=Hawaiian dictionary|year=1986|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD&amp;nbsp;1100, natives established [[adze]] [[Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve|quarries]] high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense [[basalt]] (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during [[subglacial eruption]]s) to make tools. [[Volcanic glass]] and [[gabbro]] were collected for blades and fishing gear, and [[Sophora chrysophylla|māmane]] wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD&amp;nbsp;1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt;

Lake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, to give them the strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the [[Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve]].&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt;

This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These [[ahupuaa|''ahupua{{okina}}a'']] generally took the form of&lt;!-- but were not NECESSARILY --&gt; long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast&lt;!-- there were many per mountain --&gt;. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupua{{okina}}a of Ka{{okina}}ohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humu{{okina}}ula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–[[Myoporum sandwicense|naio]] forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the [[Pterodroma sandwichensis|{{okina}}ua{{okina}}u]] (''Pterodroma sandwichensis''), [[nēnē]] (''Branta sandvicensis''), and [[palila]] (''Loxioides bailleui''). The lower [[acacia koa|koa]]–[[Metrosideros polymorpha|{{okina}}ōhi{{okina}}a]] forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt;

Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including [[Hilo]], [[Kealakekua]], and [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua]] grew with the establishment of trade&lt;!-- which did not exist beforehand--&gt;; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt;

In 1793, cattle were brought by [[George Vancouver]] as a tribute to King [[Kamehameha I]]. By the early 19th century, they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 [[John Palmer Parker (rancher)|John Palmer Parker]] arrived and befriended Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;I, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional [[land grant]] in 1845, Parker established [[Parker Ranch]] on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle [[ranch]] that is still in operation today.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt; Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of [[sugarcane]] plantations and houses.&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt;

The [[Saddle Road]], named for its crossing of the saddle-shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably.&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt;

The [[Pohakuloa Training Area]] on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii. The {{convert|108863|acre|ha|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} base extends from the volcano's lower flanks to {{convert|2070|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} elevation, on state land leased to the US Army since 1956. There are 15&amp;nbsp;threatened and endangered plants, three endangered birds, and one endangered bat species in the area.&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt;

Mauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27&amp;nbsp;percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76&amp;nbsp;shrines, 4&amp;nbsp;adze manufacturing workshops, 3&amp;nbsp;other markers, 1&amp;nbsp;positively identified burial site, and 4&amp;nbsp;possible burial sites.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt; By 2009, the total number of identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing.&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt; It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient [[snow line]], are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.&lt;ref name="haw-culture"/&gt;

In pre-contact times, natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as no evidence of the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict ''[[kapu]]'' placed on it.&lt;ref name=haw-culture /&gt;

In the early 19th century, the earliest notable ''recorded'' ascents of Mauna Kea included the following:

Goodrich]], an American missionary, made the first recorded ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested he was not the first human on the summit.&lt;ref name=haw-culture /&gt; He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.&lt;ref name="esa-1940"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartt |first1=Constance E|first2=Marie C.|last2=Neal|title=The Plant Ecology of Mauna Kea, Hawaii|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|date=April 1940|volume=21|issue=2|pages=237–266|doi=10.2307/1930491|publisher=[[Ecological Society of America]]|jstor=1930491}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 17, 1825, an expedition from [[HMS Blonde (1819)|HMS ''Blonde'']], led by botanist James Macrae, reached the summit of Mauna Kea. Macrae was the first person to record the [[Mauna Kea silversword]] (''Argyroxiphium sandwicense''), saying: "The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of coming here to see it on purpose."&lt;ref name=esa-1940 /&gt;
* In January 1834, [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]] climbed the mountain and described extensively the division of plant species by altitude. On a second climb in July, he was found dead in a pit intended to catch wild cattle. Although murder was suspected, it was probably an accidental fall. The site, ''Ka lua kauka''  {{Coord| 19|53|17|N| 155|20|17|W|display=inline |type:landmark_region:US-HI |name= Kaluakauka }}, is marked by the [[Douglas fir]] trees named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kaluakauka Revisited: the Death of David Douglas in Hawaii

== Ecology ==

=== Background ===
Hawaii's [[geographical isolation]] strongly influences [[Environment of Hawaii|its ecology]]. Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else (see [[Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakai | first1 = Ann K. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = Warren L. | last3 = Mehrhoff | first3 = Loyal A.  | year = 2002 | title = Patterns of Endangerment in the Hawaiian Flora

In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation.&lt;ref name="ims-1984"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3673140|last1=Juvik |first1=J.

Contact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–{{okina}}ōhi{{okina}}a forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, [[feral]] animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest.&lt;ref name="botany-1990" /&gt; Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.&lt;ref name="botany-1990b"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alteration of native Hawaiian vegetation-Effects of humans, their activities and introductions|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|isbn=0-8248-1308-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0RFAQAAIAAJ|first1=Charles P. |last1=Stone |first2=Linda W. |last2=Cuddihy|chapter=Alien Plants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpine environment ===
[[File:Mauna Kea silversword3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mauna Kea silversword]] (''Argyroxiphium sandwicense sandwicense'') growing near the volcano's summit]]
The summit of Mauna Kea lies above the [[tree line]], and consists of mostly lava rock and [[alpine tundra]]. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and is known as the [[Hawaiian tropical high shrublands]]. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low [[Water retention curve|water retention capacity]].&lt;ref name=esa-1940 /&gt;

Plant species found at this elevation include ''[[Styphelia tameiameiae]]'', ''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'', ''[[Tetramolopium|Tetramolopium humile]]'', ''[[Agrostis|Agrostis sandwicensis]]'', ''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', ''[[Trisetum|Trisetum glomeratum]]'', ''[[Poa annua]]'', ''[[Sonchus oleraceus]]'', and ''[[Coprosma|Coprosma ernodiodes]]''. One notable species is [[Mauna Kea silversword]] (''Argyroxiphium sandwicense'' var. ''sandwicense''), a highly [[endangered]] endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first =Lawrence R. |last= Walker

The [[Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve]] on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of [[Aeolian landform|aeolian desert]] and Lake Waiau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauna Kea Ice Age|url=http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/ecosystems/nars/reserves/hawaii-island/mauna-kea-ice-age/|publisher=[[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources|Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources]]|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ecosystem is a likely haven for the [[threatened]] [[Pterodroma sandwichensis|{{okina}}ua{{okina}}u]] (''Pterodroma sandwichensis'') and also the center of a study on [[wēkiu bug]]s (''Nysius wekiuicola'').&lt;ref name=haw-2005 /&gt;

Wēkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus ''[[Nysius]]'', which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to {{convert|4200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="bishop-1983"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Peter D.|last1=Ashlock|first2=Wayne C.|last2=Gagné|title=A Remarkable New Micropterous Nysius Species from the Aelion Zone of Mauna Kea, Hawaii island|journal=[[International Journal of Entomology]]|publisher=[[Bernice P.

They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species is no longer a candidate for the [[Endangered species#Endangered Species Act|Endangered Species List]]; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related ''[[Nysius aa]]'' lives on Mauna Loa. [[Wolf spider]]s (Lycosidae) and [[forest tent caterpillar moth]]s have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies.&lt;ref name="usgs-wekiu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wekiu bugs-life on top of a volcano|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_05_20.html|work=Volcano Watch|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] – [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Māmane–naio forest ===
[[File:Starr 020221-0023 Sophora chrysophylla.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of [[Sophora chrysophylla|māmane]] (''Sophora chrysophylla'') trees]]

The highest [[Hawaiian tropical dry forests|forested zone]] on the volcano, at an elevation of {{convert|2000|-|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is dominated by māmane (''[[Sophora chrysophylla]]'') and naio (''[[Myoporum sandwicense]]''), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the [[palila]] (''Loxioides bailleui''). The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and [[Hualālai]], but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared [[critically endangered]].&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt;

The largest threat to the ecosystem is [[grazing]] by feral sheep (''Ovis aries''), cattle (''Bos primigenius''),&lt;ref name="ps-text"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Scrowcroft, Paul G. |year= 1983 |url= http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/651/3/v37n2-109-119.pdf.txt |format= PDF |title= Tree Cover Changes in Mamane (Sophora chrysophylla) Forests Grazed by Sheep and Cattle |journal= [[Pacific Science]] |publisher= [[University of Hawaii Press]] |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages=109–20|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the reason this ref is done manually is because the {{ref}} version breaks for some reason. --&gt; and goats (''Capra hircus'') introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s,&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt; and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of [[herbaceous]] and [[woody plant|woody]] plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing.&lt;ref name="ps-text"/&gt; The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as [[game animal]]s, and in 1959 the [[Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources]], the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt;

[[Mouflon]] (''Ovis aries orientalis'') was introduced from 1962–1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Hess, Steven |author2=Kawakami Jr, Ben |author3=Okita, David |author4=Medeiros, Keola |year=2006 |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1193/ |title=A Preliminary Assessment of Mouflon Abundance at the Kahuku Unit of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park |publisher=United States Geological Survey |page=1}} See: {{cite report |last=Giffin |first=J.G. |year=1982 |title=Ecology of mouflon sheep on Mauna Kea |publisher=Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife |location=Honolulu, HI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a plan to release [[axis deer]] (''Axis axis'') in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who said that they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the [[Endangered Species Act]] was passed; the [[National Audubon Society]] and [[Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund]] filed a lawsuit against the [[Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources]], claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case ''[[Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources|Palila v.

The court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside.&lt;ref name="ims-1984"/&gt; This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals,&lt;ref name=botany-1990 /&gt; at least temporarily. An active control program is in place,&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt; though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Banko, Paul et al.

Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered [[Hawaiian hoary bat]] (''Lasiurus cinereus semotus'') have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota.

The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking [[turbulence]] for some of the world's best [[astronomical seeing]].

In the early 1960s, the Hawaii Island [[Chamber of Commerce]] encouraged astronomical development of Mauna Kea, as economic stimulus; this coincided with [[University of Arizona]] astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]]'s search for sites to use newly improved detectors of [[infrared astronomy|infrared light]]. Site testing by Kuiper's assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit's outstanding suitability. An intense three-way competition for [[NASA]] funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper, [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Hawaii]] (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy.

== Climate ==
The summit of Mauna Kea has an [[alpine climate]]. Due to the influence of its tropical latitude, temperature swings are very low in spite of its high elevation. Frosts are common year round, but in spite of the elevation no month is nearly below freezing in terms of average high, although March almost falls below {{convert|32|F|C}} in average means.

From December to February, the ground above {{convert|12,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} is often covered by snow, ranging from a few inches deep to several feet deep. Snow may fall from {{convert|11,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|12,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and higher in any month, but occurs most often between October and April to early May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/faq.php "Frequently Asked Questions: What is the weather like in the winter...spring...&amp; the fall? &amp;...Does it snow in Hawaii?"].

Mauna Kea's coastline is dominated by the [[Hamakua]] Coast, an area of rugged terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano's flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Juvik|first1=Sonia P.|last2=Juvik|first2= James O.|last3=Paradise|first3=Thomas R.|title=Atlas of Hawaii|edition=3rd|year=1998|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Hilo|isbn=0-8248-2125-4|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area includes several recreation parks including [[Kalopa State Recreation Area]], [[Wailuku River State Park]] and [[Akaka Falls State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Island|publisher=[[Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources]]|url= http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/hawaii/|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, is a common activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, [[pheasant]]s, and [[quail]].&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ims-1984 /&gt; The [[Mauna Kea State Recreation Area]] functions as a base camp for the sport.&lt;ref name="haw-recreation"/&gt; [[Birdwatching]] is also common at lower levels on the mountain.&lt;ref name="mko-about" /&gt; A popular site is ''[[Pu'u Huluhulu (Hawaii Route 200)|Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu]]'', a [[kīpuka]] on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.&lt;ref name="lp-2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hawai'i: the big island|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn=978-1-74059-691-6|pages=145–46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T83kOvN6aTYC&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=Pu%E2%80%99u%20Huluhulu%20Native%20Tree%20Refuge&amp;pg=PA145|first1=Alan|last1=Tarbell|first2=Luci |last2=Yamamoto|chapter=Around Mauna Kea|date=August 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A152, Hawaii, USA, Mauna Kea observatories, from summit, 2007.JPG|thumb|Four observatories from the summit (left to right): [[United Kingdom Infrared Telescope|UKIRT]], [[UH88]], [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini North]], and [[Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope|CFHT]]]]
Mauna Kea's great elevation and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The high elevation with its risk of [[altitude sickness]], weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level [[Onizuka Center for International Astronomy]] telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.&lt;ref name="haw-recreation" /&gt;

Today, multiple hiking trails exist, including the [[Mauna Kea Trail]], and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station (VIS) adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy. The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at {{convert|2804|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="uh-2009"/&gt; One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ham.2007.8307 |author1=Onopa, J. |author2=Haley, A. |author3=Yeow, M.

It is strongly recommended to use a [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle to drive all the way to the top. Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea.&lt;ref name="sl-hazards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauna Kea Hazards: Please Read Before Travelling Above Hale Pohaku|url=http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/observing/safety/MK_Hazards.pdf|format=PDF|work=Safety Leaflet|publisher=[[Institute for Astronomy]] – [[University of Hawaii]]|accessdate=August 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609215514/http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/observing/safety/MK_Hazards.pdf|archive-date=June 9, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free Star Gazing Program is held at the VIS every night from 6-10 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Gazing Program|publisher=[[Mauna Kea Support Services]]|url= http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/visiting-mauna-kea/star-gazing-program.html|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year, and to help ensure safety, and protect the integrity of the mountain, a [[Park ranger|ranger program]] was implemented in 2001.&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt;

&lt;!--  Because of snow cover in January and February, (not accurate) Mauna Kea can occasionally be skied. There are no facilities,&lt;ref name=uh-2009 /&gt; and winds can reach speeds of {{convert|80|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, but skiing remains a common pastime for some island residents.

The '''Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles''' was a cooperative research program between the U.S. government and the three major domestic auto corporations, aimed at bringing extremely [[Fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] (up to {{convert|80|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} vehicles to market by 2003. 

The partnership, formed in 1993, involved eight federal agencies,&lt;ref&gt;Departments of [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Energy|Energy]], [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]] and [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]], the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; the national laboratories, universities, and the [[United States Council for Automotive Research]] (USCAR), which comprises [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[General Motors Corporation]].

"Supercar" was the unofficial description for the R&amp;D program.&lt;ref &lt;ref name="80mpg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenstien |first=Paul |title=80 mpg |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=June 2000 |volume=177 |issue=6 |pages=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On track to achieving its objectives, the program was cancelled by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush Administration]] in 2001 at the request of the automakers, with some of its aspects shifted to the much more distant [[FreedomCAR]] program.

==Objectives==
The main purpose of this program was to develop technologies to reduce the impact of cars and light trucks on the environment as well as decrease U.S. dependency on imported petroleum. It was to make working vehicles that can achieve up to triple the contemporary vehicle fuel efficiency as well as further minimizing emissions, but without sacrificing affordability, performance, or safety. The common term for these vehicles was "supercar" because of the technological advances. The goal of achieving the {{convert|80|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} target with a family-sized sedan included  using new fuel sources, powerplants, aerodynamics, and lightweight materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCosh |first=Dan |title=Emerging Technologies for the Supercar |journal=Popular Science |volume=244 |issue=6 |pages=95–100 |date=June 1994 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=053lJ8sFTAYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=define:+supercar |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The program was established in 1993 to support the domestic U.S. automakers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) develop prototypes of a safe, clean, affordable car the size of the [[Ford Taurus]], but delivering three times the fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="80mpg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuhs |first=Allen E. |title=Hybrid vehicles and the future of personal transportation |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |page=10 |isbn=978-1-4200-7534-2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c5xNff-XPWoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=define:+supercar |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
The PNGV program "overcame many challenges and has forged a useful and productive partnership of industry and government participants",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10180&amp;page=2 |title=Executive Summary - Review of the Research Program of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles: Seventh Report |author1=Transportation Research Board |author2=Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |publisher=The National Academies Press |year=2001 |doi=10.17226/10180 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "resulting in three concept cars that demonstrate the feasibility of a variety of new automotive technologies" with [[Diesel-electric transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/success/pngv3_23_01.pdf |title=New concept cars demonstrate clean, efficient transportation technologies |date=April 2001 |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three domestic automakers, GM, Ford, and Chrysler, developed fully operational [[concept car]]s. They were [[Full-size car|full sized]], five-passenger family cars that achieved at least {{convert|72|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="3cars"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/favorites/fcvt_fotw128.html |title=FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program: Fact #128: May 15, 2000 PNGV Concept Vehicles Presented to the Public in 2000 |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060930040155/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/favorites/fcvt_fotw128.html |archivedate=30 September 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors developed the 80 mpg [[General Motors Precept|Precept]], Ford designed the 72 mpg [[Ford Prodigy|Prodigy]], and Chrysler built the 72 mpg [[Chrysler ESX-3|ESX-3]]. They featured aerodynamic, lightweight aluminum or thermoplastic construction and were hybrid powered using 3- or 4-cylinder diesel engines and NiMH/lithium batteries.&lt;ref name="3cars"/&gt;

Researchers for the PNGV identified a number of ways to reach 80 mpg including reducing vehicle weight, increasing engine efficiency, combining gasoline engines and electric motors in hybrid vehicles, implementing regenerative braking, and switching to high efficiency fuel cell powerplants.  Specific new technology breakthroughs achieved under the program included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.technology.gov/Testimony/p_CCG-011206_CAFE.htm |title=Testimony to U.S Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology by Dr. Claude Gravatte, Director PNGV |date=6 December 2001| |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220104312/http://www.technology.gov/Testimony/p_CCG-011206_CAFE.htm |work=www.technology.gov |archivedate=20 February 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Ralph Nader]] called PNGV "an effort to coordinate the transfer of property rights for federally funded research and development to the automotive industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nader.org/releases/63099.html |title=Ralph Nader's Testimony on Corporate Welfare |date=30 June 1999 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021130081205/http://www.nader.org/releases/63099.html |publisher=www.nader.org |archivedate=30 November 2002 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The program was also criticized by some groups for a focus on [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] solutions, a fuel that is seen by some as having inherently high air pollutant emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_5_5/ai_71836367|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=www.findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Kolbert, a staff writer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'', described that [[renewable energy]] is the main problem, and that "If someone, somewhere, comes up with a source of power that is safe, inexpensive, and for all intents and purposes inexhaustible, then we, the Chinese, the Indians, and everyone else on the planet can keep on truckin'. Barring that, the car of the future may turn out to be no car at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |title=Running on Fumes: Does the "car of the future" have a future? |journal=The New Yorker |date=5 November 2007 |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/11/05/running-on-fumes |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is analogous to [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] of crystalline materials, where different stable crystalline states (solid 1, 2 in diagram) of the same substance can exist (e.g. diamond and graphite are two polymorphs of carbon). Like the ordinary liquid–gas transition, the liquid–liquid transition is expected to end in a [[liquid-liquid critical point]]. At temperatures beyond these critical points there is a continuous range of fluid states, i.e. the distinction between liquids and gasses is lost. If crystallisation is avoided the liquid–liquid transition can be extended into the metastable [[supercooled liquid]] regime.]]

'''Polyamorphism''' is the ability of a substance to exist in several different [[amorphous]] modifications. It is analogous to the [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] of [[crystal]]line materials. Many amorphous substances can exist with different amorphous characteristics (e.g. polymers). However, polyamorphism requires ''two distinct'' amorphous states with a clear, discontinuous (first-order) [[phase transition]] between them. When such a transition occurs between two stable liquid states, a polyamorphic transition may also be referred to as a '''liquid–liquid phase transition'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12195833|date=2002|last1=Hancock|first1=BC|last2=Shalaev|first2=EY|last3=Shamblin|first3=SL|title=Polyamorphism: a pharmaceutical science perspective|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1151–2|doi=10.1211/002235702320266343|journal=The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Even though amorphous materials exhibit no [[long-range order|long-range]] periodic atomic ordering, there is still significant and varied local structure at inter-atomic length scales (see [[structure of liquids and glasses]]). Different local structures can produce amorphous phases of the same chemical composition with different physical properties such as [[density]]. In several cases sharp transitions have been observed between two different density amorphous states of the same material. [[Amorphous ice]] is one important example (see also examples below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mishima |first=O. |title=An apparently 1st-order transition between two amorphous phases of ice induced by pressure|doi=10.1038/314076a0|journal=Nature |volume=314 |issue= 6006|date=1985 |pages=76 |last2=Calvert |first2=L. D. |last3=Whalley |first3=E.|bibcode = 1985Natur.314...76M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these transitions (including water) are expected to end in a second [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].

==Liquid–liquid transitions==

Polyamorphism may apply to all amorphous states, i.e. glasses, other amorphous solids, supercooled liquids, ordinary liquids or fluids. A liquid–liquid transition however, is one that occurs only in the liquid state (red line in the phase diagram, top right). In this article liquid–liquid transitions are defined as transitions between two liquids of the same chemical substance. Elsewhere the term liquid–liquid transition may also refer to the more common transitions between liquid mixtures of different chemical composition.

The stable liquid state unlike most glasses and amorphous solids, is a thermodynamically stable equilibrium state. Thus new liquid–liquid or fluid-fluid transitions in the stable liquid (or fluid) states are more easily analysed than transitions in amorphous solids where  arguments are complicated by the non-equilibrium, non-ergodic nature of the amorphous state.

===Rapoport's theory===

Liquid–liquid transitions were originally considered by Rapoport in 1967 in order to explain high pressure melting curve maxima of some liquid metals.&lt;ref name=rap&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rapoport |first=E. |title=Model for melting curve maxima at high pressure|doi=10.1063/1.1841150|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=46 |issue=2891 |date=1967 |pages=1–5|bibcode = 1967JChPh..46.2891R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapoport's theory requires the existence of a melting curve maximum in polyamorphic systems.

===Double well potentials===

One physical explanation for polyamorphism is the existence of a double well inter-atomic pair potential (see lower right diagram). It is well known that the ordinary liquid–gas critical point appears when the inter-atomic pair potential contains a minimum. At lower energies (temperatures) particles trapped in this minimum condense into the liquid state. At higher temperatures however, these particles can escape the well and the sharp definition between liquid and gas is lost. [[Molecular modelling]] has shown that addition of a second well produces an additional transition between two different liquids (or fluids) with a second critical point.&lt;ref name=fran/&gt;

==Examples of polyamorphism==

Polyamorphism has been experimentally observed or theoretically suggested in [[silicon]], liquid [[phosphorus]], [[triphenyl phosphate]], and in some other [[molecular network]]-forming substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_anomalies.html|accessdate = 30 August 2015|title=Anomalous properties of water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and structural analogues===

The most famous case of polyamorphism is [[amorphous ice]]. Pressurizing conventional hexagonal ice crystals to about 1.6 GPa at [[liquid nitrogen]] temperature (77 K) converts them to the high-density amorphous ice. Upon releasing the pressure, this phase is stable and has density of 1.17 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 77 K and 1 bar. Consequent warming to 127 K at ambient pressure transforms this phase to a low-density amorphous ice (0.94 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 bar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0921-4526(97)00749-7|title=Amorphous polymorphism in ice investigated by inelastic neutron scattering|date=1997|display-authors=4|last1=Schober|first1=H|journal=Physica B: Condensed Matter|volume=241–243|pages=897|last2=Koza|first2=M.|last3=Tölle|first3=A.|last4=Fujara|first4=F.|last5=Angell|first5=C.A.|last6=Böhmer|first6=R.|bibcode = 1997PhyB..241..897S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, if the high-density amorphous ice is warmed up to 165 K not at low pressures but keeping the 1.6 GPa compression, and then cooled back to 77 K, then another amorphous ice is produced, which has even higher density of 1.25 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 bar. All those amorphous forms have very different vibrational lattice spectra and intermolecular distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b108676f|title=A second distinct structural "state" of high-density amorphous ice at 77 K and 1 bar|date=2001|display-authors=4|last1=Loerting|first1=Thomas|last2=Salzmann|first2=Christoph|last3=Kohl|first3=Ingrid|last4=Mayer|first4=Erwin|last5=Hallbrucker|first5=Andreas|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=3|pages=5355|bibcode = 2001PCCP....3.5355L|issue=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; 
A similar abrupt liquid-amorphous [[phase transition]] is predicted in liquid silicon when cooled under high pressures.&lt;ref name=Morishita&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.055503|title=High Density Amorphous Form and Polyamorphic Transformations of Silicon|date=2004|last1=Morishita|first1=T.|journal=Phys.

===Oxide liquids and glasses===

[[Yttria]]-[[alumina]] melts are another system reported to exhibit polyamorphism. Observation of a liquid–liquid phase transition in the supercooled liquid has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1160766|pmid=18948535|title=Detection of First-Order Liquid/Liquid Phase Transitions in Yttrium Oxide-Aluminum Oxide Melts|first9=CJ|last10=Weber|first10=R|last11=Martin|first11=C.

Yttria-Alumina melts quenched from about 1900&amp;nbsp;°C at a rate ~400&amp;nbsp;°C/s, can form glasses containing a second co-existing phase. This happens for certain Y/Al ratios (about 20–40&amp;nbsp;mol% Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The two phases have the same average composition but different density, molecular structure and hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/369633a0|title=Density-driven liquid–liquid phase separation in the system AI2O3–Y2O3|date=1994|last1=Aasland|first1=S.|last2=McMillan|first2=P. F.|journal=Nature|volume=369|pages=633|bibcode = 1994Natur.369..633A|issue=6482}}&lt;/ref&gt; However whether the second phase is glassy or crystalline is also debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/20/20/205103|title=Phase separation, crystallization and polyamorphism in the Y2O3-Al2O3 system|first4=WA|last4=Crichton|first3=PS|last3=Salmon|date=2008|first2=AC|last2=Barnes|first1=LB|last1=Skinner|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|volume=20|pages=205103|bibcode = 2008JPCM...20t5103S|issue=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Continuous changes in density were observed upon cooling [[silicon dioxide]] or [[germanium dioxide]]. Although continuous density changes do not constitute a first order transition, they may be indicative of an underlying abrupt transition.

===Organic materials===

Polyamorphism has also been observed in organic compounds, such as liquid [[triphenyl phosphite]] at temperatures about 200 K.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xk-lYXtqM-4C&amp;pg=PA120|page=120|title=Structural chemistry of glasses|author=K.

Ossi|publisher=Springer|date=2006|isbn=3-540-29609-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyamorphism is also a potentially important area in pharmaceutical science. The amorphous form of a drug typically has much better aqueous solubility (cf. the analogous crystalline form) but the actual local structure in an amorphous pharmaceutical can be different, depending on the method used to form the amorphous phase

'''''Pycnanthus angolensis''''' is a species of [[tree]] in the [[nutmeg]] family, [[Myristicaceae]]. It is native to [[Tropical Africa]].&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its English language common names include '''African nutmeg''', '''false nutmeg''', '''boxboard''', and '''cardboard'''.&lt;ref name=waf&gt;[http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/sea/products/afdbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1397 ''Pycnanthus angolensis''.] AgroForestryTree Database. World Agroforestry Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa it is widely known as '''''ilomba'''''.&lt;ref name=ric&gt;Richter, H. G. and M. J. Dallwitz. 2000 onwards.

==Description==
This [[evergreen]] tree grows up to 40 meters tall and usually up to a meter wide, sometimes up to 1.5 meters or more. The [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] is straight and cylindrical with fissures and flaking [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. The [[plant sap|sap]] is honey-colored and turns red in time. The branches are in whorls. The leathery leaves are up to 31 centimeters long by 9 wide. The blades have pointed tips, heart-shaped bases, and thick midribs. They are hairless on top and coated with [[rust (color)|rusty]], [[felt]]like hairs on the undersides. The leaves usually bear signs of insect damage, a feature so common it is considered characteristic of the species. The flowers are arranged in dense, rusty [[panicle]]s up to 15 centimeters long. The individual flowers are difficult to see in the tight panicle until the [[stamen]]s develop,&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; being only about a millimeter long. The flowers are hairy and fragrant.&lt;ref name=kew&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/efloras/namedetail.do?flora=fz&amp;taxon=6751&amp;nameid=17150 ''Pycnanthus angolensis'' (Welw.) Warb.] In: Stannard, B. L. ''Flora Zambesiaca'' Vol. 9, Part 2: Myristicaceae. 1997. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit is a rounded [[drupe]] reaching over 3 centimeters long and wide, borne in clusters.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; It is hairy brown when new, turning yellow-orange, and has cartilaginous flesh that dries woody.&lt;ref name=kew/&gt; It contains a black seed with a red [[aril]]&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; which resembles that of [[nutmeg]].&lt;ref name=prota&gt;[http://www.prota4u.org/protav8.asp?h=M4&amp;t=Pycnanthus,angolensis&amp;p=Pycnanthus+angolensis ''Pycnanthus angolensis''.] PROTA.&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit ripens over a long period continuing into the next flowering season, which begins around October.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

==Ecology==
The tree grows in moist [[rainforest]]s up to about 1200 meters in elevation among other evergreens and semideciduous trees. It occurs in [[secondary forest]], sometimes taking hold in new canopy gaps or clearings. It thrives in sunny locations.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; It grows in [[riparian zone|riparian]] forests such as [[gallery forest]]s, and in some regions it can be found in [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; It occurs in areas receiving between about 1300 and 1800 millimeters of rain per year,&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; but the optimal seems to be about 2000 millimeters.&lt;ref name=prota/&gt;

Many animals feed on the fruits, such as [[hornbill]]s.&lt;ref name=rbg&gt;[http://congotrees.rbge.org.uk/species/details/pycnanthus-angolensis ''Pycnanthus angolensis''.] An Introduction to the Trees from the North of the Republic of Congo. Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
This species has a wide variety of human uses.

It is harvested for its [[wood]], which is light, soft, and whitish gray or pink-tinged in color.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; Its popularity rose after [[World War II]] when [[plywood]] was in demand, and during the mid-20th century it was one of the more valuable timbers in Central Africa.&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; It is not very durable and tends to [[Wood warping|warp]], but it is easy to cut and work and can be used for many purposes. It is suitable for [[furniture]], and in house construction as [[panelling]],&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; [[siding]], [[roof shingle]]s, and framing. It is used for [[wood fuel|fuel]] and [[Pulp (paper)|paper pulp]]. The wood can be vulnerable to [[termites]], [[powderpost beetle]]s, and other [[pest (organism)|pests]].&lt;ref name=prota/&gt;

The yellowish or reddish [[vegetable oil|fat]] from the aromatic seed is called "kombo butter" or "Angola tallow". A seed can be up to 70% fat. It is used as a [[Biofuel|fuel]] for lighting and is made into [[soap]]. Seed remnants are used in [[compost]].&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; When ignited, the oily seed burns slowly and can be used as a [[candle]].&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

In [[Uganda]] the tree is grown in [[Banana plantation|banana]], [[Coffea|coffee]], and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations to shade the crops.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

Most parts of the tree have been used in [[traditional African medicine]]. The sap has been used to [[Antihemorrhagic|control bleeding]].&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; It is made into an eyewash to treat [[cataracts]] and [[filariasis]] of the eye.&lt;ref name=ono&gt;Onocha, P. A. and E. O. Otunla. (2010). [http://scholarsresearchlibrary.com/aasr-vol2-iss4/AASR-2010-2-4-186-190.pdf Biological activities of extracts of ''Pycnanthus angolensis'' (Welw.) Warb.] ''Archives of Applied Science Research'' 2(4) 186-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The bark has been used as a poison [[antidote]] and a treatment for [[leprosy]], [[anemia]],&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; [[infertility]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; Leaf extracts are consumed or used in an [[enema]] to treat [[edema]]. Root extracts are used to treat parasitic infections,&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; such as [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; The seed oil is used to treat [[Oral candidiasis|thrush]].&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

Like the fat of nutmeg, kombo butter is mostly [[myristic acid]], with a high amount of [[myristoleic acid]], as well. It contains the unique compound kombic acid, which was named for the tree under its nomenclatural synonym, ''P. kombo''.&lt;ref name=lok&gt;Lok, C. M., et al. (1983). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031942283800260 Kombic acid, a hydroquinone polyisoprenoic carboxylic acid from ''Pycnanthus kombo'' seed fat.] ''Phytochemistry'' 22(9) 1973-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
This tree is [[horticulture|cultivated]] for its products. Seeds are sown in the field,&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; and seedlings are grown in [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] until they have large [[taproot]]s.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; They cannot tolerate [[drought]].&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; After a year the tree is about half a meter tall, and within 4 years it can reach 4 meters. A 20-year-old tree can be 25 meters tall. Stands of cultivated trees are pruned and thinned periodically.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

Pest insects such as ''[[Monochamus scabiosus]]'' and ''[[Mallodon downesi]]'' and [[fungus|fungi]] such as ''[[Ophiostoma]]'' sp. have been observed, but they are not severe problems.&lt;ref name=prota/&gt; The freshly harvested wood may become discolored due to [[bacteria]]l growth, the light-colored wood developing dark brown staining.&lt;ref name=yaz&gt;Yazaki, Y., et al. (1985).

Trees can be cut when they reach a diameter of 50 centimeters, at around 30 years old.&lt;ref name=prota/&gt;

[[Agricultural cooperative]]s in Ghana cultivate the trees for the kombo butter.&lt;ref name=gus&gt;Gustafson, K., et al. (2012).

'''Relative thermal resistance''' is a measure of the [[energy]] required to mix water of two different temperatures (and thus different [[density|densities]]). Comparisons will be made against the differences in the density of water at 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C and 5&amp;nbsp;°C. &lt;!-- Citation help is here http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=Wetzel+3.98+Density-of-water --&gt; (Wetzel 1983) Since this is a relative measure, there are no units involved.

It is calculated at intervals of 1&amp;nbsp;cm using the following equation:
&lt;math&gt;RTR= ((p_1-p_2) \times 10^{6})/ 8 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; is the density at the bottom of the stratum being considered
and &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; is the density at the top of the stratum being considered

The [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) published a special report on '''''Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation''''' ('''''SRREN''''') on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian_srren"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report developed under the leadership of [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] evaluates the global potential for using [[renewable energy]] to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]]. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC’s 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger [[renewable energy policy]] coverage.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

== History ==
Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in its [[fourth assessment report]], published in 2007, but members decided that [[renewable energy commercialization]] merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session28/doc3.pdf  Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the IPCC WG III’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report.  The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/ Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Report "aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&amp;benefits, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.htm IPCC Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main findings==
Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts".&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

In the report, the IPCC said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, United States |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, United States |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, energy products accounted around 60% of the total EU's import from Russia.&lt;ref name=eurostat2018/&gt;

The [[Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhgorod pipeline]] was constructed in 1982–1984 with Western financing to provide Soviet gas to the Western European market.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Russian state-owned company [[Gazprom]] exports natural gas to Europe.  It also controls a [[List of Gazprom's subsidiaries|large number of subsidiaries]], including various infrastructure assets.  According to the study published by the [[Research Centre for East European Studies]], the liberalization of the EU gas market has driven Gazprom's expansion in Europe by increasing its share in the European [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] market.  It has established sale subsidiaries in many of its export markets, and has also invested in access to industrial and power generation sectors in Western and Central Europe.  In addition, Gazprom has established joint ventures to build natural gas pipelines and storage depots in a number of European countries.&lt;ref name=rad34&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Transneft]], a Russian state-owned company responsible for the national oil pipelines, is another Russian company supplying energy to Europe.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In September 2012 the [[European Commission]] has opened formal proceedings to investigate whether [[Gazprom]] is hindering competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets, in breach of [[European Union competition law|EU competition law]]. In particular, the Commission is looking into Gazprom's usage of ‘no resale’ clauses in supply contracts, alleged prevention of diversification of gas supplies, and imposition of unfair pricing by linking oil and gas prices in long-term contracts.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Antitrust: Commission Opens Proceedings Against Gazprom, [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-937_en.htm IP/12/937]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Federation responded by issuing a blocking legislation, which introduced a default rule prohibiting Russian strategic firms, including Gazprom, to comply with any foreign measures or requests.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Martyniszyn, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2399923 Legislation Blocking Antitrust Investigations and the September 2012 Russian Executive Order], 37(1) World Competition 103 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance is made subject to a prior permission granted by the Russian government.

==History==
In the early 1980s there were American efforts, led by the Reagan administration, to convince European countries through which a proposed Soviet gas pipeline was to be built to deny firms responsible for construction the ability to purchase supplies and parts for the pipeline and associated facilities. The pipeline was built despite these protests and the rise of large Russian gas firms such as [[Gazprom]] as well as increased Russian fossil fuel production has facilitated a large expansion in the quantity of gas supplied to the European market since the 1990s.

==Natural gas deliveries==
[[File:Major russian gas pipelines to europe.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Major existing and planned natural gas pipelines supplying Russian gas to Europe]]
In 2017, 39% of the European Union's natural gas total imports originated from Russia.&lt;ref name=eurostat2018/&gt;  As of 2009, Russian natural gas was delivered to Europe through 12&amp;nbsp;pipelines, of which three were direct pipelines (to Finland, Estonia and Latvia), four through Belarus (to Lithuania and Poland) and five through Ukraine (to Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland).&lt;ref name="gas security directive"&gt;

The largest importers of Russian gas in the European Union are Germany and Italy, accounting together for almost half of the EU gas imports from Russia.  Other larger Russian gas importers (over 5&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meter per year) in the European Union are France, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.&lt;ref name="eia-russia"&gt;

==Disputes and diversification efforts==
{{Seealso|Nord Stream 2}}
At the same time, the variety of national policies and stances of larger exporters ''versus'' larger dependents of Russian gas, together with the segmentation of the European gas market, has become a prominent issue in European politics toward Russia, with significant geopolitical implications for economic and political ties between the EU and Russia. These ties have occasionally led to calls for greater European energy diversity, although such efforts are complicated by the fact that many European customers have long term legal contracts for gas deliveries despite the disputes, most of which stretch beyond 2025–2030.&lt;ref name="pirani"&gt;

The '''Scuttling of SMS ''Cormoran''''' off [[Guam]] on April 7, 1917 was the result of the [[United States]] entry into [[World War I]] and the internment of the [[Imperial Germany|German]]
[[merchant raider]] [[SMS Cormoran (1909)|SMS ''Cormoran'']]. The incident was the only hostile encounter between United States and German military forces during the [[Pacific Ocean]] campaign of the war.

==Background==
SMS ''Cormoran'' was originally a passenger and cargo ship, named ''SS Ryaezan'' and built by the Germans in 1909 for the Russian merchant fleet. When the war broke out, she was captured off [[Korea]] by [[SMS Emden (1908)|SMS ''Emden'']] and transformed into an [[auxiliary cruiser]]. ''Cormoran'' was armed with eight 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.1&amp;nbsp;in) rapid fire guns from the original [[SMS Cormoran|SMS ''Cormoran'']] and commanded by Captain [[Adalbert Zuckschwerdt]]. The number of crew she had on board is unknown. Setting out from [[Tsingtao]] on August 10, 1914 for a [[commerce raiding]] cruise in the South Pacific, SMS ''Cormoran'' failed to sink any enemy shipping as she spent all of her time avoiding allied warships.

Captain Zuckschwerdt pulled into [[Apra Harbor]], Guam on December 14 with the intention of receiving coal from the Americans on the island. The United States was a neutral power at this time so the Germans were refused the proper amount of coal needed to continue their voyage, there was little coal on the island for the Americans and Guamanians themselves. So the German sailors were interned and for about two years they lived among the Americans and Guamanians in friendship until the [[American entry into World War I]].

==Scuttling==
When war was declared on April 7, 1917, the [[United States Marines]] and sailors on Guam were notified and set out from their base. They embarked the old screw [[schooner]] [[USS Supply (1873)|USS ''Supply'']] with the goal of capturing the auxiliary cruiser, or destroying it. Not wanting to anger the Germans they had lived with for two years and not wanting to expose the Guamanians to needless harm; the Americans resorted to first requesting that the Germans surrender peacefully. In case anything went wrong, the [[artillery battery]] of three 7&amp;nbsp;inch guns on the western face of [[Mount Tenjo]] was also trained on the vessel. Before Captain Zuckschwerdt could refuse surrender a group of [[United States Navy]] sailors on the deck of USS ''Supply'' noticed that the Germans were preparing to scuttle their vessel instead of surrendering or attempting an escape. 
[[File:Apra Harbor.jpg|300px|left|thumb|An aerial view of Apra Harbor.]]
The sailors notified the Marines so one of the Americans fired a shot across the German ship's bow with his rifle. The shot was the first to be fired by the United States at the Germans after war had been declared. A similar incident occurred in 1915 at [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] in the [[Caribbean]], America's very first shot was fired, at a different German auxiliary cruiser which was also interned in a neutral American port. Despite the warning shot, which alarmed the Germans, the scuttling continued but at a faster pace. The Germans finished setting their explosives and they began to evacuate. The ''Cormoran'' exploded and sank to the bottom of the harbor where she remains today. USS ''Supply'' quickly became a hospital ship when she came to the aid of the German lifeboats.

Accounts of the event differ but what is known is that nine Germans were killed while scuttling the ''Cormoran'', either by the explosion which crippled the ship or by the American marines who did not want the ''Cormoran'' sunk. The rest of the German crew were captured by the Americans and the dead were buried on Guam with full military honors. The prisoners were sent to various American [[fort]]s until finally being released after World War I in 1919.

SMS ''Cormoran'' rests 110 feet (34 m) below the water of Apra harbor on her port side. A [[Japan]]ese cargo ship, the ''[[Tokai Maru]]'', which was sunk during [[World War II]] leans up against her screw. Together the ships are one of the few places where a diver can visit a sunken vessel of World War I next to a sunken vessel of World War II. The shipwreck was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975 due to its association with the First World War.

'''Social video marketing''' is a component of an integrated [[marketing communications]] plan designed to increase audience engagement through social activity around a given video. In a successful social video marketing campaign, the content, distribution strategy and consumer self-expression tools combine to allow an individual to “add their voice” or co-create value to a piece of content - then further propagating it out to their social circles. Social video typically benefits from a [[halo effect]] cast by the "[[Social influence|influence]]rs” of a given [[social group]]ing. Social video marketing draws on [[Consumer culture|consumer-culture theory]], [[economic theory]], and [[social theory]] around the [[Sharing|psychology of sharing]]. Social video marketing differs from [[social marketing]], which has the intent of influencing behavior for a social good.

Media publishers and content rights holders create social videos from TV, live video feeds and pre-recorded content in order to generate engagement on social platforms and drive media distribution.&lt;ref name=Farber&gt;{{cite news|author=Farber, Alex|date=February 18, 2014|title=Twitter to offer near-live Brits clips|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multiplatform/twitter-to-offer-near-live-brits-clips/5067831.article|work=Broadcast|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use [[real-time video editing]] software to instantly create and share social videos in native formats such as [[vertical video]] for [[Snapchat]] and square video for [[Instagram]].

==Distinguished from viral video marketing==

Social video marketing is also distinct from [[viral marketing]] which is more closely aligned with the self-replicating nature of both “memorable and sufficiently” interesting content. In contrast to [[viral video]] where success is typically measured solely on the pass-along rate or the number of impressions, social video hinges upon leveraging a deeper more [[contextualism|contextual]] relationship between sharer and recipient.

Social videos tends to be passed along because of a shared interest or a sense of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] between sender and recipient(s). Social videos attract conversation in either a one-to-one or a one-many relationship, with the comments and interactions becoming cumulative, rather than moving in a one-way trajectory, as in the case of a viral video.

==Theories on social video and sharing==

===Historical context===

Conditions which have made the market conducive to the rise of social video marketing:

* [[Moore's law|Falling cost of technology]]
* Cameras' ubiquity
* Increase of bandwidth and consumer access
* Computer speed/RAM
* Desktop publishing
* [[Social networking service|Rise of social networking sites]]

===Usage of the term===
ReelSEO mentions “social video marketing” frequently and has been using the term since at least 2010. “Social Video Marketing” as a term has also been championed by Internet entrepreneur Shawn Hopwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Social Video Era|url=http://scenechat.com/blog/hopwood-blog/|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
In a 2011 study published in [[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]], a journal of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], Jonah Berger found that subjects the sharing of stories or information may be driven in part by arousal. When people are physiologically aroused, whether due to emotional stimuli or otherwise, the autonomic nervous is activated, which then boosts social transmission. Simply put, evoking certain emotions can help increase the chance a message is shared.

“In a prior paper, we found that emotion plays a big role in which New York Times articles make the most emailed list. But interestingly, we found that while articles evoking more positive emotions were generally more viral, some negative emotions like [[anxiety]] and [[anger]] actually increased transmission while others like sadness decreased it. In trying to understand why, it seemed like arousal might be a key factor,” says Berger,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Identity Signaling with Social Capital: A Model of Symbolic Consumption|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Identity%20Signaling%20with%20Social%20Capital%20w%20names.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Joseph G. Campbell Jr. Assistant Professor of Marketing at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In the study, Berger suggests that feeling fearful, angry, or amused drives people to share news and information. These types of emotions are characterized by high arousal and action, as opposed to emotions like sadness or contentment, which are characterized by low arousal or inaction. “If something makes you angry as opposed to sad, for example, you’re more likely to share it with your family and friends because you’re fired up,” continues Berger.

More recent video marketing statistics show that 55% of an online audience watch at least one video per day and that 86% of the total video viewers are between the ages of 18-26. This clearly indicates that millennials are watching a lot of video content. In addition to that, the younger age group is more inclined to conduct transactions online which is an added advantage for most of the businesses as they are able to market in front of the decision makers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Marketing Statistics of 2018|url=https://www.zutmedia.com/video-marketing-statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2936">The term '''standard day''' is used throughout [[meteorology]], [[aviation]], and other sciences and disciplines as a way of defining certain properties of the [[atmosphere]] in a manner which allows those who use our atmosphere to effectively calculate and communicate its properties at any given time.  For example, a temperature deviation of +8&amp;nbsp;°C means that the air at any given altitude is 8&amp;nbsp;°C  (14&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than what standard day conditions and the measurement altitude would predict, and would indicate a higher [[density altitude]].  These variations are extremely important to both meteorologists and aviators, as they strongly determine the different properties of the atmosphere.

For example, on a cool day, an airliner might have no problem safely departing a medium length runway, but on a warmer day, the density altitude might be higher, require a higher speed [[ground speed and true airspeed]] prior to liftoff, which would require more acceleration, a longer runway, and a reduced climb rate after liftoff.  The pilot may choose to reduce the gross weight of the aircraft by carrying less fuel or reducing the amount/weight of the cargo, or even reducing the number of passengers (usually the last option).  Not carrying sufficient fuel to complete the flight to the destination, the pilot would plan an intermediate fuel stop, which would likely delay the final destination arrival time.  In meteorology, departure from standard day conditions is what gives rise to all weather phenomena, including [[thunderstorm]]s, fronts, clouds, even the heating and cooling of our planet.

==Standard day parameters==
For Pilots: At sea level, Altimeter:29.92 in/Hg at {{convert|15|°C}}
The "standard day" model of the atmosphere is defined at sea level, with certain present conditions such as temperature and pressure.  But other factors, such as humidity, further alter the nature of the atmosphere, and are also defined under standard day conditions:

* [[Density]] (''ρ''):  1.225&amp;nbsp;kg/m³  (0.00237 [[Slug (unit)|slug]]/ft³)
* [[Pressure]] (''p''):  1013.25 [[Hectopascal|hPa]] (14.7&amp;nbsp;lb/ in²)
* [[Temperature]] (''T''):  15&amp;nbsp;°C  (59&amp;nbsp;°F)
* [[Viscosity]] (''μ''):  17.3 [[Pascal second|µPa·s]] (3.62 &amp;times; 10⁻⁷ lb s/ft²)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/airprop.html NASA:  Standard Day Conditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three properties are usually referred as "standard day" conditions, which the viscosity aspect is largely ignored throughout the aviation community.  However, viscosity, which is affected by humidity levels, plays a key role in aerodynamic drag, which is why it is a key component of standard day conditions.  Because it is a key component of drag, it affects the amount of fuel burned per unit of distance travelled.

This '''Timeline of heat engine technology''' describes how [[heat engine]]s have been known since antiquity but have been made into increasingly useful devices since the 17th century as a better understanding of the processes involved was gained. They continue to be developed today.

In [[engineering]] and [[thermodynamics]], a heat engine performs the conversion of [[heat]] [[energy]] to [[mechanical work]] by exploiting the [[temperature]] gradient between a hot "source" and a cold "[[sink]]". Heat is [[heat transfer|transferred]] to the sink from the source, and in this process some of the heat is converted into [[energy|work]].

A [[heat pump]] is a heat engine run in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. The timeline includes devices classed as both engines and pumps, as well as identifying significant leaps in human understanding.

The necklace of Lord [[Vishnu]] is crucial to the revelation of [[Vaikunta|Vaikuntha]].  Considering Vaijayanthi as a living entity, and assuming relation through feminine genotype, she is the representation of absolute supercontrollership on context of civilization.  Her mood transcends the need to magistrate, for she fascinates the applicant civilian from his or her relatively distracting wizardry or witchcraft into a more peaceful cooperativity by reflecting glory through strength absolute.

According to her tradition, which is [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] (of India), she prominently displays five precious gemstones:  emerald, sapphire, ruby, pearl and diamond.  These correspond with the five classic elements commonly named earth, water, fire, air and ether respectively.&lt;ref name="Ravi"/&gt; Her name, Vaijayanthi, means “triumphant victory.”

He developed the [[Refal programming language]], the theory of [[metasystem transition]]s and the notion of [[supercompilation]]. He was as a pioneer in [[Artificial Intelligence]] and a proponent of the [[global brain]] hypothesis.

==Biography==
Turchin was born in 1931 in [[Podolsk]], [[Soviet Union]]. In 1952, he graduated from Moscow University in Theoretical Physics, and got his Ph.D. in 1957. After working on neutron and solid-state physics at the Institute for Physics of Energy in Obninsk, in 1964 he accepted a position at the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] in [[Moscow]]. There he worked in statistical regularization methods and authored REFAL, one of the first AI languages and the AI language of choice in the Soviet Union.

In the 1960s, Turchin became politically active. In Fall 1968, he wrote the pamphlet ''The Inertia of Fear'', which was
quite widely circulated in [[samizdat]], the writing began to be circulated under the title ''The Inertia of Fear: Socialism and Totalitarianism'' in Moscow from 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sandzdat News|journal=[[A Chronicle of Current Events]]|date=1979|issue=40-42|page=270|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/eur460221979eng.pdf|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its publication in the underground press, he lost his research laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Science|author=Valentin F. Turchin|pages=11|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|date=1977|isbn=978-0-231-03983-3|url=http://pcp.vub.ac.be/POSBOOK.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 he authored "The Phenomenon of Science",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Science|author=Valentin F. Turchin|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|date=1977|isbn=978-0-231-03983-3|url=http://pcp.vub.ac.be/POSBOOK.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grand cybernetic meta-theory of universal evolution, which broadened and deepened the earlier book. By 1973, Turchin had founded the Moscow chapter of [[Amnesty International]] with [[Andrey Tverdokhlebov]] and was working closely with the well-known physicist and Soviet dissident [[Andrei Sakharov]]. In 1974 he lost his position at the Institute, and was persecuted by the [[KGB]]. Facing almost certain imprisonment, he and his family were forced to emigrate from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1977.

He went to New York, where he joined the faculty of the [[City University of New York]] in 1979. In 1990, together with [[Cliff Joslyn]] and [[Francis Heylighen]], he founded the [[Principia Cybernetica Project]], a worldwide organization devoted to the collaborative development of an evolutionary-cybernetic philosophy. In 1998, he co-founded the software start-up SuperCompilers, LLC. He retired from his post of Professor of Computer Science at [[City College of New York|City College]] in 1999. A resident of [[Oakland, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Andrew]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/05/world/for-the-soviet-emigres-gorbachev-stirs-both-optimism-and-skepticism.html?pagewanted=all  "For the Soviet Emigres, Gorbachev Stirs Both Optimism and Skepticism"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 5, 1987. Accessed May 25, 2016. "Valentin Turchin, who teaches computer sciences at the City College of New York and lives in Oakland, N.J., said: 'Both sides of Gorbachev's new era must be stressed. What he says is significant and unprecedented, but at the same time, it should be seen only as a beginning. In addition, we generally have the impression that during the last months, things have started curving down.'"&lt;/ref&gt; he died there on 7 April 2010.&lt;ref name=Joslyn/&gt;

His son, [[Peter Turchin]], is a specialist in [[population dynamics]] and [[mathematical modeling]] of historical dynamics.

==Work==
The philosophical core of Turchin's scientific work is the concept of the [[metasystem transition]], which denotes the evolutionary process through which higher levels of control emerge in system structure and function.

Turchin uses this concept to provide a global theory of [[evolution]] and a coherent social systems theory, to develop a complete [[cybernetic]]s philosophical and ethical system, and to build a constructivist foundation for mathematics.

Using the [[REFAL]] language he has implemented a Supercompiler, a unified method for program transformation and optimization based on a metasystem transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Supercompilation: Techniques and results|title=Perspectives of System Informatics|pages=227&amp;ndash;248|author=Valentin F.

[[File:Sampling lava with hammer and bucket.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[volcanologist]] sampling lava using a rock hammer and a bucket of water]]

'''Volcanology''' (also spelled '''vulcanology''') is the study of [[volcano]]es, [[lava]], [[magma]], and related [[geology|geological]], [[geophysical]] and [[geochemistry|geochemical]] phenomena.   The term ''volcanology'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[Vulcan (mythology)|vulcan]]''.  Vulcan was the ancient [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of fire.

A [[volcanologist]] is a [[geologist]] who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes, and their current and historic eruptions. Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, especially active ones, to observe [[volcanic eruption]]s, collect eruptive products including [[tephra]] (such as [[Volcanic ash|ash]] or [[pumice]]), [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[lava]] samples. One major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions; there is currently no accurate way to do this, but predicting eruptions, like predicting earthquakes, could save many lives.

In 1841, the first volcanological observatory, the [[Vesuvius Observatory]], was founded in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vulcani.ingv.it/it/ Vulcani attivi], [[INGV]], accessed 29 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seismic observations are made using [[seismograph]]s deployed near volcanic areas, watching out for increased seismicity during volcanic events, in particular looking for long period harmonic tremors, which signal [[magma]] movement through volcanic conduits.&lt;ref name=Decker&gt;Robert Decker and Barbara Decker, ''Volcanoes,'' 4th ed., W. H. Freeman, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7167-8929-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface [[Deformation Monitoring|deformation monitoring]] includes the use of geodetic techniques such as leveling, tilt, strain, angle and distance measurements through tiltmeters, total stations and EDMs. This also includes [[GNSS|GNSS observations]] and InSAR.&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, B., 2002.

Master's Thesis, Department of Geological Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt; Surface deformation indicates magma upwelling: increased [[Magma supply rate|magma supply]] produces bulges in the volcanic center's surface.

Gas emissions may be monitored with equipment including portable ultra-violet spectrometers (COSPEC, now superseded by the miniDOAS), which analyzes the presence of [[volcanic gas]]es such as [[sulfur dioxide]]; or by infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). Increased gas emissions, and more particularly changes in gas compositions, may signal an impending volcanic eruption.&lt;ref name=Decker/&gt;

Temperature changes are monitored using thermometers and observing changes in thermal properties of volcanic lakes and vents, which may indicate  upcoming activity.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;Peter Francis and Clive Oppenheimer, ''Volcanoes'', Oxford University Press, USA 2003, 2nd ed., {{ISBN|0-19-925469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satellite]]s are widely used to monitor volcanoes, as they allow a large area to be monitored easily.  They can measure the spread of an ash plume, such as the one from [[Eyjafjallajokull]]'s 2010 eruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/iceland-volcano-plume-archive1.html | website = NASA | title = Archive: NASA Observes Ash Plume of Icelandic Volcano | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Other [[Geophysics|geophysical techniques]] (electrical, gravity and magnetic observations) include monitoring fluctuations and sudden change in resistivity, gravity anomalies or magnetic anomaly patterns that may indicate volcano-induced faulting and magma upwelling.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;

[[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphic analyses]] includes analyzing [[tephra]] and lava deposits and dating these to give volcano eruption patterns, with estimated cycles of intense activity and size of eruptions.&lt;ref name=Decker/&gt;

== History ==
Volcanology has an extensive history. The earliest known recording of a volcanic eruption may be on a wall painting dated to about 7,000 BCE found at the [[Neolithic]] site at Çatal Höyük in [[Anatolia]], [[Turkey]]. This painting has been interpreted as a depiction of an erupting volcano, with a cluster of houses below shows a twin peaked volcano in eruption, with a town at its base (though archaeologists now question this interpretation).&lt;ref name=Meece&gt;Meece, Stephanie, (2006)''A bird’s eye view - of a leopard’s spots. The Çatalhöyük ‘map’ and the development of cartographic representation in prehistory'' Anatolian Studies 56:1-16. See http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/195777&lt;/ref&gt; The volcano may be either [[Mount Hasan|Hasan Dağ]], or its smaller neighbour, Melendiz Dağ.&lt;ref name="Ülkekul"&gt;Ülkekul, Cevat, (2005)''Çatalhöyük Şehir Plani: Town Plan of Çatalhöyük'' Dönence, Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greco-Roman philosophy  ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Vesuvius1822scrope.jpg|thumb|Eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] in 1822. The eruption of CE 79 would have appeared very similar.]]
The classical world of Greece and the early [[Roman Empire]] explained volcanoes as sites of various gods. Greeks considered that [[Hephaestus]], the god of fire, sat below the volcano [[Mount Etna|Etna]], forging the weapons of [[Zeus]]. The Greek word used to describe volcanoes was ''etna'', or ''hiera'', after [[Heracles]], the son of Zeus. The Roman poet [[Virgil]], in interpreting the Greek mythos, held that the giant  [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]] was buried beneath Etna by the goddess Athena as punishment for rebellion against the gods; the mountain's rumblings were his tormented cries, the flames his breath and the tremors his railing against the bars of his prison. Enceladus' brother [[Mimas (Giant)|Mimas]] was buried beneath [[Vesuvius]] by Hephaestus, and the blood of other defeated giants welled up in the Phlegrean Fields surrounding Vesuvius.

The Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] (c. 490-430 BCE) saw the world divided into four elemental forces, of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Volcanoes, Empedocles maintained, were the manifestation of Elemental Fire.  Plato contended that channels of hot and cold waters flow in inexhaustible quantities through subterranean rivers. In the depths of the earth snakes a vast river of fire, the ''Pyriphlegethon'', which feeds all the world's volcanoes. Aristotle considered underground fire as the result of "the...friction of the wind when it plunges into narrow passages."

Wind played a key role in volcano explanations until the 16th century. [[Lucretius]], a Roman philosopher, claimed Etna was completely hollow and the fires of the underground driven by a fierce wind circulating near sea level. Ovid believed that the flame was fed from "fatty foods" and eruptions stopped when the food ran out. [[Vitruvius]] contended that sulfur, alum and bitumen fed the deep fires. Observations by [[Pliny the Elder]] noted the presence of earthquakes preceded an eruption; he died in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in 79 CE while investigating it at [[Stabiae]]. His nephew, [[Pliny the Younger]] gave detailed descriptions of the eruption in which his uncle died, attributing his death to the effects of toxic gases. Such eruptions have been named [[Plinian]] in honour of the two authors.

=== Renaissance observations ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
''[[Pyroclastic flow|Nuées ardentes]]'' were described from the Azores in 1580. [[Georgius Agricola]] argued the rays of the sun, as later proposed by [[Descartes]] had nothing to do with volcanoes. Agricola believed vapor under pressure caused eruptions of 'mointain oil' and basalt.

Jesuit [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680) witnessed eruptions of Mount Etna and Stromboli, then visited the crater of Vesuvius and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur, bitumen and coal.

[[Johannes Kepler]] considered volcanoes as conduits for the tears and excrement of the Earth, voiding bitumen, tar and sulfur. Descartes, pronouncing that God had created the Earth in an instant, declared he had done so in three layers; the fiery depths, a layer of water, and the air. Volcanoes, he said, were formed where the rays of the sun pierced the earth.

Science wrestled with the ideas of the combustion of [[pyrite]] with water, that rock was solidified bitumen, and with notions of rock being formed from water ([[Neptunism]]). Of the volcanoes then known, all were near the water, hence the action of the sea upon the land was used to explain [[volcanism]].

=== Interaction with religion and mythology ===
[[File:peleshair on antenna.jpg|thumb|Pele's hair caught on a radio antenna mounted on the south rim of [[Puʻu ʻŌʻō|Pu{{okina}}u {{okina}}Ō{{okina}}ō]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], July 22, 2005]]

Tribal legends of [[volcano]]es abound from the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and the Americas, usually invoking the forces of the supernatural or the divine to explain the violent outbursts of volcanoes. [[Mount Taranaki/Egmont|Taranaki]] and [[Tongariro]], according to Māori mythology, were lovers who fell in love with [[Pihanga]], and a spiteful jealous fight ensued. Māori will not to this day live between Tongariro and Taranaki for fear of the dispute flaring up again.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the [[Hawaiian religion]], [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] ( {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|eɪ|l|eɪ}} Pel-a; {{IPA-haw|ˈpɛlɛ|}}) is the goddess of volcanoes and a popular figure in [[Hawaiian mythology]].&lt;ref name="Nimmo"&gt;{{cite book | author= H.

A volcano on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] moon [[Io (Moon)|Io]] is also named [[Pele (volcano)|Pele]].&lt;ref name=Radebaugh2004&gt;{{cite journal | last=Radebaugh |first=J. |display-authors=etal |title=Observations and temperatures of Io’s Pele Patera from Cassini and Galileo spacecraft images |journal=Icarus |volume=169 |pages=65–79 |date=2004 |doi =10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.019 |bibcode=2004Icar..169...65R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Agatha]] is patron saint of [[Catania]], close to mount Etna, and an important highly venerated (till today&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1282 Foley O.F.M., Leonard.

Etna was attributed to her intercession. Catania was however nearly completely destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Etna in 1169, and over 15,000 of its inhabitants died. Nevertheless, she was invoked again 1669 and, for an outbreak danginering [[Nicolosi]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Volcanoes: Crucibles of Change Richard V. Fisher, Grant Heiken, Jeffrey B. Hulen Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The way she is invoked and dealt with in Italian [[Folk religion]], a sort of quid pro quo way approach to saints, has been related (in the tradition of [[James Frazer]]) to earlier pagan believes.&lt;ref&gt;''Festa: Recipes and Recollections of Italian Holidays'' Helen Barolini Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1660 the eruption of Vesuvius rained [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] [[pyroxene]] crystals and ash upon the nearby villages. The crystals resembled the crucifix and this was interpreted as the work of [[Saint Januarius]]. In [[Naples]], the relics of St Januarius are paraded through town at every major eruption of Vesuvius. The register of these processions and the 1779 and 1794 diary of Father Antonio Piaggio allowed British diplomat and amateur naturalist [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] to provide a detailed chronology and description of Vesuvius' eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/james-hamilton/lure-volcanoes The Lure of Volcanoes] [http://www.historytoday.com/author/james-hamilton James Hamilton] [http://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-today/latest History Today] [http://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-today/volume-60-issue-7-july-2010 Volume 60 Issue 7 July 2010 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evariste-Vital Luminais - Fuite de Gradlon.jpg|thumb|right|''Flight of King Gradlon'', by [[Évariste Vital Luminais|E. V. Luminais]], 1884 (Musée des Beaux-Arts, [[Quimper]])]]
'''Ys''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|s}} {{respell|EESS|'}}), also spelled '''Is''' or '''Kêr-Is''' in [[Breton language|Breton]] (''kêr'' is the Breton word for "city", see [[caer]]), and '''Ville d'Ys''' in [[French language|French]], is a [[List of mythological places|mythical city]] that was built on the coast of [[Brittany]] and later swallowed by the ocean.  Most versions of the legend place the city in the [[Baie de Douarnenez]].&lt;ref name="breton_tradition"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doan|first1=James|title=The Legend of the Sunken City in Welsh and Breton Tradition|journal=Folklore|date=1981|volume=92|issue=1|pages=77–83|jstor=1260254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The legend ==
Ys was built on land reclaimed from the sea&lt;ref name="breton_tradition" /&gt; by [[Gradlon]] (Gralon in [[Breton language|Breton]]), King of [[Cornouaille]] (Kerne in Breton), upon the request of his daughter [[Dahut]] (also called Ahes),&lt;ref name="women_celts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markale|first1=Jean|title=Women of the Celts|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; who loved the sea. To protect Ys from inundation, a [[Dike (construction)|dike]] was built with a gate that was opened for ships during low tide. The one key that opened the gate was held by the king.&lt;ref name="romances"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=Lewis|title=Legends &amp; Romances of Brittany|date=1917|page=184|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30871/30871-h/30871-h.htm#page_184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ys is described as a city rich in commerce and the arts, with Gradlon's palace being made of marble, cedar and gold.&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt;

Other versions of the legend tell that Ys was founded more than 2,000 years before Gradlon's reign in a then-dry location off the current coast of the Bay of Douarnenez, but the Breton coast had slowly given way to the sea so that Ys was under it at each high tide when Gradlon's reign began.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Most versions of the legend present Gradlon as a pious man with a wayward daughter, princess Dahut, who "had made a crown of her vices and taken for her pages the [[Seven deadly sins|seven capital sins]]."&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt;
Princess Dahut had a lover for whom she threw a secret banquet and, under the influence of wine, she stole the key to the gate from her father and opened the gate, and the water submerged the entire city.&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt; Another version of the legend says that she stole the silver key to admit her lover, mistakenly opening the sluices in the dark.&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt;

[[Winwaloe|St Gwénnolé]], who, according to one version, had foretold the city's ruin due to its luxury, woke the king and commanded him to flee. He mounted his horse and took his daughter with him. As the water was about to overtake him, a voice called out: "Throw the demon thou carriest into the sea, if thou dost not desire to perish." Dahut fell from the horse's back, and Gradlon was saved.&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt;

Though this is the most common version, there is an ancient ballad that blames Gradlon himself for leading his people to extravagances of every kind and says that Dahut received the key from him.&lt;ref name="romances" /&gt;

===The devil as Dahut's lover===

Another version of the legend directly identifies Dahut's lover with the devil. Ys was the most beautiful and impressive city in Europe, but quickly became a city of sin under the influence of Dahut. She organized [[orgy|orgies]] and had the habit of killing her lovers when morning broke. [[Winwaloe|Saint Winwaloe]] decried the corruption of Ys and warned of God's wrath and punishment, but was ignored by Dahut and the populace.

One day, a knight dressed in red came to Ys. Dahut asked him to come with her, and one night, he agreed. A storm broke out in the middle of the night and the waves could be heard smashing against the gate and the bronze walls. Dahut said to the knight: "Let the storm rage.  The gates of the city are strong, and it is King Gradlon, my father, who owns the only key, attached to his neck." The knight replied: "Your father the king sleeps. You can now easily take his key." Dahut stole the key from her father and gave it to the knight, who was none other than the [[Satan|devil]]. The devil then opened the gate.

Because the gate was open during storm and at high tide, a wave as high as a mountain collapsed on Ys. King Gradlon and his daughter climbed on Morvarc'h, his magical horse. Saint Winwaloe approached them and told Gradlon: "Push back the demon sitting behind you!" Gradlon initially refused, but he finally gave in and pushed his daughter into the sea. The sea swallowed Dahut, who became a mermaid or [[Morgen (mythological creature)|morgen]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Gradlon took refuge in [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]], which became his new capital. An [[equestrian statue]] of Gradlon still stands between the spires of the Cathedral of Saint Corentin in Quimper. Folklore asserts that the bells of the churches of Ys can still be heard in the calm sea. A legend says that when [[Paris]] is swallowed, the city of Ys will rise up from under the waves: ''{{lang|br|Pa vo beuzet Paris, Ec'h adsavo Ker Is}}''  (''Par-Is'' meaning "similar to Ys" in Breton).{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Interpretation==
This history is also sometimes viewed as the victory of [[Christianity]] over [[druidism]], as Gradlon was converted by Saint Winwaloe. Dahut and most inhabitants of Ys were worshippers of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic gods]]. However, another Breton folktale asserts that Gradlon met, spoke with and consoled the last [[Druid]] in [[Brittany]], and oversaw his pagan burial, before building a chapel in his sacred grove.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Development of the legend==
While legends and literature about Gradlon are much older, such as the ''[[Graelent|Lai de Graelent]]'' by [[Marie de France]] probably written in the late 12th century, the story of Ys appears to have developed between the end of the fifteenth century and the seventeenth century. An early mention of Ys appears in [[Pierre Le Baud]]'s ''Cronicques et ystoires des Bretons'' in which Gradlon is the king of the city, but Dahut is not mentioned. Bernard d'Argentre's ''La histoire de Bretagne'' and mystery plays on the life of [[St. Winwaloe]], in the sixteenth century, also provide early references to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Guyot, Charles; translated by Deirdre Cavanagh. The Legend of the City of Ys. Amherst, Mass.: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The version of the story of Ys which appears in Albert Le Grand's ''Vie des Saincts de la Bretagne Armorique'' published in the seventeenth century already contains all the basic elements of the later story&lt;ref&gt;Amy Varin, "Dahut and Gradlon", ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', Vol. 2, (1982), pp. 19–30.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been said to be the first.&lt;ref name="breton_tradition" /&gt;

The legend of Ys was confined to the folk of Brittany until 1839, when [[T. Hersart de la Villemarqué]] published a collection of popular songs collected from [[oral tradition]], the ''[[Barzaz Breizh]]''. The collection achieved a wide distribution and brought Breton folk culture into European awareness. In the second edition, the poem "Livaden Geris" ("The Submersion of Ker-Is") appeared. The same basic story elements are present, but in this version the holy man is instead [[Corentin of Quimper|St. Corentin]].

It appears that elements of the text of this version were adapted from the medieval Welsh poem "Seithennin" about the legend of [[Cantre'r Gwaelod]], a very similar Welsh legend about a land that disappeared beneath the ocean as a result of human error. In this version, Dahut steals the key at the incitement of a lover. Also, here the element of Dahut as a mermaid or [[Morgen (mythological creature)|morgen]] has appeared as the last verses of the song refer to a fisherman seeing a mermaid combing her hair and singing a sad song.

[[Emile Souvestre]]'s ''[[Le Foyer breton]]'' also played a great part in making the legend widely known, and many 19th century English tellings of the story are closely derived from the ''Foyer Breton'''s tale "Keris".  In Souvestre's telling, the character of the Devil disguised as a man with a red beard has appeared.&lt;ref name="breton_tradition" /&gt;

==Adaptations in the arts==
[[File:Le Roi d'Ys Poster.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|Poster for [[Édouard Lalo]]'s 1888 opera, ''[[Le roi d'Ys]]'']]
Several famous artistic adaptations of the Ys legend appeared in the late 19th and early 20th century.
[[E. V. Luminais]]' painting ''Flight of King Gradlon'', depicting Gradlon's escape from Ys, scored a success at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1884.

''[[Le roi d'Ys]]'', an opera by the [[Chronological list of French classical composers|French composer]] [[Édouard Lalo]] which premiered in 1888, transforms the story significantly, replacing the figure of Dahut with Margared, whose motive for opening the gates (with the aid of her own betrothed Karnac) is her jealousy at her sister Rozenn's marriage to Mylio (characters who are also inventions of Lalo).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Huebner, ''French Opera at the Fin De Siècle'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518954-4}}; p. 238–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also inspired by the story of Ys is [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La cathédrale engloutie]]'', found in his first book of ''[[Preludes (Debussy)|Preludes]]'' (published 1910). This is a [[prelude (music)|prelude]] intended to evoke the atmosphere of the legend by its sound.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lederer. ''Debussy: a listener's guide''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-57467-153-7}}; p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is also an element in [[Alexander Blok]]'s 1912 verse drama ''The Rose and the Cross''.

The city of Ys and the character Dahut feature prominently in the 1934 novel ''Creep, Shadow!'' by [[A. Merritt]].

[[Poul Anderson]] and his wife [[Karen Anderson (writer)|Karen Anderson]] retold the story in the tetralogy ''The King of Ys'' in the 1980s. They pictured Gradlon as a Roman soldier named Gratillonius.

The name Dahut and certain thematic elements of the story of Ys can be found in the survival/exploration noir game ''[[Sunless Sea]]''.

''[[The King in Yellow]]'' by [[Robert W. Chambers]] contains the story "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]".

[[Alan Stivell]]'s renowned album "[[Renaissance of the Celtic Harp]]" opens with a track entitled "Ys".

The '''Zoigê Marsh''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|若|尔|盖|湿|地}}|p={{linktext|Ruò|ěr|gài| Shī|dì}}}}), also known as the '''Ruoergai Marsh''' or the '''Songpan Grasslands''', is located in the eastern part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and forms the largest high-altitude marsh area in the world.&lt;ref name=Xiang2009&gt;Shuang Xiang, Ruqing Guo, Ning Wu, Shucun Sun, Current status and future prospects of Zoige Marsh in Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Ecological Engineering 35: 553-562&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location==
The marsh areas are mainly located in northern [[Sichuan]] Province, but extend into southern [[Gansu]] and southeastern [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref name=lakesandwetlands2011&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=StCGBdKR4qgC&amp;pg=PA176 Britannica Educational Publishing, Lakes and Wetlands, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The marshes are formed in a region of poor drainage that is located between the watersheds of the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and [[Yangtze River]]s. The marshes are located at an altitude of about 3,600&amp;nbsp;meters above sea level and cover an area of about 2,600 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=lakesandwetlands2011/&gt; To east, they are bordered by the [[Min Mountains]] and to the west by the [[Amne Machin]] mountain range.&lt;ref name=lakesandwetlands2011/&gt; 

==Geology==
The marshes can be divided into four geomorphological regions: the Zoigê plateau plain, the Hong Yuan plateau mound, the A Ba plateau mountain, and the Songpan-Lixan Alp.&lt;ref name=Xiang2009/&gt; The soil of the marshes contains a layer of [[peat]] that is about 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;meters thick in most places, but can reach up to 7&amp;nbsp;meters in thickness.&lt;ref name=lakesandwetlands2011/&gt; 

==History==
[[File:若尔盖草原风情2.JPG|thumb|Yak graze on the Zoigê Grassland.]]
The [[Long March]] passed through the Zoigê Marsh in August 1935. The marshes were partially drained for grazing of cattle, sheep, and horses in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=lakesandwetlands2011/&gt; This involved digging 200 km of ditches to drain 1,400 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of marshland. The project continued until the 1990s and exacerbated [[Environmental issues in China#Desertification|desertification problems]].&lt;ref name=feng&gt;{{cite web | title=Yaks unleashed in fight against desertification | author-last=Feng |author-first=Hao | url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/10070-Yaks-unleashed-in-fight-against-desertification | date=14 September 2017 | access-date=27 September 2017 | website=China Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herders reported that gold miners have also used [[Cloud seeding|cloud-seeding cannons]] to prevent rainfall, which has caused die-offs in vegetation.&lt;ref name=feng/&gt;

In 1994, a nature preserve was established in the marshes. From 2010, community efforts to replant local grasses have been underway, with light grazing by [[yak]] allowed, so that the animals can tread the seeds down and stimulate regrowth.&lt;ref name=feng/&gt;
