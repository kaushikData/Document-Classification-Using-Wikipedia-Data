'''"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"''' ({{zh|c=千里之行，始於足下|s=|t=|p=Qiānlǐ zhī xíng, shǐyú zú xià|l=A journey of a thousand Chinese miles (''[[li (unit)|li]]'') starts beneath one's feet|labels=|links=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step|first=}}) is a common saying that originated from a famous [[Chinese language|Chinese]] proverb. The quotation is from Chapter 64 of the [[Tao Te Ching]] ascribed to [[Laozi]], although it is also erroneously ascribed to his contemporary, [[Confucius]]. This saying teaches that even the longest and most difficult ventures have a starting point; something which begins with one first step.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2370">In the [[Grimoirium Verum]], '''Agaliarept''' is purported to be one of two [[demon]]s directly under [[Lucifer]]; [[Satanachia]] being the other.  The Grimoirium Verum also states that Agalierept and ''Tarihimal'' are the rulers of ''Elelogap'', who in turn governs matters connected with water.  The [[Grand Grimoire]] holds that Agaliarept is a general with the power to uncover secrets and reveal mysteries, and commands the second legion (including [[Buer (demon)|Guer]], [[Gusion|Gusoyn]], and [[Botis|Boris]]).

==Modern fiction and games==
Agaliarept is also the name given to the Demon King in two computer games published by [[Level 9 Computing]] in the 1980s as part of their ''Middle Earth'' [[trilogy]]: ''Adventure Quest'' and ''Dungeon Adventure''.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

In the [[MMORPG]] [[Ultima Online]], Agaliarept is one of the names randomly assigned to demons in various dungeons. He is also featured in Wayne Barlowe's novel ''God's Demon''.

The Action-Online-RPG "The Ruins of the Lost Kingdom Online" also has a Boss named Agaliarept (Japanese Katakana:"アガリアレプト") with 2 additional variations with added prefix "Demon-Lord [魔王]" and "Old Devil [老魔]".

Algaliarept (note spelling variation) is the name given to a demon in [[Kim Harrison]]'s [[urban fantasy]] series about Rachel Morgan set in "[[Hollows (series)|The Hollows]]".

In the anime [[Macademi Wasshoi!]], Agaliarept is a highest-rank demon and ironically trying to save the world. He is also a friend of Gabriel, the archangel. She even calls him Aga-rin as a nickname.

In the game [[Lucius II (video game)|Lucius II]], Agaliarept is one of the titles based on your scores that you can get at the end of every level.

== Biography ==

Félix was born in Pedra do Baú and is reported to have died in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Félix served in the army in World War II.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1959 Félix under his pen name '''Dino Krespedon''' published ''Meu Contato com os discos voadores'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=VyKkAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=My+Contact+with+Flying+Saucers My Contact with Flying Saucers]) .&lt;ref name=eccentric/&gt;&lt;ref name=mind/&gt; The book tells the story of his claimed contact with a [[flying saucer]] commander, at his home. Félix (as Dino Kraspedon) wrote that he gave the [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] visitor was given a lengthy Q&amp;A interview in which the visitor explained advanced concepts in physics and gave insights on how to improve humanity's social conditions on earth. Félix (as Dino Kraspedon), later publicly clarified that he did not witness the male human extraterrestrial leaving or entering any spacecraft.&lt;ref name=reader /&gt; 

Under his pen name Dino '''Kraspedon''', Félix appeared to correctly predict that there would be a period of terrorism. However Félix seems to have been motivated to fulfill his own prediction since a 2018 Brazilian investigative journalism report revealed that in 1967-68 Félix himself was actually leading a group of 14 police officers in a false flag operation committing acts of terrorism in coordination with a general with close ties to Brazil's right wing dictatorship. The terrorist acts included detonating 14 bombs, stealing arms and explosives and robbing a bank. Evidence shows this terrorism was carried out in order to allow the dictatorship a pretense for tightening their repression of Brazilian society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aladino Félix was arrested and charged with terrorism in 1968 and served three years in prison.&lt;ref name="reader" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eccentric" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Turn Off Your Mind |year= |publisher=The Disinformation Company |quote=... as well as a wave of political terrorism in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian Dino Kraspedon, author of My Contact with Flying Saucers (1959), was arrested on ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jfptmqzTzkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA355,M1 |isbn=0-9713942-3-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11980">The '''Archaic Triad''' comprised the original three deities worshipped on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]]: [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]].&lt;ref name="Ryberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryberg |first1=Inez Scott |title=Was the Capitoline Triad Etruscan or Italic? |journal=The American Journal of Philology |date=1931 |pages=145–156 |doi=10.2307/290109 |jstor=290109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This structure was no longer clearly detectable in later times, and only traces of it have been identified from various literary sources and other testimonies. Many scholars dispute the validity of this identification.

==Description==
[[Georg Wissowa]], in his manual of the Roman religion, identified the structure as a triad on the grounds of the existence in Rome of the three ''flamines maiores'', who carry out service to these three gods. He remarked that this triadic structure looks to be predominant in many sacred ''formulae'' which go back to the most ancient period and noted its pivotal role in determining the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ordo sacerdotum|ordo sacerdotum]]'', the hierarchy of dignity of Roman priests: [[Rex Sacrorum]], [[Flamen Dialis]], [[Flamen Martialis]], [[Flamen Quirinalis]] and [[Pontifex Maximus]] in order of decreasing dignity and importance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] s.v. ordo sacerdotum p. 299 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that since such an order no longer reflected the real influence and relationships of power among  priests in the later times, it should have reflected a hierarchy of the earliest phase of Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa cited the following sources as supporting the existence of this ''triad'': Servius ''ad Aeneidem'' VIII 663 on the ritual of the ''[[Salii]]'', priests who use the ''ancilia'' in their ceremonies and are under the tutelage of Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus; Polybius ''Hist.'' III 25, 6 in occasion of a treaty stipulated by the fetials between Rome and Carthage; Livy VIII 9, 6 in the formula of the [[devotio]] of [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Decius Mus]]; Festus s.v. [[spolia opima]], along  with Plutarch ''Marcellus'' 8, Servius ''ad Aeneidem'' VI 860 on the same topic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wissowa identified the presence of such a ''triad'' also in the Umbrian ritual of [[Iguvium]] where only Iove, Marte and Vofionus are granted the epithet of Grabovius and the fact that in Rome the three ''flamines maiores'' are all involved in a peculiar way in the cult of goddess [[Fides (deity)|Fides]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Roemer'' Munich 1912 pp. 23 and 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

However Wissowa did not pursue further the analysis of the meaning and function of the structure (which he called ''Göttersystem'') he had identified.

===Dumézil’s analysis===
[[Georges Dumézil]] in various works, particularly in his ''Archaic Roman  Religion''&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, G. (1966, 1974&amp;nbsp;2nd) ''La religion romaine archaique'', part&amp;nbsp;I, chapters&amp;nbsp;1 &amp; 2. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the hypothesis that this triadic structure was a relic of a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], based on a trifunctional ideology modelled on the division of that archaic society. The highest deity would thus be a heavenly sovereign endowed with religious, magic and legal powers and prerogatives (connected and related to the king and to priestly sacral lore in human society), followed in order of dignity by the deity representing  braveness and military prowess (connected and related to a class of warriors) and lastly a deity representing the common human worldly values of wealth, fertility, and pleasure (connected and related to a class of economic producers). According to the hypothesis, such a tripartite structure must have been common to all [[Indo-European languages|Indoeuropean]] peoples on accounts of its widespread traces in religion and myths from India to Scandinavia, and from Rome to Ireland. However it had disappeared from most societies since prehistoric times, with the notable exception of India.

In [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] the sovereign function was incarnated by [[Dyaus Pita]] and later appeared split into its two aspects of uncanny and awe inspiring almighty power incarnated by [[Varuna]] and of source and guardian of justice and compacts incarnated by [[Mitra]]. [[Indra]] incarnated the military function and the twins [[Ashvins]] (or Nasatya) the function of production, wealth, fertility and pleasure. In human society the [[raja]] and the class of the [[brahmin]] priests represented the first function (and enjoyed the highest dignity), the  warrior class of the [[kshatriya]] represented the second function and the artisan and merchant class of the [[vaishya]] the third.

Similarly in Rome Jupiter was the supreme ruler of the heavens and god of thunder, represented on earth by the ''rex'', king  (later  the ''rex sacrorum'') and his substitute, the Flamen Dialis, the legal aspect of sovereignty being  incarnated also by [[Dius Fidius]], Mars was the god of military prowess and a war deity, represented by his flamen Martialis; and Quirinus the enigmatic god of the Roman ''populus'' ("people") organised in the [[curia]]e as a civilian and productive force, represented by the Flamen Quirinalis.

Apart than from the analysis of the texts already collected by Wissowa, Dumezil stressed the importance of the tripartite  plan of the [[regia]], the cultic centre of Rome and official residence of the rex. As recorded by sources and confirmed by archeological data it was devised to lodge the three major deities Iupiter, Mars, and [[Ops]], the deity of agricultural plenty, in three separate rooms.

The cult of Fides involved the three ''Flamines Maiores'': they were carried to the ''sacellum'' of the deity together in a covered carriage and officiated with their right hand wrapped up to the fingers in a piece of white cloth. The association with the deity that founded divine order (Fides is associated with Iupiter in his function of guardian of the supreme juridical order) underlines the mutual interconnections among them and of the gods they represented with the supreme heavenly order, whose arcane character was  represented symbolically in the  hidden character of the forms of the cult.

The [[spolia opima]] were dedicated by the person who had killed the king or chief of the enemy in battle. They were dedicated to Jupiter in case the Roman was a king or his equivalent (consul, dictator or tribunus militum consulari potestate), to Mars in case he was an officer and to Quirinus in case he was common soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. spolia opima p. 302 L 2nd who has Ianus Quirinus, which let it possible an identification of Quirinus as an epithet of Ianus.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sacrificial animals too were in each case the ones of the respective deity, i. e. an ox to Jupiter, [[Suovetaurilia|''solitaurilia'']] to Mars and a male lamb to Quirinus.

Besides Dumézil analysed the cultural functions of the Flamen Quirinalis to better understand the characters of this deity. One important element was his officiating on the ''feriae'' of the [[Consualia]] ''aestiva'' ( of the Summer), which associated Quirinus to the cult of [[Consus]] and indirectly of [[Ops]] (Ops Consivia). Other feriae on which this flamen officiated were the [[Robigalia]], the [[Quirinus#Festivals|Quirinalia]] that Dumezil identifies with the last day of the [[Fornacalia]], also named ''stultorum feriae'' because on that day the people who had forgot to roast their spelt on the day prescribed by the [[curio maximus]] for their own curia were given a last chance to make amends, and the [[Larentalia]] held in memory of [[Larunda]]. These religious duties show Quirinus was a civil god related to the agricultural cycle and somehow to the worship of Roman ancestry.

In Dumézil's view the figure of Quirinus became blurred and started to be connected to the military sphere because of the early assimilation to him of the divinised Romulus, the warring founder and first king of Rome. A coincident facilitating factor of this interpretation was the circumstance that Romulus carried with himself the quality of twin and Quirinus had a correspondence in the theology of the [[divine twins]] such the Indian [[Ashvins]] and the Scandinavians [[Vani]]. The resulting  interpretation was the mixed civil and military, warring and peaceful personality of the god.

A detailed discussion of the sources is devoted by Dumézil to showing  that they do not support the theory of an agrarian Mars. Mars would be invoked both in the [[Carmen Arvale]] and in Cato's prayer as the guardian, the armed protector of the fields and  the harvest. He is definitely not a deity of agricultural plenty and fertility.

It is also noteworthy that according to tradition Romulus established the double role and duties, civil and military, of the [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]. In this way the relationship between Mars and Quirinus became a dialectic one, since Romans would regularly pass from the warring condition to the civil one and vice versa. In the yearly cycle this passage is marked by the rites of the [[Salii]], they themselves divided into two groups, one devoted to the cult of Mars (Salii Palatini, created by Numa) and the other of Quirinus (Salii Collini, created by Tullus Hostilius).

The ''archaic triad'' in Dumézil's view was not strictly speaking a triad, it was rather a structure underlying  the earliest religious thought of the Romans, a reflection of the common Indoeuropean heritage.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris 1974 part I chapt. 6 end; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

This grouping has been interpreted as a symbolic representation of [[Roman Kingdom|early Roman society]], wherein Jupiter, standing in for the ritual and [[augur]]al authority of the Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter) and the chief priestly colleges, represents the priestly class, Mars, with his warrior and agricultural functions, represents the power of the king and young nobles to bring prosperity and victory through [[sympathetic magic]] with rituals like the [[October Horse]] and the [[Lupercalia]], and Quirinus, with his source as the deified form of Rome's founder [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] and his derivation from ''co-viri'' ("men together") representing the combined military and economic strength of the Roman people.

According to his [[trifunctional hypothesis]], this division symbolizes the overarching societal classes of "priest" (Jupiter), "warrior" (Mars) and "farmer" or "civilian" (Quirinus). Though both Mars and Quirinus each had militaristic and agricultural aspects, leading later scholars to frequently equate the two despite their clear distinction in ancient Roman writings, Dumézil argued that Mars represented the Roman [[gentry]] in their service as soldiers, while Quirinus represented them in their civilian activities. Although such a distinction is implied in a few Roman passages, such as when [[Julius Caesar]] scornfully calls his soldiers ''[[quirites]]'' ("citizens") rather than ''[[military history of ancient Rome|milites]]'' ("soldiers"), the word ''quirites'' had by this time been dissociated with the god Quirinus, and it is likely that Quirinus initially had an even more militaristic aspect than Mars,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} but that over time Mars, partially through synthesis with the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Ares]], became more warlike, while Quirinus became more domestic in connotation. Resolving these inconsistencies and complications is difficult chiefly because of the ambiguous and obscure nature of Quirinus' cult and worship; while Mars and Jupiter remained the most popular of all Roman gods, Quirinus was a more archaic and opaque deity, diminishing in importance over time.

'''Bon''', also spelled '''Bön'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism |last=Keown |first=Damien |authorlink=Damien Keown |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=0-19-860560-9 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQoszLjWBkC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=B%C3%B6n&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=anG5TvW7DMPptgeR78C3Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=B%C3%B6n&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bo|t=བོན་|w=bon|l=pʰø̃̀|}}), is a [[Tibet]]an [[religion]]. Although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology as [[Tibetan Buddhism]], its followers consider Bon a separate religion. According to traditional Bon beliefs and legends, the religion predates the arrival of [[Buddhism]] in Tibet, however in reality it arose in the eleventh century alongside the revival of Buddhism. According to Sam Van Schaik, "in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion."&lt;ref name="Schaik"/&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam van Schaik]] describes "In fact, the Bonpo religion only started to take shape alongside the revival of Buddhism in the eleventh century." - ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scriptures are derived primarily from [[terma (religion)|termas]] (hidden teachings) and visions by [[tertön]]s (discoverers of hidden teachings) such as Loden Nyingpo.&lt;ref name="Schaik"&gt;Van Schaik, Sam. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, pages 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of Bon==
As Bon only arose in the eleventh century through the work of tertöns, [[Sam van Schaik]] states it is improper to refer to the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet as Bon:

{{quote|Though some people call the old pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet "Bon", it is unlikely that before Buddhism the Tibetans had a clear sense of practising a religion as such, or a specific name for these practices. In fact, the Bonpo religion only started to take shape alongside the revival of Buddhism in the eleventh century. And when the scriptures of the Bonpo started to appear in Tibet, it was mainly through the work of tertöns.&lt;ref name="Schaik"/&gt;}}

==History==

===Foundation===
Three Bon scriptures—''mdo &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;dus'', ''gzer mig'', and ''gzi brjid''—relate the mythos of [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche]]. The Bonpos regard the first two as ''[[terma (religion)|gter ma]]'' rediscovered around the tenth and eleventh centuries and the last as ''nyan brgyud'' (oral transmission) dictated by Loden Nyingpo, who lived in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samten Karmay|Karmay, Samten G]]. ''A General Introduction to the History and Doctrines of Bon'', ''The Arrow and the Spindle''. Kathmandu: Mandala Book Point. pp. 108–113. [originally published in ''Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko'', No. 33. Tokyo, 1975.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a terma known as ''The Brilliance'' ({{bo|w=gzi brjid}}), which contained the story of Tonpa Shenrab. He was not the first Bonpo [[tertön]], but his terma became one of the definitive scriptures of Bon religion.&lt;ref name="Schaik"/&gt; It states that Shenrab&lt;!--dates of birth/death and/or era flourished in?--&gt; established the Bon religion while searching for a horse stolen by a demon. Tradition also tells that he was born in the land of [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring]] (considered{{by whom|date=March 2013}} an [[axis mundi]]) which is traditionally identified as Mount Yung-drung Gu-tzeg (“Edifice of Nine [[Sauwastika]]s”), possibly [[Mount Kailash]], in western Tibet. Due to the sacredness of Tagzig Olmo Lungting and Mount Kailash, the Bonpo regard both the swastika and the number [[9 (number)|nine]] as auspicious and as of great significance.

Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche visited [[Kongpo]] and found people whose practice involved spiritual appeasement with animal sacrifice. He taught them to substitute offerings with symbolic animal forms made from barley flour. He only taught according to the student's capability with lower shamanic vehicles to prepare; until with prayer, diligence, devotion and application they could incarnate to achieve [[sutra]], [[tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref name=twr&gt;
[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''.  Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications,  2002. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}, pp. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

Bon teachings feature Nine Vehicles, which are pathway-teaching categories with distinct characteristics, views, practices and results. Medicine, astrology, and divination are in the lower vehicles; then sutra and tantra, with Dzogchen great perfection being the highest. Traditionally, the Nine Vehicles are taught in three versions: as Central, Northern and Southern treasures. The Central treasure is closest to Nyingma [[Yana (Buddhism)#Nine yānas|Nine Yānas]] teaching and the Northern treasure is lost. [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] elaborated the Southern treasure with shamanism.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

===“A Cavern of Treasures” (mdzod phug)===
“A Cavern of Treasures” ({{bo|t=མཛོད་ཕུག|w=mdzod phug}}) is a Bon [[terma (religion)|terma]] uncovered by Shenchen Luga ({{bo|t=གཤེན་ཆེན་ཀླུ་དགའ|w=gshen chen klu dga'}}) in the early 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berzin|first=Alexander |year=2005|title=The Four Immeasurable Attitudes in Hinayana, Mahayana, and Bon|website= studybuddhism.com |url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-four-immeasurables-in-hinayana-mahayana-and-bon|accessdate= June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin&lt;ref&gt;n.d.: p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the importance of this scripture for studies of the [[Zhang-Zhung language]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For students of Tibetan culture in general, the ''mDzod phug'' is one of the most intriguing of all Bon scriptures, since it is the only lengthy bilingual work in Zhang-zhung and Tibetan. (Some of the shorter but still significant sources for Zhang-zhung are signalled in Orofino 1990.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Dan (n.d.)|title=Comparing Treasuries: Mental states and other ''mdzod phug'' lists and passages with parallels in Abhidharma works of Vasubandhu and Asanga, or in Prajnaparamita Sutras: A progress report|work=University of Jerusalem|url=http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10502/1286/1/SER15_004.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=&lt;!--Mond--&gt; March 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628000301/http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10502/1286/1/SER15_004.pdf|archivedate=June 28, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===18th century===
The [[Dzungar people]] invaded Tibet in 1717 and deposed a pretender to the position of [[Dalai Lama]] who had been promoted by [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhabzang]], the titular King of Tibet. This was met with widespread approval. However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa, which brought a swift response from the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars not far from Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richardson, Hugh E]]. (1984). ''Tibet and its History''. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48–9. Shambhala. Boston &amp; London. {{ISBN|0-87773-376-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. ''Tibetan Civilization''. (1972), p. 85. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Nyingma]]pas and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras, which was said to make the tongue black or brown. This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapas and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Namkhai. (1980). “Bon and Bonpos”. ''Tibetan Review'', December, 1980, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom into modern times.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===19th century===
In the 19th century, [[Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen]], a Bon master whose collected writings comprise eighteen volumes significantly rejuvenated the tradition. His disciple [[Kagya Khyungtrul Jigmey Namkha]] trained many practitioners to be learned in not only the Bon religion, but in all Tibetan schools.

According to the Bonpo, eighteen enlightened entities will manifest in this [[aeon]] and Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche, the founder of Bon, is considered the enlightened [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of this age (compare [[yuga]] and [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]). The 33rd lineage holder of [[Menri Monastery]], Menri Trizin Lungtog Tenpei Nyima and [[Lopön Tenzin Namdak]] are important current lineage holders of Bon.

More than three hundred Bon monasteries had been established in Tibet prior to Chinese annexation. Of these, Menri Monastery and [[Shurishing Yungdrung Dungdrakling Monastery]] were the two principal monastic universities for the study and practice of Bon knowledge and science-arts.

==Geography==
[[Image:Narshi Gonpa Ngawa Sichuan China.jpg|thumb|right|The Bon monastery of [[Nangzhik Gompa]] at [[Ngawa Town]], in [[Sichuan]].]]

Ethnic Tibet is not confined culturally to China's [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The broader area of ethnic Tibet also includes, to the east and north, parts of the Chinese provinces of [[Sichuan]], [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]] and [[Yunnan]] and the southern [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]]; to the southwest, the Indian territories of [[Ladakh]], [[Lahaul and Spiti district|Lahaul and Spiti]] and the [[Baltistan]] region of Pakistan; the extreme northwest of [[Assam]]; and to the south, [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]], and parts of northern [[Nepal]], such as [[Mustang District|Mustang]] and [[Dolpo]], the regions in northeastern Nepal inhabited by [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] and [[Tamang people]]s, and extreme northern Burma (Myanmar). Even parts of modern Bangladesh were once a part of this "Greater Tibet."

==Gods==
Bonpos cultivate household gods in addition to other deities:{{quote|Traditionally in Tibet divine presences or deities would be incorporated into the very construction of the house making it in effect a castle ([[Dzong architecture|''dzongka'']]) against the malevolent forces outside it. The average Tibetan house would have a number of houses or seats (''poe-khang'') for the male god (''pho-lha'') that protects the house. {{sic|Eve|ryday}} the man of the house would invoke this god and burn juniper wood and leaves to placate him. In addition the woman of the house would also have a protecting deity (''phuk-lha'') whose seat could be found within the kitchen usually at the top of the pole that supported the roof.&lt;ref name=STBud&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhism – Unit One| publisher=Sharpham Trust |accessdate=13 July 2011 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062536/http://www.sharpham-trust.org/centre/Tibetan_unit_01.pdf |page=5 |quote={{Sic|Ev|eryday}} the man of the house would invoke this god and burn juniper wood and leaves to placate him.|url=http://www.sharpham-trust.org/centre/Tibetan_unit_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another set of deities are the White Old Man, a sky god, and his consort. They are known by a few different names, such as the [[Gyalpo Pehar]] called “King Pehar” ({{bo|w=pe har rgyal po}}). Pehar is featured as a protecting deity of [[Zhangzhung]], the center of the Bon religion. Reportedly, Pehar is related to celestial heavens and the sky in general. In early Buddhist times, Pehar transmogrified into a shamanic bird to adapt to the bird motifs of shamanism. Pehar's consort is a female deity known by one of her names as Düza Minkar ({{bo|w=bdud gza smin dkar}}, Stein1954 in Hummel 1962).

[[Image:Tenzin Lopen Namdak.jpg|thumb|[[Lopön Tenzin Namdak]], [[abbot]] of a Bon monastery in [[Nepal]]]]

==Present situation==
According to a recent Chinese census{{When|date=November 2009}}, an estimated 10 percent of Tibetans follow Bon. When [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|Tibet was annexed into the People's Republic of China]], there were approximately 300 Bon monasteries in Tibet and the rest of [[western China]]. According to a recent{{When|date=November 2009}} survey, there are 264 active Bon monasteries, convents, and hermitages.

The present spiritual head of the Bon is [[Lungtok Tenpa'i Nyima]] (1929–2017), the thirty-third Abbot of [[Menri Monastery]] (destroyed in the [[Cultural Revolution]], but now rebuilt), who now presides over [[Pal Shen-ten Menri Ling]] in [[Dolanji]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], India, for the abbacy of which monastery he was selected in 1969.

A number of Bon establishments also exist in [[Nepal]]; [[Triten Norbutse Bonpo Monastery]] is one on the western outskirts of [[Kathmandu]]. Bon's leading monastery is the [[Menri Monastery#Menri Monastery in India|refounded Menri Monastery]] in [[Dolanji]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.

Many Bon elements are in the Hangui (韩规) religion of the [[Pumi people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pumichina.com/pmyj_show.asp?id=58&amp;classid=258&amp;title=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914115046/http://www.pumichina.com/pmyj_show.asp?id=58&amp;classid=258&amp;title=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-14|title=普米韩规古籍调研报告|publisher=Pumichina.com|date=|accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
[[Lobsang Yeshe, 5th Panchen Lama|Lobsang Yeshe]], recognized as the 5th [[Panchen Lama]] by the [[5th Dalai Lama]], was a member of the Dru family, an important family of the Bon religion. Under Lozang Gyatso, Bon became respected both philosophically and politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Karmay|first=Samten G.|title=The Great Fifth|work=International Institute for Asian Studies Newsletter|issue=39|pages=12–13|year=2005|url=http://www.iias.nl/nl/39/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|access-date=2010-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915182901/http://www.iias.nl/nl/39/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf#|archive-date=2013-09-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bonpo remained stigmatized and marginalized until 1977, when they sent representatives to [[Dharamshala]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who advised the [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration]] to accept Bon members.

Since then, Bon has had official recognition of its status as a religious group, with the same rights as the Buddhist schools. This was re-stated in 1987 by the Dalai Lama, who also forbade discrimination against the Bonpos, stating that it was both undemocratic and self-defeating. He even donned Bon ritual paraphernalia, emphasizing "the religious equality of the Bon faith".&lt;ref&gt;Kværne, Per and Rinzin Thargyal. (1993). ''Bon, Buddhism and Democracy: The Building of a Tibetan National Identity'', pp. 45–46. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies. {{ISBN|978-87-87062-25-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tibetans still differentiate between Bon and Buddhism, referring to members of the Nyingma, Shakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools as ''nangpa'', meaning "insiders", but to practitioners of Bon as "Bonpo", or even ''chipa'' ("outsiders").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bon Children's Home In Dolanji and Polish Aid Foundation For Children of Tibet |publisher=Nyatri.org |url=http://nyatri.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=455&amp;Itemid=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonfuturefund.org/wp/about-the-bon/ |title=About the Bon: Bon Culture |publisher=Bonfuturefund.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906172112/http://www.bonfuturefund.org/wp/about-the-bon/ |archivedate=2013-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Flemming''' is an [[United States|American]] film director, playwright and activist. His films include ''[[Hang Your Dog in the Wind]]'', ''[[Nothing So Strange]]'', and ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]''. His musicals include ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'', which won the [[LA Weekly Theater Award]], [[Lucille Lortel Award]], and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]. He advocates for the [[Free culture movement]] and is an outspoken atheist.

== Early career ==

Flemming's first feature film was the low-budget ''[[Hang Your Dog in the Wind]]''. Partly to promote his film, Flemming co-founded a punk film festival in [[Park City, Utah]], called the [[Slumdance Film Festival]], a pun on the name of the [[Slamdance Film Festival]] (which in turn referred to the [[Sundance Film Festival]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-02-02/news/9702020371_1_slumdance-sundance-two-years-mrs-fields-cookies|title=New Kids On The Block|last=Caro|first=Mark|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2 February 1997|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slumdance brought Flemming to the attention of  [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]], who later hired Flemming to work as a director and segment producer for Pierson's [[Independent Film Channel]] magazine-style show called ''Split Screen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-07/news/9911070315_1_independent-film-channel-pierson-reel-drama|title=Reel Drama|last=Caro|first=Mark|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=7 November 1999|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Bat Boy'' ==

After Slumdance, Flemming turned his attention from indie film to theater with ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]''. The stage musical is based on a story about a half-bat half-boy from the tabloid ''[[Weekly World News]]''. Flemming co-wrote ''Bat Boy'' with Keythe Farley and [[Laurence O'Keefe (composer)|Laurence O'Keefe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll, and Musicals|last=Miller|first=Scott|publisher=[[UPNE]]|year=2011|pages=175–203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAKvBAXbdFkC&amp;pg=PA175|isbn=9781555537616}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical grew from a Los Angeles theater to winning the [[LA Weekly Theater Award]] for Musical of the Year Award for 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/1998-04-23/stage/monsters-galore/|title=Monsters Galore|last=Morris|first=Steven Leigh|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=15 April 1998|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus four [[Ovation Award]] nominations and six [[Drama-Logue Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/21/entertainment/ca-53668/2|title=Hit Musical 'Bat Boy,' a Strange Beast, Seemed Unlikely to Fly|last=Pike|first=Laurie|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=21 April 2001|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bat Boy: The Musical'' made its way to a New York production in March 2001, for which the play won the [[Lucille Lortel Award]] for Best Musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/bat-boy-proof-mnemonic-among-winners-of-2001-ob-lortel-awards-ceremony-may-7-com-96208|title=Bat Boy, Proof, Mnemonic Among Winners of 2001 OB Lortel Awards; Ceremony May 7|last=Lefkowitz|first=David|work=[[Playbill]]|date=23 April 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Musical Off-Broadway,&lt;ref name=playbill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/87146-Bat-Boy-to-Fly-Into-Londons-West-End|title=Bat Boy to Fly Into London's West End|last=Inverne|first=James|work=[[Playbill]]|date=2 July 2004|accessdate=24 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325083626/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/87146-Bat-Boy-to-Fly-Into-Londons-West-End|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six Drama Desk nominations.&lt;ref name=playbill/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described ''Bat Boy'' as a "giggling cult hit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lahr |first=John |date=9 April 2001 |title=Bloodsucker’s Ball: Camp, cult, and Complicite |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/04/09/bloodsuckers-ball |magazine=The New Yorker |volume=77 |issue=7 |page=128 |access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It is astonishing what intelligent wit can accomplish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/22/theater/theater-review-who-s-the-guy-who-ordered-the-bloody-mary-on-the-rocks.html|title=THEATER REVIEW; Who's the Guy Who Ordered the Bloody Mary on the Rocks?|last=Weber|first=Bruce |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 March 2001|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical ran in New York through December 2001.

== ''Nothing So Strange'' ==

Flemming released a faux documentary about the assassination of [[Bill Gates]] called ''[[Nothing So Strange]]''.  Bill Gates said through a spokesman that it was "very disappointing that a movie maker would do something like this".&lt;ref name=filmthreat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/635/|title=BRIAN FLEMMING: THE CINEMATIC VAGRANT WHO WOULD BE GOVERNOR|last=Campos|first=Eric|work=[[Film Threat]]|date=5 August 2003|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nothing So Strange'' debuted at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it, "a crackling good movie... [that] may be the ideal prototype film for the digital age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/nothing-so-strange-1200551170/|title=Review: ''Nothing So Strange''|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=24 February 2002|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film won the Claiborne Pell New York Times Award for Original Vision at the 2002 Newport Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/news/1153/|title=''NOTHING SO STRANGE'' IN SAN FRANCISCO|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Film Threat]]|date=13 January 2003|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2003 the film had a simultaneous debut in theaters and as an Internet download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/000428.html|title=Nothing So Strange makes history again: First worldwide int|last=Flemming|first=Brian|work=Slumdance.com|date=23 October 2003|accessdate=24 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127125128/http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/000428.html|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on DVD in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10252/nothing-so-strange/|title=Nothing So Strange|last=Bovberg|first=Jason|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=11 April 2004|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The God Who Wasn't There'' ==
In 2005, Flemming released his third feature-length film, the documentary ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]''. Through interviews with biblical and folklore scholars, Flemming investigates the [[historicity of Jesus|evidence for the existence of Jesus]], concluding that it is highly improbable that the Christian savior ever actually lived. He then discusses the beliefs of conservative [[Christian fundamentalist]]s, Christian moderates (who, he states, simply enable the fundamentalists), and returns to confront the principal of the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as a child. Flemming launched three media campaigns to support his documentary: War on Christmas, War on Easter, and [[Blasphemy Challenge]]. The Blasphemy Challenge was the most successful of the three publicity stunts, gaining coverage by Newsweek, NBC News, Fox News and many other media outlets,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and participation by [[Penn Jillette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2833103|title=The Blasphemy Challenge|last=Berman|first=John|work=[[ABC News]]|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
In addition to working in film and theater, Flemming is an activist on copyright issues. He has released ''Nothing So Strange'' as an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, which means all of the raw footage that makes up the film is released without copyright restrictions for anyone to use. The final cut of the film, however, remains protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Beyond-the-big-coverup-Indie-film-takes-on-2671970.php|title=Beyond the big coverup / Indie film takes on conspiracy theories|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|work=[[SF Gate]]|date=10 February 2003|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flemming founded the organization Free Cinema, which encourages feature filmmakers to create films under two rules:&lt;ref name=filmthreat/&gt;
# No money may be spent on the production, and
# The film must be released under a [[copyleft]] license.

Flemming claims that filmmaking can now be "as inexpensive as writing novels"{{cite quote|date=March 2014}} and that the copylefting practice is a way for new artists to gain notice and distribution in a marketplace dominated by large corporations. Free Cinema was inspired by the [[Free Software Movement]], which is guided by similar principles of freedom. Flemming is also the owner and operator of Fair Use Press, which distributes e-books critical of public figures such as [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] for their stance on [[intellectual property law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/news/1367/|title=BRIAN FLEMMING’S MEDIA ATTACK|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Film Threat]]|date=28 August 2003|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2007 [[Slamdance Film Festival]], Flemming, who had been invited to sit on the festival's documentary jury, saw a demo of the video game [[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]] and hearing about it having its nomination pulled by the festival's founder, convinced fellow jurors to award it a "Special Jury Prize" for Best Documentary (an unofficial award not endorsed by the festival). The festival's founder, Peter Baxter, later told Flemming that legal considerations prevented SCMRPG from receiving the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=31 January 2007|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/31/columbine-game-blocked-from-receiving-slamdance-special-jury-pri/|title=Columbine game blocked from receiving Slamdance special jury prize|work=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] is the country with the largest population of Buddhists, approximately 244 million or 18.2% of its total population.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; They are mostly followers of [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese schools]] of ''[[Mahayana]]'', making this the largest body of Buddhist traditions. Mahayana, also practiced in broader [[East Asia]], is followed by over half of the world's Buddhists.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt;

The second largest body of Buddhist schools is ''[[Theravada]]'', mostly followed in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; The third and smallest body of schools ''[[Vajrayana]]'', is followed mostly in [[Tibet]], the [[Himalayas|Himalayan region]], [[Mongolia]] and parts of [[Russia]],&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; but is disseminated throughout the world.

According to a demographic analysis reported by Peter Harvey (2013):&lt;ref name="Harvey2013"/&gt;
* Eastern Buddhism (''Mahayana'') has 360 million adherents;
* Southern Buddhism (''Theravada'') has 150 million adherents; and
* Northern Buddhism (''Vajrayana'') has 18.2 million adherents.
* Seven million additional Buddhists are found outside Asia.

note : Exact number of followers when calculating Buddhists varies because Buddhism is often mixed with the native East Asian religions in their respective countries. For example, in [[Japan]] the number of Buddhists when calculating including the Shintoists would ramp the percentage of Buddhists in [[Japan]] from 67% to &gt;98%.

'''Charlotte Bergman''' (1903-2002) was born in [[Antwerp]] and was an art collector and philanthropist.

== Biography ==
Charlotte Bergman was born in Antwerp in 1903. She was the daughter of a Polish-born diamond merchant. Charlotte Bergman married Louis Bergman, an English architect with whom she shared a great love of travel and art. They resided in London for many years and traveled to Israel and the Middle East for the first time in the 1920s. They came into contact with many artists, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]] and many others. They were very close to [[Raoul Dufy]], a friend who often joined the couple on their travels. The Bergmans collected examples of Dufy's art, including a portrait he painted of Charlotte. Other artists collected by the couple included [[Braque]] and [[Chagall]], as well as [[:sv:Antal Biró|Antal Biró]].

Charlotte and Louis Bergman found themselves in the [[United States]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. They never returned to live in [[England]]. Charlotte lost many members of her European family during the [[Holocaust]]. In [[New York City]], the Bergmans were involved with the leading events and personalities of the day. Their apartment became a salon for music, art and politics and they became fervent supporters of the [[Zionist movement]] and the nascent [[State of Israel]].

After Louis Bergman died in 1955, Charlotte continued to travel and collect new works of art. She immigrated to Israel following the [[Six-Day War]]. Sharing [[Teddy Kollek]]'s early vision for a national museum in Jerusalem, she was involved in the establishment of the [[Israel Museum]]. She also became an active, though often anonymous, supporter of other philanthropic concerns in the country.

In the 1970s, Charlotte Bergman built her permanent home on the Museum grounds, with the encouragement of Teddy Kollek. Bergman located her collections of art and ethnography there. Just as she did in New York, in Jerusalem, Charlotte hosted may events and welcomed visitors from Israel and abroad to her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/page_548 |title=The Bergman House |publisher=Israel Museum |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2002 - one month before her 99th birthday - Charlotte Bergman died in her bedroom, today  referred to as the Henry Moore room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Silver |title=Life after death for Israel Museum home of the late Charlotte Bergman |newspaper=The Jerusalem Report |date=August 12, 2002 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10028980.html 
|accessdate=July 29, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house and its paintings, sculptures, ceramics and works on paper were bequeathed to the Israel Museum. Charlotte Bergman asked that the house be used as a venue for special events, as it was in her lifetime, and that it be viewed as the home of an art lover at the end of the 20th century, in the spirit of the Israel Museum's period rooms. The legacy of Charlotte Bergman lives on in the house she built on the Israel Museum's grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelincentives.com/israel-incentives/venues/venues-in-jerusalem/the-israel-museum/villa-bergman/ |title=The Israel Museum Bergman Villa |publisher=Eshet Incentives &amp; Conferences in Israel |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Charlotte Bergman house panel|date=2015|publisher=Israel Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dom Christopher Jamison''' [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] is a [[Benedictine]] monk and former [[Abbot]] of [[Worth Abbey]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. He became well-known through the BBC TV series ''[[The Monastery (BBC TV series)|The Monastery]]''. In the summer of 2017, Jamison was appointed Abbot President of the English Benedictine Congregation.

==Early life==
Jamison was born in [[Melbourne]], Australia, in 1951 as one of four siblings whose family moved to [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], while he was a child. He went on to study at [[Downside School]] and later [[Oxford University]] where he attained a [[bachelor's degree]] in French and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benedictine-youth.org/TIBYC_Newspaper_screen.pdf ''The Benedictine Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for 25 years as a teacher. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/christopher-jamison-the-pope-has-a-friend-in-father-christopher-1935431.html The Independent] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Jamison is a former headmaster of [[Worth School|Worth]], a Roman Catholic independent school in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the School|url=http://www.worthschool.co.uk/History-of-the-School|publisher=Worth School|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came into wider public awareness after his appearance in the [[BBC Two]] [[Documentary film|television documentary]], ''[[The Monastery (BBC TV series)|The Monastery]]''. The series charted the trials and tribulations of six men of varying levels of belief over a period of forty days and nights as they attempt to follow the monastic life. He also made the TV documentary ''[[The Big Silence (BBC TV series)|The Big Silence]]'' in 2010, which followed several ordinary people as they explored the value and challenge of silent meditation.

Jamison has written two books: ''Finding Sanctuary: Monastic steps for Everyday Life'' and ''[[Finding Happiness: Monastic Steps For A Fulfilling Life]]'' as well as contributing to many others. He is also the president of the International Conference on Benedictine Education (ICBE) which facilitates dialogue between Benedictine secondary schools across the world.

He currently works as the Director for the National Office of Vocation.

The '''Communist Bund''' (''Kombund'') was a [[Jew]]ish [[Communist]] [[political party]] in [[Ukraine]] and [[Bielorussia]], formed after a split in the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (''Bund''). In late 1918 Bund branches in cities like [[Bobruisk]], [[Ekaterinoburg]] and [[Odessa]] formed 'leftwing Bund groups'. In February 1919 these groups (representing the majority in Ukrainian Bund movement) adopted the name 'Communist Bund', constituting themselves as an independent party of the Jewish [[proletariat]]. The ''Kombund'' supported Jewish national autonomy.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Nora|title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Nz0N5GBW6MC|accessdate=2009-11-10 | isbn=978-0-8147-5051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel.

[[Moisei Rafes]] was the leader of the party. Rafes had been a leading figure in the Bund in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="levin"/&gt;

Whilst the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] (CP(b)U) recognized the need to collaborate with the Ukrainian Kombund, they refused to recognize the Kombund as a communist party. CP(b)U held that the Kombund was a middle class movement and its members were not given responsibilities in different Soviets. Nor did CP(b)U accept that the Kombund merge into the party.&lt;ref name="Gurevitz1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baruch Gurevitz|title=National Communism in the Soviet Union, 1918-28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EjI5CvKH94C&amp;pg=PA31|date=15 September 1980|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7736-0|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] : 地論宗; [[pinyin]] ''di lun zong'') was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sect in [[China]], based around [[Vasubandhu]]'s Sanskrit sutra of the same name (Chinese 十地經; pinyin ''shi di jing''; ''ten stages sutra'').  It was later absorbed into the [[Huayan school|Huayan]] school, which adopted this sutra as part of its own central text.

Along with the [[Gandavyuha Sutra]], the [[Ten Stages Sutra|Daśabhūmikā shastra]] is one of the most important chapters of the compounded [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It describes the [[Mahayana|Bodhisattvayana]], that is the [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|ten stages to Buddhahood]], or rather the ten grounds on which a [[Bodhisattva]] marches on its path towards complete Enlightenment, or [[Bodhi]].

The '''destruction of sites associated with early Islam''' is an ongoing phenomenon that has occurred mainly in the [[Hejaz]] region of western Saudi Arabia, particularly around the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. The demolition has focused on mosques, burial sites, homes and historical locations associated with the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and many of the founding personalities of [[Historiography of early Islam|early Islamic history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/medina-saudis-take-a-bulldozer-to-islams-history-8228795.html|title=Medina: Saudis take a bulldozer to Islam's history|work=The Independent|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Saudi Arabia, many of the demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the [[Masjid al-Haram]] at Mecca and the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in Medina and their auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever-increasing number of Muslims performing the pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-11/india/35749248_1_islamic-heritage-islamic-cooperation-aiumb-general-secretary|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411040819/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-11/india/35749248_1_islamic-heritage-islamic-cooperation-aiumb-general-secretary|deadurl=yes|title='Cultural genocide of Islamic heritage' in Saudi Arabia riles Sunni S…|date=11 April 2013|archivedate=11 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Much of the Arabian Peninsula was politically unified by 1932 in the third and current Saudi State, the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. The military campaign led by [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz ibn Saud]] and his [[Bedouin]] army of tribesmen conquered the Hejaz and ousted the ruling [[Hashemite]] clan. The new [[Najd]]i rulers, nomadic Arabs largely tribal and illiterate, found themselves at the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of a highly sophisticated society. A cohesive political structure based on the [[Majlis al-Shura]] (consultative council) system had been in place for centuries. A central administrative body managed an annual budget which allocated expenditure on secondary schools, military and police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Yamani | first = Mai | coauthor= | authorlink = | title = Cradle of Islam | year = 2009 | month = | publisher = I.B. TAURIS | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84511-824-2 | page = 2 | chapter = Devotion | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the religious fabric of the Najd and the Hejaz were vastly different. Traditional Hejazi cultural customs and rituals were almost entirely religious in nature. Celebrations honouring [[Muhammad]], his [[family of Muhammad|family]] and [[sahaba|companions]], reverence of deceased saints, visitation of shrines, tombs and holy sites connected with any of these were among the customs indigenous to Hejazi Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Yamani | first = Mai | coauthor= | authorlink = | title = Cradle of Islam | year = 2009 | month = | publisher = I.B.

In 1801 and 1802, the Saudis under [[Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud]] attacked and captured the [[Shia]] holy cities of [[Karbala]] and [[Najaf]] in today's Iraq, massacred parts of the Shia Muslim population and destroyed the tomb of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of Muhammad and son of [[Ali]], Muhammad's son-in-law. In 1803 and 1804, the Saudis captured Mecca and Medina and destroyed historical monuments and various holy Muslim sites and shrines, such as the shrine built over the tomb of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, and even intended to destroy the grave of Muhammad himself as idolatrous, causing outrage throughout the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="islamicamagazine.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6999574/Spirit The Destruction of Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina] By Irfan Ahmed in Islamic Magazine, Issue 1, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Paladin Gears Up for War"&gt;Nibras Kazimi, [http://www.nysun.com/article/65662?page_no=3 A Paladin Gears Up for War], [[The New York Sun]], November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saudi's Shi'ites walk tightrope"&gt;John R Bradley, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GC17Ak01.html Saudi's Shi'ites walk tightrope], [[Asia Times]], March 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In Mecca, the tombs of direct relations of Muhammad located at [[Jannatul Mualla]] cemetery, including that of his first wife [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]], were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/destruction_of_islamic_architectural_heritage_in_saudi_arabia_a_wake_up_cal|title=The American Muslim (TAM)|publisher=Theamericanmuslim.org|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial dismantling of the sites began in 1806 when the [[Wahhabi]] army of the [[First Saudi State]] occupied Medina and systematically levelled many of the structures at the [[Jannat al-Baqi]] cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm|title=The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam|publisher=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the vast burial site adjacent the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid al-Nabawi) housing the remains of many of the members of [[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad’s family]], close [[Sahaba|companions]] and central figures of early Islam. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], practitioners themselves of more tolerant and at times mystical strains of Islam, had erected elaborate mausoleums over the graves of Al-Baqi. These were levelled in their entirety. Mosques across the city were also targeted and an attempt was made to demolish Muhammad's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjpExwQWtOsC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206
|title=Saudi Arabia enters the 21st century |author=Anthony H. Cordesman|quote=The tension between Saudi Shi'ite and Wahhabi is especially intense because Saudi "Wahhabis" actively reject all veneration of man, even the prophet.  At one point, they attempted to destroy Muhammad's tomb in Medina. In contrast, the Saudi Shi'ites are "[[Twelver]]s", a branch of Islam that venerates the Prophet's son-in-law Ali, and believes that the leadership of Islam must pass through Ali's line. They venerate each of the past imams, and make pilgrimages to their tombs.|publisher=Praeger (April 21, 2003)|isbn=978-0-275-98091-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread vocal criticism of this last action by Muslim communities as far away as India, eventually led to abandoning any attempt on this site. Political claims made against Turkish control of the region initiated the [[Ottoman–Saudi war]] (1811–1818) in which the Saudi defeat forced Wahhabi tribesmen to retreat from the Hejaz back into the interior. Turkish forces reasserted control of the region and subsequently began extensive rebuilding of sacred sites between 1848 and 1860, many of them done employing the finest examples of Ottoman design and craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=IM&gt;Irfan Ahmed, [http://islamicamagazine.com/?p=424 The Destruction of Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina, page 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063137/http://islamicamagazine.com/?p=424 |date=2011-07-13 }}, ''Islamica Magazine'', Issue 15.page 71. Accessed online October 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
On 21 April 1925 the mausoleums and domes at Al-Baqi in Medina were once again levelled&lt;ref name=IM/&gt; and so were indicators of the exact location of the resting places of Muhammad’s family members and descendants, as it remains to the present day. Portions of the famed [[Qasida al-Burda]], the 13th century ode written in praise of Muhammad by [[Imam al-Busiri]], inscribed over Muhammad's tomb were painted over. Among specific sites targeted at this time were the graves of the Martyrs of the [[Battle of Uhud]], including the grave of the renowned [[Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib]], uncle of Muhammad and one of his most beloved supporters, the Mosque of Fatimah Al Zahraa’, daughter of Mohammad, the Mosque of the Two Lighthouses (Manaratayn) as well as the Qubbat Al-Thanaya,&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt; the cupola built as the burial place of Mohammad’s incisor tooth, which was broken from a blow received during the Battle of Uhud. In Medina, the Mashrubat Umm Ibrahim, the home of Mohammad’s Coptic Egyptian wife [[Maria al-Qibtiyya|Mariah]] and birthplace of their son [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad|Ibrahim]], as well as the adjacent burial site of Hamida al-Barbariyya, mother of [[Imam Musa al-Kadhim|Musa al-Kadhim]], were destroyed during this time.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt; The site was paved over and is today part of the massive marble esplanade beside the Mosque. The government-appointed permanent scholarly committee of Saudi Arabia has ordered the demolition of such structures in a series of Islamic rulings noting excessive veneration leading to [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]].&lt;ref name="Fatwas of the Permanent Committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aliftaweb.org/English/Pages/FatwasPermanentCommittee.aspx?cultStr=en&amp;View=Tree&amp;NodeID=8510&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7 | title=Fatwas of the Permanent Committee | publisher=Official KSA Rulings | accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
The twenty-first century has seen an increase in the demolition of sites in Mecca and Medina by Saudi authorities, alongside expansion of luxury development.

As the annual ''[[hajj]]'' continues to draw larger crowds year after year, the Saudi authorities deemed it necessary to raze large tracts of formerly residential neighborhoods around the two important mosques to make way for pilgrimage-related [[infrastructure]]. In 2010, it was forecast that developers were going to spend an estimated $13 billion on the largest expansion project in the city’s history.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.islamicpluralism.org/467/dr-sami-angawi-on-wahhabi-desecration-of-makkah| title = Dr.Sami Angawi on Wahhabi Desecration of Makkah | accessdate = November 28, 2010| last = Abou-Ragheb| first = Laith| date = July 12, 2005| work =| publisher = Center for Islamic Pluralism| quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While there is widespread agreement for the need of facilities that can accommodate greater numbers of pilgrims, the development of upscale hotels and condominium towers, restaurants, shopping centres and spas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairmont.com/makkah|title=Makkah Hotels: Makkah Hotel at Fairmont|publisher=Fairmont.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has caused some to criticize the over-[[commercialization]] of a site which many consider to be a divinely ordained [[sanctuary]] for Muslims. 

The rapid influx of capitalist investment in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] leads many to believe that money and [[economic growth]] are the ultimate reason for Saudi authorities. Critics argue that this monetary focus works with Wahhabi state [[policy]] that imposes a massive cultural and social deletion within the Holy Cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.torontosun.com/travel/international/2010/11/12/16107661-reuters.html| title = Mecca goes Upmarket| accessdate = December 1, 2010| last = Laessing| first = Ulf| date = November 18, 2010| publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; erasing any elements that encourage practices counter to the Wahhabi creed. 

According to ''[[The Independent]]'', the House of Mawalid where Muhammad is said to have been born is about to be replaced by a huge royal palace, as a part of a multibillion-pound construction project in Mecca which has resulted in the destruction of hundreds of historic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mecca-under-threat-outrage-at-plan-to-destroy-the-birthplace-of-the-prophet-mohamed-and-replace-it-with-a-new-palace-and-luxury-malls-9857098.html|title=Mecca under threat: Outrage at plan to destroy the ‘birthplace’ of the Prophet Mohamed and replace it with a new palace and luxury malls|work=The Independent|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudis are turning [[Diriyah]], the domain of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], into a major tourist attraction, with [[Diriyah]] becoming an important place of touristic visitation within Saudi Arabia's modern borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/world/middleeast/saudis-turn-birthplace-of-ideology-into-tourist-spot.html|title=Saudis Turn Birthplace of Wahhabism Ideology Into Tourist Spot|first=Ben|last=Hubbard|date=31 May 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1034231/saudi-arabia  |title=Diriyah on course to become world-class tourist spot |author=Estimo Jr, Rodolfo|date=5 January 2017|work=[[Arab News]]|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dolanji''' is an area near [[Solan]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], India. It is famous for its [[Bon]] Monastery, which one of the main tourist attractions in the [[Solan district]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hptdc.gov.in/cir0101.htm Places of Interest], HP Tourism Development Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joke van de Belt |title=Ani-la: The Nuns from Redna Menling |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qQ46sDmLIkC&amp;pg=PA30 |year=2010 |publisher=Sidestone Press |isbn=978-90-8890-046-4 |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an offshoot of the [[Menri Monastery]], the second oldest monastery in the world. It is located at a distance of 24-25 km from Kumarhatti, on the Narag-Sarahan road and is run by the Yungdrung Bon Monastic Centre. Constructed in 1969, it was founded by Abbot Lungog Tenpai Nyima. The place is considered to be the best place to witness Tibetan culture.This monastery has recreated the Geshe training program and is home to over 200 monks. Menri in India and Triten Norbutse Monastery in Nepal now host the only two Geshe programs in the Bon lineage.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was an instant hit and as a result the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded.

McGuire's single hit #1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1965.

==Background==
The song had initially been presented to [[The Byrds]] as a [[Bob Dylan|Dylanesque]] potential single, but they rejected it. [[The Turtles]], another L.A. group who often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as a track on their 1965 debut album ''[[It Ain't Me Babe (album)|It Ain't Me Babe]]'', shortly before McGuire's version was cut; it was eventually released as a single and hit #100 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1970. The song was also recorded by [[Jan and Dean]] on their album ''Folk 'n Roll'' in 1965, using the same backing track as the McGuire version, and by [[The Grass Roots]] on their first album ''[[Where Were You When I Needed You]]'' in 1966.

McGuire recalled in later years that "Eve of Destruction" had been recorded in one take on a Thursday morning, reading lyrics scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. The following Monday morning he got a phone call from the record company at 7:00 am, telling him to turn on the radio—his song was playing.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire stated this on ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', Australian ABC TV shown on March 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], McGuire re-recorded "Eve of Destruction" as the lead track on his second [[contemporary Christian]] release: "Lighten Up". He updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line about the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] replaced by the words "[[Columbine, Colorado]]", referring to the student massacre of 1999. On March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', performing an updated version of "Eve of Destruction", with new lines such as "You're old enough to kill/you just started voting" and "...can live for ten years in space". The reference to "Red China" was also removed, and in its place were the more generic "Now think of all the hate, still living inside us/it's never too late, to let love guide us".

==Reception==
In the first week of its release, the single was at #103 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts. By August 12 Dunhill released the LP, ''Eve of Destruction''. It reached its peak of #37 on the Billboard album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to #1 on the chart, and repeated the feat on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' chart, where it had debuted at #30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barrymcguire.com/?page=bio4 |title=Eve of Destruction |publisher=BarryMcGuire.com |author=Barry McGuire |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuire would never again break into the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It went to #1 in [[Norway]] for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Barry McGuire - Eve of Destruction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Barry+McGuire&amp;titel=Eve+Of+Destruction&amp;cat=s |title= Barry McGuire - Eve of Destruction |accessdate=5 September 2010 |work=norwegiancharts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[Mass media|media]] helped popularize the song by using it as an example of everything that was wrong with the youth of that time.&lt;ref name=sloan&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also drew flak from [[conservatism|conservatives]]. A group called [[The Spokesmen]] released a partial [[parody music|parody]] and [[answer song|answer record]] entitled "The Dawn of Correction". A few months later, [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] medic SSgt. [[Barry Sadler]] released the patriotic "[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]". [[Johnny Sea]]'s [[spoken word]] recording, "Day For Decision", was also a response to the song.

Due to its controversial lyrics, some American radio stations, "claiming it was an aid to the enemy in Vietnam",&lt;ref name=pc33&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19792/m1/ |title=Show 33 - Revolt of the Fat Angel: American musicians respond to the British invaders.

==Later uses==
In the late 1970s [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Dickies]] recorded a cover of "Eve of Destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dickies/_/Eve+of+Destruction |title=The Dickies – Eve Of Destruction |work=Last.fm |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Undead]] (Fronted by Ex-[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] guitarist [[Bobby Steele]]) recorded a cover of "Eve of Destruction" in 1986 and was released on their album "[[Act Your Rage]]" in 1989. [[New wave music|New wave]] group [[Red Rockers]] covered the song in their 1984 album ''Schizoprenic Circus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Schizophrenic-Circus-Red-Rockers/dp/B000LRZ05W |title= Schizophrenic Circus |publisher= [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Thunders]] recorded it on his 1984 album ''[[Hurt Me]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunders.ca/discs/hurtme.htm |title=Johnny ThundersHurt Me |work=Thunders.ca |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also frequently covered the song in concert (a live version is included on his 2000 CD, ''Belfast Nights''), while veteran [[Canadians|Canadian]] punk outfit [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] also covered the song on their 2004 album ''Live Free Or Die''.  [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] included a 23-minute cover of the song as the final track of his 1993 album ''Rock''. The song has also been covered by Australian band [[Screaming Jets]] on their 1997 album ''[[World Gone Crazy (The Screaming Jets album)|World Gone Crazy]]''. Christian rock pioneer [[Larry Norman]] released his cover version on a maxi-single CD in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetjesushere.com/eve_of_destruction.htm |title=Eve Of Destruction |website=Meetjesushere.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing Christian punk band [[Crashdog]] also covered it on their album ''Cashists, Fascists, and Other Fungus''. Post-Industrial psychedelic rock outfit [[Psychic TV]] released "Eve Of Destruction" as a limited edition single in the late 1980s. In 2003, the [[reggae]] singer Luciano recorded a version of the song. The band Bishop Allen also released a song titled "Eve of Destruction" on their 2003 album, ''Charm School'', which takes its chorus from this song. The [[Cookeville, Tennessee]], rock band [[MerseySide]] released a rocked up version in 2012 with the lyric "Think of all the hate there is in Al Qaeda", with the Mayan Calendar as the cover. Irish singer-songwriter [[Eleanor McEvoy]] also covered the song on her 2011 album ''[[Alone (Eleanor McEvoy album)|Alone]]'', and often performs the song live with the lyrics altered to acknowledge more contemporary issues.

[[The Temptations]]' song "[[Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)]]" mentions the song title.  The song was briefly featured on [[Stephen King]]'s 1994 miniseries ''[[The Stand]]''. With a burning [[Des Moines, Iowa]], as a backdrop, Larry Underwood sits atop the hood of a car, belting out the song to amuse himself until interrupted by another survivor of the [[The Stand#"Captain Trips"|superflu]]. It also appeared in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode GABF16, "[[The Girl Who Slept Too Little]]", and was featured in [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s 1997 film ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]''. A [[Joey Scarbury]] cover was played repeatedly in the original airing of ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'' episode "Operation Spoil Sport" to encourage the hero to prevent an automated nuclear strike being triggered by a renegade U.S. general (the aliens who provided the hero's super-powers commandeered his car radio and tuned it to stations playing the song). Due to copyright issues, the song does not appear in the DVD version of the episode. A French translation is used in the closing credits of [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Sicko]]''. An Italian version, "Questo vecchio pazzo mondo" ("This old crazy world"), was recorded by [[Gino Santercole]] in 1967; a 1984 recording by [[Adriano Celentano]] was included in his album ''I miei americani'' (a collection of US hits translated into Italian). This song also makes an appearance in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (directed by [[Oliver Stone]]), as the opening act performs it before [[The Doors]] take the stage in Miami.

[[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] covered the song on their 2007 ''[[How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul]]'' album.

''The Greatest American Hero'' opened its second (and only full) season with the episode "Operation: Spoilsport," in which reluctant superhero Ralph Hinkley must prevent an insane, rogue general from launching a nuclear attack on Russia.  Hinkley's alien friends contact him secretly, through a radio station, and use the song as a way of getting their point across without being too obvious.

The song is played during the fourth-season finale of ''[[The A-Team]]'', "The Sound of Thunder," when the team returns to Vietnam and flashbacks recall their tours of duty. The song is featured in the fourth level of the Vietnam War video game ''[[Men of Valor]]''. While the song is playing, the main character's [[lieutenant]] is dying of his wound on the battlefield.

The song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a [[gun truck]] used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the [[Vietnam War]]. The truck is on display at the [[U.S. Army Transportation Museum]] and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam era gun truck.&lt;ref name="eve"&gt;{{cite web

The indie rock group [[Bishop Allen]] performs a version of "Eve of Destruction" borrowing heavily from the original, but with an even more sharply apocalyptic theme. It includes the lyrics "And if this moment is gone in a flash/And my hand in yours becomes ash in ash", followed in the next verse by an imagining of rejection from Heaven: "Then we'll have a dance, yeah a dance, on the head of a pin/Then God will grin, and shoo us away".

'''Four of Cups''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card.

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes; the unconscious finds meaning and fulfillment in the Tarot's images and symbols.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==
The Four of Cups represents a period of self-reflection and inaction and/or quiet deliberation or contemplation. The querent is being pushed into a bad situation or forced to do something that seems undesirable to him. This card can also predict that the querent might have to undergo a time of tribulation and/or force him to self-reflect or self-sacrifice.

Also, the reader must acknowledge that the figure in meditation is staring intently at the cups before him. This shows a distraction with affairs already present, although not necessarily all that is pressing. He need only look in a new direction to find the gift he is ignoring.

The querent is advised to open himself to new possibilities.

In its reversed meaning, the Four of Cups indicates that a time of stagnation, boredom or self-absorption is about to come to an end.

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

A '''hookah lounge''' (also called a '''shisha bar''' or '''den''', especially in Britain and parts of Canada, or a '''hookah bar''') is an establishment where patrons share [[Mu‘assel|shisha]]  from a communal [[hookah]] or from one which is placed at each table or a bar. [[File:HarvardSquareHookah.jpg|222px|thumb|Center|A [[hookah]] and a variety of [[tobacco]] products are on display in a [[Harvard Square]] [[window shopping|store window]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]].]]
Often, hookah lounges are owned and operated by people from the [[Arab world]],  origin and or other regions where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition. Many hookah lounges incorporate such elements as [[Islamic architecture|Islamic decor]] and [[Arabic music]] or [[Music of India|Indian music]]. In Europe this is no longer a fact and hookah lounges are simply a bar without the eastern cultural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/20/EBGAJCNHUM1.DTL&amp;type=t|title=East Bay: Aromas, relaxation are the hook in hookah|date=20 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Hookah lounges are mostly found in [[college town]]s and [[urban area]]s and are regarded by some as a novel and chic way to socialize and embrace [[multiculturalism]]. Certain lounges offer modern hookahs with fruit bowls or other kinds of improvements over smoking hookah at home.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192828/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/344847/hookah_bars_finding_a_place_in_america/index.html?source=r_health|title=Hookah Bars Finding a Place in America - Health - RedOrbit|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people of [[Middle East]]ern or [[South Asia]]n extraction consider them a continuation of their own cultural traditions. Hookah lounges nowadays often distance themselves from the eastern cultures offering hookah and alcohol without the cultural elements. These bars differ from other bars only in the fact that they offer hookah. {{CN|date=June 2015}}

Typically a disposable mouthpiece is provided for each user for [[hygiene]] reasons.  Hookah lounges do not typically have [[liquor license]]s but instead derive the bulk of their revenue from sales of [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s and [[snack food]]s.{{cn|date=August 2014}}  Almost all offer [[Turkish coffee]]. 

Some hookah lounges have well-equipped kitchens and are more akin to [[bistro]]s.  In the broadest sense, any [[restaurant]] or [[nightclub]] can be considered a hookah lounge if it offers patrons hookahs, shisha and a comfortable place to smoke. Some offer [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] menu items.

Due to several state anti-tobacco laws, many hookah bars have made the transition from smoking traditional shisha to smoking herbal shisha because it contains no tobacco, or nicotine and is legal indoors in areas specific to the prohibition of tobacco smoking. Herbs do produce tar when they burn.

==History==

The hookah in its first and simplest form originated in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article-niche.com/launch/25-08-2008History-Of-Hookah.htm|title=article-niche.com|website=article-niche.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon traveled west to [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]], where it gained mass popularity{{CN|date=June 2015}} The hookah lounge has clear antecedents in the tradition of [[coffee house]]s in the Middle East and Turkey, where people smoke tobacco from hookahs or other styles of [[Bong|water pipe]] provided by the establishment.  In this traditional setting the hookah is typically of the single-hose variety.  This is in contrast with the multi-hose variety favored in the hookah lounge and intended to emphasize the communal nature of the activity.

==In Europe==
*'''[[Germany]]''' - Hookahs are available in many establishments in Germany, particularly in [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]] and the [[Ruhr Area]] and areas, and it is not only popular amongst [[Turkish people]].
*'''[[Netherlands]]''' - Hookahs are now gaining popularity in the Netherlands, particularly in [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]].
*'''[[United Kingdom]]''' - In the United Kingdom, hookahs are most commonly found in "shisha bars" run by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] or [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] people. Since a 2007 British ban on smoking in public places, Shisha bars have risen from 179 in 2007 to 556 in 2012. Birmingham also has a large number of Shisha lounges also such as Shabbi Shics in the Digbeth area of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hubble, bubble |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2013/08/24/hubble-bubble |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=The Economist |date=24 August 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Spain]]''' - Hookah use has grown in popularity in Spain, especially among the young.  As a result, many ''teterías'' ([[tea house]]s) have made hookahs available to patrons.
* '''[[Russia]]''' - Due to heavy influence from Caucasus and Central Asia, hookahs have become a widespread recreational practice in large Russian cities, and are now offered in many cafes and restaurants.
* '''[[Denmark]]''' - Hookah lounges have gained heavy popularity in the recent years. You can most likely find a hookah lounge in every moderately big city. [[Aarhus]], [[Odense]] and [[Copenhagen]] being the biggest citites in Denmark, you can without a doubt find several hookah lounges in each of these cities.

==In the United States==
[[Image:Hookah Lounge.jpg|thumb|Mist Hookah Lounge in North Brunswick, New Jersey]]
In the [[United States]], establishments akin to hookah lounges first opened decades ago in the [[immigrant]] quarters of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California]] as coffee and tea houses. The Hookah was not the central focus of the businesses until the Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas featured it as the primary offering. Patrons were typically men of Middle Eastern descent{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The first establishment to call itself the Hookah Lounge, is in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Hookah Lounge created the entire experience of the Hookah, specialty cocktails and Middle Eastern food. The decor is Moroccan. They registered the name in 2000 and began using the URL Hookahlounge.com. They have two locations in Las Vegas. It was the first full service bar that focused its business around serving hookahs. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas was opened in 2000 by owner Paymon Raouf and operator Jeff Ecker. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas originally defended the use of the name Hookah Lounge but it became too commonly used and too costly to defend. They now use the term America's Original Hookah Lounge in advertisements to better identify them as the first to operate in a major lounge setting. 

Many hookah lounges in the United States have [[modernism|modernistic]] elements such as glass tables, [[plasma television]]s, and [[oxygen bar]]s. Most bars in the U.S. require patrons to be at least 18 years of age to smoke shisha and 18 years of age to purchase (exceptions are Utah, Arizona, Alabama, and New Jersey: 19 years of age to smoke; New York is 21 years of age). &lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;

One purveyor of hookahs and shisha claims:

{{quote|It's at its largest demand ever in this country...I don't think it's going away anytime soon. There's so much more room for the product to expand. Only a small percentage of Americans know about it.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;}}

Over the recent years hookah in general has become increasingly popular for the young-adults; those who are just at the legal age to smoke in their state. It is not uncommon now to find hookah bars within short distance of college campuses and in the surrounding towns. This younger generation has revitalized the hookah market, hookah bars are successful and remaining open despite indoor smoking bans{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} For private hookah smokers, many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets now offer hookah products for sale.

==Smoking bans and exemptions==
Hookah use has increased dramatically among American and European youth in recent years because of the social atmosphere it creates, and because many young adults know it as an alternative to cigarette smoking.

Many municipalities, especially in North America and Europe have enacted [[smoking ban]]s in public places. Sometimes, however, businesses can obtain special permits allowing smoking within; these permits are typically available only for hookah lounges, [[cigar bar]]s, [[tobacconist]]s, and similar establishments where smoking is the focus of activity. They are less frequently available for places in which alcohol or food is served.

In some cases, the ban is against tobacco smoking specifically. When this is the case, a hookah lounge may remain in business by replacing traditional, tobacco-based shisha with a tobacco-free Mu‘assel.

In order to remain open, many hookah lounges cannot sell food or beverages. Approximately 90% of the cities that have put a ban on smoking in public places have exemptions for hookah lounges. The cities with these kinds of exemptions, typically, have more dense populations.&lt;ref name="PublicBan"&gt;A, Primack B. "US Health Policy Related to Hookah Tobacco Smoking." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 24 July 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health concerns===
Because hookah lounges are exempt from the smoking bans, and because the hookah trend is increasing at a high rate among youth, many believe it is becoming a public health concern. Many hookah users do not understand the health risks that come along with it. Common beliefs include shisha is not addictive, and the smoke contains less [[carcinogens]].
Hookah smoke contains the same chemicals found in cigarettes, it is not safer because it is smoked as often, it is addictive, and even if the tobacco is filtered with water, the carcinogens are not filtered out.&lt;ref name="HealthEffects"&gt;Morris, Daniel S., Steven C. Fiala, and Rebecca Pawlak. "Opportunities for Policy Interventions to Reduce Youth Hookah Smoking in the United States." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. N.p., 15 Nov. 2012. Web. 01 Apr. 2013..&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Popularity"&gt;Channick, Robert. "Hookah Lounges Thriving, Three Years after Smoking Ban." Chicago Tribune. N.p. Web.13 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many cities want to create tougher restrictions for hookah lounges, and some want them shut down altogether.

{{Sikh scriptures}}

'''Jaap Sahib''' (or Japu ''Sahib'') is the morning prayer of the [[Sikh]]s. The prayer was composed by the tenth Sikh Master, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and is found at the start of the Sikh scripture [[Dasam Granth]].&lt;ref name=singha110/&gt; 
This [[Gurbani|Bani]] is an important Sikh prayer, and is recited by the ''[[Panj Pyare]]'' while preparing ''[[Amrit]]'' on the occasion of ''[[Amrit Sanchar]]'' (initiation), a ceremony held to admit initiates into the [[Khalsa]] and it is a part of a Sikh's ''[[Nitnem]]'' (daily mediations). The ''Jaap Sahib'' is reminiscent of ''[[Japji Sahib]]'' composed by Guru Nanak, and both praise God.&lt;ref name=singha110/&gt;

==Meaning of Jaap==
Following are some accepted meanings of Jaap:
* The popular meanings of Jaap is ''to recite'', to repeat, or ''to chant''.&lt;ref name=deol11&gt;S Deol (1998), Japji: The Path of Devotional Meditation, {{ISBN|978-0966102703}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jaap also means ''to understand''. Gurbani cites ''Aisa Giaan Japo Man Mere, Hovo Chakar Sache Kere'', where Jap word means to understand wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nihang|first1=Dharam Singh|title=Naad Ved Vichar |format=Exegesis |language=Punjabi |location=India |page=20|quote=ਐਸਾ ਗਿਆਨੁ ਜਪਹੁ ਮਨ ਮੇਰੇ।। ਹੋਵਹੁ ਚਾਕਰ ਸਾਚੇ ਕੇਰੇ (ਪੰਨਾ ੭੨੮) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jaap'' is a Sanskrit word meaning "to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
''Jaap Sahib'' is a rhythmic hymn composed like a necklace of pearls and gems, beauteously arranged around a string: the string is the Supreme God; the pearls and gems are His attributes, excellences, and glories. It basically helps reader do a daily Greetings to Waheguru in 199 verses, just like we do hello to each other. The glories sung by Guru Sahib revolve around the following attributes of God:

*God is metaphysical , beyond time, Eternal, Unborn, Uncreated, Self-existent, and withour form, feature, colour or contour. Therefore, neither can God be described or depicted, nor can anyone make an  image or idols of that which is undefinable.
*God's  manifestations are universally pervasive. God cannot be confined to any particular place, land, country, religion, race, garb, body or name.
*God is the Creator of the Universe and the laws governing it. Never can anyone be outside the ambit of these laws nor can anyone have the power to oppose them. God's Law and Justice is Righteous and Ultimate.
*God's  is pervasive  in all that 'He' has created, yet God also extends beyond  'His'  creations; God is thus Immanent in His Creation and at the same time Transcends it.
*God is Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient; nothing, whether good or evil, can happen outside of the Creator's Will; God is the Creator-Sustainer-Annuller of His Creation. God is the Life of life, the Death of death,  the Darkness of darkness, the Light of light.

==Content==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
The Jaap Sahib is a recitation and praise of God. It includes various names of God in various languages. Understand the fact that god has no name but is called by various names by devotees based on their experience and the blessings they have obtained from him. There is only one sole religion of humans - humanity, and the worldly path that we choose to understand the natural power, our source, source of creation -  is called faith only.

All faiths are rivers and are destined to merge into one great "Ocean - the lord, the light"; whatever you may call, think, believe or perceive.&lt;ref name=singha110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amarjit Singh (1985), Concept of God in Jaap Sahib: An analytic study, Studies in Sikhism and Comparative Religion,  Vol. 4, Issue 1, pages 85–92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
''Jaap Sahib'' is made up of 199 verses and is the first Bani of the [[Dasam Granth]] (p.&amp;nbsp;1-10).

The Jaap Sahib begins with the words:
 
:{{font color|brown|"ਸ੍ਰੀ ਮੁਖਵਾਕ ਪਾਤਿਸਾਹੀ ੧੦ ॥'}}
:"Sri Mukhwakh Patshahi Dasvee," 
:"By the holy mouth of the Tenth King,"

This line is clearly intended to authenticate Guru Gobind Singh Ji as the Author of the Dasam Granth.

''Jaap'' is a Sanskrit word which means "to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice." The form of the word here is ''Japu'', which makes it a noun, meaning "meditation on nothing but the Truth; ('God') (or The True God).

==Language==
The language of Jaap, is close to classical with words and compounds drawn from [[Sanskrit]], [[Brij Bhasha]], [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. The contents of Jaap Sahib, are divided into various ''Chhands'' bearing the name of the related meter according to the then prevalent system of prosody in India.

==Japji Sahib and Jaap Sahib==
The Guru Granth Sahib starts with ''Japji Sahib'', while [[Dasam Granth]] starts with Jaap Sahib also called Japu Sahib.&lt;ref name=singha110&gt;HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170103011}}, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak is credited with the former, while Guru Gobind Singh is credited with the latter.&lt;ref name=singha110/&gt; The Jaap Sahib, unlike Japji Sahib, is composed predominantly in Braj-Hindi, Sanskrit language and Arabic words, and with 199 stanzas is longer than Japji Sahib. The Jaap Sahib is, like Japji Sahib, a praise of God as the unchanging, loving, unborn, ultimate power.

'''John Slocum''' (Squ-sacht-un) was a member of the [[Squaxin Island Tribe]], Coast Salish, and a reputed holy man and prophet who founded the [[Indian Shaker Church]] in 1881.

Slocum was introduced to [[Christianity]] by [[missionaries]] working in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]'s [[Puget Sound]] region. In 1881 he became ill and allegedly fell into a trance where he was transported to heaven where he met an angel who instructed him to start a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; While in trance he was told how to bring [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples to [[salvation]]. This experience was similar to that described by other 19th-century Native American prophets, including [[Wovoka]], Tavibo and [[Smohalla]]. In 1886, he began preaching a message he designated "[[Tschadam]]".

About a year later, Slocum once again became ill. While his wife, Mary Thompson Slocum, cared for him, she started shaking uncontrollably in his presence. When he recovered, he interpreted her shaking as a spiritual manifestation which saved him from death. Slocum incorporated shaking or twitching into the religion as a way to brush off sin, sickness, or bad feelings. This practice led non-natives to call the Church the "Indian Shaker Religion."  Slocum and some of his followers were imprisoned regularly for their opposition to government-mandated [[acculturation programs]] for Pacific Coast peoples.

The Indian Shaker Religion is still practiced and combines many traditional native beliefs and customs with Christian beliefs about [[God]] and the realities of [[heaven]] and [[hell]].

According to Vaishnavas, [[Vishnu]], the supreme god (सर्वोत्तम), has infinite names. 24 of these names of the Lord are present in a group called ‘Chaturvimsati Kesava Namas’.

== Etymology ==
Kesava Namas refers to the 24 names of Lord Vishnu, the first of which is Kesava. They are often referred to as Chaturvimsati Namas (चतुर्विंशति नाम).

== Background ==
The 24 forms of Vishnu seem to have been conceived in the [[Mahabharatha]]. His roopa and forms are first mentioned in [[Agni Purana]], the Rūpamaṇḍana and the Aparājitapṛcchā.&lt;ref name="Desai2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Kalpana Desai|title=Iconography of Visnu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4M90AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA10|date=31 December 2013|publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=10–|id=GGKEY:GSELHU3JH6D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these they are also mentioned in Vaishnava [[puranas]] such as [[Bhagavata]] and Vishnu purana. The Kesava namas were thus well established during the ancient period of Hinduism.

== Usage ==
* The Kesava Namas are the most sacred names for [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]], and are recited and praised at the beginning of all Vedic pujas in Hinduism.
* The [[Achamana]] is a ritual where the namas are used while simultaneously touching the numerous parts of the body to purify them.
* The names form an important part of the bhakti devotional with bhaktas like [[Purandara Dasa]] having sung many devotional songs in praise of them.
* [[Archana (Hinduism)|Archanas]] to Lord Vishnu are incomplete without at least a single recitation of the namas.

== Iconography ==
* The 24 Names of Vishnu are all represented as standing and holding 4 of his emblems the [[Sudarshana Chakra|chakra]], [[shankha]], [[Kaumodaki|gadaa]], [[Padma (attribute)|padma]]
The twenty-four varieties of standing Viṣhṇu images symbolize his different visible forms. The only distinguishing point or difference between these images is merely the order of the emblems held by the four hands, each variety deserving of a separate description.&lt;ref name="Desai2013"/&gt;

'''''Letters from the Earth''''' is a posthumously published work of celebrated American author [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) collated by [[Bernard DeVoto]].&lt;ref name="aboutMTP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Project History |url=http://www.marktwainproject.org/about_projecthistory.shtml |website=www.marktwainproject.org |publisher=Mark Twain Project |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain's life (1904–09), when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a sarcastic — Twain's own term throughout the book — tone. Initially, another of his daughters, [[Clara Clemens]], objected to its publication in March 1939,&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion, claiming it presented a ''"distorted"''&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962book"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with [[Soviet]] reports that her father's ideas were being suppressed in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt;  The papers were selected, edited and sequenced for the book in 1939 by [[Bernard DeVoto]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt;

==Content==
''Letters from the Earth'' consists of a series of commentaries in essay and short story form. Many of these pieces express Twain's discomfort with and disdain for Christianity, both as a theological position and a lifestyle. The title story consists of eleven letters written by the [[archangel]] [[Satan]] to archangels [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes1962" /&gt; about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other pieces in the book include a [[morality tale]] told as a bedtime discussion with Twain's children, Susy and Clara, about a family of cats, and an essay explaining why an [[anaconda]] is morally superior to Man.

==Date of writing==
''Letters from the Earth'' was written after the deaths of Twain's daughter [[Susy Clemens|Suzy]] (1896) and of his wife [[Olivia Langdon Clemens|Olivia]] (1904). Textual references make clear that sections, at least, of ''Letters from the Earth'' were written shortly before his death in April 1910. (For instance, Letter VII, in discussing the ravages of [[hookworm]], refers to the $1,000,000 gift of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] to help eradicate the disease – a gift that was announced on October 28, 1909, less than six months before Twain's death.&lt;ref name="RockefellerArticle"&gt;{{citation |title = Rockefeller Gift To Kill 'Hookworm' |periodical = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | page = 1 | date = October 29, 1909 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/10/29/101902851.pdf | accessdate = 2010-03-05 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the following excerpt appears in a discussion of the Palestinian town of Nablous, in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''. This passage was written more than four decades before his death, in 1867 or 1868, and appears to be an oblique reference to the idea that later became ''Letters from the Earth.'' 
{{cquote|Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community is a MSS. copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest document on earth. It is written on vellum, and is some four or five thousand years old. Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight. Its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast upon it. Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from the high priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished translating it.}}

Louis J. Budd, editor of ''Mark Twain: Collected Tales, Sketches, Speeches, and Essays: Volume 2: 1891-1910'' (1992), a volume in the [[Library of America]] series, places ''Letters from the Earth'' sequentially in 1909.

A stage adaptation of ''Letters from the Earth'' by [[Dan Savage]] was produced in [[Seattle]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiley|first=Brendan|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/on-stage/Content?oid=13727 |title=On Stage Killer Dickens, Trite Twain, Nifty Neel, Limp Lonergan |date= March 2003 |publisher=The Stranger|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected Quotations==
{{cquote|The Creator sat upon the throne, thinking. Behind him stretched the illimitable continent of heaven, steeped in a glory of light and color; before him rose the black night of Space, like a wall. His mighty bulk towered rugged and mountain-like into the zenith, and His divine head blazed there like a distant sun. At His feet stood three colossal figures, diminished to extinction, almost, by contrast -- archangels -- their heads level with His ankle-bone.}}

{{cquote|In time, the Deity perceived that death was a mistake; a mistake, in that it was insufficient; insufficient, for the reason that while it was an admirable agent for the inflicting of misery upon the survivor, it allowed the dead person himself to escape from all further persecution in the blessed refuge of the grave. This was not satisfactory. A way must be conceived to pursue the dead beyond the tomb.}}

{{cquote|Man is a marvelous curiosity. When he is at his very, very best he is a sort of low grade nickel-plated angel; at his worst he is unspeakable, unimaginable; and first and last and all the time he is a sarcasm.}}
{{cquote|He took a pride in man; man was his finest invention; man was his pet, after the housefly . . . .}}
{{cquote|(On the Bible) It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies.}}

Letter VIII on "the law of God" expressed by each gender's physical construction:
{{cquote|(women) There shall be no limit put upon your intercourse with the other sex sexually, at any time of life .. During twenty-three days in every month (in absence of pregnancy) from the time a woman is seven years old till she dies of old age, she is ready for action, and competent. As competent as the candlestick is to receive the candle. Competent every day, competent every night. Also she wants that candle -- yearns for it, longs for it, hankers after it, as commanded by the law of God in her heart .. her plant has to be out of service three days in the month, and during a part of her pregnancy. These are times of discomfort, often of suffering. For fair and just compensation she has the high privilege of unlimited adultery all the other days of her life. (on a 50 year old man's great grand mother) as good as new. There is nothing the matter with her plant. Her candlestick is as firm as ever}}
{{cquote|(men) During your entire life you shall be under inflexible limits and restrictions, sexually .. man is only briefly competent; and only then in the moderate measure applicable to the word in his sex's case. He is competent from the age of sixteen or seventeen thence-forward for thirty-five years. After fifty his performance is of poor quality, the intervals between are wide, and its satisfactions of no great value to either party .. his candle is increasingly softened and weakened by the weather of age, as the years go by, until at last it can no longer stand, and is mournfully laid to rest in the hope of a blessed resurrection which is never to come.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1141">Christian theological limitarianism teaches that Christ's atonement applies only to the elect (as [[Calvinism]]), and not to all humanity (as [[Christian universalism]] taught), or of [[limited atonement]] and [[irresistible grace]] as [[St. Augustine]] had taught, later associated with classic Calvinism.

Reformed theologian, pastor, and author [[R.C. Sproul]] suggests there is confusion about what the doctrine of [[limited atonement]] actually teaches. While he considers it possible for a person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claims that a person who really understands the other four points ''must'' believe in limited atonement because of what [[Martin Luther]] called a resistless logic.&lt;ref name=Sproul&gt;{{Citation | last = Sproul | first = RC | title = The Truth of the Cross | publisher = Reformation Trust | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-1-56769-087-3 | pages = 140–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
This is a '''list of [[Hindu temple]]s in [[Singapore]]'''. A characteristic of most temples is the presence of murtis (statues) of the Hindu deity to whom the temple is dedicated. They are usually dedicated to one primary deity, the presiding deity, and other deities associated with the main deity. However, some temples are dedicated to several deities, and others are dedicated to murtis in an aniconic form. This is a '''Map of [[Hindu temple]]s in [[Singapore]]'''. 

The following temple list is classified according to the main deity of the temple

The definition and the criteria have changed since the inception of the term. The shrine structures in this list were designated national treasures when the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was implemented on June 9, 1951. As such they are eligible for government grants for repairs, maintenance and the installation of fire-prevention facilities and other disaster prevention systems. Owners are required to announce any changes to the National Treasures such as damage or loss and need to obtain a permit for transfer of ownership or intended repairs.&lt;ref name="chapter06"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The practice of marking sacred areas began in Japan as early as the [[Yayoi period]] (from about 500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting ''[[kami]]'', and subsequently were worshiped as ''[[yorishiro]]''.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt; Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or ''[[torii]]''.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"/&gt; Later, temporary structures similar to present day [[mikoshi|portable shrines]]&lt;ref name="nishi-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings ([[Izumo Taisha]])&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; or storehouses ([[Ise Grand Shrine]]).&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=724}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings had [[gabled roof]]s, raised floors, plank walls, and were [[thatching|thatched]] with reed or covered with [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki cypress]] bark.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"/&gt; Such early shrines did not include a space for worship.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt; Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'',&lt;ref group="ex" name="taisha-zukuri-expl"/&gt; ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]''&lt;ref group="ex" name="shinmei-zukuri-expl"/&gt; and ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''.&lt;ref group="ex" name="sumiyoshi-zukuri-expl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p40"/&gt; They are exemplified by [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] and [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, and date from before 552&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai|式年遷宮祭}}'', the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Presently only the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] is rebuilt every 20 years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuroda2005"/&gt;

Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism was brought to Japan from [[Baekje]], new styles of shrine architecture were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tamura|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of temples as a place of assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'') in addition to the main hall (''[[honden]]'').&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt; The following stylistic elements of [[Buddhist temple]] architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Before wooden columns were placed directly in the ground.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]], curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.&lt;ref name="young-p50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the 8th century as architectural styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in ''[[kasuga-zukuri]]''&lt;ref group="ex" name="kasuga-zukuri-expl"/&gt; ([[Kasuga Shrine]] and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at [[Enjō-ji]]), the flowing roof or ''[[nagare-zukuri]]''&lt;ref name="nagare-zukuri-expl" group="ex"/&gt; ([[Shimogamo Shrine]]), ''[[hachiman-zukuri]]''&lt;ref group="ex" name="hachiman-zukuri-expl"/&gt; ([[Usa Shrine]]) and ''[[hiyoshi-zukuri]]''&lt;ref group="ex" name="hiyoshi-zukuri-expl"/&gt; ([[Hiyoshi Taisha]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nagare-zukuri'' continues to be the more popular style, followed by the ''kasuga-zukuri''.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuroda2005"/&gt; The ''honden'' of [[Ujigami Shrine]] dates to this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Heian period]] ''torii'' and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential ''[[shinden-zukuri]]'' style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as [[Itsukushima Shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auxiliary Marōdo Shrine at [[Itsukushima Shrine]] originates from the 13th-century [[Kamakura period]], and the ''honden'' and ''haiden'' of the [[Kibitsu Shrine]] date from the 15th-century [[Muromachi period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 16th century and early 17th century, during the [[Momoyama period]], ''[[gongen-zukuri]]'' was introduced as a new plan of building shrines. The main hall was joined to the [[Haiden (Shinto)|oratory]] via a connecting structure called the ''ai-no-ma'', derived from the ''hachiman-zukuri'' style. Examples of ''[[gongen-zukuri]]'' are the ''honden'' at [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] and [[Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] dates from the [[Edo period]] and was completed in 1636. It is a complex assembly of richly adorned shrines, temples and a mausoleum.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p726"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes are a result of the [[Shinbutsu shūgō|syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism]] which began to appear during the Heian period; [[Kitano Tenman-gū]], built in 947 for the spirit of [[Sugawara no Michizane]], was the first of these ''byō'' or ''[[jingū-ji]]''.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The 40&lt;ref group="nb" name="itsukushima-reg"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="aoiaso-reg"/&gt; entries in the list consist of the following: main halls (''[[honden]]''), combined structures of ''honden'', ''haiden'' with or without an ''ai-no-ma'' or ''heiden'' in between, oratories (''haiden''), offering halls (''heiden''), corridors, gates, fences, purification halls and other halls that are related to a shrine.

[[File:Living the Questions logo.jpg|thumb|Living the Questions logo]]
'''Living the Questions''' is a "DVD and web-based curriculum&amp;nbsp;... designed to help people wrestle with the relevance of Christianity in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpc.org/review/review.cfm?review_id=69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108094316/http://tcpc.org/review/review.cfm?review_id=69 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing out of two United Methodist congregations in Arizona, the curriculum is part of the larger movement of [[Progressive Christianity]] and is distributed through the Internet and through several denominational publishing divisions like [[Cokesbury]] and Logos Productions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cokesbury.com/forms/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=645096&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.logosproductions.com/content/living-questions-20&lt;/ref&gt; Created{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} to resource moderate to more liberally-minded Christians, Living the Questions (LtQ) offers an alternative to the [[Alpha Course]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} {{As of | 2016}} the LtQ curriculum is in use in nearly 5000 churches across North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livingthequestions.com/xcart/pages.php?pageid=4&lt;/ref&gt;

Living the Questions does not offer a "systematic theology", but is more of a thematic overview born of day-to-day conversation and questions raised in local parishes. Utilizing both written material (downloadable from the web) and DVD-based input from "some of the most outspoken and respected voices in today's theological circles",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpc.org/review/review.cfm?review_id=69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108094316/http://tcpc.org/review/review.cfm?review_id=69 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; LtQ curricula seek to expose lay people to the complex theological questions and perspectives that are taught in seminaries but that often don't "trickle down" into the local churches. The programs do not aim to spell out new doctrine or to develop new dogma, but to resource people who are in the midst of a lifelong conversation about the mysteries of [[faith]] and [[personal life | life]]. In her book, ''Christianity for the Rest of Us'', [[Diana Butler Bass]] notes that both the Living the Questions program and its methodology were part of the success and vitality of one of her subject churches, Trinity Episcopal Church in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Diana Butler, Christianity for the Rest of Us: How the Neighborhood Church is Transforming the Faith. San Francisco, Harper Collins Publishers, 2006, pg 282.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Big Christianity: What's Right with the Religious Left'', author Jan G. Linn wrote: "Living the Questions is a welcomed&amp;nbsp;... alternative to literalism that has promise in helping Christians find the biblical grounding for Bigger Christianity." He affirms that "faith questions are consistent with a desire to grow into spiritual maturity" with a quote from the mission of the Living the Questions series:
{{quote|People know that at its core, Christianity has something good to offer the human race. At the same time, many have a sense that they are alone in being a "thinking" Christian and that "salvaging" Christianity is a hopeless task. What is needed is a safe environment where they have permission to ask the questions they've always wanted to ask but have been afraid to voice for fear of being thought a heretic.&lt;ref&gt;Linn, Jan G., Big Christianity: What's Right with the Religious Left, Louisville, Kentucky, Westminster John Knox Press, 2006, pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Living the Questions Session, St. Luke's Anglican.JPG|thumb|Living the Questions Session at St. Luke's Anglican, North London]]Reviewers have called Living the Questions both "enlightening and inspiring" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www396.ssldomain.com/tcpc/review/review.cfm?review_id=166 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125307/https://www396.ssldomain.com/tcpc/review/review.cfm?review_id=166 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "fascinating" in that the series raises questions many have "thought about but have been afraid to ask, and topics they know are important but don't hear mentioned in church". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connectionsonline.org/Connpdf/11-07Conn.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225955/http://www.connectionsonline.org/Connpdf/11-07Conn.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US liberal flagship mainline church magazine ''The [[Christian Century]]'' criticizes the original 12-session version of Living the Questions for taking a fundamentalist-like position, "close to a mirror image" of "fundamentalists".&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_7_122/ai_n13795015/pg_2/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle course has since{{when?|date=December 2016}} been expanded{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} to nearly twice the original length, doubling the number of contributing participants and broadening the mix of contributors to include more women, more racial minorities, and more representation from the LGBT community.

== Producers ==
Living the Questions is co-created by the Arizonan [[United Methodist]] ministers Jeff Procter-Murphy and David Felten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viadecristo.com/index.php?page=our_pastor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefountainsumc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; They have been recognized by Bishop [[John Shelby Spong]] as "two of the most gifted young clergy I have ever met"&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby, ''Eternal Life: A New Vision'', San Francisco, HarperOne, 2010, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; and being among the younger generation of clergy and theological future thinkers saying,

{{quote|I see future thinkers&amp;nbsp;– yes, overtly Christian thinkers&amp;nbsp;– already on the horizon and eager to go to places in their writing that it has not yet occurred to me to walk. I think especially of such people as [[Gretta Vosper]] in Ontario, Ian Lawton in Michigan, Eric Elnes in Nebraska, [[Carlton Pearson]] and [[Robin Meyers]] in Oklahoma, Jeff Procter-Murphy and David Felten in Arizona, Hugh Dawes in England and Greg Jenks in Australia, whom I regard as the most creative church-related voices in the next generation. Each will make an enormous impact on the emerging Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby, Eternal Life: A New Vision, San Francisco, HarperOne, 2010, pg. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Based on the Living the Questions curriculum and written by the series creators, David Felten and Jeff Procter-Murphy, the book ''Living the Questions: The Wisdom of Progressive Christianity'' was released by HarperOne (an imprint of [[HarperCollins]]) in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Living-the-Questions-David-Felten?isbn=9780062109361&amp;HCHP=TB_Living+the+Questions&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20049">'''The Reverend Dr. Lonnie Latham''' (born January 7, 1946) served as the senior pastor of South Tulsa Baptist Church, in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], a post he held from 2002 to January 6, 2006, when he resigned from that position as well as from the executive committee of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (where he served as one of four such members from [[Oklahoma]]), and as the recording secretary of the Southern Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma. His resignation came after his arrest for lewdness. He was later acquitted of the lewdness charge on March 7, 2007.

==History in the Tulsa Metro Baptist Association==
Lonnie Latham was elected director of missions for the Tulsa Metro Baptist Association during their November 13–14, 2000 meeting. The meeting also saw the controversial adoption of the [[Baptist Faith and Message]], a pivotal document in the Southern Baptist Convention's "Conservative Resurgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethicsdaily.com/article_detail.cfm?AID=6311 |title=SBC President's Anti-Jewish Remark Helped Spark Conservative Revolution |first=Daniel |last=Goodman |publisher=EthicsDaily.com |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2007-05-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135708/http://ethicsdaily.com/article_detail.cfm?AID=6311 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, Latham has spoken out against expansion of tribal gaming in Oklahoma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/showdoc.html?id%3D2701 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420021138/http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/showdoc.html?id=2701 |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as against homosexuality. In the latter vein, he supported the SBC's adoption of a policy encouraging Baptists to befriend [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] and to help them "reject their sinful, destructive lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Southern Baptist Pastor Arrested for Gay Sex Offer | url = http://www.exgaywatch.com/wp/2006/01/southern-baptis/ | first = Timothy | last = Kincaid | date = 2006-01-05 | publisher = [[Ex-Gay Watch]] | accessdate = 2007-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 16, 2001 edition of ''Tulsa World'' describes Latham as executive director of the Tulsa Metro Baptist Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/assault/A_1_9_16.pdf ''Clergy see spiritual rebirth as downcast Americans ask why''] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to gambling==
On Tuesday, October 26, 2004, one week before the 2004 General Election, Latham addressed the subject of State Question 712, a referendum on the expansion of tribal gaming and installation of gambling machines at three local racetracks. Speaking to attendees of the Tulsa Press Club’s “Two Views” luncheon, Latham said:
:''"It grieves my heart to think we would do anything to undermine the effectiveness of the average home or the average person in our state...We don’t need gambling to help Oklahoma. What we do need is an empathetic heart toward small business. Through them, we’ll gain a true economic base for our state."''

“The petition would be to allow the state’s people to vote on whether or not they want this kind of casino gambling in the state,” he said. “.... We’re hoping that we can gather not only 51,000 names but also many more who will see this as the moral issue that it is.”

Latham also said the social costs of gaming outweigh its benefits, and he opposed efforts to establish a [[Oklahoma Lottery|state lottery]].

State voters eventually approved both expanded Indian gaming and a lottery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativetimes.com/index.asp?action=displayarticle&amp;article_id=7413 ''Native American Times'' 1/5/2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518185754/http://nativetimes.com/index.asp?action=displayarticle&amp;article_id=7413 |date=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 arrest==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RevLonnieLanthamArrestPhoto.jpg|right|thumb|50px|frame|Arrest photo of Lonnie Latham, provided by Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office.]] --&gt;

On Tuesday, January 3, 2006, Latham was arrested and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail by members of the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oklahomacounty.org/cosheriff/InmateQuery/bookingdetail.asp?PERSON_ID=200058274&lt;/ref&gt; The misdemeanor charge was that of "Offering to Engage In An Act of [[Lewdness]]," a charge carrying penalties of up to a year in jail and a US$2,500 fine. Reports sourced to a police department spokesman said that he had propositioned a [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] [[police officer]] for [[oral sex]] in an area of the community which had been the subject of public complaints of cruising related to male [[prostitution]].

Latham was arrested around 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. and his automobile was impounded. The arrest took place in the parking lot of The Habana Inn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmgallery.com/artwork/press/miller.html&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Latham followed a plainclothes police officer's car for several blocks, ultimately pulling up beside it. Latham told the officer that he enjoyed "a particular lewd act" and then solicited the police officer to perform the act at a room Latham said he had booked at the nearby Holiday Inn Express. Latham did not offer money in exchange, so he was not charged with soliciting prostitution.

Upon posting bail, Latham contested the charge to local television reporters, saying "I was set up. I was in the area pastoring to police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channeloklahoma.com/news/5845859/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107142111/http://www.channeloklahoma.com/news/5845859/detail.html |archivedate=2006-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I was involved in a prayer ministry in that area, and I had a dialogue with police," he said, according to the website of the Daily Oklahoman newspaper. "The officer made many suggestions."

According to police officials, Latham made no mention of prayer, told the officer his name was "Luke," and said he was from Dallas and worked frequently in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2006/01_06_2006/ne060106sbc.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111160907/http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2006/01_06_2006/ne060106sbc.shtml |archivedate=2006-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not Latham's first visit to the area. Public records show that on December 2, 1998, at about 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Latham was issued a traffic ticket for "failure to stop for a stop sign" at NW 39th and Frankford. This intersection is only blocks from where Latham was arrested and serves as rear access to the Habanna Inn."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johntv.com/images/tickets/12-02-98-Latham_ticket.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} PDF Document&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction within the Southern Baptist Convention===
South Tulsa Baptist Church issued the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stbc.net/statement.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108155041/http://stbc.net/statement.jpg |archivedate=2006-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We are deeply grieved to hear the news about our pastor, Lonnie Latham. Our first concerns are with Lonnie, his family, and our church family. We will be focused on doing what we can to minister to everyone in this difficult time. Our church has a great history and a great future of ministry in this community. We would appreciate your prayers."

On January 8, 2006 Rev. Lonnie Latham notified The Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma that he was resigning from the BGCO Board of Directors effective immediately.

“We are deeply saddened by the recent events regarding Lonnie. We continue to be concerned for South Tulsa Baptist Church and the Latham family. We pray Lonnie will find healing and restoration as he seeks help for the issues he faces,” said Heidi B. Wilburn, spokeswoman for the BGCO. "Lonnie’s resignation has been accepted without the BGCO Board of Directors having to take initiative regarding the matter. Lonnie also indicated he has resigned from the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channeloklahoma.com/news/5887178/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219061349/http://www.channeloklahoma.com/news/5887178/detail.html |archivedate=2006-02-19 |df= }} Pastor Accused Of Lewdness Resigns From Convention&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pamspaulding.com/graphics/statement2.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109161729/http://www.pamspaulding.com/graphics/statement2.jpg |archivedate=2006-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Jordan, BGCO executive director-treasurer, spoke with Baptist Press after having talked with Latham.

"We have a dual responsibility," Jordan said.

"From the standpoint of the church and, certainly, as brothers in Christ, we are to hold Lonnie to the biblical standard of morality and to hold him accountable for his actions." He added, "Lonnie has responded to that admonition by resigning from his church, asking their forgiveness and stepping aside to seek healing.

"At the same time, in the midst of failure, the church is to be a place of restoration," he said. "That is the biblical admonition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2006/01_09_2006/ne090106sbc.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214130316/http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2006/01_09_2006/ne090106sbc.shtml |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2006 a letter from Latham to his congregation was released.  [[Morris Chapman]], CEO of the Southern Baptist Convention, says of Latham - "In spite of his denials soon after his arrest, he now acknowledges the incident did happen and that he needs help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotv.com/main/home/stories.asp?whichpage%3D1%26id%3D96711 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421084447/http://www.kotv.com/main/home/stories.asp?whichpage=1&amp;id=96711 |archivedate=2006-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Charles A. Cruce, Director of Missions for The Tulsa Metro Association of Baptist Churches posted the following message:

:"Our association of churches is saddened by the recent news concerning our former Executive Director, Dr. Lonnie Latham, now pastor of our own South Tulsa Baptist Church.  We hurt deeply for Lonnie, for his loved ones, and for the wonderful church that he pastors. While we certainly do not condone this type of behavior, it is so important for us to remember that Lonnie is one of our own and our actions toward him as a fellow member of God’s Family should be responses of [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]].   What has happened in this situation only demonstrates that we are all human, that we all make mistakes and that we all fail. That is why we need a [[wiktionary:Savior|Savior]] who heals, who forgives, and who restores ... that’s why we need [[Jesus]]."{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Reaction from within the GLBT community===
[[Jamie McDaniel]], a spokesperson for [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]] who works to change the antigay policies of the SBC, said: "It’s tragic that so many, like Rev. Latham, have never been told the truth that they can live with dignity and express their God-given sexuality in ways that are open, honest, loving and life-affirming. Trapped by Southern Baptist misinformation, many people of faith think their only option is to live a dark and secretive double-life. The SBC needs to be held accountable for causing this kind of needless suffering."{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Writes Leslie Robinson of the gay newspaper, ''The Dallas Voice'', "Whew, good thing I’m not required to take such a high-minded approach. I appreciate that Latham has likely been suffering a long time, and that his family is in pain. But the man has been a colonel in the campaign against us, so I prefer to point, yell 'Hypocrite!' and resign myself to the fact that I won’t be on Soulforce’s Christmas-card list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/artman/publish/article_1030.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210131951/http://www.dallasvoice.com/artman/publish/article_1030.php |archivedate=2006-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 6 press release, The [[National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce]] commented: "This isn't the first time he's been in the area, having received a traffic violation there a few years back.

"Rev. Latham has been an outspoken opponent of...rights for
[[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people. And, of course,
in recent years the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] - the nation's
largest [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] - has become increasingly
[[homophobic]] and aligned itself with the worst elements of the far
right in working to stop [[Same-sex marriage|Marriage Equality]] for gay people...

"These kinds of situations involving anti-gay political and religious leaders being caught, literally, with their pants down are hardly uncommon. My instinctual reaction has always been one
of smug satisfaction - "serves the damn [[hypocrite]] right."

"...I only feel sadness for Rev. Latham and his family."{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Rev. Dr. Mel White, founder of [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]], an organization which works on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people to oppose religious and political oppression, commented about Rev. Latham's arrest: "No one should have to come out via an undercover sting operation. That is its own evil. Until the Southern Baptist Convention ends their spiritual violence against gay and lesbian people, tragedies like this will continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soulforce.org/article/741 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209015310/http://www.soulforce.org/article/741 |archivedate=2006-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results of criminal trial==
On February 2, 2006, Latham pleaded not guilty to the lewdness charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kotv.com/main/home/stories.asp?whichpage=1&amp;id=96889{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then heard in a non-jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscn.net/applications/ocisweb/GetCaseInformation.asp?submitted=true&amp;viewtype=caseGeneral&amp;casemasterID=1996992&amp;db=Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2007, Latham was found to be not guilty by Special Judge Roma McElwee, who said her ruling was based on the evidence and not on the issue of the constitutionality of the law in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0307/403600.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316041052/http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0307/403600.html |archivedate=2007-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acluok.org/LegislatureCourts/BaptistMinister'sCaseContinues.htm{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030702267.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026055203/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030702267.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-10-26 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latham's attorney, [[Mack Martin]], has told reporters that what his client did was [[Constitutionally protected]] and shouldn't be a crime. “It’s like saying you’re arrested for crossing the street — so what?” Martin said. “This is a major [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issue.”

Mack says he feels the only reason that the court is pursuing charges is because of pressure from the media attention.

But Oklahoma City District Attorney Wes Lane says, “The law in Oklahoma prohibits an individual from soliciting another to engage in what is considered a [[lewd]] act regardless of whether money is sought for or exchanged.” The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a brief for Latham,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/lgbt/discrim/24032prs20060201.html&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the law is unconstitutional because it makes it a crime for an adult to ask another adult to engage in legal conduct.

[[File:Lou en Mientje Voorthuijzen (1967).jpg|thumb|Mientje and Lou Voorthuijzen (1967)]]
'''Lou de Palingboer''' (19 February 1898 - 23 March 1968) was the founder and figurehead of a [[new religious movement]] in the [[Netherlands]].

==Information==
Lou was born '''Louwrens Voorthuijzen''' in [[Breezand]]. He had a strong religious interest from an early age, probably under the influence of his devout father. He chose the profession of [[fisherman]]. After a failed marriage he met [[Mien Wiertz]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmina Wiertz, *14-08-1914 in Baarn&lt;/ref&gt; and began to believe under her influence that he must save the world from the devil.

Voorthuijzen sold his boat and took up employment as an eel vendor at the [[Dappermarkt]] in Amsterdam, where he became known as ''Lou de Palingboer'' (''Lou the eel vendor''). From his market stall, he preached to his customers that he was "the resurrected body of Jesus Christ". He would elaborate further in a nearby café. A circle of followers formed around him. In 1954, he began holding weekly meetings in the ''Frascati'' and ''De Brakke Grond'' theatres, where he captivated his audience with a mix of mystical language and down-to-earth humour.

In 1957, a rich supporter bought a large house in [[Muiderberg]] in the municipality [[Muiden]]. They called it the "White House", and lived in it communally. His followers believed him to be a God. According to [[Harry Mulisch]]'s ''Voer voor psychologen'' (''Fodder for Psychologists''), he claimed to be the author of the Bible. Some members of his group rejected medicine in favour of his blessing as a cure for ailments. Lou himself claimed to be immortal.

Around this time, Dutch society began to see them as a cult. Tensions frequently arose when one partner of a couple was not "in Lou" and the other one was. This resulted in a number of divorces in which Lou was summoned to testify, which he disliked. Lou moved to [[Agimont]] in the French-speaking part of [[Belgium]] to avoid summons of this kind.

After his death in Belgium in 1968, the movement seems to have dissipated. Wiertz, who moved to Spain, continues to have faith in him and there are a few other elderly believers left.

'''Lur''' (Lurs, Luridus, Lurmitla) is an [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] [[deity]] with not much known history. Lurs does not have many depictions but the ones that have been found show the deity as a male. He has been noted to be associated with a prophetic nature, while also bearing oracular and martial characteristics. He has been linked to another deity by the name of [[Laran]], which suggest is where Lur derives his name from. The context of the name has been associated with darkness and the underworld. A fifth century vase found near a sanctuary in [[Sans Giovenale]] reads an inscription that translates: "I am Lurs, that of Laran."{{sfn|Gleba|Becker|2008|pages=217-227}} Another inscription has been found with the spelling of his name as ''lartla'', noting relations to a Lar, which gives a label to Lur that describes features of protection.{{sfn|Maras|2009}}

[[File:Lur3.jpg|thumb|Piece of shard found during an excavation in Cetamura]]
There is not much information about Lur except from the various evidence found in differing areas. In [[Corchiano]], a [[candelabrum]] dating around 400-350 BCE was found with an inscription in dedication to Lur. A [[bucchero]] [[chalice]] founded by a small shrine near a bridge in [[San Giovenale]] does not specifically have inscribed but ''laruniθla'', again, relating Lur to other gods with similar name epithets. A bronze sheet from [[Perugia]] reads a translation "dedicated to Lvrmita", suggesting the gods' oracular characteristic. In addition, a bronze statuette possibly from [[Orvieto]] features a man, perhaps [[Vel Matunas]], given the inscription on the cloak. The statuette has another votive inscription that translates to "precious/sacred gift to Lur", also contributing to his oracular nature.{{sfn|Getty|2002}}

[[File:Bronze Mirror of Tinia and Lur.jpg|thumb|Bronze Mirror of Tinia, Lur and another unknown young man found in Vulci. Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow. Ca, 350 BCE]]
Lur has also been mentioned on two lead tablets, one from [[Magliano in Toscana|Magliano]] and another from [[Santa Marinella]]. The latter shows a connection to [[Tinia]] and reinforces this relation with other findings in [[Bolsena]] inscribed with ''lurs'' near two Tinia altars.{{sfn|Maras|2009}} However, the most prominent evidence discovered concerning Lur is a bronze mirror from Vulci.{{sfn|Boardman|1981}} The mirror is an extension of Lurs relationship with Tinia. In the ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'', H.L Stoltenberg describes the scene present with three figures, Tinia, Lur, and an unknown young man. Tinia is in the middle, identifiable by the lightning bolt. He is wearing a chiton and looking to his right with his right arm raised. The unknown young man sits, appearing to be listening to whatever Tinia might be saying. To the left of the mirror, and Tinias right, sits Lur. He is naked except for a cloak, which is only noticeable from the seal around his neck. His head is thrown back, hair frizzled, and mouth partially open. He carries a sword in his right hand and his left is gesturing towards Tinia. A head coming from the clouds is also seen and has been implied to be delivering a message to Lur.{{sfn|De Grummond|2010}} With the combinations of Lurs behavior and gestures, the mirror amplifies a prophetic deity.

== Cult ==
The numerous [[candelabra]] founded with Lur inscriptions suggest the object was notable as an offering to the god. An excavation at a sanctuary in [[Cetamura]] where a shard with an inscribed Lurs was found, likewise pieces of iron founded fit together to indicate potentially a candelabrum. The bronze [[Vel Matunas]] statuette again enforces the cult of Lur. In [[Gravisca]], by the [[Sacellum Alpha]], a miniature shrine, an impasto bowl inscribed with Lur was found. Additionally, a bronze strip from [[Perugia]], as well as a small altar in [[Vulci]] both including dedications to ''lurmitla''. The gods name furthermore, is including on the [[Piacenza]] liver twice. Scholars have debated with the evidence at hand what exactly the deity Lur oversees. Archaeologist Giovanni Colonna asserts a dark and underworld type of god, while D.F Maras thought of him as more of a warlike and prophetic god. Contrastingly, L. Bouke Van der Meer labels Lur as having the combined qualities.{{sfn|De Grummond|2009}}

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
'''Mawlānā''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɔː|ˈ|l|ɑː|n|ə}}; from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|مولانا}}, literally "our lord/master")&lt;ref&gt;defined in the ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' as "a form of address to a sovereign"&lt;/ref&gt; is a title, mostly in [[Central Asia]] and in the [[Indian subcontinent]], preceding the name of respected [[Muslim]] religious leaders, in particular graduates of religious institutions, e.g. a [[madrassa]] or a [[darul uloom]], or scholars who have studied under other Islamic scholars.

== Other uses ==
Although the word is derived from the Arabic word ''[[mawla]]'', it adopted different meanings as it travelled from [[Arabia]] to [[Persia]], [[Turkey]], [[Africa]] and the Indian subcontinent.

=== Persian use===
In Iran and Turkey the word normally refers to ''[[Rumi]]'' (Persian pronunciation ''Mowlana'') (Turkish pronunciation ''Mevlana'').

=== Africa ===
This word has been borrowed into the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] language, where it is used also as a title of respect for revered members of a community, religious or secular, roughly equivalent to the English "Sir". 

In the mostly Muslim region of [[West Africa]], the root has been proposed as a source for the words ''Mallam'' ([[Hausa language]]) and ''Maame'' ([[Wolof language]]), which are used to denote Islamic scholars, or in areas practising [[folk Islam]] or [[folk magic]], a local [[shaman]]. Among the Hausas the word ''Mallam'' is additionally used as equivalent of English ''Mr''. A more likely explanation for this word (and for the Swahili ''mwalimu'') is the Arabic word ''mu'allim'' ({{lang|ar|معلم}}), which in [[Moroccan Arabic]] is pronounced "m'allam" and means ‘teacher’ or ‘master’ in a Qur'anic school.

== Difference in titles ''Mullah'' and ''Maulvi'' among Muslims in South Asia ==
In the Central Asian and South Asian / Indian subcontinent context, where "Mullah" does not carry a formal sense, ''Maulana'' is often the word of choice for addressing or referring to Muslim religious scholars that are respected, while ''Mullah'' is used often derogatorily for people the speaker considers to be more rabble-rousers than scholars.

Although the words ''Maulvi'' and ''Maulana'' are interchanged in the Indian Subcontinent as a title of respect, ''Maulana'' is more often associated with formal qualification following study at a [[madrassa]] or [[darul uloom]] and ''[[Maulvi]]'' is usually more a general title for religious figures. In [[Bangladesh]], in the government Aliyah madrassa system, ''Maulvi'' is also associated with formal degrees for those who have passed the course of ''Maulvi'' (basic), ''Maulvi Alim'' (intermediate) or ''Maulvi Fazil'' (advanced).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12180">'''Mesivta''' (also '''metivta'''; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: מתיבתא, "academy") is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[yeshiva]] [[secondary school]] for boys. The term is commonly used in the United States to describe a yeshiva that emphasizes [[Talmud]]ic studies for boys in grades 9 through 11 or 12; alternately, it refers to the religious studies track in a yeshiva high school that offers both religious and secular studies.&lt;ref name=helm&gt;Helmreich (2000), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council for Jewish Education (1978), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The comparable term in Israel is '''Yeshiva Ketana''' ({{lang-he|ישיבה קטנה}}, lit. "small yeshiva").&lt;ref&gt;Berezovsky (2001), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from a mesivta, students progress to a [[beth midrash|beis medrash]], or undergraduate-level, yeshiva program.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer (1984), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, yeshivas that call themselves mesivtas are usually a combination of mesivta (high-school) and beis medrash (post-high-school) programs.&lt;ref&gt;Helmreich (2000), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the beis medrash program are often called upon to mentor those in the mesivta.&lt;ref&gt;Helmreich (2000), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In Talmudic and Geonic eras===
The term ''metivta''  first appears in the Talmud, where it refers to a yeshiva of Talmudic sages. [[Abba Arika]] learned in the metivta in [[Sepphoris]] under [[Judah the Prince]], his son, and grandson.&lt;ref&gt;Holder (2004), pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of [[Abba Arika|Rav]] and [[Samuel of Nehardea|Shmuel]], the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academy]] of [[Sura (city)|Sura]] during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]] was called a ''sidra'', but under [[Rav Huna]], the second dean of the Academy of Sura, the yeshiva began to be called a ''metivta'' and Huna was the first to hold the title of ''resh metivta'' (corresponding to ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Singer and Adler (1925), p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]], the ''metivta'' convened in certain months of the year.&lt;ref name="graetz"&gt;Graetz (1893), p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metivta'' frameworks continued to operate throughout the era of the [[Geonim]], a period of approximately 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sorski (1982), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-day concept===
Rabbi [[Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz]] introduced the concept of a mesivta as a Talmudic studies program for boys aged 14 and older in New York in 1926. Until that time, religious boys attended [[Talmud Torah]] (elementary school) until their [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] and then went on to public high school and college, where their level of Torah observance and commitment were sorely tested. The only post-bar mitzvah religious education available at the time was at [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary|Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon]]'s [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy|Talmudical Academy]] (founded 1916),&lt;ref&gt;".. first Jewish High School in America--Talmudical Academy, 1916." {{cite book  |title=The Jewish Forum - Volume 5 |page=67
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIEzAQAAMAAJ  |author=E. Neufeld  |date=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The World of the Yeshiva: An Intimate Portrait of Orthodox Jewry
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0881256420  |isbn=0881256420
|author=William B. Helmreich  |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prepared students for a career in the rabbinate.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (2001), pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mendlowitz, who had begun teaching at the [[Yeshiva Torah Vodaas]] elementary school in 1923, suggested the innovation, he was met with widespread resistance. An editorial in the ''[[Jewish Morning Journal|Yiddish Morgen Journal]]'' stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Reform have a rabbinical Seminary in Cincinnati, and the Conservative have the Solomon Schechter Seminary in New York, so should Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon suffice [to produce Orthodox rabbis].&lt;ref name="harry"&gt;Astor (2003), pp. 16-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the support of three Torah Vodaas board members – [[Binyomin Wilhelm]], Ben Zion Weberman, and Abraham Lewin – Mendlowitz successfully opened Mesivta Torah Vodaas in its own building in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], in September 1926. The mesivta opened with four classes of post-bar mitzvah students and 11 students in the advanced, beis medrash program. The mesivta went on to graduate generations of students who became Torah scholars and leaders in the American Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (2001), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendlowitz also influenced the administration at Yeshivas Chaim Berlin to expand beyond eighth grade and open a mesivta as well. Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin opened in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (2001), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mesivtas founded in the 1930s and 1940s were [[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem|Mesivta Tifereth Jerusalem]], Kaminetzer Mesivta of Boro Park, and [[Rabbi Jacob Joseph School]]. In the 1950s, the latter four mesivtas had their own basketball league.&lt;ref&gt;Helmreich (2000), p. 369, note 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau (2006), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Mendlowitz founded '''Camp Mesivta''', the first yeshiva summer camp in America, in [[Ferndale, New York]]. This became the summer camp of choice for thousands of students from other yeshivas&lt;ref name="harry"/&gt; and a prototype for yeshiva learning camps in later decades. Mendlowitz instituted the practice of inviting [[Gadol|Gedolim]] to visit the camp for a few days or a few weeks, giving campers the experience of seeing Torah greats in action. The Gedolim who regularly stayed at Camp Mesivta included Rabbi [[Yaakov Kamenetsky]], Rabbi [[Shlomo Heiman]], Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], and Rabbi [[Avraham Kalmanowitz]]. Camp Mesivta operated until the early 1960s; in 1966, it was succeeded by Camp Ohr Shraga-Beis Medrash LeTorah in Greenfield Park, New York, headed by Rabbi [[Zelik Epstein]] and Rabbi [[Nesanel Quinn]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (2001), pp. 275–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesivtas today==
Today mesivtas are located in cities throughout the United States that have a sizable Orthodox Jewish population. Since the 1980s, the number of mesivtas in the New York/New Jersey area has mushroomed. Whereas before there were at most a handful of schools to choose from, today every city with a religious Jewish population and nearly every [[Township (United States)|township]] has a yeshiva high school. Because of the proliferation, mesivtas have developed reputations that reflect the academic level of their students. There are schools for ''metzuyanim'' (top learners), schools for average students, and schools for students with "serious scholastic and/or ''yirat shamayim'' (religious belief) challenges". Some mesivtas operate different "tracks" to satisfy a diverse student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.mishpacha.com/Browse/Article/699/Navigating-The-Mesivta-Maze |last=Blum |first=Shimmy |title=Navigating the Mesivta Maze |work=[[Mishpacha]] |date=2 February 2011|accessdate=4 September 2011|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesivtas, like yeshivas, do not follow the public education schedule of terms and vacations, but organize the school year according to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. School is in recess during [[Jewish holidays]], and the term ends in the month of [[Av]], the traditional break for yeshivas since the days of the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. (2006), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[dress code]]: whereas in elementary school, boys wear casual clothes to school, upon entering mesivta, they are expected to dress in dark suits and white shirts.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen (1985), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nam Cho''' ({{bo|w=gnam chos}}, [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription|THL transcription]]: '''namchö''') translates as the "sky/space dharma", a [[Terma (religion)|terma]] cycle especially popular among the [[Palyul]] lineage of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It was revealed by the [[tertön]] [[Namchö Migyur Dorje]], transmitted to [[Kunzang Sherab]] and compiled by the [[Kagyu]] school master [[Karma Chagme]].

The Nam Cho comprises an entire cycle of practices ranging from preliminary practice ([[ngöndro]]) to the "pointing out instructions" of [[dzogchen]]. While Migyur Dorje's terma are said to have originated from his visionary encounters with deities, they also include instructions based on his own insights.

By and large they cover diverse subjects such as: 
*i) ritual offerings (''bsang, chab gtor, bum gter'');
*ii) funeral rites (''byang chog'');
*iii) popular empowerments for long-life (''tshe dbang''); health (''sman lha dbang''); and wealth (''nor dbang'');
*iv) thread rituals and protective amulets (''mdos, srung ba'');
*v) rites for propitiating [[dharmapala|protector deities]] (''chos skyong, zhing skyong, gter srung''); demons (''btsan / gnod sbyin / bdud''); high heaven spirits (''lha''); mountain gods (''spom ri / thang lha''); [[nāga]]s (''klu''); and earth spirits (''sa bdag'');
*vi) divination and astrology (''rde’u dkar mo / spar kha / rtsis'');
*vii) preliminary tantric practices (''sngon ’gro'');
*viii) tantric practices (''rmi lam, 'pho ba, gtum mo, phur ba, gcod'') and commentaries (''rgyud ’grel'');
*ix) [[Pure land]] sādhanas (''zhing khams sgrub'') and hundreds of meditation practices on peaceful (''zhi ba'') and wrathful (''khro bo'') deities grouped under well-known [[Vajrayana]] cycles (''chos skor''), such as the Bde mchog; Gu ru drag po; Ma ning; Sgrol ma; Phag mo; and 
*x) Dzogchen philosophical commentaries (''khrid'')&lt;ref&gt;Halkias, Georgios. 2006. ‘Pure-Lands and other Visions in Seventeenth-Century Tibet: a Gnam-chos sādhana for the pure-land Sukhāvatī revealed in 1658 by Gnam-chos Mi-’gyur-rdo-rje (1645-1667).’ In Power, Politics and the Reinvention of Tradition: Tibet in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28041">This article on '''nudity in religion''' deals with the differing attitudes to [[nudity]] and [[modesty]] among world [[religion]]s.

==Ancient Greek religion==
[[File:Venere di Milo 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of ''[[Aphrodite of Milos]]'', the Greek goddess of love and beauty, ({{circa|100}} BC), [[Louvre]]]]
[[Hesiod]] the writer of the poem ''[[Theogony]]'', which describes the origins and genealogies of the [[Greek gods]] in [[Ancient Greek religion]], suggested that farmers should "Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all [[Demeter]]'s fruits in due season."{{sfn|Villing|2010|p=40}} [[Demeter]] is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.

== Abrahamic religions ==

The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all recount the legend of the [[Garden of Eden]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]].  After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with fig leaves.{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:74|NIV}} Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with [[original sin]], an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth. {{efn|when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies.{{Cite quran|7|22}} }} This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it.{{efn|O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best.{{Cite quran|7|26}} }} Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.

=== Judaism ===
{{see also|Tzniut}}

In Judaism, nudity is an aspect of [[body modesty]] which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of [[Tzniut]] which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.

A person who enters a ritual bath (a ''[[mikveh]]'') does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.

Care needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour.{{sfn|Telushkin|1977|p=17-18}} For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of [[Noah]]'s sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son "saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside" what he had done to his father.{{efn|[Noah] drank the wine [of his vineyard] and became drunk. He uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their backs, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And when Noah awoke and learned what [Ham] had done to him, he said "Cursed be Canaan [Ham's son], the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:21-25|NIV}} }}{{efn|it has been suggested that this episode involved Ham doing more than just viewing his father's nakedness.{{sfn|Edwards|1978|p=113}} }} Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Representation of baptism in early Christian art]]
[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|upright|Baptism of [[Clovis I]] (496)]]
''{{Main article|Christian naturism}}''

The early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity.{{sfn|Knights|1999}} In the [[Old Testament]], Isaiah in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|20|NIV}} walk nude as a sign of shame against Egypt. 

The first recorded [[liturgy]] of [[baptism]], written down by Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.{{sfn |Hippolytus|2013|p=33}} {{harvtxt|Guy|2003}}, however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.

Later [[Christian]] attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.

Several saints, such as a number of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as [[Basil Fool for Christ]], practiced nudity as a form of [[ascetic]] poverty.

Early Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the [[Renaissance]], the [[Catholic Church]] was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Michelangelo]], but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the [[Sistine Chapel]] painted by Michelangelo.

{{harvtxt|Smith|1966}}, in discussing [[logion]] 37{{efn|Jesus' disciples ask, "When will you be revealed to us and when will we see you? Jesus said: When you unclothe yourselves without being ashamed and take off your clothes and put them under your feet as little children and tread on them, then [shall you see] the Son of the Living One and you shall not fear"&lt;ref name="free_Gosp"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gospel of Thomas Translated by Paterson Brown | author =  | work = freelyreceive.net | date =  | accessdate = 2016-07-18 | url = http://freelyreceive.net/metalogos/files/thomas.html#37 | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }} of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], notes that early Christian art depicts,{{sfn|Wilpert|1929}} as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are [[Jonah]] emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, [[Daniel]] emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref |Ezekiel|37:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the [[resurrection]]. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and one representation of the [[Miracle at Cana]].

In 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person."{{sfn|Wojtyla|2013|p=}}

=== Christian sects ===

Sects have arisen within [[Christianity]] from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the [[Adamites]] and the [[Freedomites]] social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.

Today, [[Christian naturist]]s maintain that [[naturism|social nudity]] is a normal part of Christianity and is acceptable. {{harvtxt|De Clercq|2011}} argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.

=== Islam ===

''{{Main article|Intimate parts in Islam}}''

In [[Islam]] the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the ''[[awrah]]'', and while referred to in the [[Qur'an]], is addressed in more detail in [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bukhari:6:60:282|url=http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/hadith/sunnan_abu_dawud/32/4091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sunni tradition, the male ''awrah'' is from the navel to knees. Other denominations have differing interpretations. For women, there are different classifications of ''awrah''. In public, many Muslim women wear the [[hijab]] and long dresses which covers most of their head and body, with only specific body parts such as hands and face exposed. But in front of direct family (parents, children, siblings), the ''awrah'' is relaxed further, allowing them to be uncovered, except between the chest and the thighs. [[Sharia]] law in some Islamic countries requires women to observe [[purdah]], covering their entire bodies, including the face (see [[niqab]] and [[burqa]]), However, the degrees of covering vary according to local custom and/or interpretation of Sharia law.

* '''For men''', the [[awrah]] is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s; inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s). However, in most Islamic cultures, a man is frowned upon should he walk around in public without covering the upper half of his body.
* '''For women''', in front of non-[[mahram]] men and non-Muslim women, the [[awrah]] is the whole body, apart from the hands and the face (and, solely according to the Hanafis, the feet). In front of Muslim women it is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s, inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s), and with [[mahram]] men there are three opinions:
# It is from the shoulders (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive). ([[Hanbali]] opinion)
# It is from the stomach (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive according to the [[Hanafis]], but not according to the [[Shafi'i]]s and [[Maliki]]s). ([[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] opinion)
# It is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (inclusive) when with either. (Alternate [[Hanafi]] opinion)

* '''For both genders''', it is encouraged to wear loose clothing. Note that the awrah is not necessarily what is preferable to wear but what is the bare minimum. It is reported that [[Muhammad]] said, "Modesty is a part of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari and Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian religions ==

[[File:Naga baba.jpg|thumb|right|Naga mystics, at the Hindu bathing ceremony of Ardha [[Kumbh Mela]], at [[Allahabad]]]]

In ancient [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian]] cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously [[minoritarian]]) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the [[gymnosophists]] (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day [[Hindu]] devotion and in [[Jainism]].

=== Hinduism ===
====Philosophical basis====
The philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ ([[Puruṣārtha]]) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) pp.9 and 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Spiritual basis=====
In the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example [[Kali]] is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity. &lt;ref&gt;Pravrajika Vedantaprana, Saptahik Bartaman, Volume 28, Issue 23, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 10 October, 2015) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Trailanga Swami]], the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Material basis=====
In comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book ''The Renaissance in India''. He says about Hinduism in the book – “Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…”&lt;ref&gt; SRINVANTU Magazine, 63, College Street, Kolkata – 700 073(ed. 8th June, 2018) pp.26 and 28 (Website: http://srinvantu.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;
Extreme hedonists and materialists like the [[Charvaka]]s are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, “Marthakamaveva purusharthau” (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;There is another sloka in support of their view – “Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha” (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
For non-hedonists pursuing [[kama]] (sensual pleasures) accompanied with [[dharma]] (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari ([[Lalleshwari]]) &lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 20: We Do Not Visit Kashmir, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;, Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri. &lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) pp. 187 and 251&lt;/ref&gt;Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to  nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the Hindu religious sects, only the [[sadhu]]s (monks) of the [[Nāga]] sect can be seen nude.{{sfn|Crooke|1919}} They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their [[Akhara]] or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during [[Kumbh Mela]]. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a ''[[talwar]]'' ([[sword]]), ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' ([[trident]]), ''bhala'' ([[javelin]]) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siddharth|first1=Gautam|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/Nagas-Once-were-warriors/articleshow/18026313.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times Syndication Service|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

In the ''[[Digambara]]'' sect of [[Jainism]], monks and nuns are "sky-clad" and the members of this sect also keep their holy statues naked. However, the ''[[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambar]]'' sect is "white-clad" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.{{sfn|Sharma| Sharma|2004|p=262}}

== New religious movements ==

=== Neopaganism ===

In many modern [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[religious movement]]s, such as [[Wicca]], social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|''skyclad'']] refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.{{sfn|Zimmermann|Gleason|2006|p=77}}

=== Raëlism ===

In [[Raëlism]], nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of [[topfreedom]] on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual "[[Go Topless Day]]" protest (also known as "National GoTopless Day", "International Go-Topless Day", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Take Off Your Shirt Everybody!

'''Pum-Nahara Academy''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''ישיבת פום נהרא''') was a Jewish [[Yeshiva]] academy in [[Babylon]], during the era of the Jewish [[Amoraim|Amora]] sages, in the town of [[Pum-Nahara]], [[Babylonia]], that was within the area of jurisdiction of [[Sura (city)|Sura city]], and was situated on the east bank of the "Sura" river, nearby the Sura river's [[estuary]] to the [[Tigris]] river,&lt;ref name="Tzuri_PL"&gt;'''Yud Shin Tzuri''', "History of the Hebrew public law - the reign of the Exilarchs and the Yeshivas (The times of [[Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak]] the [[Rosh Kala]] and dean of the Yeshiva academy), [[Mitzpeh Publications]], 1938 {{he icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was granted its name ('''Pum''' = in Aramaic "mouth" or "lips" (i.e. "waterside"); '''Nahara''' =  River; Hence, "The waterside of the River").

A '''Ramadan tent''' is a venue erected during the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] for people to eat the daily [[Iftar]] meal. They are common across the [[Middle East]] and can be found anywhere there are communities of Muslims. Ramadan tents provide a place for people to meet with friends and family after the daily [[Fasting|fast]] is broken at sunset. People gather there to eat Iftar, drink [[tea]], and smoke [[hookah|shisha]]. Ramadan tents are traditionally a family or neighborhood affair in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dajani&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dajani |first1=Haneen |title=This man's Ramadan tent has been feeding hundreds a day for 25 years |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/this-man-s-ramadan-tent-has-been-feeding-hundreds-a-day-for-25-years-1.727586 |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=The National |date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jordanian journalist described a typical Ramadan tent thus in 2008:{{r|Tobin|pp=66}}

{{quote|Under the fluffy colorful ceiling of the big tent, you can treat yourself and friends to various types of sweets, entertainment and distraction until the very early hours of the morning, while playing game after game of cards. A musical band with a leading singer can play classical pieces of Arab music. ... Waiters are dressed in special 19th- or 18th-century attire with the red cylinder-shaped hat better known as "''[[tarboush]]''." They offer you, in addition to the very popular ''[[argilah|argeelah]]'', a rich assortment of little snacks.|Salim Ayoub Quna}}

In recent years, restaurants and hotels have begun running Ramadan tents to attract customers. Most luxury hotels (4- or 5-star) hotels in [[Jordan]], the [[UAE]], and other countries set up Ramadan tents.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press| isbn = 9781501704185| last = Tobin| first = Sarah A.| title = Everyday Piety: Islam and Economy in Jordan| date = 2016-02-04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwCCCwAAQBAJ|chapter=Making it Meaningful: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These for-profit Ramadan tents typically charge an entrance fee of $10 to $15,{{r|Tobin|pp=63}} though more expensive ones at nice hotels will charge $36 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zaki |first1=Yousra |title=18 Ramadan tents to try in the UAE |url=https://gulfnews.com/guides/life/ramadan/iftars/18-ramadan-tents-to-try-in-the-uae-1.1834358 |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=Gulf News |date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More upscale Ramadan tents also often have music or other entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hamouda |first1=Nada |title=Here Are 7 Of New Cairo’s Most Stunning Ramadan Tents! |url=https://scoopempire.com/here-are-7-of-new-cairos-most-stunning-ramadan-tents/ |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=Scoop Empire |date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly commercial and [[economic materialism|materialistic]] nature of these Ramadan tents has led many in the Middle East to criticize them for cheapening the holiday and in particular for associating "corporate-sponsored materialism with morality."{{r|Tobin|pp=63, 66-7}} However, some do not share this negative opinion of Ramadan tents; the aforementioned Jordanian journalist writes that:{{r|Tobin|page=66}}
{{quote|Maybe the tent is a symbol of open space and freedom of movement that our modern way of life in the city is stripped of ...

In contrast to this materialism, some charitable organizations and individuals host free Ramadan tents that are open to strangers, especially the poor and those who otherwise have nowhere to go for Iftar.&lt;ref name=Dajani /&gt; These charitable Ramadan tents are rarer than the lavish, commercial kind, although they can be found in countries with Muslim populations around the world.&lt;ref name=Arabiya /&gt; One such organization, the [[Ramadan Tent Project]] (RTP), hosts free Iftar dinners in open Ramadan tents that have served more than 50,000 people on four continents.&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khan |first1=Aina |title=Open Iftar tent attracts hundreds in the UK |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/open-iftar-tents-attracts-hundreds-uk-180608160604953.html |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=[[Al-Jazeera]] |date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These open Ramadan tents have been in operation since RTP was founded in 2011 by a graduate student at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suliman |first1=Adela |title=Strangers break bread at Ramadan tent in London park |url=http://news.trust.org/item/20180607133023-tnqak/ |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=Thomson Reuters Foundation |date=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open Iftar dinners of the RTP are open to people of all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prichep |first1=Deena |title=This Dinner Party Invites People Of All Faiths To Break Bread Together |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/06/11/532102736/this-dinner-party-invites-people-of-all-faiths-to-break-bread-together |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=NPR |date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ramadan tents are a relatively recent tradition, and they do not date back to the origins of the holiday.&lt;ref name=AlZahiri&gt;{{cite news |last1=الظاهري |first1=ناصر |title=خيمة رمضان |url=http://www.alittihad.ae/details.php?id=63628&amp;y=2014 |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=الإتحاد |date=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramadan tents are believed to have their origin in [[Egypt]]ian "''saradek''," tents set up in [[Cairo]] for people to offer their condolences. Over time, organizations and merchants began to use these ''saradek''. ''Saradek'' became venues for providing food and shelter to the needy, particularly during the winter months. This marked the beginning of its transition to becoming the Ramadan tent that is well-known today. Soon, the ''saradek'' merged with the preexisting traditions of Arab [[hospitality]] and lavish Iftar dinners to create the modern Ramadan tent. However, Ramadan tents only became popular in the [[Levant]] following the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1990, when they were introduced to [[Lebanon]] by a prominent businessman from the Tabbara family.&lt;ref name=Arabiya&gt;{{cite news |title=The changing face of the Ramadan tent |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/07/49834/the-changing-face-of-the-ramadan-tent/ |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=Morocco World News |agency=Al-Arabiya |date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Ramadan tents are a recent tradition, they are considered ''[[bid‘ah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: بدعة) – innovation or heresy.&lt;ref name=AlZahiri /&gt;

'''Rebbetzin''' ({{lang-yi|רביצין}}) or '''Rabbanit''' ({{lang-he-n|רַבָּנִית}}) is the title used for the wife of a [[rabbi]], typically from the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]], and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Jewish groups, or for a female Torah scholar or teacher.

The Yiddish word has a trilingual etymology: Hebrew ''rebbə'' "master", plus the Slavic feminine suffix ''-itsa'' and the Yiddish feminine suffix ''-in.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebbetzin|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/rebbetzin|website=Your Dictionary|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Hasidic courts, Rebbetzins are considered to be spiritual counselors, and give blessings. In circles such as the [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Hasidic dynasty of Belz]], the girls schools are run by the rebbetzin.

The rabbi's wife plays an important community role, especially in small communities. In many ways, she is called on to be as knowledgeable as the rabbi in the realm of woman's observances: In this manner, for something that does not require a ''[[Posek|psak]]'' (ruling), she can be approached when a woman does not feel comfortable approaching the rabbi, or where the rabbi maybe should not be approached. For instance, the rebbetzin may be consulted in personal questions regarding female sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolowelsky |first1=Joel |title=Rabbis, Rebbetzins, and Halakhic Advisors |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |date=Winter 2002 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=54-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a rabbi is a "pulpit rabbi" (versus a teacher or a "lay rabbi"), his wife becomes something of a [[first lady]] of the community, and performs social tasks and "outreach" roles, freeing her husband to attend to rabbinical duties. 

With the growth of independent scholarship among Orthodox women, some women have received the title on their own merit, irrespective of their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebbetzin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rebbetzin|website=Oxford English Dictionaries|accessdate=18 September 2017}}; [http://www.shearim.com/about-us/educational-staff/ Rebbetzin Pavlov], [http://www.tziporahheller.com/ Rebbetzin Heller].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6910">'''Reidenbach Old Order Mennonites''', also called '''Thirty Fivers''', comprise about 10 [[Old Order Mennonite]]s churches, who emerged from a split of the [[Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church|Groffdale Old Order Mennonite Conference]] in 1946 and subsequent splits. The people who formed the Reidenbach Mennonites Church were more conservative than the members of the Groffdale Conference. The original name of the new church in 1946 was "Reidenbach Mennonite Church".

== History ==

During [[World War II]] around the year 1942 there was a conflict among the Groffdale Conference Mennonites about the question if members of the Conference should send their male youth to government-run Civilian Public Service camps or if the young males should rather go to jail. A minority group of 35 church members who opted against Civilian Public Service camps on May 30, 1946 formed the "Reidenbach Mennonite Church". The later history is characterized by a long series of splits, the major one being a division in 1977 about the use of [[bottled gas]], which left the 158 members in two groups, one of 90 members, the John J. Martin group, who forbade bottled gas, and one of 68 members, the Amos Martin group, who allowed it. The John J. Martin group later saw several further splits.&lt;ref&gt;Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History &amp; Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''. Morgantown, PA 1996, pages 84-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Splits ==

The table below lists all splits of more than one family until the middle of the year 1996:&lt;ref&gt;Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History &amp; Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''. Morgantown, PA 1996, page 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs and belief ==

The belief of the Reidenbach Mennonites almost does not differ from other Old Order Mennonites. Their [[Ordnung]] (set of church rules) does not allow cars, rubber wheels on buggies, tractors for fieldwork, TV, radio, telephones and electricity from [[Electric power transmission|public lines]]. [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] is the language used at home and with other [[Old Order Movement|Old Orders]], children go to [[parochial school]]s and dress is a very conservative form of [[plain dress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lancasteronline.com/features/who-s-who-in-amish-and-mennonite-communities/article_fdc5061b-e66c-570c-9a3d-16564acab745.html Lancaster Online: Who's who in Amish and Mennonite communities]&lt;/ref&gt; Their Ordnung is more conservative than that of mainstream horse and buggy Old Order Mennonites ([[Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church|"Wenger"]] and [[Ontario (Old Order) Mennonite Conference|Ontario]]) but less conservative than the Ordnung of the [[Stauffer Mennonite|"Pikers"]].

== Marriage and disease ==

There are basically four family names among the Reidenbachs: Martin, Hoover, Reiff and Nolt, because there was only a [[founder effect|small founder group]]. [[Cousin marriage|First cousin marriages]] are avoided among Old Order Mennonites, if it is possible, but in the first years of the Reidenbachs the small size of the group led to a high percentage of such marriages, as young members could not find partners inside the church who were less close related and marrying outside the church was no option because of the [[Ordnung]] (set of rules) of the church. From 1947 to 1965 83.3 percent of all marriages were first cousin marriages. The fast natural growth of the group improved the situation and from 1965 to 1977 only 5.9 percent of all marriages were first cousin marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History &amp; Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''. Morgantown, PA 1996, page 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The split in 1977 aggravated the situation again and the old problem arose anew. Therefore, the Reidenbachs are in all likelihood the most [[Inbreeding|inbred]] group of [[Anabaptists]]. There are two genetic diseases among them: [[Hirschsprung's disease]] and [[Maple syrup urine disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History &amp; Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''. Morgantown, PA 1996, page 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==

In 1994 there were about 300 adult members divided into 10 subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]]: An Introduction to Old Order: and Conservative Mennonite Groups, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008/9 membership was about 375 in 10 subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald B. Kraybill|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites and Mennonites|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2010|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the membership of all branches was 371
in 18 congregations&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mwc-cmm.org/mwc_map/country/1228 Mennonite World Conference: Membership 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and the total population was 740.&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. Bronner, Joshua R. Brown (eds.): ''Pennsylvania Germans: An Interpretive Encyclopedia'', Baltimore, 2017, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation stone of this Mandir was laid on Monday 14 June 1965 on Ashad Sankranti day by [[Sant Hari Dass]], along with a large number of devotees of [[Dera Ballan]], specially deputed by [[Sant Sarwan Dass]] for the purpose. Devotees traced the birthplace of Guru Ravidass and temple was built. It is believed that Guru Ravidass used to live and do bhakti at this place. The construction of the temple was completed in 1994. Saheb [[Kanshi Ram]], the [[Bahujan Samaj Party|BSP]] supremo, performed the ceremonial installation of the golden dome atop the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=the foundation stone of Guru Ravidass Gate at Varanasi was laid by BSP founder Kanshi Ram on May 25, 1997|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Deciphering-dera-politics/articleshow/10849962.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilgrimage==
It is the birthplace of Guru [[Ravidass]]. It was this city where two great saints of Bhakti Movement i.e. Satguru [[Kabir]] and  Satguru [[Ravidass]] were born. The Janam Asthan Mandir of Guru Ji at Seer Goverdhanpur, Varanasi has now acquired the status of [[Shri Khuralgarh Sahib#Minar-e-Begampura|Begampura]] (serenity) for Guru Ji’s followers and has become an Ultimate Place of Pilgrimage for them. Every year during birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass, the Mandir attracts millions of devotees from India and abroad. ''Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan'' is nearly 13 minutes drive from [[Sant Ravidas Ghat|Sant Guru Ravidas Ghat]], [[Varanasi]].&lt;ref name="Ravidas Ghat to Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan Mandir 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ravidas Ghat to Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan Mandir | website=Ravidas Ghat to Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan Mandir | date=5 October 2015 | url=https://www.google.co.in/maps/dir/Ravidas+Ghat,+Dumraon+Colony,+Varanasi,+Uttar+Pradesh/Shri+Guru+Ravidass+Janam+Asthan+Mandir,+Seer+Goverdhanpur,+Varanasi,+Uttar+Pradesh+221005/@25.2611345,82.9862396,5755m/am=t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x398e319356fa1cbf:0xbd341065b0cead04!2m2!1d83.0091181!2d25.2836247!1m5!1m1!1s0x398e31792cffa1d1:0x44c331ffd6cc6b8b!2m2!1d82.998758!2d25.256477?hl=en | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Southern Buddhism"''', '''"Eastern Buddhism"''' and '''"Northern Buddhism"''' are geographical terms sometimes used to describe the styles of [[Buddhism]] practiced in [[Asia]].

==Southern Buddhism==
"Southern Buddhism" represents Buddhism as practiced in [[Sri Lanka]] and countries in mainland [[Southeast Asia]], especially [[Myanmar]] (Burma), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]]. This group is primarily connected by the [[Pāli Canon]], monasticism and its prevalent monastic rules, and ritual practices.&lt;ref name="Religions in the Modern World"&gt;Cantwell, Cathy; Kawanami, Hiroko. "Buddhism". In Woodhead, Linda; Partridge, Christopher; Kawanami, Hiroko. Religions in the Modern World. Routledge. p. 78. {{ISBN|9780415858809}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Buddhism tends to be in agreement that the canonical Pali scriptures and commentaries are considered its textual authority, and a strong monastic tradition along with the ideal of renunciation (considered the best way to live one's life) allows its adherents to disregard worldly concerns and devote all of their attention to religious practice. &lt;ref name="Religions in the Modern World" /&gt; It is usually considered to be synonymous with the [[Theravada]]. Theravada means from the elders; teaching come from immediate disciple of Buddha, Ananda and Kassapa. Buddhists in this region place their trust in the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha and is of utmost important in order to seek refuge to the Triple Gem for conducting a Buddhist ritual. The sangha includes both nuns and lay supports of the monastic community while referring to the overall body of the spiritually advanced community. However, monks are predominately the symbol of the sangha and the symbol of many individual’s worship. Ranking for the sangha is based off seniority by the time of entry and gender, while many decisions are made ideally by consensus. &lt;ref&gt;Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-0-415-85881-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Buddhism Monastic Members'''

The monastic members of Southern Buddhism are characterized by celibacy, detachment, and monastic discipline. These monastic members are valued above the lay Buddhist. There are two distinctions of monastic members, those with book duty, where they would be a resident in a monastic institution intending to preserve and teach the traditions that are passed down, whereas those on meditation duty would instead focus on gaining realizations (often through reclusive forest retreats). The monastic community is an important social institution that provides education and social mobility for the bright and ambitious. &lt;ref name="Religions in the Modern World" /&gt;

{{Seealso|East Asian Buddhism}}

==Northern Buddhism==

"Northern Buddhism" sometimes refers to Buddhism as practiced in [[East Asia]] and the Tibetan region- particularly [[China]], [[Tibet]], [[Korea]], [[Mongolia]], [[Japan]], and [[Vietnam]].  It is often held to by synonymous with [[Mahayana]]. However, the term Northern Buddhism is also sometimes used to refer specifically to [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] (including Mongolian) Buddhism. In this terminology, the Buddhism of China, Japan etc. is called Eastern Buddhism.{{efn|This system is used in the ''New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions''}} The Brill ''Dictionary of Religion''{{efn|article on Buddhism}} uses the term Northern Buddhism in a sense exclusive of tantric Buddhism.

In early Buddhism, doctrinal variations did not necessarily imply separate organizations, so the [[Mahāyāna]] movement spread within rather than institutionally separating itself from the early monastic orders. The same is generally true of [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monasticism; the monastic code followed is that of the Mūlasarvastivāda, an ancient Indian order. Tibetan Buddhists also share [[Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayāna]] (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders are loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. Additionally, the main four traditions are '''Kaguy'''(bka' brgyud), '''Sakya'''(sa skya'), '''Nyingma'''(rnying ma), and '''Geluk'''(dge lugs), but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous. Certain doctrinal positions or specialisms in specific practices are associated with each school, but just as in the ancient Buddhist orders, there are no rigid sectarian boundaries. &lt;ref&gt;Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 81. {{ISBN|978-0-415-85881-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhism of this branch derives from later Indian Buddhism especially of the Pāla dynasty (Bengal, eighth to twelfth centuries CE), incorporating Buddhist monastic scholarship, Mahāyāna, and tantric traditions. It preserves large collections of scriptural and commentarial texts in Tibetan language, including a comprehensive set of translations from Sanskrit sources as well as a vast indigenous literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cantwell |first1=Cathy |last2=Kawanami |first2=Hiroko |last3=Woodhead |first3=Linda |last4=Partridge |first4=Christopher |title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |isbn=9780415858809 |page=78 |edition=Third |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four main traditions are [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]], [[Nyingma]], and [[Geluk]], but each of these major schools contain groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Religions in the Modern World 3rd |edition = 3rd chapter |pages= 80-81 |author=Cantwell, Cathy; Kawanami, Hiroko ref|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahayana and Theravada in Asia==
The use and meaning of these terms reflects only the contemporary situation of the various schools of Buddhism in Asia, and even that only imperfectly.  While the Theravada presently dominates in Southeast Asia, prior to the 13th Century the Mahayana was also well established in that region.  The survival of certain Mahayana notions in popular Southeast Asian Buddhism (such as the worship of [[Lokesvara]]- a form of [[Avalokitesvara]]- in [[Thailand]]) reflect the early presence of Mahayana ideology in the "Southern Buddhist" world.  Ongoing contact between Southeast Asia and India brought a variety of doctrines, relics, and texts into Southeast Asia from both the Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]] traditions, as well as the Theravada and the other [[early Buddhist schools]].  Only after the decline of Buddhism in India did Theravada Buddhism begin to dominate in Southeast Asia, with Theravada-dominated Sri Lanka replacing India as the source of new texts and teachers.

In East Asia and Tibet, the lands traditionally described as "Northern Buddhist", share Mahayana and Vajrayana (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders or loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. The main four traditions are Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Geluk, but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 80-81. {{ISBN|978-0-415-85881-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence for the cohabitation of Mahayana and non-Mahayana monks in some South Asian monasteries during the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia provides additional evidence that the form of Buddhism practiced in the "Northern" territories likely retains many non-Mahayana influences.  Furthermore, in certain regions of China and East Asia (notably in Southern China), non-Mahayana forms were sometimes dominant.

[[Vietnam]] represents an interesting case of a country lying in the liminal region between the Northern and Southern Buddhist schools.  As might be expected, Vietnamese Buddhism shows both a strong Mahayana and Theravada influence.

The '''Temple of Hibis''' is the largest and best preserved [[ancient Egyptian temple]] in the [[Kharga Oasis]], as well as the only structure in Egypt dating to the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]] or Saite-Persian period (664-404 BCE) which has come down to modern times in relatively good condition.

==History==
[[File:The Temple of Hibis by Hanne Siegmeier.jpg|thumb|Palmiform columns at the Temple of Hibis]]
The [[temple]] of Hibis was once surrounded by the city of Hibis ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Hebet'', meaning "the plough"&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;), which nowadays lies under the crops.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; Construction of the temple started during the [[26th Dynasty]], most likely under [[Pharaoh]] [[Psamtik II]],&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; or possibly even earlier, during the [[25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=w236/&gt; Archaeological evidences suggest that an older temple, dating back to the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], was already present in the same place.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; Several decades after Psamtik II, during the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty|27th Dynasty]], the [[Achaemenid]] pharaoh [[Darius I]] took a particularly active part in its building, being credited of the decoration of the walls.&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;&lt;ref name=zc78&gt;{{cite book|last=Zivie-Coche|first=Christiane|chapter=Late Period Temples|title=UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology|editor-first=Willeke|editor-last=Wendrick|year=2008|publisher=UCLA|location=Los Angeles|url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz000s3mkp|pp=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, several other rulers made additions or decorations here, such as [[Hakor]] of the [[Twenty-ninth Dynasty|29th Dynasty]], notably [[Nectanebo I]] and [[Nectanebo II]] of the [[30th Dynasty]], possibly [[Ptolemy IV]] ([[Ptolemaic Dynasty]]), and at least one [[Roman emperor]].&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt;

A first excavation campaign, organized by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York, took place in 1909–11. A more recent one, led by Eugene Cruz-Uribe, began in 1985.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Temple of hibis.png|thumb|300px|Plan of the Temple of Hibis]]
The temple bears a close resemblance – both architecturally and regarding inscribed texts – to [[Theban Necropolis|Theban temples]] of the New Kingdom and also of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] period,&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; yet it differs from both because of some peculiarities, such as the rather bold style of the decorations.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt;&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;

A long hallway, lined with [[sphinx]]es, crosses a series of [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and arrives to the proper temple. This was originally surrounded by a lake, now long-gone.&lt;ref name=w236/&gt; The [[hypostyle hall]] has its walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, bearing various decorations and several hynms dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] Amun, many of which are known since earlier times.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt; Among the decorations, notable is a depiction of [[Seth (god)|Seth]] defeating [[Apep]], a theme believed by some art historian to be a foreshadowing of [[Saint George and the Dragon]].&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The walls and the roof are dedicated to the Theban theology and to [[Osiris]] respectively, while the ''[[cella|naos]]'' is subdivided in nine [[Register (art)|registers]], fully decorated with a ''[[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]'' of Egyptian deity and royal figures, for a total of almost 700 figures. At the beginning of each register, the king is depicted while performing a ritual; the Egyptian ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomoi]]'' are also present, each one represented in an Osirian form. In stark contrast with the richness of these representations, the accompanying inscriptions are brief, when not absent at all.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt;

The relatively good preservation of the Temple of Hibis may be attributed to its seclusion. However, since several decades the building is endangered by a rise of ground water which is damaging its foundations, and the [[Egyptian Antiquities Service]] was taking into consideration a complete dismantling and relocation of the whole temple.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, pp. 236–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sikh practices}}
[[Image:Sikh Articles of Faith.JPG|thumb|right|Kanga, Kara and Kirpan – three of the five Ks]]
In [[Sikhism]], the '''Five Ks''' ({{lang-pa|ਪੰਜ ਕਕਾਰ}} ''Pañj Kakār'') are five items that [[Guru Gobind Singh]] commanded [[Khalsa]] Sikhs to wear at all times in 1699. They are: [[#Kesh|Kesh]] (uncut hair), [[#Kangha|Kangha]] (a wooden comb for the hair), [[#Kara|Kara]] (an iron bracelet), [[#Kachera|Kachera]] (100% cotton tieable undergarment (not an elastic one)) and [[#Kirpan|Kirpan]] (an iron dagger large enough to defend oneself).

The Five Ks are not just symbols, but articles of faith that collectively form the external identity and the Khalsa devotee's commitment to the ''Sikh rehni'' "Sikh way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amritsar.com/The%20Five%20K.shtml | title=The Five K's | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sikh who has taken [[Amrit Sanchar|Amrit]] and keeps all five Ks are known as ''Khalsa'' ("pure") or ''Amritdhari Sikh'' ("Amrit Sanskar participant"), while a Sikh who has not taken Amrit but follows the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is called a ''[[Sahajdhari Sikh]]''.

==Kesh==
{{Main|Kesh (Sikhism)|l1=Kesh}}

The Kesh, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs as an indispensable part of the human body. Long known as a sign of spiritual devotion, it also emulates the appearance of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and is one of the primary signs by which a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The uncut long hair and the [[beard]], in the case of men, form the main kakār for Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/customs/fiveks.shtml | title=The Five Ks | publisher=bbc.co.uk | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to the Sikh that they are sitting on the throne of consciousness and is committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his Sikhs: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Khaalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khaalsa mai ho karo nivaas... The Khalsa is my image. Within the Khalsa I reside."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sikhdharma.org/khalsa-wearing-five-ks/ As Khalsa, Wearing the Five K’s]; Posted March 30, 2016 by Sikh Dharma International&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing a turban declares sovereignty, dedication, self-respect, courage and piety.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A noted figure in Sikh history is [[Bhai Taru Singh]], who was martyred when he refused to get his Kesh cut.

==Kangha==
{{Main|Kangha (Sikhism)|l1=Kangha}}
[[File:Wooden kanga comb (Sikhism article of faith).JPG|thumb|right|Kangha – one of the five articles of faith for the Sikhs]]

{{quotation|Comb the hair twice a day, covering it with turban that is to be tied from fresh.|Tankhanama Bhai Nand Lal Singh&lt;ref name="Tankh"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5FbCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Tankhanama+Bhai+Nand+Lal+Singh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JOM5Vf2VLcjraMPLgbAH&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Tankhanama%20Bhai%20Nand%20Lal%20Singh&amp;f=false | title=Sikh Code of Conduct | publisher=Akaal Publishers; 4th Revised edition | author=Singh, Harjinder | authorlink=Five Kakkaars | year=2015 | location=English | pages=26 | isbn=0955458749}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A [[Kangha (Sikhism)|Kangha]] is a small wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair, and is  a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized.

The comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru Granth Sahib said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this excludes any shaving for both men and women. In the Guru's time, some holy men let their hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru  said that this was not right; that hair should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice a day.

==Kara==
{{Main|Kara (Sikhism)|l1=Kara}}
[[Image:Kara (Sikhism).jpg|thumb|right|Kara – one of the five articles of faith for the Sikhs]]

The Sikhs were commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear an iron bracelet called a Kara at all times. The Kara is a constant reminder to always remember that whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice given by the Guru. The Kara is an iron/steel circle to symbolise God as never ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is "kari").
{{-}}

==Kachera==
{{Main|Kachera}}
{{Quotation|ਸੀਲ ਜਤ ਕੀ ਕਛ ਪਹਿਰਿ ਪਕਿੜਓ ਹਿਥਆਰਾ ॥ The sign of true chastity is the Kachera, you must wear this and hold weapons in hand.|Bhai Gurdas Singh, Var. 41, pauri 15}}

The Kachera is a [[shalwar kameez|shalwar]]-[[undergarment]] with a tie-knot worn by [[Amrit Sanskar|baptized]] Sikhs. Originally, the Kachera was made part of the five Ks as a symbol of a Sikh soldier's willingness to be ready at a moment's notice for battle or for defence. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the Amrit) wears a Kachera every day. Some go to the extent of wearing a Kacheraye while bathing, to be ready to at a moment's notice, changing into the new one a single leg at a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash and carry compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the [[dhoti]]. The Kachera symbolises self-respect, and always reminds the wearer of mental control over lust, one of the [[Five Evils]] in Sikh philosophy.

Kachera follow a generally practical and roomy design.  It features an embedded string that circles the waist which can be tightened or loosened as desired, and then knotted securely.  The Kachera can be classed between underwear and an outer garment, as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts.  As with all of the Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it.  Considering the hot climate in India, the Kachera is often worn by men as an outer garment, keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, but it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the Kachera as an outer garment (on its own) as it is considered too revealing.
{{-}}

==Kirpan==
{{Main|Kirpan}}
[[Image:Kirpan small.JPG|thumb|right|Typical Kirpan worn by modern Sikhs]] 
{{Quotation|ਸ਼ਸਤਰ ਹੀਨ ਕਬਹੂ ਨਹਿ ਹੋਈ, ਰਿਹਤਵੰਤ ਖਾਲਸਾ ਸੋਈ ॥Those who never depart his/her arms, they are the Khalsa with excellent [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|rehats]].|Rehatnama Bhai Desa Singh{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}}}

The [[Kirpan]] is a dagger which symbolizes a Sikh's duty to come to the defence of those in peril. All Sikhs should wear kirpan on their body at all times as a defensive side-arm, just as a police officer is expected to wear a side-arm when on duty.  Its use is only allowed in the act of self-defense and the protection of others.  It stands for bravery and protecting the weak and innocent. 
 
The kirpan is kept sharp and is actually used to defend others, such as those who are oppressed by harsh rulers, women who are raped in the streets, or a person who was being robbed or beaten. The true Sikh cannot turn a blind eye to such evils, thinking that they are "someone else's concern."{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It is the duty of the true Sikh to help those who suffer unjustly, by whatever means available, whether that means alerting the police, summoning help, or literally defending those who cannot defend themselves, even if that means putting oneself in harm's way.

==Reception==
[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote "The appendix might better have been a preface ... But the chase and basic situation (in Europe the hungry pursuers would be a witch and her familiar) are as easy to grasp as the peculiarly Australian flavor is authentic. And despite the sameness of the scenes--repetitive in scale, perspective and color--Roughsey's flat, clay colored paintings (with dabs of green for foliage) are the more effective for their amateur look--especially where that huge-tongued, red-eyed dingo opposes the small, faceless, dimly differentiated humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dick-roughsey/the-giant-devil-dingo/ |title=The Giant Devil-Dingo|website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Aboriginal Child at School'' called it "a highly successful book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1974 |title=Book Reviews |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9396459&amp;fileId=S1326011100003586 |journal=The Aboriginal Child at School |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=58–59 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;''The Giant Devil Dingo'' has also been reviewed by ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''Reading Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C317845 |title=The Giant Devil Dingo |website=www.austlit.edu.au |publisher=AustLit |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">About 104 million people in [[India]] are members of [[Scheduled Tribes]], which accounts for 8.6 % of [[India]]{{'}}s population (according to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/hlo/pca/pca_pdf/PCA-CRC-0000.pdf 2011 Census Primary Census Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indians belonging to these populations adhere to traditional Indian [[tribal religion]]s, often syncretised with one or more of the [[religion in India|major religious traditions]] of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and/or [[Christianity]] and often under ongoing pressure of [[cultural assimilation]].&lt;ref name=tr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/57.htm|title=The Green Revolution in India|work=U.S. Library of Congress (released in [[public domain]])|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the nature of Indian religion generally, these particular religions often involve traditions of [[ancestor worship]] or worship of spirits of natural features.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Council of Educational Research and Training]]. "Social and Political Life - III". Publication Department, NCERT, 2009, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal beliefs persist as [[folk religion]] even among those converted to a [[major religion]]. 

The largest and best-known tribal religion of India is that of the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].
In 1991, there were some 24,000 Indians belonging to the Santhal community who identified explicitly as adherents of the Santhal traditional religion in the [[Indian census]], as opposed to 300,000 who identified as [[Christianity in India|Christians]]. Among the [[Munda people]] and [[Oraons]] of Bihar, about 25 % of the population are Christian. Among the [[Kharia language| Kharia]] people of Bihar (population about 130,000), about 60 % are Christians, but all are heavily influenced by [[Folk Hinduism]]. Tribal groups in the [[Himalayas]] were similarly affected by both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in the late 20th century. The small hunting-and-gathering groups in the union territory of [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] have also been under severe pressure of cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

The '''Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones''' (or The '''Valley of Dry Bones''' or The '''Vision of Dry Bones''') is a [[prophecy]] in [[Ezekiel 37|chapter 37]] of the [[Book of Ezekiel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel]], [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16135 37:1-14]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter details a vision revealed to the prophet [[Ezekiel]], conveying a dream-like [[Reality|realistic]]-[[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]] depiction.

In his vision the prophet sees himself standing in the [[valley]] full of dry human [[bone]]s. He is commanded to carry a prophecy. Before him the bones connect into human figures, then the bones become covered with [[tendon]] tissues, [[flesh]] and [[skin]]. Then God reveals the bones to the prophet as the [[People of Israel]] in [[exile]] and commands the Prophet to carry another prophecy in order to revitalize these human figures, to resurrect them and to bring them to the [[Land of Israel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''William Cormick''' (born 1822, [[Tabriz]]; died 30 December 1877), was a [[physician]] in [[Qajar Iran]] of [[British people|British]] origin during the reigns of [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] (1834–1848) and [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] (1848–1896). He is noted for having played an important role in the diffusion of Western medicine into Iranian society.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} He is also noted as the only westerner to have met the [[Báb]].

==Biography==
===Education===
William Cormick was born in Tabriz to the [[Irish people|Irish]] physician John Cormick and a local [[Iranian Armenians|Armenian]] woman.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} Having been sent to England at the age of ten in order to gain an education, he was subsequently enrolled into the medical faculty of the [[University College of London]]. He received his qualification as a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] on 17{{nbs}}July 1840. A year later he was admitted into membership of the [[Society of Apothecaries]], as well as being awarded a doctors degree in [[medicine]] from St. Andrew's in London.

===Career===
From 1844 to 1855 Cormick worked as a physician in London and in [[Paris]]. He was summoned to Iran, by the then incumbent king [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], as the second physician to the British mission and to become the personal physician to the king.{{sfn|Floor|2004|page=169}}{{sfn|Lambton|1987|page=203}} In 1846 he was appointed as the second physician to the family of [[Abbas Mirza]]. Later he became the personal physician to the crown prince and the future king [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], when the latter was given the governorship of [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] province, which he held for seven months.{{sfn|Amanat|1997|pages=78–79}} Upon the ascension of Naser al-din Shah Qajar to the throne in 1848, Cormick travelled with him to [[Tehran]]. However, on the decision of the prime minister (''[[vizier|vazīr]]''), [[Amir Kabir]], he was replaced by the [[France|French]] physician [[Ernest Cloquet]]. This was part of Iran's policy of avoiding becoming over-dependent on either [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] or [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} Cormick returned to Tabriz, where he lived for the rest of his life, continuing to practice medicine and becoming rich.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}}

===The Báb===
During the [[court trial|trial]] of the [[Báb]] in Tabriz in July 1848, William Cormick and two Iranian physicians were given the task of certifying whether the former could be classified as [[insanity|mentally incompetent]]. The governing authorities were reported to be "reluctant" to give the Báb the death sentence.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} Cormick, at the request of the Báb, visited him several times as part of the medical treatment for his having been ''[[bastinadoed]]'' following his trial. This made Cormick the only Westerner recorded as having personally met the Báb.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} He presented an account of his meetings with the Báb in a letter to an [[United States of America|American]] missionary friend named J. H. Shedd.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}}

===Awards===
He was awarded the [[Order of the Lion and the Sun]] (2nd class).{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} On 19{{nbs}}October 1876 Cormick became a [[fellow]] of the British Royal College of Surgeons.

===Personal life===
Cormick was married to an Armenian woman named Tamar, who was the younger sister of the Armenian wife of Edward Burgess (a trader).{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}} Cormick died on 30{{nbs}}December 1877, and was buried in [[Tabriz]] in the same cemetery as his father, brother and nine other Cormick family members.{{sfn|Momen|1993|pages=275–276}}
