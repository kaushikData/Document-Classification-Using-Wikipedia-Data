'''''$pread''''' was a quarterly [[magazine]] by and for [[sex worker]]s and those who support their rights. The magazine's focus was: "personal experiences and political insights" and it "contain(ed) practical information like news, features, health columns, and resources related to the sex industry".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |publisher=$pread Magazine |accessdate=April 2, 2015|date=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528104430/http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |archivedate=May 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Articles were written by readers as well as by figures from academic, cultural, and literary backgrounds, most of whom are current or former sex workers. The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega.&lt;ref name="Rough Trade"/&gt; ''$pread'' was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at [[independent bookstore]]s and via national distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/pread-magazine-provided-a-smart-funny-lifeline-for-sex-workers-around-the-world-069|title=Remembering '$pread,' the Magazine That Gave Sex Workers a Voice - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-editor said, "We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-01-11/people/whore-pride/2 ''Whore Pride''], Rachel Kramer Bussel, The Village Voice, January 11, 2005 Accessed March 26, 2009.

''$pread'' published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. ''$pread'' supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program "helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes", said [[Audacia Ray]], an executive editor at the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/nyregion/05sex.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Federal%20Taxes%20(US) An Old Profession That's New to Doing Taxes]. Corey Kilgannon, ''The New York Times''. April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 30, 2010, ''$pread'' has ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if "there was $100k made available".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spreadmagazine.org/2010/08/30/pread-is-dead-really/ $pread is Dead, Really] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 |date=April 18, 2009 }}. Retrieved September 6, 2010.  $pread Blog, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because ''$pread'' was part of the [[sex workers rights]] movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 ''Hot &amp; Bothered'', Bitch Magazine, Issue 33, Fall 2006 ] Accessed March 26, 2009.[https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 Archived] April 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''$pread'' Book==
[[The Feminist Press]] released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled ''$pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution''.&lt;ref name="$pread book publication from The Feminist Press"&gt;{{cite web |title=$pread book publication by The Feminist Press |url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XfDSTm1n?url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]], the distribution of a [[discrete random variable]] ''N'' whose values are nonnegative integers is said to be a member of the '''(''a'', ''b'', 0) class of distributions''' if its [[probability mass function]] obeys

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}} = a + \frac{b}{k}, \qquad k = 1, 2, 3, \dots&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_k = P(N = k)&lt;/math&gt; (provided &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; exist and are real).

There are only three discrete distributions that satisfy the full form of this relationship: the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]], [[Binomial distribution|binomial]] and [[Negative binomial distribution|negative binomial]] distributions. These are also the three discrete distributions among the six members of the [[natural exponential family#Quadratic variance functions|natural exponential family with quadratic variance functions]] (NEF–QVF). 

More general distributions can be defined by fixing some initial values of ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and applying the recursion to define subsequent values. This can be of use in fitting distributions to empirical data. However, some further well-known distributions are available if the recursion above need only hold for a restricted range of values of ''k'':&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; for example the [[logarithmic distribution]] and the discrete [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]].

The (''a'', ''b'', 0) class of distributions has important applications in [[actuarial science]] in the context of loss models.&lt;ref name=Klugman/&gt;

== Properties ==
Sundt&lt;ref name=Sundt/&gt; proved that only the [[binomial distribution]], the [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[negative binomial distribution]] belong to this class of distributions, with each distribution being represented by a different sign of&amp;nbsp;''a''. Furthermore, it was shown by Fackler&lt;ref name=Fackler/&gt; that there is a universal formula for all three distributions, called the '''(united) Panjer distribution'''.

The more usual parameters of these distributions are determined by both ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b''. The properties of these distributions in relation to the present class of distributions are summarised in the following table. Note that &lt;math&gt;W_N(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[probability generating function]].

|&lt;math&gt; \frac{\lambda}{\alpha+\lambda}\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{(\alpha-1)\lambda}{\alpha+\lambda}\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \left( 1+\frac{\lambda}{\alpha} \right)^{-\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \left( 1-\frac{\lambda}{\alpha}(x-1)\right)^{-\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \lambda \, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \lambda \left( 1 + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Note that the Panjer distribution reduces to the Poisson distribution in the limit case &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;; it coincides with the negative binomial distribution for positive, finite real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, and it equals the binomial distribution for negative integers &lt;math&gt; -\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Plotting ==
An easy way to quickly determine whether a given sample was taken from a distribution from the (''a'',''b'',0) class is by graphing the ratio of two consecutive observed data (multiplied by a constant) against the ''x''-axis.

By multiplying both sides of the recursive formula by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, you get

: &lt;math&gt;k \, \frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}} = ak + b,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the left side is obviously a linear function of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. When using a sample of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; data, an approximation of the &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;'s need to be done. If &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of observations having the value &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_k = \frac{n_k}{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Estimator bias|unbiased]] estimator of the true &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, if a linear trend is seen, then it can be assumed that the data is taken from an (''a'',''b'',0) distribution. Moreover, the [[slope]] of the function would be the parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, while the ordinate at the origin would be &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5159">'''Accentuation effect''' occurs when something (be it a person, place or thing) is placed into a category, and aspects of it which match the stereotypes of that category are emphasized and perceived to be greater than they are, i.e. the similarities of an individual to the group are accentuated.  Memory of anything that can be categorized is subject to an accentuation effect in which the memory is distorted toward typical examples.

In the case of people, the accentuation effect is similar to [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] and social [[categorization]] in that when classified as part of a group, people's features seem to more closely match their [[classification]] rather than any individual differences they have.

==Within ethnicity and faces==
[[Research]]ers Corneille, Huart, Becquart, and Bredart found that when participants looked at ethnically [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] faces, certain ethnic features that stood out caused participants to falsely remember the person more toward an ethnic category than they actually were. Researchers used [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] or [[North Africa]]n faces, and morphed them to be either low, moderate, or high on [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] features. The faces that were moderately stereotypical of either a [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Caucasian]] or [[North African]] person were falsely recollected in memory as more Caucasian or [[North African]] than they actually were. This is evidence for how distortions in memory are due to stereotypical conceptions that are held about certain [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] {{harv |Corneille et al.|2004}}.last edit (2017)

==Within temperature estimates==
A study at [[Brown University]] found accentuation effects happened when participants were asked to [[Estimation|estimate]] average [[temperature]]s in days throughout the year. Typically, four days in a month were used, i.e., September 2, 10, 18, and 28, and the average high and low temperatures were estimated for each day. Results of this study found that when estimating the [https://www.google.com.pk/search?q=temperature&amp;oq=temperature&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 temperature], there was more of a jump in temperature estimates between months as opposed to estimates within months. Even though the temperature rises and falls fairly steadily with each passing day through the year, participants assume there is more of a drop in temperature, for example, between August 25 and September 2 than there is between September 2 and September 10, based entirely on the idea that August is warmer than September. {{harv |Krueger |Clement|1994}}.

==Real examples==
One example that researchers presented was that after an [[Italians|Italian]] colleague returned from a two-week vacation in [[Italy]], his friends noticed that his hair and eyes were lighter than they had remembered. This happened because his categorization as Italian caused them to remember him with darker hair and eyes than he actually had. Thus, while there was no actual change in his hair and [[eye color]], their memory of his features had been shifted to match what the [[stereotype]] of an Italian looks like, rather than his actual appearance {{harv |Corneille et al.|2004}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">[[File:Running boy in joyous mood 2.jpg|alt=A young boy running in a road. He has black hair and is wearing a backpack.|thumb|The [[running]] of a [[human]] could be considered an action.]]{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}{{About|the theory of action in general|[[Ludwig von Mises]]' work on this subject|Human Action}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Image of action.jpg|thumb|right|A throw (an action) a spear (with object) by man (by an agent)]] --&gt;
In [[philosophy]], an '''action''' is that which is done by an agent. In common speech, the term is often used interchangeably with the term "behaviour". However, in the [[Action theory (philosophy)|philosophy of action]], [[behavioural sciences]], and the [[social sciences]], a distinction is made: behavior is automatic and reflexive activity, while action is an intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful activity {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Thus, things like running or throwing a ball is an instance of action; it involves intention, a goal, and a bodily movement guided by the agent. On the other hand, catching a cold is not considered an action because it is something which happens ''to'' a person, not something done ''by'' one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Perception ==
In [[enactive|enactivism]] theory, perception is understood to be [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] in nature. That is, we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world. Alva Noë states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We move our eyes, head and body in taking in what is around us... [we] crane our necks, peer, squint, reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better look...'…'Perception is a mode of  activity on the part of the whole animal...It cannot be represented in terms of merely passive, and internal, processes...' &lt;ref&gt;Alva Noë [[Action in Perception]], (2004), MIT Press(pp1/2 and 111)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Movement==
Some would prefer to define actions as requiring [[Human body|bodily]] movement (see [[behaviorism]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The [[Unintended consequence|side effects]] of actions are considered by some to be part of the action; in an example from [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe]]'s manuscript ''Intention'', pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This introduces a [[moral]] dimension to the [[discussion]] (see also [[Moral agency]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the poisoned water resulted in a death, that death might be considered part of the action of the agent that pumped the water.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whether a side effect is considered part of an action is especially unclear in cases in which the agent isn't aware of the possible side effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  For example, an agent that accidentally cures a person by administering a poison he was intending to kill him with.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Reasons for action==
A primary concern of [[philosophy of action]] is to analyze the nature of actions and distinguish them from similar phenomena. Other concerns include individuating actions, explaining the relationship between actions and their effects, explaining how an action is related to the beliefs and desires which cause and/or justify it (see [[practical reason]]), as well as examining the nature of agency.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A primary concern is the nature of free will and whether actions are determined by the mental states that precede them (see [[determinism]]). Some philosophers (e.g. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;"Davidson, D. Essays on Actions and Events, 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001a.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Their mental properties don't seem to be doing any work.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action, however, are not the cause of the action, they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Charity gift cards for good little Yahoos (3119024104).jpg|thumb|A charity gift card, describing its donation as an alternative to a "sweater you'd never wear"]]
'''Alternative giving''' is a form of [[gift|gift giving]] in which the giver makes a [[donation]] to a [[charitable organization]] on the gift recipient’s behalf, rather than giving them an item. The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by [[Benjamin Franklin]] as a "trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money", which came to be known as "[[pay it forward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Franklin to Benjamin Webb|Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Webb, April 22d, 1784]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of giving is often used as an alternative to [[consumerism]] and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdream.org/holiday/simplify.pdf|title=Simplify the Holidays|publisher=[[Center for a New American Dream]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day’s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called "ownership" or "adoption" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of [[wedding favors]], normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to "Pay it Forward" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/royal-wedding-charity-gifts_n_836429.html|title=Prince William &amp; Kate Middleton Ask For Charitable Royal Wedding Gifts, Not Presents|date=16 March 2011|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pop culture references==
The concept was [[satire|spoofed]] in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Strike (Seinfeld episode)|"The Strike"]]. [[George Costanza]], angry at having received a donation to charity instead of an actual gift, made up his own non-existent charity and handed out fake donations to save money on gifts and cheques.

Comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] poked fun at the concept during a stand-up routine in which he recounts the time when his friends gave a goat to an African family in Gervais' name. Gervais considers this to be a lose-lose situation for all involved: he gets nothing, his friends spent a considerable amount of money on the alternative gift, the African family would not likely appreciate having "another mouth to feed," and the goat being taken away from its natural environment to an unfamiliar place unsuited for it.

      <comment>Beatrice Han-Pile in "Nietzsche and Amor Fati" (EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY) cites "for all its importance, there is very little material on amor fati in Nietzsche’s work. All in all, I was able to identify only seven passages, four in the published work, one in the Will to Power, one in the Nachlass and one in Nietzsche’s correspondence."</comment>

{{italic title}}
'''''Amor fati''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "love of fate") is a [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate".  It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] apparently means by the concept of "[[Eternal recurrence#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence]]": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

==Concept==
The concept of ''amor fati'' has been linked to [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'' Ch. VIII: "Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."—as quoted in [[Pierre Hadot]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dLVyyDE-vQC&amp;redir_esc=y The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Meditations|the writings]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' IV.23: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, O World! Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or too late for me. All that your seasons produce, O Nature, is fruit for me. It is from you that all things come: all things are within you, and all things move toward you." — as quoted in [[Hadot]] (1998), p. 143.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  who did not himself use the words (he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], not Latin).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with the Master: Robert Greene on Stoicism|url=https://dailystoic.com/robert-greene-interview/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. ''Amor fati'': let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. ''Looking away'' shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the "Yes-sayer", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality ''per se''.

Quotation from "Why I Am So Clever" in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', section 10:&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Writings of Nietzsche''. trans. and ed. by Walter Kaufmann (1967), p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is ''amor fati'': that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.  Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it&amp;mdash;all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary&amp;mdash;but ''love'' it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering.  For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked.  In section 3 of the preface of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Leiter|first=Brian|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9615">'''Association'''&amp;nbsp;in psychology refers to a mental connection between concepts, events, or mental states that usually stems from specific experiences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, Stephen (2012).&amp;nbsp;''Learning: Principles and Applications''&amp;nbsp;(6 ed.). SAGE Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-8734-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Associations are seen throughout several schools of thought in psychology including [[behaviorism]], [[associationism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[social psychology]], and [[structuralism]]. The idea stems from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories, and it was carried on by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and [[James Mill]].&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; It finds its place in modern psychology in such areas as [[memory]], [[learning]], and the study of neural pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. E. &amp; Kosslyn, S. M. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learned associations==
[[Associative learning]] is when a subject creates a relationship between stimuli (auditory or visual) or behavior (auditory or visual) and the original stimulus (auditory or visual). The acquisition of associations is the basis for learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Eich|first=Eric|last2=Forgas|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Mood, Cognition, and Memory|editor-last2=Proctor|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning is seen in classical and operant conditioning.&amp;nbsp;

=== Law of Effect ===
[[Edward Thorndike]] did research in this area and developed the [[law of effect]], where associations between a stimulus and response are affected by the consequence of the response.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Miller|first=Ralph|last2=Grace|first2=Randolph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Conditioning and Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, behaviors increase in strength and/or frequency when they have been followed by reward.&amp;nbsp;This occurs because of an association between the behavior and a&amp;nbsp;[[mental representation]]&amp;nbsp;of the reward (such as food). Conversely, receiving a negative consequence lowers the frequency of the behavior due to the negative association.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this would be a rat in a cage with a bar lever. If pressing the lever results in a food pellet, the rat will learn to press the lever to receive food. If pressing the lever resulted in an electric shock on the floor of the cage, the rat would learn to avoid pressing the lever.

===Classical conditioning===
[[Classical conditioning]]&amp;nbsp;is an example of a learned association. The classical conditioning process consists of four elements: unconditioned stimulus (UCS), unconditioned response (UCR), conditioned stimulus (CS), and conditioned response (CR).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Without conditioning, there is already a relationship between the unconditioned stimulus and the unconditioned response. When a second stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the response becomes associated with both stimuli. The secondary stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus and elicits a conditioned response.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4129-8734-9|edition=6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the response to the conditioned stimulus increases over the period of learning, as the CS becomes associated with UCS.&amp;nbsp;The strength of the response can diminish if CS is presented without UCS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In his famous experiment, Pavlov used the unconditioned response of dogs salivating at the sight of food (UCS), and paired the sound of a bell (CS) with receiving food, and later the dog salivated (CR) to the bell alone, indicating that an association had been established between the bell and food.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shett"&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operant conditioning===
In&amp;nbsp;[[operant conditioning]],&amp;nbsp;behaviors are changed due to the experienced outcomes of those behaviors. Stimuli do not cause behavior, as in classical conditioning, but instead the associations are created between stimulus and consequence, as an extension by Thorndike on his Law of Effect.&lt;ref name="Shett" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4129-8734-9|edition=6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] was well known for his studies of reinforcers on behavior. His studies included the aspect of contingency, which refers to the connection between a specific action and the following consequence or reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Skinner described three contingencies: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and punishment. Reinforcements create a positive association between the action and consequence in order to promote the continuation of the action. This is done in one of two ways, positive reinforcers introduce a rewarding stimulus, whereas negative reinforcers remove an aversive stimulus to make the environment less aversive. Punishments create a negative relationship between the action and the consequence so that the action does not continue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Mood ===
[[John B. Watson|Watson]] introduced a white fluffy rabbit to an infant, and created a connection between the rabbit and a loud noise. This experience for [[Little Albert experiment|Little Albert]] associated a feeling of fear with the rabbit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology|last=Eich|first=Eric|last2=Forgas|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Healy|editor-first=Alice|volume=4|location=New Jersey|pages=|chapter=Mood, Cognition, and Memory|editor-last2=Proctor|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
[[Memory]] seems to operate as a sequence of associations: concepts, words, and opinions are intertwined, so that stimuli such as a person’s face will call up the associated name.&lt;ref&gt;Watier &amp; Collin 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, Ivry &amp; Mangun, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the relationships between different items is fundamental to episodic memory, and damage to the hippocampal region of the brain has been found to hinder learning of associations between objects.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Bayley &amp; Squire, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing associations==
Associations in humans can be measured with the [[Implicit Association Test]], a psychological test which measures the implicit (subconscious) relation between two concepts. It has been used in investigations of subconscious racial bias. The test measures the associations between different ideas, such as race and crime. Reaction time is used to distinguish associations; faster reaction time is an indicator of a stronger association.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, McGhee &amp; Schwartz, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and related terms==
[[Sanskrit]] ''Brahman'' (an ''n''-stem, nominative ''{{IAST|bráhmā}}'') from a [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''{{IAST|bṛh}}-'' "to swell, expand, grow, enlarge"  is a neuter noun to be distinguished from the masculine ''{{IAST|[[brahmán]]}}''—denoting a person associated with Brahman, and from [[Brahmā]], the creator God in the Hindu Trinity, the [[Trimurti]]. Brahman is thus a gender-neutral concept that implies greater impersonality than masculine or feminine conceptions of the deity. Brahman is referred to as the supreme self. Puligandla states it as "the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world",{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=222}} while Sinar states Brahman is a concept that "cannot be exactly defined".{{sfn|Sinari|2000|p=384}}

In [[Vedic Sanskrit]]:
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्म) (nominative singular), ''br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;n'' (ब्रह्मन्) (stem) (neuter&lt;ref name="neuter"&gt;Not Masculine or Feminine  (see [[Grammatical gender]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[gender]]) from root ''bṛh-'', means "to be or make firm, strong, solid, expand, promote".&lt;ref name=jangondaetymo&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;n&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्मन) (nominative singular, never plural), from stems ''brh&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (to make firm, strong, expand) + Sanskrit ''-man-'' from Indo-European root ''-men-'' which denotes some manifest form of "definite power, inherent firmness, supporting or fundamental principle".&lt;ref name=jangondaetymo/&gt;

In later Sanskrit usage:
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्रह्म) (nominative singular), ''brahman'' (stem) (neuter&lt;ref name="neuter" /&gt; [[gender]]) means the concept of the transcendent and immanent ultimate reality, Supreme Cosmic Spirit in Hinduism. The concept is central to Hindu philosophy, especially Vedanta; this is discussed below. ''Brahm'' is another variant of ''Brahman''.
* ''Br&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;hmā'' (ब्रह्मा) (nominative singlular), ''Brahman'' (ब्रह्मन्) (stem) ([[masculine]] [[gender]]), means the deity or [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Brahma (god)|Prajāpati Brahmā]]. He is one of the members of the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]] and associated with creation, but does not have a cult in present-day India. This is because Brahmā, the creator-god, is long-lived but not eternal i.e. Brahmā gets absorbed back into [[Purusha]] at the end of an aeon, and is born again at the beginning of a new [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]].

These are distinct from:
* A ''brāhm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ṇ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्राह्मण) (masculine, pronounced {{IPA-sa|ˈbraːhməɳə|}}), (which literally means "pertaining to prayer") is a prose commentary on the [[Veda|Vedic mantras]]—an integral part of the Vedic literature.
* A ''brāhm&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ṇ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'' (ब्राह्मण) (masculine, same pronunciation as above), means priest; in this usage the word is usually rendered in English as "[[Brahmin]]". This usage is also found in the [[Atharva Veda]]. In neuter plural form, Brahmāṇi. See [[Vedic priest]].
* ''[[Ishvara]]'', (lit., Supreme Lord), in Advaita, is identified as a partial worldly manifestation (with limited attributes) of the ultimate reality, the attributeless Brahman. In [[Visishtadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]], however, Ishvara (the Supreme Controller) has infinite attributes and the source of the impersonal Brahman.
* ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]'', the expansions of Brahman/God into various forms, each with a certain quality. In the Vedic religion, there were 33 devas, which later became exaggerated to 330 million devas. In fact, devas are themselves regarded as more mundane manifestations of the One and the Supreme Brahman (See [[Para Brahman]]). The Sanskrit word for "ten million" also means group, and 330 million devas originally meant 33 types of divine manifestations.

==History and literature==

===Vedic===
''Brahman'' is a concept present in Vedic [[Samhita]]s, the oldest layer of the [[Vedas]] dated to the 2nd millennium BCE. For example,&lt;ref name=barbarah29/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The ''Ṛcs'' are limited (''parimita''),
The ''Samans'' are limited,
And the ''Yajuses'' are limited,
But of the Word ''Brahman'', there is no end.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Taittiriya Samhita VII.3.1.4|Translated by Barbara Holdrege&lt;ref name=barbarah29&gt;Barbara Holdrege (1995), Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791416402}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept ''Brahman'' is referred to in hundreds of hymns in the Vedas.&lt;ref name=mauricebrahman&gt;[[Maurice Bloomfield]], [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/656/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance], Harvard University Press, pages 656-662&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is found in [[Rig veda]] hymns such as 2.2.10,&lt;ref&gt;Original: वयमग्ने अर्वता वा सुवीर्यं '''ब्रह्मणा''' वा चितयेमा जनाँ अति । अस्माकं द्युम्नमधि पञ्च कृष्टिषूच्चा स्वर्ण शुशुचीत दुष्टरम् ॥१०॥&lt;br&gt;Source: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_२.२ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं २.२] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; 6.21.8,&lt;ref&gt;Original: स तु श्रुधीन्द्र नूतनस्य '''ब्रह्मण्य'''तो वीर कारुधायः । त्वं ह्यापिः प्रदिवि पितॄणां शश्वद्बभूथ सुहव एष्टौ ॥८॥&lt;br&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_६.२१ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ६.२१] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; 10.72.2&lt;ref&gt;Original: '''ब्रह्मण'''स्पतिरेता सं कर्मार इवाधमत् । देवानां पूर्व्ये युगेऽसतः सदजायत ॥२॥&lt;br&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.७२ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.७२] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Atharvaveda|Atharva veda]] hymns such as 6.122.5, 10.1.12, and 14.1.131.&lt;ref name=mauricebrahman/&gt; The concept is found in various layers of the Vedic literature; for example:&lt;ref name=mauricebrahman/&gt; Aitareya [[Brahmana]] 1.18.3, Kausitaki Brahmana 6.12, Satapatha Brahmana 13.5.2.5, Taittiriya Brahmana 2.8.8.10, Jaiminiya Brahmana 1.129, Taittiriya [[Aranyaka]] 4.4.1 through 5.4.1, Vajasaneyi Samhita 22.4 through 23.25, Maitrayani Samhita 3.12.1:16.2 through 4.9.2:122.15. The concept is extensively discussed in the Upanishads embedded in the Vedas (see next section), and also mentioned in the [[Vedas#Vedanga|vedāṅga]] (the limbs of Vedas) such as the Srauta sutra 1.12.12 and Paraskara Gryhasutra 3.2.10 through 3.4.5.&lt;ref name=mauricebrahman/&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]] states that the diverse reference of ''Brahman'' in the Vedic literature, starting with Rigveda Samhitas, convey "different senses or different shades of meaning".&lt;ref name=jangondameaning&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 269–271&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one single word in modern Western languages that can render the various shades of meaning of the word ''Brahman'' in the Vedic literature, according to Jan Gonda.&lt;ref name=jangondameaning/&gt; In verses considered as the most ancient, the Vedic idea of ''Brahman'' is the "power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas". However, states Gonda, the verses suggest that this ancient meaning was never the only meaning, and the concept evolved and expanded in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 271–272&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Holdrege states that the concept ''Brahman'' is discussed in the Vedas along four major themes: as the Word or verses (''Sabdabrahman''),&lt;ref&gt;See Rigveda Chapter 1.164;&lt;br&gt;Karl Potter and Harold Coward, The Philosophy of the Grammarians, ''Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'': Volume 5, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-8120804265}}, pages 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; as Knowledge embodied in Creator Principle, as Creation itself, and a Corpus of traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (1995), ''Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791416402}}, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; Hananya Goodman states that the Vedas conceptualize Brahman as the Cosmic Principles underlying all that exists.&lt;ref name="Hananya Goodman 1994 page 121"/&gt; [[Gavin Flood]] states that the Vedic era witnessed a process of abstraction, where the concept of ''Brahman'' evolved and expanded from the power of sound, words and rituals to the "essence of the universe", the "deeper foundation of all phenomena", the "essence of the self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], soul)", and the deeper "truth of a person beyond apparent difference".&lt;ref name=gavinflood84&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
[[File:Mozzercork - Heart (by).jpg|thumb|Swan (Hansa, हंस) is the symbol for Brahman-Atman in Hindu iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Jones (2005), ''Encyclopedia of religion'', Volume 13, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}, page 8894, Quote: "In Hindu iconography the swan personifies Brahman-Atman, the transcendent yet immanent ground of being, the Self."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denise Cush (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415556231}}, page 697&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The primary focus on the early Upanishads is ''Brahmavidya'' and ''Atmavidya'', that is the knowledge of Brahman and the knowledge of Atman (self, soul), what it is and how it is understood.&lt;ref&gt;R. Prasad and P. D. Chattopadhyaya (2008), ''A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept'', {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; The texts do not present a single unified theory, rather they present a variety of themes with multiple possible interpretations, which flowered in post-Vedic era as premises for the diverse schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sphilips/&gt;

[[Paul Deussen]] states that the concept of ''Brahman'' in the Upanishads expands to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[ontology|ontological]] and [[soteriology|soteriological]] themes, such as it being the "primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen243&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 243, 325–344, 363, 581&lt;/ref&gt; the "principle of the world",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen243/&gt; the "[[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 358, 371&lt;/ref&gt; the "general, universal",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 305, 476&lt;/ref&gt; the "cosmic principle",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 110, 315–316, 495, 838–851&lt;/ref&gt; the "ultimate that is the cause of everything including all gods",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 211, 741–742&lt;/ref&gt; the "divine being, Lord, distinct God, or God within oneself",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 308–311, 497–499&lt;/ref&gt; the "knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 181, 237, 444, 506–544, 570–571, 707, 847–850&lt;/ref&gt; the "soul, sense of self of each human being that is fearless, luminuous, exalted and blissful",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen52&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 52, 110, 425, 454, 585–586, 838–851&lt;/ref&gt; the "essence of liberation, of spiritual freedom",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 173–174, 188–198, 308–317, 322–324, 367, 447, 496, 629–637, 658, 707–708&lt;/ref&gt; the "universe within each living being and the universe outside",&lt;ref name=pauldeussen52/&gt; the "essence and everything innate in all that exists inside, outside and everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 600, 619–620, 647, 777&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Flood summarizes the concept of ''Brahman'' in the Upanishads to be the "essence, the smallest particle of the cosmos and the infinite universe", the "essence of all things which cannot be seen, though it can be experienced", the "self, soul within each person, each being", the "truth", the "reality", the "absolute", the "bliss" (''ananda'').&lt;ref name=gavinflood84/&gt;

According to [[Radhakrishnan]], the sages of the [[Upanishads]] teach Brahman as the ultimate essence of material phenomena that cannot be seen or heard, but whose nature can be known through the development of self-knowledge (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma jnana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S., ''The Principal Upanisads'', HarperCollins India, 1994, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upanishads contain several ''mahā-vākyas'' or "Great Sayings"  on the concept of Brahman:&lt;ref name="EoH 270"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upanishad discuss the metaphysical concept of Brahman in many ways, such as the Śāṇḍilya doctrine in Chapter 3 of the Chandogya Upanishad, among of the oldest Upanishadic texts.&lt;ref name=hume314/&gt; The Śāṇḍilya doctrine on Brahman is not unique to Chandogya Upanishad, but found in other ancient texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana in section 10.6.3. It asserts that Atman (Soul, Self inside man) exists, the Brahman is identical with Atman, that the Brahman is inside man—thematic quotations that are frequently cited by later schools of Hinduism and modern studies on Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=hume314/&gt;&lt;ref name=gjha314&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n165/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad with Shankara Bhashya] Ganganath Jha (Translator), pages 150–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For modern era cites:

==Discussion==

The concept Brahman has a lot of undertones of meaning and is difficult to understand. It has relevance in :
* [[Metaphysics]]
* [[Ontology]]
* [[Axiology]] ([[Ethics]] &amp; [[Aesthetics]])
* [[Teleology]]
* [[Soteriology]]

===Brahman as a metaphysical concept===
Brahman is the key metaphysical concept in various schools of Hindu philosophy. It is the theme in its diverse discussions to the two central questions of [[metaphysics]]: what is ultimately real, and are there principles applying to everything that is real?&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/metaphysics/ Metaphysics], Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}, Accessed (13 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman is the ultimate "eternally, constant" reality, while the observed universe is a different kind of reality but one which is "temporary, changing" [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] in various orthodox Hindu schools. Maya pre-exists and co-exists with Brahman—the Ultimate Reality, The Highest Universal, the Cosmic Principles.&lt;ref name=aegough&gt;Archibald Edward Gough (2001), ''The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415245227}}, pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the concept of Brahman, Hindu metaphysics includes the concept of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]—or soul, self—which is also considered ultimately real.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; The various schools of Hinduism, particularly the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dual]] and non-dual schools, differ on the nature of Atman, whether it is distinct from Brahman, or same as Brahman. Those that consider Brahman and Atman as distinct are theistic, and [[Dvaita Vedanta]] and later [[Nyaya]] schools illustrate this premise.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (Editor, 2000), ''Indian Philosophy: Metaphysics'', Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0815336082}}, page xvii;&lt;br&gt;K. K. Chakrabarti (1999), ''Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}} pages 279–292&lt;/ref&gt; Those that consider Brahman and Atman as same are monist or pantheistic, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], later [[Samkhya]]&lt;ref&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), ''Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] schools illustrate this metaphysical premise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Lipner]] (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Patton (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 45–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Fowler (1996), ''Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices'', Sussex University Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pages 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; In schools that equate Brahman with Atman, Brahman is the sole, ultimate reality.&lt;ref name="acdas"/&gt; The predominant teaching in the Upanishads is the spiritual identity of soul within each human being, with the soul of every other human being and living being, as well as with the supreme, ultimate reality ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), ''Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101–109 (in German), also pages 69–99;&lt;br&gt;[http://www.vedantaadvaita.org/AdvaitaVedanta_3.htm Advaita Vedanta - A Bird's Eye View], Topic III: ''Philosophy of Advaita Vedanta'', D. Krishna Ayyar (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the metaphysics of the major schools of Hinduism, Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality—the Brahman. Maya is unconscious, Brahman-Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal and the effect, Brahman is the figurative ''Upādāna''—the principle and the cause.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept, states Archibald Gough, is "the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt;

While Hinduism sub-schools such as Advaita Vedanta emphasize the complete equivalence of ''Brahman'' and ''Atman'', they also expound on Brahman as ''[[saguna Brahman]]''—the Brahman with attributes, and ''[[nirguna Brahman]]''—the Brahman without attributes.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.7825/2164-6279.1250|title = Heirarchies{{sic|hide=y}} in the Nature of God?

===Brahman as an ontological concept===
Brahman, along with Soul/Self (Atman) are part of the ontological&lt;ref&gt;that is things, beings or truths that are presumed to exist for its philosophical theory to be true, and what is the nature of that which so exists?; see: Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/ontology/ Ontology], ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}&lt;/ref&gt; premises of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (1998), [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/ontology/ Ontology], ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}, Accessed (13 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips (2001), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400164 Could There Be Mystical Evidence for a Nondual Brahman? A Causal Objection], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 51, No. 4, pages 492–506&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools of Indian philosophy have held widely dissimilar ontologies. [[Buddhism]] and [[Carvaka]] school of Hinduism deny that there exists anything called "a soul, a self" (individual Atman or Brahman in the cosmic sense), while the orthodox schools of Hinduism, [[Jainism]] and [[Ajivika]]s hold that there exists "a soul, a self".&lt;ref&gt;K.

Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";&lt;br /&gt;Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}}, pages 2–4&lt;br /&gt;Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], ''Philosophy Now''&lt;br /&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), ''Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept.

Prabhakar (2012), Review: An Introduction to Indian Philosophy, ''Philosophy in Review'', 32(3), pages 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahman as well the Atman in every human being (and living being) is considered equivalent and the sole reality, the eternal, self-born, unlimited, innately free, blissful Absolute in schools of Hinduism such as the [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]].&lt;ref name=barbarasca&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 241–242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (2014), ''A Hindu Theology of Liberation: Not-Two Is Not One'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438454559}}, pages 131–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), ''The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 298–300;&lt;br&gt;Mike McNamee and William J. Morgan (2015), ''Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Sport'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415829809}}, pages 135–136, '''Quote''': "As a dualistic philosophy largely congruent with Samkhya's metaphysics, Yoga seeks liberation through the realization that Atman equals Brahman; it involves a cosmogonic dualism: purusha an absolute consciousness, and prakriti original and primeval matter."&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing one's own self is knowing the God inside oneself, and this is held as the path to knowing the ontological nature of Brahman (universal Self) as it is identical to the Atman (individual Self). The nature of Atman-Brahman is held in these schools, states Barbara Holdrege, to be as a pure being (''sat''), consciousness (''cit'') and full of bliss (''ananda''), and it is formless, distinctionless, nonchanging and unbounded.&lt;ref name=barbarasca/&gt;

In theistic schools, in contrast, such as [[Dvaita Vedanta]], the nature of Brahman is held as eternal, unlimited, innately free, blissful Absolute, while each individual's soul is held as distinct and limited which can at best come close in eternal blissful love of the Brahman (therein viewed as the Godhead).&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney and Tony Stewart (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, pages 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools of Hinduism have their own ontological premises relating to Brahman, reality and nature of existence. [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, for example, holds a substantial, realist ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kloetzli and Alf Hiltebeitel (2004), ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: S. Mittal and G. Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0415215277}}, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carvaka]] school denied Brahman and Atman, and held a materialist ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Myers (2000), ''Brahman: A Comparative Theology'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712571}}, pages 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahman as an axiological concept===
Brahman and Atman are key concepts to Hindu theories of [[axiology]]: ethics and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;R. Prasad and P. D. Chattopadhyaya (2008), ''A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept'', {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, pages 56–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Pande (1990), ''Foundations of Indian Culture'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807105}}, pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ananda'' (bliss), state Michael Myers and other scholars, has axiological importance to the concept of Brahman, as the universal inner harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Myers (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400017 Śaṅkarācārya and Ānanda], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 48, No. 4, pages 553–567&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hartman (2002), ''The Knowledge of Good: Critique of Axiological Reason'', Rodopi, {{ISBN|978-9042012202}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars equate Brahman with the highest value, in an axiological sense.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. P. Mahadevan (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397291 The Metaphysics of Śaṁkara], ''Philosophy East and Wes''t, Vol. 3, No. 4, pages 359–363&lt;/ref&gt;

The axiological concepts of Brahman and Atman is central to Hindu theory of values.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (1999), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40018229 The Puruṣārthas: An Axiological Exploration of Hinduism], ''The Journal of Religious Ethics'', Vol. 27, No. 2, pages 223–256&lt;/ref&gt; A statement such as ‘I am Brahman’, states Shaw, means ‘I am related to everything,’ and this is the underlying premise for compassion for others in Hinduism, for each individual's welfare, peace, or happiness depends on others, including other beings and nature at large, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Shaw (2011), [http://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/comparativephilosophy/s1/Freedom-East-and-West-by-J-L-Shaw.pdf Freedom: East and West], ''SOPHIA'', Vol 50, Springer Science, pages 481–497&lt;/ref&gt; Tietge states that even in non-dual schools of Hinduism where Brahman and Atman are treated ontologically equivalent, the theory of values emphasizes individual agent and ethics. In these schools of Hinduism, states Tietge, the theory of action are derived from and centered in compassion for the other, and not egotistical concern for the self.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L Tietge (1997), ''Ontology and Genuine Moral Action: Jñaña (Intuitive Perception) Ethics and Karma-Yoga in Sankara's Advaita Vedanta and Schopenhauer's On the Basis of Morality'', Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Philosophy, Southern Illinois University (US), [http://philpapers.org/rec/TIEOAG Archive Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The axiological theory of values emerges implicitly from the concepts of Brahman and Atman, states Bauer.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt; The aesthetics of human experience and ethics are one consequence of self-knowledge in Hinduism, one resulting from the perfect, timeless unification of one's soul with the Brahman, the soul of everyone, everything and all eternity, wherein the pinnacle of human experience is not dependent on an afterlife, but pure consciousness in the present life itself.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt; It does not assume that an individual is weak nor does it presume that he is inherently evil, but the opposite: human soul and its nature is held as fundamentally unqualified, faultless, beautiful, blissful, ethical, compassionate and good.&lt;ref name=nancybauer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2000), ''Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pages 57–61&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorance is to assume it evil, liberation is to know its eternal, expansive, pristine, happy and good nature.&lt;ref name=nancybauer&gt;Nancy Bauer (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399082 Advaita Vedānta and Contemporary Western Ethics], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 37, No. 1, pages 36–50&lt;/ref&gt; The axiological premises in the Hindu thought and Indian philosophies in general, states Nikam, is to elevate the individual, exalting the innate potential of man, where the reality of his being is the objective reality of the universe.&lt;ref name=nikam/&gt; The Upanishads of Hinduism, summarizes Nikam, hold that the individual has the same essence and reality as the objective universe, and this essence is the finest essence; the individual soul is the universal soul, and Atman is the same reality and the same aesthetics as the Brahman.&lt;ref name=nikam&gt;N. A. Nikam (1952), A Note on the Individual and His Status in Indian Thought, ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 2, No. 3, pages 254–258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahman as a teleological concept===
Brahman and Atman are very important teleological concepts. [[Teleology]] deals with the apparent purpose, principle or goal of something. In the first chapter of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], these questions are dealt with. It says :
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
"People who make inquiries about brahman say:

What is the cause of Brahman? Why were we born? By what do we live? On what are we established? Governed by whom, O you who know Brahman, do we live in pleasure and in pain, each in our respective situation?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Svetashvatara Upanishad|Hymns 1.1&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduwebsite.com/sveta.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://estudantedavedanta.net/Svetasvatara_Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Tyagisananda%20%281949%29%20{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[Sanskrit-English].pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The main purpose of the Brahman and why it exists is a subjective question according to the [[Upanishads]]. One can only find out its true purpose when one becomes the Brahman as the 'Brahman' is all the knowledge one can know itself. Hence, complete answers for anything in life can only be determined or obtained when the Brahman is realized as the Brahman is all the complete knowledge itself. This is said in the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4.4.17 and many other [[Upanishads]].

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Knowledge is the eye of all that, and on knowledge it is founded. Knowledge is the eye of the world, and knowledge, the foundation. Brahman is knowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Aitereya Upanishad|Hymns 3.3&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-aitareya_upanishad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://esamskriti.com/essays/Aitareya-Upanishad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the reasons to why the Brahman should be realized according to the Upanishads is because it removes suffering from a person's life. This is because the person has the ability and knowledge to discriminate between the unchanging (Atman and Brahman) and the ever-changing ([[Prakrit]]) and so the person is not attached to the transient. Hence, the person is only content with the self and not his body or anything other than the self.

In [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.9.26 it mentions that the atman 'neither trembles in fear nor suffers injury' and in the [[Isha Upanishad]] 6-7 it too talks about suffering as non existent when one becomes the Brahman as they see the self in all beings and all beings in the self. Therefore, the apparent purpose of Brahman is in discussion in the [[Upanishads]] but the Brahman itself is the only self-contained purpose and true goal according to the [[Upanishads]], so posing the question is redundant. The [[Upanishads]] consider the Brahman the only actual worthwhile goal in life and ultimately one should aim to become it as it is the means and an end in and of itself to ultimate knowledge, immortality, etc. So the question of what is the ultimate purpose of everything including the Brahman is answered by realizing or attaining the Brahman as the Brahman itself is ultimate knowledge. Hence, the Brahman is a teleological concept as it is the ultimate purpose and goal of everything possible and permeates everything and is in everything.

===Brahman as a soteriological concept: Moksha===
{{Main|Moksha}}

The orthodox schools of Hinduism, particularly Vedanta, Samkhya and Yoga schools, focus on the concept of Brahman and Atman in their discussion of [[moksha]]. The Advaita Vedanta holds there is no being/non-being distinction between Atman and Brahman. The knowledge of Atman (Self-knowledge) is synonymous to the knowledge of Brahman inside the person and outside the person. Furthermore, the knowledge of Brahman leads to a sense of oneness with all existence, self-realization, indescribable joy, and moksha (freedom, bliss),&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas'', University of Hawaii Press, pages 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; because Brahman-Atman is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta Up to Śaṃkara and His Pupils'', Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 210–215&lt;/ref&gt;

The theistic sub-school such as Dvaita Vedanta of Hinduism, starts with the same premises, but adds the premise that individual souls and Brahman are distinct, and thereby reaches entirely different conclusions where Brahman is conceptualized in a manner similar to God in other major world religions.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt; The theistic schools assert that moksha is the loving, eternal union or nearness of one's soul with the distinct and separate Brahman ([[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or equivalent henotheism). Brahman, in these sub-schools of Hinduism is considered the highest perfection of existence, which every soul journeys towards in its own way for moksha.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Stafford (2010) "Dvaita, Advaita, And Viśiṣṭadvaita: Contrasting Views Of Mokṣa", ''Asian Philosophy'', pages 215–224&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book ''Sunlightenment: Science of Universe''&lt;ref name="Fathor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brain Mechanic|first=Fathor|title=Sunlightenment: Science of Universe|year=2018|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sunlightenment-Science-Universe-Fathor-ebook/dp/B07KX3X393/}}&lt;/ref&gt; says 'Brahman as the State of a Ripple made by the Great Swan as it olam infinites, like the Pulses of Universe as the State of Sun.'

==Schools of thought==

===Vedanta===
The concept of Brahman, its nature and its relationship with Atman and the observed universe, is a major point of difference between the various sub-schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.

====Advaita Vedanta====
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta}}
{{Advaita}}
[[Advaita Vedanta]] espouses [[nondualism]]. ''Brahman'' is the sole unchanging reality,&lt;ref name=acdas&gt;AC Das (1952), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397304 Brahman and Māyā in Advaita Metaphysics], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pages 144–154&lt;/ref&gt; there is no duality, no limited individual souls nor a separate unlimited cosmic soul, rather all souls, all of existence, across all space and time, is one and the same.&lt;ref name=jeffreybrodd/&gt;&lt;ref name=barbarasca/&gt;&lt;ref name=rdalal&gt;Rosen Dalal (2014), Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-8184752779}}, see article on Brahman&lt;/ref&gt; The universe and the soul inside each being is Brahman, and the universe and the soul outside each being is Brahman, according to Advaita Vedanta. Brahman is the origin and end of all things, material and spiritual. ''Brahman'' is the root source of everything that exists. He states that Brahman can neither be taught nor perceived (as an object of intellectual knowledge), but it can be learned and realized by all human beings.&lt;ref name="Arvind Sharma 2007 pages 19-40"/&gt; The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to realize that one's Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') gets obscured by ignorance and false-identification ("[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]"). When Avidya is removed, the Atman (Soul, Self inside a person) is realized as identical with Brahman.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; The Brahman is not an outside, separate, dual entity, the Brahman is within each person, states Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. ''Brahman'' is all that is eternal, unchanging and that which truly exists.&lt;ref name=acdas/&gt; This view is stated in this school in many different forms, such as "''Ekam sat''" ("Truth is one"), and all is ''Brahman''.

The universe does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], a proponent of [[Advaita Vedanta]], the knowledge of Brahman that [[shruti]] provides cannot be obtained by any other means besides self inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas.'' University of Hawaii Press, pages 125, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Advaita Vedanta]], nirguna Brahman, that is the Brahman without attributes, is held to be the ultimate and sole reality.&lt;ref name=acdas/&gt;&lt;ref name=williamw/&gt; Consciousness is not a property of Brahman but its very nature. In this respect, Advaita Vedanta differs from other Vedanta schools.&lt;ref&gt;[Sangeetha Menon (2007), ''Advaita Vedānta''], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Example verses from [[Bhagavad-Gita]] include:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The [[Yajna|offering]] is Brahman; the oblation is Brahman;
offered by Brahman into the fire of Brahman.

&lt;/poem&gt;
|Bhagavad Gita|}}

====Dvaita Vedanta====
{{Vaishnavism}}
Brahman of [[Dvaita]] is a concept similar to God in major world religions.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt; Dvaita holds that the individual soul is dependent on God, but distinct.&lt;ref name=mmyers/&gt;

Dvaita propounds Tattvavada which means understanding differences between [[Tattva]]s (significant properties) of entities within the universal substrate as follows:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

# Jîva-Îshvara-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between the soul and Vishnu
# Jada-Îshvara-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between the insentient and Vishnu
# Mitha-jîva-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between any two souls
# Jada-jîva-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between insentient and the soul
# Mitha-jada-bheda&amp;nbsp;— difference between any two insentients

====Achintya Bheda Abheda====
The [[Acintya Bheda Abheda]] philosophy is similar to [[Dvaitadvaita]] (differential [[monism]]). In this philosophy, Brahman is not just impersonal, but also personal.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} That Brahman is Supreme Personality of Godhead, though on first stage of realization (by process called [[jnana]]) of Absolute Truth, He is realized as impersonal Brahman, then as personal Brahman having eternal [[Vaikunta|Vaikuntha]] abode (also known as Brahmalokah sanatana), then as [[Paramatma]] (by process of [[yoga]]–[[meditation]] on Supersoul, Vishnu-God in heart)—Vishnu ([[Narayana]], also in everyone's heart) who has many abodes known as Vishnulokas (Vaikunthalokas), and finally (Absolute Truth is realized by [[bhakti]]) as [[Bhagavan]], Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is source of both Paramatma and Brahman (personal, impersonal, or both).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Vaishnavism===
{{Main|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and perceive the Advaita concept of identification of Atman with the impersonal Brahman as an intermediate step of self-realization, but not [[Moksha|Mukti]], or final liberation of complete God-realization through [[Bhakti Yoga]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a form of Achintya Bheda Abheda philosophy, also concludes that Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to them, Brahman is Lord Vishnu/Krishna; the universe and all other manifestations of the Supreme are extensions of Him.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Bhakti movement===
{{main|Bhakti movement}}

The Bhakti movement of Hinduism built its theosophy around two concepts of Brahman—''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna''.&lt;ref name=karen21&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), ''The Embodiment of Bhakti'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nirguna'' Brahman was the concept of the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), ''The Bhagavad Gita'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages xxvii–xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saguna'' Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; The two had parallels in the ancient pantheistic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), ''The Bhagavad Gita'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from ''Nirguni'' knowledge-focus and other from ''Saguni'' love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt; ''Nirguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Jnana-shrayi'', or had roots in knowledge.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; ''Saguna'' bhakta's poetry were ''Prema-shrayi'', or with roots in love.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt; In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.&lt;ref name=fowlernirgunasaguna/&gt;

Jeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, at the root of Bhakti movement [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], underwent more profound development with the ideas of [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, particularly those of [[Adi Shankara]]'s Advaita Vedanta, [[Ramanuja]]'s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=jeaneanefxxvii/&gt; Two 12th-century influential treatises on bhakti were ''Sandilya Bhakti Sutra''—a treatise resonating with Nirguna-bhakti, and ''Narada Bhakti Sutra''—a treatise that leans towards Saguna-bhakti.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Frazier and Gavin Flood (2011), ''The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies'', Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826499660}}, pages 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nirguna'' and ''Saguna'' Brahman concepts of the Bhakti movement has been a baffling one to scholars, particularly the ''Nirguni'' tradition because it offers, states David Lorenzen, "heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality".&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns/&gt; Yet given the "mountains of ''Nirguni'' bhakti literature", adds Lorenzen, bhakti for ''Nirguna Brahman'' has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the bhakti for ''Saguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenns&gt;David Lorenzen (1996), ''Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791428054}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; These were two alternate ways of imagining God during the bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=karen21/&gt;

==Buddhist understanding of Brahman==

Buddhism rejects the Upanishadic doctrine of Brahman and Atman (soul, permanent self, essence).{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Zen Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 2005), p. 30: "''Upanisadic'' thought is anything but consistent; nevertheless, there is a common focus on the acceptance of a totally transcendent Absolute, a trend which arose in the ''Vedic'' period. This indescribable Absolute is called Brahman [...] The true Self and Brahman are one and the same. Known as the Brahman-Atman synthesis, this theory, which is central to ''Upanisadic'' thought, is the cornerstone of Indian philosophy. The Brahman-Atman synthesis, which posits the theory of a permanent, unchanging self, was anathema to Buddhists, and it was as a reaction to the synthesis that Buddhism first drew breath. Merv Fowler p. 47: "For the ''Upanisadic'' sages, the real is the Self, is Atman, is Brahman. [...] To the Buddhist, however, any talk of an ''Atman'' or permanent, unchanging Self, the very kernel of ''Upanisadic'' thought, is anathema, a false notion of manifest proportion."}} According to Damien Keown, "the Buddha said he could find no evidence for the existence of either the personal soul (''atman'') or its cosmic counterpart (''brahman'')".&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, ''Buddhism'' (NY: Sterling, 2009), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphysics of Buddhism rejects Brahman (ultimate being), Brahman-like essence, soul and anything metaphysically equivalent through its [[Anatta]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Webster|title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqxI7YRUSegC|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-01057-0|pages=194–195, 93, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|author2=Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub|title=Buddhist Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7_Rea05eAMC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3248-0|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Juergensmeyer|author2=Wade Clark Roof|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5 |pages=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Merv Fowler, some forms of Buddhism have incorporated concepts that resemble that of Brahman.{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 34: "It was inevitable that the non-theistic philosophy of orthodox Buddhism should court the older Hindu practices and, in particular, infuse into its philosophy the belief in a totally transcendent Absolute of the nature of Brahman."}} As an example, Fowler cites the early [[Sarvastivada]] school of Buddhism, which "had come to accept a very pantheistic religious philosophy, and are important because of the impetus they gave to the development of Mahayana Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Theodore De Bary, in the doctrines of the [[Yogacara]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], "the Body of Essence, the Ultimate Buddha, who pervaded and underlay the whole universe [...] was in fact the World Soul, the Brahman of the Upanishads, in a new form".&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore De Bary, cited in Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fowler, some scholars have identified the Buddhist ''[[nirvana]]'', conceived of as the Ultimate Reality, with the Hindu Brahman/atman; Fowler claims that this view "has gained little support in Buddhist circles."&lt;ref&gt;Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler asserts  that the authors of a number of Mahayana texts took pains to differentiate their ideas from the Upanishadic doctrine of Brahman.{{refn|group=note|Merv Fowler, ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices'' (Brighton: Sussex Academic, 1999), p. 82: "The original writers of these Mahayana texts were not at all pleased that their writings were seen to contain the Brahman of the ''Upanisads'' in a new form. The authors of the ''Lankavatara''  strenuously denied that the womb of Tathagatahood, [...] was in any way equatable with the 'eternal self', the Brahmanical ''atman'' of ''Upanisadic'' thought. Similarly, the claim in the ''Nirvana Sutra'' that the Buddha regarded Buddhahood as a 'great atman' caused the Yogacarins considerable distress."}}

===Brahma as a surrogate for Brahman in Buddhist texts===
The spiritual concept of Brahman is far older in the Vedic literature, and some scholars suggest deity Brahma may have emerged as a personal conception and icon with form and attributes (saguna version) of the impersonal, nirguna (without attributes), formless universal principle called Brahman.&lt;ref name=brucesullivan&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1999), Seer of the Fifth Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816763}}, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hindu texts, one of the earliest mention of deity Brahma along with [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] is in the fifth ''Prapathaka'' (lesson) of the [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]], probably composed in late 1st millennium BCE, after the rise of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=hume51&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n443/mode/2up|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=422–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

The early Buddhists attacked the concept of Brahma, states Gananath Obeyesekere, and thereby [[polemic]]ally attacked the Vedic and Upanishadic concept of gender neutral, abstract metaphysical Brahman.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2006p179"/&gt; This critique of Brahma in early Buddhist texts aim at ridiculing the [[Vedas]], but the same texts simultaneously call ''metta'' (loving-kindness, compassion) as the state of union with Brahma. The early Buddhist approach to Brahma was to reject any creator aspect, while retaining the value system in the Vedic [[Brahmavihara]] concepts, in the Buddhist value system.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2006p179"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEK4Qgm7Z0kC |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2609-0 |pages=177–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin Wiltshire, the term "Brahma loka" in the Buddhist canon, instead of "Svarga loka", is likely a Buddhist attempt to choose and emphasize the "truth power" and knowledge focus of the Brahman concept in the Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G.

 }}
The metaphysical concept of Brahman, particularly as ''nirguni Brahman''—attributeless, formless, eternal Highest Reality—is at the foundation of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=sskohli39&gt;S. S. Kohli (1993), ''The Sikh and Sikhism'', Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is observed through ''nirguni Bhakti'' by the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Hardip Syan (2014), in ''The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies'' (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mandair (2011), Time and religion-making in modern Sikhism, in ''Time, History and the Religious Imaginary in South Asia'' (Editor: Anne Murphy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415595971}}, pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gauri, which is part of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], Brahman is declared as "One without a second", in Sri Rag "everything is born of Him, and is finally absorbed in Him", in Var Asa "whatever we see or hear is the manifestation of Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Kohli (1993), ''The Sikh and Sikhism'', Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; Nesbitt states that the first two words, ''Ik Onkar'', in the twelve-word Mul Mantar at the opening of the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib, has been translated in three different ways by scholars: "There is one god", "This being is one", and as "One reality is".&lt;ref name=eleanor/&gt;

Similar emphasis on "One without a second" for metaphysical concept of Brahman, is found in ancient texts of Hinduism, such as the Chandogya Upanishad's chapter 6.2.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/92/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1] Oxford University Press, pages 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], ''Sixty Upanishads of the Veda'', Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 156–157, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas about God and Highest Reality in Sikhism share themes found in the ''Saguna'' and ''Nirguna'' concepts of Brahman in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sskohli39/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.

The concept of Ultimate Reality (Brahman) is also referred in Sikhism as ''Nam'', ''Sat-naam'' or ''Naam'', and ''Ik Oankar'' like Hindu [[Om]] symbolizes this Reality.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1998), ''The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'', 2nd edition, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pages 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

==Brahman in Jainism==
Scholars contest whether the concept of Brahman is rejected or accepted in Jainism. The concept of a theistic God is rejected by Jainism, but ''Jiva'' or "Atman (soul) exists" is held to be a metaphysical truth and central to its theory of rebirths and [[Kevala Jnana]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Billington (1997), ''Understanding Eastern Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415129657}}, page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Bissett states that Jainism accepts the "material world" and "Atman", but rejects Brahman—the metaphysical concept of Ultimate Reality and Cosmic Principles found in the ancient texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;James Bissett, ''Cultural and Religious Heritage of India'', Volume 2: Jainism (Editors: Sharma and Sharma), Mittal, {{ISBN|81-70999553}}, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Goswami, in contrast, states that the literature of Jainism has an undercurrent of monist theme, where the self who gains the knowledge of Brahman (Highest Reality, Supreme Knowledge) is identical to Brahman itself.&lt;ref&gt;C. Caillat and N.

A '''chemical formula''' is a way of  presenting information about the chemical proportions of [[atom]]s that constitute a particular [[chemical compound]] or molecule, using [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A chemical formula is not a [[chemical nomenclature|chemical name]], and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical [[structural formula]]. Chemical formulas can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of [[molecule]]s and [[chemical substance]]s, and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.

The simplest types of chemical formulas are called ''[[empirical formula]]s'', which use letters and numbers indicating the numerical ''proportions'' of atoms of each type. '''Molecular formulas''' indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on structure. For example, the empirical formula for glucose is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon and oxygen), while its molecular formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (12 hydrogen atoms, six carbon and oxygen atoms).

Sometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a [[condensed formula]] (or condensed molecular formula, occasionally called a "semi-structural formula"), which conveys additional information about the particular ways in which the atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] together, either in [[covalent bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, or various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension. An example is the condensed molecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. However, even a condensed chemical formula is necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships between atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different [[substituent]]s.

Since a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship between atoms in chemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and chemical formulas, at right). For reasons of structural complexity, there is no condensed chemical formula (or semi-structural formula) that specifies glucose (and there exist many different molecules, for example [[fructose]] and [[mannose]], that have the same [[molecular formula]] [[C6H12O6|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as glucose). Linear equivalent chemical ''names'' exist that can and do specify any complex structural formula (see [[chemical nomenclature]]), but such names must use many terms (words), rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that define a chemical formula.

Chemical formulas may be used in [[chemical equation]]s to describe [[chemical reaction]]s and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulas do not have the full power of structural formulas to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus [[Chemical equation#Balancing chemical equations|balancing chemical equations]] so that these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric charge.

== Overview ==
A chemical formula identifies each constituent [[chemical element|element]] by its [[chemical symbol]] and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of [[ethanol]] may be written C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is [[boron carbide]], whose formula of CB&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.

When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple [[molecule]]s, chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. These types of formulas are variously known as ''molecular formulas'' and ''[[structural formula|condensed formulas]]''. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for [[glucose]] is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.

For simple molecules, a condensed (or semi-structural) formula is a type of chemical formula that may fully imply a correct structural formula. For example, [[ethanol]] may be represented by the condensed chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, and [[dimethyl ether]] by the condensed formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These two molecules have the same empirical and molecular formulas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O), but may be differentiated by the condensed formulas shown, which are sufficient to represent the full structure of these simple [[organic compound]]s.

Condensed chemical formulas may also be used to represent [[ionic compound]]s that do not exist as discrete molecules, but nonetheless do contain covalently bound clusters within them. These [[polyatomic ion]]s are groups of atoms that are covalently bound together and have an overall ionic charge, such as the sulfate {{chem|[S|O|4|]|2-}} ion. Each polyatomic ion in a compound is written individually in order to illustrate the separate groupings. For example, the compound [[dichlorine hexoxide]] has an empirical formula {{chem|Cl|O|3}}, and molecular formula {{chem|Cl|2|O|6}}, but in liquid or solid forms, this compound is more correctly shown by an ionic condensed formula {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+|[ClO|4|]|-}}, which illustrates that this compound consists of {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+}} ions and {{chem|[ClO|4|]|-}} ions. In such cases, the condensed formula only need be complex enough to show at least one of each ionic species.

Chemical formulas as described here are distinct from the far more complex chemical systematic names that are used in various systems of [[chemical nomenclature]]. For example, one systematic name for glucose is (2''R'',3''S'',4''R'',5''R'')-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucose's structural formula, but the name is not a chemical formula as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in chemical formulas. Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.

== Empirical formula ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Acetic acid]] --&gt;
{{anchor|1=Empirical formulas}}
{{main|Empirical formula}}
In [[chemistry]], the [[empirical formula]] of a chemical is a simple expression of the relative number of each type of atom or ratio of the elements in the compound. Empirical formulas are the standard for [[ionic compound]]s, such as {{chem|CaCl|2}}, and for macromolecules, such as {{chem|SiO|2}}. An empirical formula makes no reference to [[isomer]]ism, structure, or absolute number of atoms. The term ''empirical'' refers to the process of [[elemental analysis]], a technique of [[analytical chemistry]] used to determine the relative percent composition of a pure chemical substance by element.

For example, [[hexane]] has a molecular formula of {{chem|C|6|H|14}}, or structurally {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|3}}, implying that it has a chain structure of 6 [[carbon]] atoms, and 14 [[hydrogen]] atoms. However, the empirical formula for hexane is {{chem|C|3|H|7}}. Likewise the empirical formula for [[hydrogen peroxide]], {{chem|H|2|O|2}}, is simply HO expressing the 1:1 ratio of component elements. [[Formaldehyde]] and [[acetic acid]] have the same empirical formula, {{chem|CH|2|O}}. This is the actual chemical formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms.

== Molecular formula ==
Molecular formulas indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular substance. They are the same as empirical formulas for molecules that only have one atom of a particular type, but otherwise may have larger numbers. An example of the difference is the empirical formula for glucose, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''ratio'' 1:2:1), while its molecular formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (''number of atoms'' 6:12:6). For water, both formulas are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. A molecular formula provides more information about a molecule than its empirical formula, but is more difficult to establish.

A molecular formula shows the number of elements in a molecule, and determines whether it is a [[binary compound]], [[ternary compound]], [[quaternary compound]], or has even more elements.

== Condensed formula ==
{{Main|Condensed formula}}
[[File:Isobutane_numbered_2D.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Isobutane]] structural formula&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensed or semi-structural chemical formula: (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH]]

{{Image frame|content=&lt;chem&gt;H-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-H&lt;/chem&gt;|align=right|width=155|caption=''n''-[[Butane]] structural formula&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensed or semi-structural formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}

The [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of [[isomer]]s) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a [[structural formula]] is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate [[molecular geometry|shape of the molecule]].

A condensed chemical formula may represent the types and spatial arrangement of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] in a simple chemical substance, though it does not necessarily specify [[isomer]]s or complex structures. For example, [[ethane]] consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[ethylene]] there is a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only has two hydrogens), therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or less commonly H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C'''::'''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The two lines (or two pairs of dots) indicate that a [[double bond]] connects the atoms on either side of them.

A [[triple bond]] may be expressed with three lines (HC≡CH) or three pairs of dots (HC:::CH), and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond.

Molecules with multiple [[functional group]]s that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in [[parenthesis|round brackets]]. For example, [[isobutane]] may be written (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three [[methyl group|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]]. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, ''n''-[[butane]]: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Law of composition == 
In any given chemical compound, the elements always combine in the same proportion with each other. This is the [[law of constant composition]].

The law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. If we look at the relative masses of oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule, we see that 94% of the mass of a water molecule is accounted for by oxygen and the remaining 6% is the mass of hydrogen. This mass proportion will be the same for any water molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of Constant Composition|url=http://www.everythingmaths.co.za/science/grade-10/13-physical-and-chemical-change/13-physical-and-chemical-change-03.cnxmlplus|website=Everything Math and Science|publisher=SIYAVULA|accessdate=31 March 2016}} [[File:CC-BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] This material is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical names in answer to limitations of chemical formulas ===&lt;!-- what why here??? --&gt;
{{main|Chemical nomenclature}}
The alkene called '''but-2-ene''' has two isomers, which the chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not identify. The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (''cis'' or ''Z'') or on the opposite sides from each other (''trans'' or ''E''). Such extra symbols violate the rules for chemical formulas, and begin to enter the territory of more complex naming systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}

As noted above, in order to represent the full structural formulas of many complex organic and inorganic compounds, [[chemical nomenclature]] may be needed which goes well beyond the available resources used above in simple condensed formulas.  See [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]] and [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005]] for examples. In addition, linear naming systems such as [[International Chemical Identifier]] (InChI) allow a computer to construct a structural formula, and [[simplified molecular-input line-entry system]] (SMILES) allows a more human-readable ASCII input. However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are chemical naming systems, not formula systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}

=== Polymers in condensed formulas ===

For [[polymer]]s in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a [[hydrocarbon]] molecule that is described as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a molecule with fifty repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter ''n'' may be used to indicate this formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Ions in condensed formulas ===
For [[ion]]s, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The total charge on a charged molecule or a [[polyatomic ion]] may also be shown in this way. For example: [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[Sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]].  Note that + and - are used in place of +1 and -1, respectively.

For more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in compounds such as [[Caesium dodecaborate|Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]]. Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in [[Hexamminecobalt(III)_chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Here, (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the ion contains six [[ammine|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]] bonded to [[cobalt]], and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3. {{Elucidate|date=November 2012}}

This is strictly optional; a chemical formula is valid with or without ionization information, and Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride may be written as [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Brackets, like parentheses, behave in chemistry as they do in mathematics, grouping terms together{{snd}} they are not specifically employed only for ionization states.  In the latter case here, the parentheses indicate 6 groups all of the same shape, bonded to another group of size 1 (the cobalt atom), and then the entire bundle, as a group, is bonded to 3 chlorine atoms.  In the former case, it is clearer that the bond connecting the chlorines is [[ionic bonding|ionic]], rather than [[covalent bond|covalent]].

== Isotopes ==

Although [[isotope]]s are more relevant to [[nuclear chemistry]] or [[stable isotope]] chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may be indicated with a prefixed [[superscript]] in a chemical formula. For example, the phosphate ion containing radioactive phosphorus-32 is &amp;#91;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. Also a study involving stable isotope ratios might include the molecule &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O.

A left-hand subscript is sometimes used redundantly to indicate the [[atomic number]]. For example, &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for dioxygen, and {{ComplexNuclide2|O|16|q=2}}  for the most abundant isotopic species of dioxygen. This is convenient when writing equations for [[nuclear reaction]]s, in order to show the balance of charge more clearly.

== Trapped atoms ==
[[File:Endohedral fullerene.png|thumb|180px|Traditional formula: MC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "@" notation: M@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]
{{main|Endohedral fullerene}}
The @ symbol ([[at sign]]) indicates an atom or molecule trapped inside a cage but not chemically bound to it. For example, a [[buckminsterfullerene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) with an atom (M) would simply be represented as MC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; regardless of whether M was inside the fullerene without chemical bonding or outside, bound to one of the carbon atoms. Using the @ symbol, this would be denoted M@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; if M was inside the carbon network. A non-fullerene example is [As@Ni&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, an ion in which one As atom is trapped in a cage formed by the other 32 atoms.

This notation was proposed in 1991&lt;ref name=YanChai&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fullerenes wlth Metals Inside |author1=Chai, Yan |author2=Guo, Ting |author3=Jin, Changming |author4=Haufler, Robert E. |author5=Chibante, L. P. Felipe |author6=Fure, Jan |author7=Wang, Lihong |author8=Alford, J. Michael |author9=Smalley, Richard E. |journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry |volume=95 |issue=20 |year=1991 |pages=7564–7568 |doi=10.1021/j100173a002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the discovery of [[fullerene]] cages ([[endohedral fullerene]]s), which can trap atoms such as [[Lanthanum|La]] to form, for example, La@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or La@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;. The choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically (the at sign is included in [[ASCII]], which most modern character encoding schemes are based on), and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene.

== Non-stoichiometric chemical formulas ==

{{Main|Non-stoichiometric compound}}

Chemical formulas most often use [[integer]]s for each element. However, there is a class of compounds, called [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, that cannot be represented by small integers. Such a formula might be written using [[decimal fraction]]s, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O, or it might include a variable part represented by a letter, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;1–x&lt;/sub&gt;O, where x is normally much less than 1.

== General forms for organic compounds ==
A chemical formula used for a series of compounds that differ from each other by a constant unit is called a ''general formula''. It generates a [[homologous series]] of chemical formulas. For example, [[alcohols]] may be represented by the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2n + 1)&lt;/sub&gt;OH  (''n'' ≥  1), giving the homologs [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[propanol]] for ''n''=1–3.

== Hill system ==
The '''Hill system''' (or Hill notation) is a system of writing empirical chemical formulas, molecular chemical formulas and components of a condensed formula such that the number of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]] is indicated first, the number of [[hydrogen]] atoms next, and then the number of all other [[chemical element]]s subsequently, in [[alphabetical order]] of the [[chemical symbols]]. When the formula contains no carbon,  all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

By sorting formulas according to the number of atoms of each element present in the formula according to these rules, with differences in earlier elements or numbers being treated as more significant than differences in any later element or number&amp;mdash;like sorting text strings into [[lexicographical order]]&amp;mdash;it is possible to [[collation|collate]] chemical formulas into what is known as Hill system order.

The Hill system was first published by [[Edwin A. Hill]] of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edwin A. Hill | title = On a system of indexing chemical literature; Adopted by the Classification Division of the U.S. Patent Office | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1900 | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 478–494 | doi = 10.1021/ja02046a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most commonly used system in chemical databases and printed indexes to sort lists of compounds.&lt;ref name="wiggins"&gt;Wiggins, Gary. (1991). ''Chemical Information Sources.'' New York: McGraw Hill. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of formulas in Hill system order is arranged alphabetically, as above, with single-letter elements coming before two-letter symbols when the symbols begin with the same letter (so "B" comes before "Be", which comes before "Br").&lt;ref name="wiggins"/&gt;

The following example formulae are written using the Hill system, and listed in Hill order:

* BrI
* CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br
* H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S

A '''class of groups''' is a set theoretical collection of [[Group_(mathematics)|groups]] satisfying the property that if ''G'' is in the collection then every group isomorphic to ''G'' is also in the collection. This concept arose from the necessity to work with a bunch of groups satisfying certain special property (for example finiteness or commutativity).  Since [[set theory]] does not admit the "set of all groups", it is necessary to work with the more general concept of ''[[Class_(set_theory)|class]]''.

== Definition ==

A '''class of groups''' &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of groups such that if &lt;math&gt;G\in\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G\cong H~&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;H\in\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt;. Groups in the class &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; are referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;-'''groups'''.

For a set of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}~&lt;/math&gt;, we denote by &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{I})&lt;/math&gt; the smallest class of groups containing &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular for a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(G)&lt;/math&gt; denotes its isomorphism class.

== Examples ==

The most common examples of classes of groups are:
* &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;: the empty class of groups
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[Cyclic_group|cyclic groups]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[Abelian_group|abelian groups]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{U}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Supersolvable group|supersolvable groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[nilpotent group|nilpotent groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Solvable_group|solvable groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of finite [[Simple group|simple groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{E}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of [[finite groups]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}~&lt;/math&gt;: the class of all groups

== Product of classes of groups==

Given two classes of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Y}~&lt;/math&gt; it is defined the '''product of classes'''

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\mathfrak{Y}~=(G|G \text{ has a normal subgroup } N\in\mathfrak{X} \text{ with } G/N\in\mathfrak{Y})&lt;/math&gt;

This construction allows us to recursively define the '''power of a class''' by setting

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}^0=(1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}^n=\mathfrak{X}^{n-1}\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;

It must be remarked that this [[binary operation]] on the class of classes of groups is neither [[associative]] nor [[commutative]]. For instance, consider the [[alternating group]] of degree 4 (and order 12); this group belongs to the class &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; because it has as a subgroup the group &lt;math&gt;V_4&lt;/math&gt; which belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; and furthermore &lt;math&gt;A_4/V_4\cong C_3&lt;/math&gt; which is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;. However &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt; has no non-trivial normal cyclic subgroup, so &lt;math&gt;A_4\not\in\mathfrak{C}(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\not=(\mathfrak{C}\mathfrak{C})\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

However it is straightforward from the definition that for any three classes of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Z}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}(\mathfrak{Y}\mathfrak{Z})\subseteq(\mathfrak{X}\mathfrak{Y})\mathfrak{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

== Class maps and closure operations==

A '''class map''' '''c''' is a map which assigns a class of groups &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; to another class of groups &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;. A class map is said to be a closure operation if it satisfies the next properties:
# '''c''' is expansive: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\subseteq c\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;
# '''c''' is [[idempotent]]: &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}=c(c\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;
# '''c''' is monotonic: If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}\subseteq\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;c\mathfrak{X}\subseteq c\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

Some of the most common examples of closure operations are:

* &lt;math&gt;S\mathfrak{X}=(G|G\leq H, \ H\in\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Q\mathfrak{X}=(G|\text{exists }H\in\mathfrak{X} \text{ and an epimorphism from }H \text{ to }G)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;N_0\mathfrak{X}=(G| \text{ exists }K_i\ (i=1,\cdots,r)\text{ subnormal in }G\text{ with }K_i\in\mathfrak{X}\text{ and }G=\langle K_1,\cdots,K_r\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R_0\mathfrak{X}=(G| \text{ exists }N_i\ (i=1,\cdots,r)\text{ normal in }G\text{ with }G/N_i\in\mathfrak{X}\text{ and }\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^rNi=1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S_n\mathfrak{X}=(G|G\text{ is subnormal in }H\text{ for some }H\in\mathfrak{X})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14154">In [[mathematics]] the '''cotangent complex''' is roughly a universal linearization of a [[morphism]] of geometric or algebraic objects.  Cotangent complexes were originally defined in special cases by a number of authors. [[Luc Illusie]], [[Daniel Quillen]], and M. André independently came up with a definition that works in all cases.

==Motivation==
Suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] and that {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a morphism between them.  The cotangent complex of ''f'' is a more universal version of the relative [[Kähler differentials]] Ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. The most basic motivation for such an object is the exact sequence of Kähler differentials associated to two morphisms. If ''Z'' is another variety, and if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is another morphism, then there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;f^*\Omega_{Y/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Y} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In some sense, therefore, relative Kähler differentials are a [[right exact functor]]. (Literally this is not true, however, because the category of algebraic varieties is not an [[abelian category]], and therefore right-exactness is not defined.) In fact, prior to the definition of the cotangent complex, there were several definitions of functors that might extend the sequence further to the left, such as the [[Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functor]]s ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; and [[imperfection module]]s. Most of these were motivated by [[deformation theory]].

This sequence is exact on the left if the morphism ''f'' is smooth. If Ω admitted a first [[derived functor]], then exactness on the left would imply that the [[connecting homomorphism]] vanished, and this would certainly be true if the first derived functor of ''f'', whatever it was, vanished. Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that the first derived functor of a smooth morphism vanishes. Furthermore, when any of the functors which extended the sequence of Kähler differentials were applied to a smooth morphism, they too vanished, which suggested that the cotangent complex of a smooth morphism might be equivalent to the Kähler differentials.

Another natural exact sequence related to Kähler differentials is the [[conormal exact sequence]]. If ''f'' is a closed immersion with ideal sheaf ''I'', then there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;I/I^2 \to f^*\Omega_{Y/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Z} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an extension of the exact sequence above: There is a new term on the left, the conormal sheaf of ''f'', and the relative differentials Ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; have vanished because a closed immersion is [[formally unramified]]. If ''f'' is the inclusion of a smooth subvariety, then this sequence is a short exact sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Grothendieck|year = 1967|loc = Proposition 17.2.5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cotangent complex of the inclusion of a smooth variety is equivalent to the conormal sheaf shifted by one term.

==Early work on cotangent complexes==
The cotangent complex dates back at least to SGA 6 VIII 2, where [[Pierre Berthelot]] gave a definition when ''f'' is a ''smoothable'' morphism, meaning there is a scheme ''V'' and morphisms {{nowrap|''i'' : ''X'' → ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''h'' : ''V'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''hi''}}, ''i'' is a closed immersion, and ''h'' is a smooth morphism. (For example, all projective morphisms are smoothable, since ''V'' can be taken to be a projective bundle over ''Y''.) In this case, he defines the cotangent complex of ''f'' as an object in the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] ''X'' as follows:
*&lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_0 = i^*\Omega_{V/Y},&lt;/math&gt;
*If ''J'' is the ideal of ''X'' in ''V'', then &lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_1 = J/J^2 = i^*J&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all other ''i'',
*The differential &lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_1 \to L^{X/Y}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the pullback along ''i'' of the inclusion of ''J'' in the structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_V&lt;/math&gt; of ''V'' followed by the universal derivation &lt;math&gt;d : \mathcal{O}_V \to \Omega_{V/Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
*All other differentials are zero.
Berthelot proves that this definition is independent of the choice of ''V''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Berthelot|year = 1966|loc = VIII Proposition 2.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that for a smoothable complete intersection morphism, this complex is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Berthelot|year = 1966|loc = VIII Proposition 2.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he proves that if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is another smoothable complete intersection morphism and if an additional technical condition is satisfied, then there is an [[exact triangle]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\bullet \to L^{X/Z}_\bullet \to L^{X/Y}_\bullet \to \mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\bullet[1].&lt;/math&gt;

==The definition of the cotangent complex==
The correct definition of the cotangent complex begins in the [[homotopic algebra|homotopical setting]]. Quillen and André worked with the [[simplicial set#Simplicial objects|simplicial]] commutative rings, while Illusie worked with simplicial ringed [[topos|topoi]]. For simplicity, we will consider only the case of simplicial commutative rings. Suppose that ''A'' and ''B'' are [[simplicial ring]]s and that ''B'' is an ''A''-algebra. Choose a resolution {{nowrap|''r'' : ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''B''}} of ''B'' by simplicial free ''A''-algebras. Applying the Kähler differential functor to ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; produces a simplicial ''B''-module. The total complex of this simplicial object is the '''cotangent complex''' ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;. The morphism ''r'' induces a morphism from the cotangent complex to Ω&lt;sub&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the '''augmentation map'''. In the homotopy category of simplicial ''A''-algebras (or of simplicial ringed topoi), this construction amounts to taking the left derived functor of the Kähler differential functor.

Given a commutative square as follows:
:[[File:Commutative square.svg]]
there is a morphism of cotangent complexes {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''D'' → ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''D''/''C''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which respects the augmentation maps. This map is constructed by choosing a free simplicial ''C''-algebra resolution of ''D'', say {{nowrap|''s'' : ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''D''}}. Because ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; is a free object, the composite ''hr'' can be lifted to a morphism {{nowrap|''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Applying functoriality of Kähler differentials to this morphism gives the required morphism of cotangent complexes. In particular, given homomorphisms {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' &amp;rarr; ''C''}}, this produces the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B/A} \otimes_B C \to L^{C/A} \to L^{C/B}.&lt;/math&gt;
There is a connecting homomorphism &lt;math&gt;L^{C/B} \to (L^{B/A} \otimes_B C)[1]&lt;/math&gt; which turns this sequence into an exact triangle.

The cotangent complex can also be defined in any combinatorial [[model category]] ''M''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism in ''M''.  The cotangent complex &lt;math&gt;L^f&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;L^{B/A}&lt;/math&gt;) is an object in the category of spectra in &lt;math&gt;M_{B//B}&lt;/math&gt;.  A pair of composable morphisms &lt;math&gt;A\xrightarrow{f} B\xrightarrow{g} C&lt;/math&gt; induces an exact triangle in the homotopy category, &lt;math&gt;L^{B/A}\otimes_BC\rightarrow L^{C/A}\rightarrow L^{C/B}\rightarrow (L^{B/A}\otimes_BC)[1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties of the cotangent complex==

===Flat base change===
Suppose that ''B'' and ''C'' are ''A''-algebras such that {{nowrap|Tor&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'', ''C'') {{=}} 0}} for all {{nowrap|''q'' &gt; 0}}. Then there are quasi-isomorphisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Theorem 5.3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B \otimes_A C/C} \cong B \otimes_A L^{C/A},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B \otimes_A C/A} \cong (L^{B/A} \otimes_A C) \oplus (B \otimes_A L^{C/A}).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''C'' is a flat ''A''-algebra, then the condition that {{nowrap|Tor&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'', ''C'')}} vanishes for {{nowrap|''q'' &gt; 0}} is automatic. The first formula then proves that the construction of the cotangent complex is local on the base in the [[flat topology]].

===Vanishing properties===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B''}}. Then:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Theorem 5.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Corollary 6.14|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''B'' is a [[localization of a ring|localization]] of ''A'', then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.
*If ''f'' is an [[étale morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.
*If ''f'' is a [[smooth morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is quasi-isomorphic to Ω&lt;sub&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, it has [[projective dimension]] zero.
*If ''f'' is a [[local complete intersection morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} has projective dimension at most one.
*If ''A'' is Noetherian, {{nowrap|''B'' {{=}} ''A''/''I''}}, and ''I'' is generated by a regular sequence, then &lt;math&gt;I/I^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[projective module]] and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; is quasi-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;I/I^2[1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
*Let &lt;math&gt;X \in \text{Sch}/S&lt;/math&gt; be smooth. Then the cotangent complex is &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt;. In Berthelot's framework, this is clear by taking &lt;math&gt;V=X&lt;/math&gt;. In general, étale locally on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a finite dimensional affine space and the morphism &lt;math&gt;X\to S&lt;/math&gt; is projection, so we may reduce to the situation where &lt;math&gt;S=\text{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X = \text{Spec}(A[x_1,\ldots,x_n])&lt;/math&gt;. We can take the resolution of &lt;math&gt;\text{Spec}(A[x_1,\ldots,x_n])&lt;/math&gt; to be the identity map, and then it is clear that the cotangent complex is the same as the Kähler differentials.
*Let &lt;math&gt;i:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a closed embedding of smooth schemes in &lt;math&gt;\text{Sch}/S&lt;/math&gt;. Using the exact triangle corresponding to the morphisms &lt;math&gt;X \to Y \to S&lt;/math&gt;, we may determine the cotangent complex &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, note that by the previous example, the cotangent complexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt; consist of the Kähler differentials &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt; in the zeroth degree, respectively, and are zero in all other degrees. The exact triangle implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero only in the first degree, and in that degree, it is the kernel of the map &lt;math&gt;i^*\mathbf{L}_{X/S} \to \mathbf{L}_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt;. This kernel is the conormal bundle, and the exact sequence is the conormal exact sequence, so in the first degree, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the conormal bundle &lt;math&gt;C_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
*More generally, a local complete intersection morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; with a smooth target has a cotangent complex perfect in amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;. This is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I^2} \to \Omega_{Y}|_X&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the cotangent complex of the twisted cubic &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^3&lt;/math&gt; is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{O}(-2)\oplus\mathcal{O}(-2)\oplus\mathcal{O}(-2) \xrightarrow{s} \Omega_{\mathbb{P}^3}|_X
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Democratized transactional giving''' is a form of corporate philanthropy and the latest evolution in [[cause marketing]], (defined as when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause) where consumers, and not the brand in question, have maximum control over the causes they choose to support. Augmenting traditional corporate philanthropy and participatory cause marketing, democratized transactional giving empowers consumers to become better brand and cause advocates while promoting a strong behavioral influence that seeks to yield greater loyalty and brand commitment.

Successful democratized transactional giving is the outgrowth or result of a fully realized [[cause-related loyalty marketing]] campaign which not only links [[nonprofits]] and for-profits together, but does so in the context of an existing company’s [[loyalty program]]. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.

== Difference from traditional corporate philanthropy ==
According to KULA Causes, Inc., of Boulder, Colorado, which in 2010 designed and launched the Cause-Related Loyalty Marketing (CLM) software solution for companies looking to improve their loyalty and philanthropic efforts, corporate philanthropy/cause marketing has evolved in three phases.

Phase one was an autocratic approach where the brand selected the cause in question, the brand told the “cause story,” and the result was low customer behavioral influence. Phase two witnessed the growth of participatory cause marketing. Under this improvement, the brand still selects a number of causes (and tells the cause story) while customers choose causes from among that limited selection. The result is growing customer behavioral influence. In democratized transactional giving decisions and brand advocacy responsibility has been passed on to the consumer – a level of control that inspires a strong behavioral influence.

== Benefits for companies ==

When companies allow customers to donate unused rewards to causes of the customer’s choosing, the customer develops a greater appreciation for the company. [[Edelman]] PR found in its 2012 Goodpurpose Study that "72% of consumers would recommend a brand that supports a good cause over one that doesn’t, a 39% increase since 2008."&lt;ref&gt;Allison Goldberg, "Introducing: Goodpurpose 2012", Purpose. Edelman.com, April 25, 2102&lt;/ref&gt; By facilitating democratized transactional giving, companies can see that benefit as deepened customer loyalty.

== Benefits for consumers ==

Humans’ hard-wired capacity for [[empathy]] fuels the desire to help those in need, because people can imagine themselves in the same situation.&lt;ref&gt;Ray B. Williams, "Are We Entering the Age of Empathy?", Psychology Today, October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers who act on this impulse benefit from the positive feelings associated with spending money on a good cause.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson, 2011, "If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it right", ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'' 21, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits for nonprofits ==

Nonprofits as a whole benefit when consumers rather than companies dictate where donations, including donations of unredeemed loyalty-program rewards, will go. This is because increasing numbers of consumers participating in democratized transactional giving also mean a wider diversity of nonprofits being helped according to each individual consumer’s cause affinities – the types of causes they tend to support.

'''Disability Insurance''', often called '''DI''' or '''disability income insurance''', or '''income protection''', is a form of [[insurance]] that insures the beneficiary's earned income against the risk that a [[disability]] creates a barrier for a worker to complete the core functions of their work. For example, the worker may suffer from an inability to maintain composure in the case of psychological disorders or an injury, illness or condition that causes physical impairment or incapacity to work. It encompasses paid sick leave, short-term [[disability benefits]] (STD), and long-term disability benefits (LTD).&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that in the US a disabling accident occurs, on average, once every second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Statistics |date=March 12, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=National Treasury Employees Union - Chapter 78 |url=http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133227/http://nteu-chapter78.org/documents/member_benefits/Disability%20Statistics.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, nearly 18.5% of Americans are currently living with a disability,{{cn|date=February 2016}} and 1 out of every 4 persons in the US workforce will suffer a disabling injury before retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Insurance Infographic |date=January 18, 2013 |url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123064308/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/disability-insurance-infographic.html |archivedate=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Railway Passengers Assurance Company header.jpg|thumb|190x190px|The Railway Passengers Assurance Company was founded in 1848 as the first company to provide [[accident insurance]].]]
In the late 19th century, modern disability insurance began to become available. It was originally known as "accident insurance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/health-insurance1.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks |title=How Health Insurance Works|date=2006-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encarta |title=Health Insurance |url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html#s49 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqZV6V7?url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576408_8/Health_Insurance.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first company to offer accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in [[England]] to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent [[railway]] system. It was registered as the Universal Casualty Compensation Company to:
:...grant assurances on the lives of persons travelling by railway and to grant, in cases, of accident not having a fatal termination, compensation to the assured for injuries received under certain conditions.

The company was able to reach an agreement with the [[railway company|railway companies]], whereby basic accident insurance would be sold as a package deal along with travel [[Train ticket|ticket]]s to customers. The company charged higher premiums for second and third class travel due to the higher risk of injury in the roofless [[carriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/heritage/companies/railway-passengers-assurance-company/|title=Railway Passengers Assurance Company Ltd|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

===Individual disability insurance===
Those whose employers do not provide benefits, and self-employed individuals who desire disability coverage, may purchase  policies. Premiums and available benefits for individual coverage vary considerably between companies, occupations, states and countries. In general, premiums are higher for policies that provide more monthly benefits, offer benefits for longer periods of time, and start payments of benefits more quickly following a disability claim. Premiums also tend to be higher for policies that define disability in broader terms, meaning the policy would pay benefits in a wider variety of circumstances thus covering more insurances that the individual was going to purchase. Web-based disability insurance calculators assist in determining the disability insurance needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422184302/http://www.lifehappens.org/disability-insurance/disability-calculator |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-22 |title=LIFE Foundation &amp;#124; Disability Insurance Needs Calculator |publisher=Lifehappens.org |accessdate=2011-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-limit disability insurance===
High-limit disability insurance is designed to keep individual disability benefits at 65% of income regardless of income level. Coverage is typically issued supplemental to standard coverage. With high-limit disability insurance, benefits can be anywhere from an additional $2,000 to $100,000 per month. Single policy issue and participation (individual or group long-term disability) coverage has gone up to $30,000 with some hospitals. 

===Business overhead expense disability insurance===
Business Overhead Expense (BOE) coverage reimburses a business for overhead expenses should the owner experience a disability.  Eligible benefits include: rent or mortgage payments, utilities, leasing costs, laundry/maintenance, accounting/billing and collection service fees, business insurance premiums, employee salaries, employee benefits, property tax, and other regular monthly expenses.

===National social insurance programs===
In most developed countries, the single most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s version is part of [[National Insurance]]; the [[United States|U.S.]]'s version is [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security (SS)]]—specifically, several parts of SS including [[Social Security Disability Insurance|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]]. These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In addition to federally funded programs, there are five states which currently offer state funded Disability Insurance programs. These programs are designed for short term disabilities only. The coverage amount is determined by the applicant's level of income over the previous 12 months. The states which currently fund disability insurance programs are California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|title=Does My State Offer Disability Insurance?|last=|first=|date=2013-12-17|website=DisabilityInsurance.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120113033/http://www.disabilityinsurance.org/articles/does-my-state-offer-disability-insurance.html|archivedate=January 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-01-17|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer-supplied disability insurance===
One of the most common reasons for disability is on-the-job injury, which explains why the second largest form of disability insurance is that provided by employers to cover their employees. There are several subtypes that may or may not be separate parts of the benefits package: workers' compensation and more general disability insurance policies.

====Workers' compensation====
{{main|Workers' compensation}}
Workers' compensation (also known by variations of that name, e.g., '''workman's comp''', '''workmen's comp''', '''worker's comp''', '''compo''') offers payments to employees who are (usually temporarily, rarely permanently) unable to work because of a job-related injury. However, workers' compensation is in fact more than just income insurance, because it compensates for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and life expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment (offering a form of [[life insurance]]).  Workers compensation provides no coverage to those not working. Statistics have shown that the majority of disabilities occur while the injured person is not working and therefore is not covered by workers' compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/causes.asp |title=Common Causes of Disability; Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Arthritis and Lifestyle Choices |publisher=Disabilitycanhappen.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's cover story for March 5, 2007 discussed the problems that American veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq wars have faced in receiving VA benefits. The article describes one veteran who waited 17 months to start receiving payments. Another article, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', points out that besides long waits, there is also variation based on the veteran's state of residence and whether he/she is a veteran of the Army, National Guard, or Reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | last = Urbina | first = Ian |author2=Ron Nixon | title = Veterans Face Vast Inequities Over Disability | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2007-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/washington/09veterans.html
 | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article says that it can be difficult for a veteran to get his or her claim approved; ''Newsweek'' described the benefits thus:

:"A veteran with a disability rating of 100 percent gets about $2,400 a month—more if he or she has children. A 50 percent rating brings in around $700 a month. But for many returning servicemen burdened with wounds, it is, initially at least, their sole income."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Forgotten Heroes |work=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |pages=28–37 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380811 |last1=Ephron |first1=D |last2=Childress |first2=S |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227133416/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316437/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=February 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 figures cited above correspond in 2012 to $2,673 a month (more with children) and, for the 50% rating, $797 a month for a single veteran.

According to a sidebar in the same Newsweek article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Untreated Wounds |journal=Newsweek |volume=149 |issue=10 |page=34 |date=March 5, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |pmid=17380812 |last1=Dehghanpisheh |first1=B |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issn=0028-9604 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302104104/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17316435/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=March 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Americans injured in these wars, for all the obstacles to proper care, will probably receive much better compensation and health care than equally injured Afghan or Iraqi soldiers.

[[File:%27Dollz%27_icon_of_woman_in_green.png|thumb|A later "Unique" style doll]]
'''Dollz''', '''cartoon dolls''', or '''pixel dolls''' are small [[pixelated]] digital images, generally consisting of illustrations of people with clothes and accessories.

Dollz are generally created by taking a base body (a drawing of a bald and naked body created for this purpose), and then drawing hair, clothes and accessories onto it. They also usually have a hard edge and transparent background so that they can be easily displayed on the web.&lt;ref name="Pyrochan2009"&gt;{{cite web | last = Fiona Marchbank | title = Welcome to Digital Dolls dA | work = DeviantArt | accessdate = 2011-11-25 | date = 2009-02-03 | url = http://pyrochan-dolls.deviantart.com/journal/Welcome-to-Digital-Dolls-dA-214186750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who create dollz are known as dollers or dollists. They are, in great majority, women,&lt;ref name="Borgeson2003"&gt;{{cite web| last = Borgeson| first = Mitch| title = Playing with dollz| work = Salon.com| accessdate = 2010-03-29| url = http://www.salon.com/2003/10/07/dollz/}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a few male dollers exist. These dollers usually take on dolling as a personal hobby.

==History==

Dollz were first created to be used as avatars on [[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace Chat Program]] in 1995. The invention of dollz is attributed&lt;ref name="left.of.center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/savageredhead/dollz/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031001232351/http://members.aol.com/savageredhead/dollz/index.html |archivedate=2003-10-01 |title=left of center |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-10-01 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Melicia Greenwood (also known as artgrrl, or shatteredInnocents), mainly because of her detailed web publishing on the history of dollz. Her new [[avatars]] were freely distributed on the main Palace server, the "Mansion".  Within weeks thousands of creatively modified dollz were redistributed around the many Palace servers, replacing the default smiley face avatars that were previously used.&lt;ref name="Originz"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.shatteredinnocents.com/dollz/originz1.html| last = Greenwood| first = Melicia| title = The Originz of Dollz| date = 2003-09-11| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031120000000/http://www.shatteredinnocents.com/dollz/originz1.html| archivedate = 2003-11-20| accessdate = 2010-03-29| deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teenagers adopted dollz avatars as a sign of rebellion against older Palace users.&lt;ref name=Borgeson2003 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28217">'''Domestic terrorism''' or '''homegrown terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] targeting victims "within a country by a perpetrator with the same citizenship" as the victims.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Gary M. Jackson, ''Predicting Malicious Behavior: Tools and Techniques for Ensuring Global Security'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[definitions of terrorism]], and no universally  accepted definition. The [[United States Department of State]] defined terrorism in 2003 as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience."&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==Definition==
While there are many potential definitions of domestic terrorism, it is largely defined as terrorism in which the perpetrator targets his/her own country. Enders &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Enders, Walter, Todd Sandler, and Khusrav Gaibulloev| title=Domestic versus transnational terrorism: Data, decomposition, and dynamics.|journal=Journal of Peace Research|edition=3|year=2011|pages=319–337|volume=48|doi=10.1177/0022343311398926}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines domestic terrorism as “homegrown in which the venue, target, and perpetrators are all from the same country. The term “homegrown terrorism” stems from [[Jihadism|jihadi]] terrorism against [[Western world|Westerners]]. Wilner and Dobouloz described homegrown terrorism as "autonomously organized radicalized Westerners with little direct assistance from transnational networks, usually organized within the home or host country, and targets fellow nationals." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Wilner, Alex S., and Claire-Jehanne Dubouloz. "Homegrown terrorism and transformative learning: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding radicalization." Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 22.1 (2010): 33-51.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Congressional Research Service]] report, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' describes homegrown terrorism as a “terrorist activity or plots perpetuated within the United States or abroad by American citizens, permanent legal residents, or visitors radicalized largely within the United States.”&lt;ref name="Bjelopera"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R41416.pdf |title=p. 1. - Jerome P. Bjelopera and Mark A. Randol, '&amp;#39;American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'&amp;#39; (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, December 7, 2010) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], domestic terrorism is defined as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

==Facts &amp; Studies==
Homegrown terrorism is not new to the world. Security analysts have argued that after the end of the [[Cold War]], military conflicts have increasingly involved [[violent non-state actors]] carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2011/08/29/non-state-conflict-and-the-transformation-of-war/|title=Non-State Conflict and the Transformation of War|work=E-International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which terror attacks are one part.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/nic/nonstate_actors_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has uncovered a number of alleged terrorist plots that have been successfully suppressed through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. The United States has begun to account for the threat of homegrown terrorism, as shown by increased volume of literature on the subject in recent years and increased number of terrorist websites since [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of al-Qaeda in [[Iraq]], began posting beheading videos in 2003.  A July 2009 document by the [[FBI]] estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities, with around 10,000 of them actively maintained.  80% of these sites are on U.S.-based servers.&lt;ref name="J Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/suspected-american-terrorists-islamic-ties-causing-concern-law/story?id=11230885&amp;page=1 |title=Jason Ryan, Pierre Thomas, and Xorje Olivares, "American-bred Terrorism Causing Alarm for Law Enforcement," ABC News.com July 22, 2010 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Congressional Research Service’s study, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' between May 2009 and November 2010, law enforcement made arrests related to 22 homegrown jihadist-inspired terror plots by American citizens or legal residents of the U.S.  This is a significant increase over the 21 plots caught in the seven interim years after the [[September 11 attacks]]. During these seven years, two plots resulted in attacks, compared to the two attacks between May 2009 and November 2010, which resulted in 14 deaths.  This spike post-May 2009 shows that some Americans are susceptible to ideologies that support a violent form of jihad.&lt;ref name="Bjelopera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/threat-homegrown-islamist-terrorism/p11509#p4 |title=Toni Johnson, "Threat of Homegrown Islamist Terrorism," Council on Foreign Relations, December 10, 2010 |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly one-quarter of these plots have been linked to major international terrorist groups but an increasing number of Americans are holding high-level operational roles in these terrorist groups, especially [[al-Qaeda]] and its affiliated groups.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bipartisan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/NSPG%20Final%20Threat%20Assessment.pdf |title=Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman, "Assessing the Terrorist Threat," Bipartisan Policy Center, September 10, 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/2010/RAND_OP292.pdf Brian Michael Jenkins, "Terrorist Radicalization in the United States Since September 11, 2001," RAND Corporation, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] called homegrown terrorism the more serious threat faced by American citizens today.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem |title=Jordy Yager, "Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a ‘devil of a problem,’" '&amp;#39;The Hill'&amp;#39;, July 25, 2010 |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, likewise, considers homegrown terrorism to be a considerable threat.  On June 6, 2011, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced a wide-ranging strategy to prevent British citizens from being radicalized into becoming terrorists while at university.  The strategy is intended to prevent extremist speakers or groups from coming to universities.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/uk/cameron-plans-to-crack-down-on-home-grown-terrorism-1.817900 |title=Brendan Carlin and Abul Taher, "Cameron plans to crack down on home-grown terrorism," gulfnews.com, June 6, 2011 |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lone Wolf ===
Domestic terrorism is often linked to "lone wolf" terrorism. Sociologist Ramón Spaaij defines lone wolf terrorism as an act of terrorism committed by one person who "acts on his or her own without orders from—or even connections to an organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaaij|first=Ramón|date=2010|title=The enigma of lone wolf terrorism: An assessment.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|volume=33|issue=9|pages=854–870.|doi=10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th to early 21st century lone wolf terrorism in the United States has been primarily associated with white supremacy, Islamic fundamentalism, anti-social, and anti-government extremists in the United States such as [[Charles Whitman]], [[Timothy McVeigh|Tim McVeigh]], [[Dylann Roof]], [[Ted Kaczynski]], [[Eric Rudolph]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold#Dylan Klebold|Dylan Klebold]], [[James Holmes (mass murderer)|James Holmes]], [[Omar Mateen]], and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev|Tamerlan]] and [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]].

In their 2007 book ''Hunting the American Terrorist'' former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Terry Turchie and former FBI special agent Kathleen Puckett described six criteria to define a lone wolf:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hunting_the_American_Terrorist.html?id=vXl1AAAACAAJ|title=Hunting the American Terrorist: The FBI's War on Homegrown Terror|last=Turchie|first=Terry D.|last2=Puckett|first2=Kathleen M.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=History Publishing Company|isbn=9781933909349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The act of terrorism was organized by few or only one person that was not operating with an organized group
# The individual is willing to use lethal violence to achieve their goal
# Their primary goal is ideological, political, or religious in scope
# The individual is willing to accept that [[collateral damage]] may occur
# The individual is not intending to commit suicide, unless the situation calls for it
# The individual is intending to commit homicide in order to get their message public

== Radicalization ==
There is no one path toward violence.  Homegrown terrorists have been high school dropouts, college graduates, members of the military, and cover the range of financial situations. Recent research by Matt Qvortrup in the British ''Journal of Politics and International Relations'' has suggested that domestic terrorism is a result of lack of opportunities for meaningful political engagement. Some domestic terrorists studied overseas and were exposed to radical Islamist thought, while others took their inspiration from the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="Congressional Panel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110310/NEWS08/110310022/2067/Saudi-police-open-fire-during-protest/Congressional-panel-homegrown-terrorism-divided-discussion-?odyssey=mod_sectionstories|title=Associated Press, "Congressional Panel on Homegrown Terrorism Divided on Discussion," March 10, 2011|date=|publisher=Tennessean.com|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Sageman]] writes in his book, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century'' that, contrary to popular belief, radicalization into terrorism is not the product of poverty, various forms of brainwashing, youth, ignorance, lack of education, lack of employment, lack of social responsibility, criminality, or mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Sageman, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century,'' (Philadelphia, PA: University Of Pennsylvania Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He says that intermediaries and English-speaking imams, such as the late Yemeni-American cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] (d. 2011), who are often found through the internet on forums, provide key roles in the [[radicalization]] process.  Social networks provided in forums support and build upon an individual’s radical beliefs.  Prison systems are also a concern as a place of radicalization and jihadist recruiting; nearly three dozen ex-convicts who attended training camps in Yemen were believed to have been radicalized in prison.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;  The only constant appears to be "a newfound hatred for their native or adopted country, a degree of dangerous malleability, and a religious fervor justifying or legitimizing violence that impels these very impressionable and perhaps easily influenced individuals toward potentially lethal acts of violence," according to Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman's September 2010 paper for the Bipartisan Policy Center.&lt;ref name="Bipartisan" /&gt;

==Training==
Training for potential homegrown terrorists is often very fast paced, or rushed, as some groups under attack by U.S. forces may feel the need to implement operations “more precipitously than they might otherwise occur,” according to [[Bruce Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Hoffman, Bruce. "Rethinking terrorism and counterterrorism since 9/11." Studies in Conflict and Terrorism 25.5 (2002): 303-316.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case with the failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt|Times Square plot]] carried out by [[Faisal Shazad]]. [[Pakistani Taliban]] (TPP) was on record as providing financing and four months of training for Shazad directly prior to his actions in Times Square. Shazad reportedly received only three to five days of training in bomb-making.

Some individuals go abroad to a region containing extremism, predominantly Pakistan, but also Iraq, Afghanistan,Yemen or Somalia.  In the case of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombers]], [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]], the operational leader of the cell, received military and explosives training at a camp in [[Malakand District|Malakand]], [[Pakistan]] in July 2003. Later he took [[Shezad Tanweer]] to Karachi, Pakistan, in late 2004 to February 2005 where they crossed the border to receive training at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf p. 33 - Edward McCleskey, Diana McCord, and Jennifer Leetz, “Underlying Reasons for the Success and Failure of Terrorist Attacks.” (Arlington, VA: Homeland Security Institute, June 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234840/http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training and usage of recruits is varied.  Some, such as Shahzad, received little training and ultimately failed in their goals. Others, like the sleeper agent [[David Headley]]’s reconnaissance efforts, were essential towards [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]]’s (LeT) success in the November [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].

Scholars say that some lone wolves may achieve objectives, but the vast majority of individual operators fail to execute their plans because of lack of training and planning. There is also a question as to whether such individuals are radical, or suffering other problems. The American convert, Abdulhakim Muhammad (née Carlos Bledsoe), who [[2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting|killed a U.S. military recruiter]] in Little Rock, Arkansas, and wounded another, had many other targets and plans, which went awry. It was not until some time after his arrest that he first claimed to have been working for [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP). But, investigators found no evidence of this. The lead county prosecutor said that, aside from Muhammad's self-serving statements, it was "just an awful killing", like others he had seen.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17convert.html |title=A Muslim Son, a Murder Trial and Many Questions |location=Arkansas;Yemen |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bledsoe's father described his son as "unable to process reality."&lt;ref name=nytterror&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp|title=Man Claims Terror Ties in Little Rock Shooting|last=Dao|first=James|date=January 21, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152356/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp| archivedate= 25 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism, and pleaded guilty.

The American [[Nidal Hasan]], the US Army major and psychiatrist charged in the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], had come to the attention of colleagues and superiors years before the shootings; they documented their concerns about his mental state. The Department of Defense has classified the event as "workplace violence" rather than terrorism, pending Hasan's court martial. Some observers believe that his personal characteristics are more like those of other [[mass murder]]ers than terrorists; he did not belong to any group.

The Somalian [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] (“the youth”) have recruited strongly in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.  The 30+ Somali-Americans received training by senior al-Qaeda leaders in [[Somalia]].  Hoffman believes this indicates that radicalization and recruitment is not an isolated, lone-wolf phenomenon unique to Somali-Americans, but that there is terrorist recruitment infrastructure in the United States.&lt;ref name="Hoffmantestimony"&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20100526101502-95237.pdf Hoffman, Bruce, “Internet Terror Recruitment And Tradecraft: How Can We Address An Evolving Tool While Protecting Free Speech?,”  House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, May 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a dozen of 20 American recruits were killed in fighting in Somalia, the number of Americans going to join Al-Shabab has declined since 2007-2008.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmitt |first=Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nyregion/07shabaab.html?src=mv |title=Al Shabab Recruits Americans for Somali Civil War |publisher= The New York Times |date= June 6, 2010|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the internet==
“The Internet is a driver and enabler for the process of radicalization”, says a report of the Police Department of the City of New York of 2007.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/NYPD_Report-Radicalization_in_the_West.pdf |title="Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat." (New York Police Department, 2007) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 November 2014}} (pages 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has a wide appeal as it provides an anonymous way for like-minded, conflicted individuals to meet, form virtual relations, and discuss the radical and extremist ideology they encounter.  The virtual network created in message boards or private forums further radicalizes and cements the jihadi-Salafi/racial supremacist message individuals have encountered as they build a community.
The internet acts as an enabler, providing the aspiring jihadist/supremacist with a forum in which they may plan, share information on targets, weapons, and recruit others into their plans.  Much of the resources needed to make weapons can be found on-line.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007/&gt;

===''Inspire''===
''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' is an online English-language propaganda magazine published by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  Purported to be created by Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen and cyber-jihadist, the magazine uses American idioms and phrasing and does not appear to have British or South Asian influences in its language.&lt;ref name="stratfor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Security Weekly |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100721_fanning_flames_jihad |title=Scott Stewart, "Fanning the Flames of Jihad." STRATFOR (July 22, 2010) |publisher=Stratfor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine contains messages calling for western jihadists, like this one from AQAP leader Nasir al-Wahayshi, "to acquire weapons and learn methods of war. They are living in a place where they can cause great harm to the enemy and where they can support the Messenger of Allah... The means of harming them are many so seek assistance from Allah and do not be weak and you will find a way.”&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

STRATFOR suggests that the magazine is meant to "fan the flames of Jihad."&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8936">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[partial differential equations]], '''Duhamel's principle''' is a general method for obtaining solutions to [[homogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear evolution equations like the [[heat equation]], [[wave equation]], and [[vibrating plate]] equation. It is named after [[Jean-Marie Duhamel]] who first applied the principle to the inhomogeneous heat equation that models, for instance, the distribution of heat in a thin plate which is heated from beneath. For linear evolution equations without spatial dependency, such as a [[harmonic oscillator]], Duhamel's principle reduces to the method of [[variation of parameters]] technique for solving linear inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz John, "Partial Differential Equations', New York, Springer-Verlag, 1982, 4th ed., 0387906096&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy underlying Duhamel's principle is that it is possible to go from solutions of the [[Cauchy problem]] (or initial value problem) to solutions of the inhomogeneous problem. Consider, for instance, the example of the heat equation modeling the distribution of heat energy ''u'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial value problem is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) - \Delta u(x,t) = 0 &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = g(x) &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the initial heat distribution. By contrast, the inhomogeneous problem for the heat equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -\Delta u(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
corresponds to adding an external heat energy ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'',''t'')''dt'' at each point. Intuitively, one can think of the inhomogeneous problem as a set of homogeneous problems each starting afresh at a different time slice ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. By linearity, one can add up (integrate) the resulting solutions through time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and obtain the solution for the inhomogeneous problem. This is the essence of Duhamel's principle.

==General considerations==
Formally, consider a linear inhomogeneous evolution equation for a function 
:&lt;math&gt;u:D\times(0,\infty)\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
with spatial domain ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -Lu(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in D\times (0,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in D,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is a linear differential operator that involves no time derivatives.

Duhamel's principle is, formally, that the solution to this problem is
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \int_0^t (P^sf)(x,t)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' is the solution of the problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t - Lu = 0 &amp; (x,t)\in D\times (s,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,s) = f(x,s) &amp; x\in D.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The integrand is the retarded solution &lt;math&gt;P^sf&lt;/math&gt;, evaluated at time ''t'', representing the effect, at the later time ''t'', of an infinitesimal force &lt;math&gt;f(x,s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt; applied at time ''s''.

Duhamel's principle also holds for linear systems (with vector-valued functions ''u''), and this in turn furnishes a generalization to higher ''t'' derivatives, such as those appearing in the wave equation (see below). Validity of the principle depends on being able to solve the homogeneous problem in an appropriate function space and that the solution should exhibit reasonable dependence on parameters so that the integral is well-defined. Precise analytic conditions on ''u'' and ''f'' depend on the particular application.

==Examples==

===Wave equation===
The linear wave equation models the displacement ''u'' of an idealized dispersionless one-dimensional string, in terms of derivatives with respect to time ''t'' and space ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=f(x,t).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f''(''x'',''t''), in natural units, represents an external force applied to string at the position (''x'',''t'').  In order to be a suitable physical model for nature, it should be possible to solve it for any initial state that the string is in, specified by its initial displacement and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=u_0(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,0)=v_0(x).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, we should be able to solve the equation with data specified on any ''t'' = ''constant'' slice:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,T)=u_T(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,T)=v_T(x).&lt;/math&gt;

To evolve a solution from any given time slice ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'', the contribution of the force must be added to the solution.  That contribution comes from changing the velocity of the string by ''f''(''x'',''T'')''dT''.  That is, to get the solution at time ''T''+''dT'' from the solution at time ''T'', we must add to it a new (forward) solution of the ''homogeneous'' (no external forces) wave equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with the initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;U(x,T)=0,\qquad \frac{\partial U}{\partial t}(x,T)=f(x,T)dT.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution to this equation is achieved by straightforward integration:

:&lt;math&gt; U(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\right)\,dT&lt;/math&gt;

(The expression in parenthesis is just &lt;math&gt;P^Tf(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; in the notation of the general method above.) So a solution of the original initial value problem is obtained by starting with a solution to the problem with the same prescribed initial values problem but with ''zero'' external force, and adding to that (integrating) the contributions from the added force in the time intervals from ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'':

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[u_0(x+ct)+ u_0(x-ct)\right]+ \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} v_0(y) dy + \frac{1}{2c}\int_0^t\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant-coefficient linear ODE===
Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using [[Duhamel's integral]].
Suppose we have a constant coefficient, m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]].

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)u(t) = F(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t^j u(0) = 0, \; 0 \leq j \leq m-1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) := a_m \partial_t^m + \cdots + a_1 \partial_t + a_0,\; a_m \neq 0. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First let ''G'' solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)G = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0) = 0, \quad 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt; H = G \chi_{[0,\infty)} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\chi_{[0,\infty)}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) H = \delta &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; u(t) = (H \ast F)(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau)F(t-\tau)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau)F(\tau)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the ODE.

===Constant-coefficient linear PDE===
More generally, suppose we have a constant coefficient inhomogeneous [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,D_x)u(t,x) = F(t,x) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; D_x = \frac{1}{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First, taking the [[Fourier transform]] in ''x'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)\hat u(t,\xi) = \hat F(t,\xi).&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; is an m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order ODE in ''t''. Let &lt;math&gt;a_m &lt;/math&gt; be the coefficient of the highest order term of &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt;.
Now for every &lt;math&gt;\xi &lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;G(t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)G(t,\xi) = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0,\xi) = 0 \; \mbox{ for } 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0,\xi) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;H(t,\xi) = G(t,\xi) \chi_{[0,\infty)}(t) &lt;/math&gt;. We then have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) H(t,\xi) = \delta(t) &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \hat u(t,\xi) = (H(\cdot,\xi) \ast \hat F(\cdot,\xi))(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau,\xi)F(t-\tau,\xi)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau,\xi)F(\tau,\xi)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the PDE (after transforming back to ''x'').

{{Emotion}}
'''Empathy''' is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | title=The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine | author1=Bellet, Paul S. | author2=Michael J.

Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006). ''Help for the Helper: The psychophysiology of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

== Definitions ==

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J. (2001). Regulating the costs of empathy: the price of being human. ''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empathy/ |title=Empathy |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

* [[Perspective-taking]]: the tendency to spontaneously adopt others' psychological perspectives.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;
* '''Fantasy''': the tendency to identify with fictional characters.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;
* '''Tactical (or "strategic") empathy''': the deliberate use of perspective-taking to achieve certain desired ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_tao_of_doing_good|title=The Tao of Doing Good (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090151/https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_tao_of_doing_good|archivedate=February 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===
By the age of two years, children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, M.L. (2000). ''Empathy and Moral Development''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy, in the sense that they understand that, just like their own actions, other people's actions have goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Meyer M. | year = 2008 | title = From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1053–1080 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000503 | pmid = 18838031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinrad, T.L., &amp; Sadovsky, A.

''Nature Neuroscience'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[toddler]]s will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two. Also during the second year, toddlers will play games of falsehood or "pretend" in an effort to fool others, and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zahn-Waxler C. |author2=Radke-Yarrow M. | year = 1990 | title = The origins of empathic concern | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 107–130 | doi = 10.1007/BF00991639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to develop these traits, it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a [[sedentary lifestyle]].

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise. Retrieved July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims? Assessment of Trait and Situational Predictors|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=August 8, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=245–267|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x/asset/asap1262.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvu9nj&amp;s=2892713f7a99d42574ccda68fa2bbfc1c1578249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einolf|first=Christopher|title=Is Cognitive Empathy More Important than Affective Empathy? A Response to "Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?"|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=March 13, 2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=268–271|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x/asset/asap1281.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvq647&amp;s=df598d6cfad7025a88420f2f5c207c0c980672fa|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

A meta-analysis of recent fMRI studies of empathy confirmed that different brain areas are activated during affective–perceptual empathy and cognitive–evaluative empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763410001739 | title=Is there a core neural network in empathy?

Research in recent years has focused on possible brain processes underlying the experience of empathy. For instance, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = Christian | last2 = Gazzola | first2 = Valeria | title = Expanding the mirror: vicarious activity for actions, emotions, and sensations | journal = [[Current Opinion in Neurobiology]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 666&amp;ndash;671 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2009.10.006 | pmid = 19880311 | date = December 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Moriguchi Y. | year = 2007 | title = The empathic brain and its dysfunction in psychiatric populations: implications for intervention across different clinical conditions | url = | journal = BioPsychoSocial Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 22–65 | doi = 10.1186/1751-0759-1-22 |pmid=18021398 |pmc=2206036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have shown that observing another person's emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network involved in processing that same state in oneself, whether it is disgust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wicker B. | year = 2003 | title = Both of us disgusted in my insula: the common neural basis of seeing and feeling disgust | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 655–664 | doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00679-2 | pmid=14642287 | last2 = Keysers | first2 = Christian | last3 = Plailly | first3 = Jane | last4 = Royet | first4 = Jean-Pierre | last5 = Gallese | first5 = Vittorio | last6 = Rizzolatti | first6 = Giacomo|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; touch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = Christian | last2 = et al | title = A touching sight: SII/PV activation during the observation and experience of touch | journal = [[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 335&amp;ndash;346 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00156-4 | pmid = 15091347 | date = 22 April 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blakemore S.-J. | year = 2005 | title = Somatosensory activations during the observation of touch and a case of vision-touch synaesthesia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 7| pages = 1571–1583 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh500 | pmid = 15817510 | last2 = Bristow | first2 = D | last3 = Bird | first3 = G | last4 = Frith | first4 = C | last5 = Ward | first5 = J |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = I. | last2 = Lloyd | first2 = D. | last3 = di Pellegrino | first3 = G. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = N. | year = 2004 | title = Vicarious responses to pain in anterior cingulate cortex: is empathy a multisensory issue? | url = | journal = Cognitive &amp; Affective Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 270–278 | doi=10.3758/cabn.4.2.270 | pmid=15460933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jackson P.L. |author2=Meltzoff A.N. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2005 | title = How do we perceive the pain of others: A window into the neural processes involved in empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 771–779 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.006 | pmid = 15652312 |citeseerx=10.1.1.391.8127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lamm C. |author2=Batson C.D. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2007 | title = The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 42–58 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.42 | pmid=17214562|citeseerx=10.1.1.511.3950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T. | year = 2004 | title = Empathy for pain involves the affective but not the sensory components of pain | url = | journal = Science | volume = 303 | issue = 5661| pages = 1157–1161 | bibcode = 2004Sci...303.1157S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Kaube | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1126/science.1093535 | pmid = 14976305 |display-authors=etal| hdl = 21.11116/0000-0001-A020-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the neural underpinnings of empathy has received increased interest following the target paper published by Preston and [[Frans de Waal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Preston S. |author2=de Waal F. | year = 2002 | title = Empathy: Its ultimate and proximate bases | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–72 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x02000018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the discovery of [[mirror neuron]]s in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action as well as when they themselves perform it.

=== Gender differences ===
The literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the [[Systemizing Quotient]] (SQ). Both males and females with [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum disorders]] usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ ([[#Autism|see below]] for more detail on autism and empathy).&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; However, a series of studies, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Tzeng O.J. |author3=Decety J. |author4=Hsieh J.C. | year = 2006 | title = Gender differences in the human mirror system: a magnetoencephalography study | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 1115–1119 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000223393.59328.21 | pmid=16837838}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinal reflex excitability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Hsieh J.C. |author4=Hung D. |author5=Tzeng O.J. | year = 2007 | title = Gender differences in spinal excitability during observation of bipedal locomotion | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 887–890 | doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e3280ebb486 | pmid=17515795}}&lt;/ref&gt; electroencephalography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang C.Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Lee S. |author4=Chen G. |author5=Cheng Y. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in the Mu rhythm during empathy for pain: An electroencephalographic study | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1251 | issue = | pages = 176–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.11.062 | pmid = 19083993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheng Y., Lee P., Yang C.Y., Lin C.P., Decety J. | year = 2008 | title = Gender differences in the mu rhythm of the human mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e2113 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2113C | last2 = Lee | last3 = Yang | last4 = Lin | last5 = Hung | last6 = Decety | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002113 | editor1-last = Rustichini | editor1-first = Aldo | pmid=18461176 | pmc=2361218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and N400 paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When neurons do not mirror the agent's intentions: Sex differences in neural coding of goal-directed actions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent's_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|journal = Neuropsychologia|pages = 1454–1463|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.01.015|first = Alice Mado|last = Proverbio|first2 = Federica|last2 = Riva|first3 = Alberto|last3 = Zani|year = 2010|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908202105/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent%27s_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|archivedate = September 8, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the presence of an overall gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants tending to exhibit stronger motor resonance than male participants.

Using [[fMRI]], neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD |date=Jan 2006 | title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7075| pages = 466–9 | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Stephan | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1038/nature04271 | pmid = 16421576 | pmc = 2636868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis from the journal of ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that, overall, there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females, on average, were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid = 25236781|pmc = 5110041|year = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814055810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|archivedate = August 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAlinden | first = Maggie | contribution = Can teachers know learners' minds?

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H. D., and A. P. Harbaugh. (2010).

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

University of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies.

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C. D. |author2=Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc.

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing. It is possible to see this form of anger as a [[pro-social]] emotion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The terms cognitive empathy and [[theory of mind]] are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex, and empathy, i.e. the ability to share the feelings of others, relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The lack of clear distinctions between [[theory of mind]] and cognitive empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome; many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillberg | first1 = C.

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions.

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile.

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===

Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.&lt;ref name="Cleckly, 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

One diagnostic criterion of [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR npd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120212711/http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder |date=January 20, 2013 }} – [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported.

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The [[optical|optics]] term '''encircled energy''' refers to a measure of concentration of [[energy]] in an optical [[image]], or projected [[laser beam|laser]] at a given range.  If a single star is brought to its sharpest [[Focus (optics)|focus]] by a [[lens (optics)|lens]] giving the smallest [[image]] possible with that given lens (called a [[point spread function]] or PSF), calculation of the encircled energy of the resulting image gives the distribution of energy in that PSF.  

Encircled energy is calculated by first determining the total energy of the PSF over the full image plane, then determining the [[centroid]] of the PSF.  Circles of increasing [[radius]] are then created at that centroid and the PSF energy within each circle is calculated and divided by the total energy.  As the circle increases in radius, more of the PSF energy is enclosed, until the circle is sufficiently large to completely contain all the PSF energy.  The encircled energy curve thus ranges from zero to one.  

A typical criterion for encircled energy (EE) is the radius of the PSF at which either 50% or 80% of the energy is encircled.  This is a [[linear]] dimension, typically in [[micrometre|micrometer]]s.  When divided by the lens or mirror focal length, this gives the angular size of the PSF, typically expressed in [[Minute of arc|arc-seconds]] when specifying [[astronomical]] optical system performance.

Encircled energy is also used to quantify the spreading of a laser beam at a given distance.  All laser beams spread due to the necessarily limited [[aperture]] of the optical system projecting the beam.  As in star image PSF's, the linear spreading of the beam expressed as encircled energy is divided by the projection distance to give the angular spreading.

An alternative to encircled energy is ensquared energy, typically used when quantifying image sharpness for digital imaging cameras using [[pixels]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12387">'''Equipotentiality''' refers to a [[psychological]] theory in both [[neuropsychology]] and [[behaviorism]]. [[Karl Spencer Lashley]] defined equipotentiality as "The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out… the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]".&lt;ref name="Fancher"&gt;Fancher, R.E., &amp; Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of Psychology. New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the brain can co-opt other areas to take over the role of the damaged part.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Garrett, H. (1941). R. Elliott (Ed.), Great experiments in psychology, New York: D. Appleton-century Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined, the law of [[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]]. The law of mass action says that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex.

==Historical context==
In the 1800s brain localization theories were the popular theories on how the brain functioned.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; The [[Broca's area]] of speech was discovered in 1861, in 1870 the cerebral cortex was marked as the motor center of the brain, and the general visual and auditory areas were defined in the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref name="Hearst"&gt;Hearst, E. (1979). The first century of experimental psychology. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviorism]] at the time would also say that learned responses were series of specific connections in the cerebral cortex. Lashley argued that one would then be able to locate these connections in part of the brain and he systematically looked for where learning was localized.

==Experiments==
While working on his PhD in genetics, Lashley began a number of tests on brain tissue and the idea of localization.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley wanted to focus mainly on behaviors that could be observed and an easy way to do that was to study white rats in a controlled setting. A fellow researcher, [[Shepherd Ivory Franz]], also shared the common interest of studying localization and studying only things that could be observed. Franz had already done previous work with lesions in cat brains and puzzle boxes so Lashley and Franz decided to team up and work with rats.

In their first experiments, Lashley was in charge of building different mazes for the rats to go through and Franz was in charge of making the lesions in the rats' brains.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; What Lashley and Franz had both observed before the lesions was that their rats became better and better at getting through the mazes to find food and they were testing if lesions had an influence on the rats' memory and ability to get through the mazes. Franz made multiple lesions in specific parts of the brains and after they healed, put them through the maze to see if they had deficits in finding the food. What they found was that the mice had no deficits finding the food if the lesions were in a specific part of the brain but if the lesions damaged a large portion of the brain, they did have troubles finding food.

This would suggest that just one part of the brain is not responsible for memory and localization was totally ruled out.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; What they concluded was that multiple parts of the brain work together for memory and retention. They also found that rats with lesions in a small specific area had functioning sensory systems and it seemed that when parts of the brain were damaged for a certain action, other parts of the brain were compensating so those actions could be carried out. Lashley coined the term equipotentiality to define the idea that if one part of the brain is damaged, other parts of the brain will carry out the memory functions for that damaged part.

"The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out… the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]".&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Another way of putting this is, the brain has the ability to use any functioning part of the brain to do what a damaged part of the brain no longer can do.&lt;ref name="Garrett" /&gt; Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined, the law of mass action. The law of mass action says that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex.

Ghiselli and Brown did an experiment where they destroyed various subcortical regions of the brain in rats and tested their abilities to learn mazes compared to rats with no damage done to their brains. The rats with damaged brains didn't learn as well as the control rats, but no particular region seemed to be necessary to learn the mazes. There has also been experimental work done on higher apes and also studies done on humans who have suffered brain damage in various ways. The data gathered from these tend to confirm Lashley's theories.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury"&gt;Dewsbury, D. A. (2006). Monkey farm: a history of the yerkes laboratories of primate biology, orange park, florida 1930-1965. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pGo606UrQhgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=yerkes laboratories&amp;ots=FPcTjpGCwA&amp;sig=wkwPpFDSPI20sYC-feSaPG8oswE&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the idea of equipotentiality we can explain how someone who's received damage to a specific part of their brain can relearn how to perform actions that were lost due to brain damage. Since the area of the brain that was originally performing this function is damaged and unusable, the brain compensates and can code that information in other parts of the brain. Through Lashley's ideas of equipotentiality and the law of mass action, he is saying that the brain is functioning as a whole unit and that over all damage to the brain effects it's over all functioning. This starts to go against localization theories which would say that the brain is only functioning in specific regions and the brain's ability to perform at any given task is only effected by the overall damage to that area of the brain and damage to an unrelated area shouldn't affect the task. However, equipotentiality and the law of mass action don't mean that there is no localization.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt; There are certain functions that have been pinned to specific parts of the brain, language and the senses for example, but for things like learning or behavior there is no specific area identified yet, and these are the brain activities that have the flexibility to be coded in different areas of the brain after damage has been sustained.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt;

===In neuropsychology===
In [[neuropsychology]], equipotentiality is a [[neurological]] principle that describes a [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] mechanism, first identified by [[Jean Pierre Flourens]] and later revisited by [[Karl Lashley]] in the 1950s. The principle of equipotentiality is the idea that the rate of learning is independent of the combination of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli that are used in classical conditioning.

After performing [[ablation]] experiments on birds, and seeing that they could still fly, peck, mate, sleep, and perform a range of other regular behaviors, Flourens concluded that every area of the brain was capable of doing what every other area of the brain could, but only for higher-level functions which he called "perception". He also argued that elementary sensory input was localized, which is supported by current research. The famous saying that we only use 10% of our brains originates from Flourens, back about a century and a half ago.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Lashley offered two generalizations from his research, that recently have been successfully challenged but nonetheless represent important milestones in the development of neurological theory:
# Although surgical removal of a portion of the cortex can produce significant behavioral deficits, those deficits can be recovered through additional training and time, by way of the development of new [[neuronal]] connections. Lashley argued that the brain is sufficiently plastic, such that when one region of the brain is surgically removed (or damaged through injury) another region takes over the damaged region's function. This is the principle Lashley referred to as equipotentiality. Extensive regions of the [[cerebral cortex]] have the potentiality for mediating specific learning and memory functions.
# His principle of "[[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]]" stated that the cerebral cortex acts as one—as a whole—in many types of learning.

===In behaviorism===
In [[behaviorism]], the theory of equipotentiality suggests that any two stimuli can be associated in the brain, regardless of their nature. It proposes that all forms of [[associative learning]], both classical ([[Pavlovian]]) and [[operant]] ([[B.F. Skinner|Skinnerian]]) involve the same underlying mechanisms. However, food avoidance experiments have questioned its application.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Contributions==
Lashley contributed to psychology and neuropsychology in a number of ways. First, his publication, ''Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence: A Quantitative Study of Injuries to the Brain'' (1929) disproved the idea of localization and brought to life the idea that the brain and its multiple parts work together for memory and other functions.&lt;ref name=" Encyclopædia Britannica "&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. (2013). Karl S. Lashley. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 21, 2013 from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330978/Karl-S-Lashley&lt;/ref&gt; Second, researchers began to copy his studies and also started to investigate what parts of the brain work together. They also began studying deficits people may have along with parts of their brain that may be damaged to see if there is a correlation between them.

Lashley was also a pioneer in challenging the way we think about human and animal behavior in terms of our biology.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley found with further experimentation that behavior is not just a reaction to a stimulus but a large and complicated series of connections made in the brain. An input of information or stimuli occurs and connections occur in the brain which leads to the output or behavior. Researchers also expanded the study of working memory, central executive, and further research on memory deficits and learning.

Lashley did not find a central place for stored memories, which suggests that stored memories are not localized but stored and retrieved in multiple areas.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley contributed to studies on [[Alzheimer's disease]] and deficits in memory, behavior, and thinking in those who have Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="B. Davis"&gt;B. Davis. (2008). Karl Spencer Lashley. Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved November 21, 2013 from http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Karl_Spencer_Lashley.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-to-cell communication slowly degrades in Alzheimer's disease and Lashley's contributions to psychology, neuropsychology and biology have helped with the understanding of this and many other diseases and disorders.
 
==People Lashley influenced==
Karl Lashley worked with [[Donald Hebb]] in The Yerkes Laboratories; a lab that worked with monkeys to study various psychological concepts. Another man that Lashley influenced was [[Roger Sperry]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt; He also studied with Lashley in the lab and eventually received the Karl Lashley Award of the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name="Hergenhahn"&gt;Hergenhahn, B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16576">The '''Feldenkrais Method''' is a type of [[exercise therapy]] devised by [[Moshé Feldenkrais]] (1904–1984).  The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state.&lt;ref name=ehm/&gt;

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits, and it is not known if it is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; even though it is hard to conceive of serious risks.&lt;ref name="Corgi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=S|last2=Ernst|first2=E|title=Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial|date=2009|publisher=Corgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness and reception==
In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly in 2017 the Australian government named  the Feldenkrais Method as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |year=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the Feldenkrais method is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; though according to Ernst and Singh's overview of alternative medicine "there are no conceivable serious risks".&lt;ref name="Corgi"/&gt;

[[David Gorski]] has written that the Method bears similarities to [[faith healing]], is like "glorified [[yoga]]" and that it "borders on [[quackery]]".&lt;ref name=gorski/&gt;

== Description ==
The Feldenkrais Method is a type of alternative exercise therapy that proponents claim can repair impaired connections between the [[motor cortex]] and the body, so benefiting the quality of body movement and improving [[wellbeing]].&lt;ref name=ehm&gt;{{cite book |editors=Stalker D, Glymour C |page=373 |year=1989 |publisher=Prometheus Books |title=Examining Holistic Medicine |isbn=9780879755539 |quote=a system of exercise therapy developed in the 1940s by former judo instructor Moshe Feldenkrais}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to "rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement" and that "These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life".&lt;ref name=gorski&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorski D |authorlink=David Gorski |publisher=Scienceblogs&amp;mdash;Respectful Insolence |title=M.D. Anderson enters the blogosphere–and goes woo |date=6 August 2009 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/05/md-anderson-enters-the-blogosphere-and-g/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that the Feldenkrais Method can benefit people with a number of medical conditions, including children with [[autism]], and people with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=autism-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Feldenkrais Method can Benefit Children with Autism |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |author=Adams A |date=30 April 2015 |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918103015/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=Maintaining Mobility:The Feldenkrais Method and Multiple Sclerosis |date=15 June 2015 |author=Dillon S |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918085542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Similar to some other somatic methods, such as those started by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], [[Elsa Gindler]], and [[Gerda Alexander]], the Feldenkrais Method originated in the efforts of its founder to work with his own bodily problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Don Hanlon|title=Bone, Breath, and Gesture: Practices of Embodiment|date=1995|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1556432011|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Moshé Feldenkrais, it was a chronically injured knee.

Feldenkrais first injured his knee while playing soccer in British-controlled Palestine in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reese|first1=Mark|title=Moshe Feldenkrais: A Life in Movement|date=2015|publisher=ReeseKress Somatics Press|location=San Rafael, California|isbn=978-0-9855612-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} He reinjured it while negotiating the slippery decks of submarines while working as a scientist at the British Naval station at [[Fairlie, North Ayrshire]], Scotland during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doidge|first1=Norman|title=The Brain's Way of Healing|date=2015|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312837-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais was by that time a Judo teacher and had mostly completed the work toward a D.Sc. under the guidance of Nobel laureate [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]].&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|208}} Facing the prospect of a surgery that could leave him with a life-long limp, Feldenkrais decided to apply the knowledge gained from his study of physics, engineering, and martial arts to an intensive self-study of his own movement habits. When his work provided him with relief, allowing him to avoid the knee surgery, he began exploring the methods he developed on himself with a small group of people at Fairlie, including scientific colleague [[John Desmond Bernal]] and [[John Boyd-Orr]], Nobel laureate and first president of the World Academy of Art and Science.&lt;ref name="Elusive Obvious"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=978-0-916990-09-1|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as head of electronic engineering for the Israeli Army in newly formed Israel from 1951 to 1953, Feldenkrais devoted the rest of his life, from age 50 onward, to developing and teaching self-awareness through movement lessons.&lt;ref name= "Claire"&gt;{{cite book |last= Claire |first= Thomas |year= 1995 |title= Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It |publisher= [[William Morrow and Co.]] |pages= 75–88 |isbn= 9781591201656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Hanna, "Moshe Feldenkrais"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais", in ''Explorers of Humankind''|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s till his death in 1984, he taught continuously in his home city of Tel Aviv. Feldenkrais gained recognition in part through media accounts of his work with prominent individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]].&lt;ref name="Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lori|first1=Aviva|title=Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer|url=http://www.haaretz.com/ben-gurion-s-personal-trainer-1.124885|website=Haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter|url=http://www.feldenkrais-biographie.de/buch-news/english/|website=feldenkrais-biographie|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1950s, Feldenkrais made trips to teach in Europe and America. Several hundred people became certified Feldenkrais practitioners through trainings he held in San Francisco from 1975 to 1978 and in Amherst, Massachusetts from 1980 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Jon|last2=Freer|first2=Bonnie|title=His Methods May Seem Bizarre, But Thousands Swear by Mind-Body Guru Moshe Feldenkrais|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20080162,00.html|website=people.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the need for an institutional structure to carry on his teaching, he helped found the Feldenkrais Guild of North America in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais" in Explorers of Humankind|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco, California|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldenkrais developed the conceptual framework of his method in part through the publication of six books, beginning with ''Body and Mature Behavior'' (1949) and ending with the posthumously published ''The Potent Self'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moshe Feldenkrais Bibliography|url=http://www.feldenkraismethod.com/articles/moshe-feldenkrais-bibliography|website=Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais – His Life and Work|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Feldenkrais' death, the international Feldenkrais community has used a guild structure to regulate its activity, with training accreditation boards in the Americas, Europe, and Australasia overseeing guilds and associations in eighteen member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Organizations|url=http://feldenkrais-method.org/iff/member-organizations/|website=International Feldenkrais Federation|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Feldenkrais Journal'', the annual publication of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America, serves as a forum for the Feldenkrais community to discuss the method and its applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feldenkrais Journal|url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|website=Feldenkrais Guild of North America|accessdate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524124542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|archivedate=24 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
The development of the Feldenkrais Method was influenced by Moshe Feldenkrais's involvement in the martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marlock|first1=Gustl|title=The Handbook of Body Psychotherapy and Somatic Psychology|date=2015|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583948415|page=876|url=https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/shop/the-handbook-of-body-psychotherapy-and-somatic-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|71}} After meeting [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of Judo, while living in Paris in the 1930s, Feldenkrais transitioned to that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title="The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education"|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy|publisher=InTech|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main influences of judo on the Feldenkrais Method is the differentiation between rote exercise and attentive movement: "the methods of physical exercise in vogue&amp;nbsp;... exert only the muscles without any other goal, and one needs much will to bind oneself unfailingly to one of these methods", wrote Feldenkrais in 1952. "Judo is very different, each movement has a specific goal which is reached after a precise and supple execution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=A.B.C. du Judo: Jiu-Jitsu|date=1952|publisher=Chiron|location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he focused on the creation of his own method, Feldenkrais influenced the teaching of martial arts in Western Europe through the publication of five books on jiujitsu and judo, as well as teaching at practice centers in France and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|211–212}}

Feldenkrais was born into an Hasidic family and community, and he acknowledged the influence of Hasidic Judaism on his method.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|7}} In his 2007 book, ''Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life of Moshe Feldenkrais'', David Kaetz argued that there are many lines of influence to be found between the Judaism of Feldenkrais's upbringing and the Feldenkrais Method – for instance, the use of paradox as a pedagogical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaetz|first1=David|title=Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life and Teachings of Moshe Feldenkrais|date=2014|publisher=River Centre Publishing|location=Hornby Island, Canada|isbn=978-0-9784014-2-9|pages=13–15, 27–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais also acknowledged the influence of the Russian spiritualist [[George Gurdjieff]] on his work, in particular Gurdjieff's teachings on automatism and freedom in embodiment.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|430–444}}

Feldenkrais earned his doctorate in a program at the Sorbonne intended to bridge theoretical physics and industrial engineering.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|128–129}} Feldenkrais's biographer, Mark Reese, argues that Feldenkrais brought this emphasis on practical scientific inquiry to the understanding of embodiment expressed through his method: "Feldenkrais was critical of the appropriation of the term 'energy' to express immeasurable phenomena or to label experiences that people had trouble describing", notes Reese. "He was impatient when someone invoked energy in pseudoscientific 'explanations' that masked a lack of understanding. In such cases he urged skepticism and scientific discourse. He encouraged empirical and phenomenological narratives that could lead to insights."&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|117}} Feldenkrais incorporated the views of other scientists into his teaching; for instance, he asked questions of both the neurosurgeon [[Karl H. Pribram]] and the cyberneticist [[Heinz von Foerster]] at trainings in San Francisco in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=0-916990-09-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|329–330}} [[Cybernetics]], also known as dynamic systems theory, continued to influence the Feldenkrais Method in the 1990s through the work of human development researcher [[Esther Thelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title=The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=Intechopen.com|publisher=InTech|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17854">'''Functional analytic psychotherapy''' ('''FAP''') is a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach based on [[clinical behavior analysis]] (CBA) that focuses on the [[therapeutic relationship]] as a means to maximize client change. Specifically, FAP suggests that in-session [[Reinforcement|contingent responding]] to client target behaviors leads to significant therapeutic improvements.

FAP was first conceptualized in the 1980s by psychologists Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai who, after noticing a clinically significant association between client outcomes and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, set out to develop a theoretical model of [[behavioral psychotherapy]] based on these concepts. Behavioral principles (e.g., [[reinforcement]], generalization) form the basis of FAP.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R. J., &amp; Tsai, M. (1991). Functional analytic psychotherapy: A guide for creating intense and curative therapeutic relationships. New York, NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsai&gt;Tsai, M., Kohlenberg, R. J., Kanter, J. W., Kohlenberg, B., Follette, W., &amp; Callaghan, G. (2009). A guide to functional analytic psychotherapy: Awareness, courage, love and behaviorism. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link||The five rules}} below.)

FAP is an [[Nomothetic and idiographic|idiographic (as opposed to nomothetic)]] approach to psychotherapy. This means that FAP therapists focus on the ''function'' of a client's behavior instead of the ''form''. The aim is to change a broad class of behaviors that might look different on the surface but all serve the same function. It is idiographic in that the client and therapist work together to form a unique [[clinical formulation]] of the client's therapeutic goals, rather than one therapeutic target for every client who enters therapy.

==Basics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
FAP posits that client behaviors that occur in their out-of-session interpersonal relationships (i.e. in the "real world") will, if clients are given a therapeutic relationship of sufficiently high quality, occur in the therapy session as well. Based on these in-session behaviors, FAP therapists, in collaboration with their client, develop a [[case formulation]] that includes classes of behaviors (based on their function not their form) that the client wishes to increase and decrease.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;

In-session occurrence of a client's problematic behavior is called ''clinically relevant behavior 1'' (CRB1). In-session occurrence of improvements is called ''clinically relevant behavior 2'' (CRB2). The goal of FAP therapy is to decrease the frequency of CRB1s and increase the frequency of CRB2s.

The FAP therapist evokes (i.e. sets the context for) CRB1s and in response gradually [[Shaping (psychology)|shapes]] CRB2s.

===The five rules===
"The five rules" operationalize the FAP therapist's behavior with respect to this goal. It is important to note that the five rules are not rules in the traditional sense of the word, but instead a set of guidelines for the FAP therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Tsai, M., Kohlenberg, R. J., Kanter, J. W., Waltz, J. (2009). Therapeutic technique: The five rules. In: M. Tsai, R. Kohlenberg, J. Kanter, B. Kohlenberg, W. Follette, G. Callaghan (Eds.) A guide to functional analytic psychotherapy: Awareness, courage, love, and behaviorism. (pp. 61–102). NY, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Rule 1: Watch for CRBs''' – Therapists focus their attention on the occurrence of CRBs that are in-session problems (CRB1s) and improvements (CRB2s).
*'''Rule 2: Evoke CRBs''' – Therapists set a context which evoke the client's CRBs.
*'''Rule 3: Reinforce CRB2s naturally''' – Therapists reinforce the occurrence of CRB2s (in-session improvements), increasing the probability that these behaviors will occur more frequently.
*'''Rule 4: Observe therapist impact in relation to client CRBs''' – Therapists assess the degree to which they actually reinforced behavioral improvements by noting the client's behavior subsequent behavior after Rule 3. This is similar to the [[behavior analytic]] concept of performing a [[Functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]].
*'''Rule 5: Provide functional interpretations and generalize''' – Therapists work with the client to generalize in-session behavioral improvements to the client's out-of-session relationships. This can include, but is not limited to, providing [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework assignment]]s.

===The ACL model===
Researchers at the Center for the Science of Social Connection at the [[University of Washington]] are developing a model of social connection that they believe is relevant to FAP. This model – called the ACL model – delineates behaviors relevant to social connection based on decades of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Reis, H. T., &amp; Shaver, P. (1988). Intimacy as an interpersonal process In: S. Duck (Ed.), Handbook of personal relationships (pp. 367–389). Chichester, England: Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Awareness (A)''' behaviors include paying attention to your own and the other's needs and values within an interpersonal relationship.
*'''Courage (C)''' behaviors include experiencing emotion in the presence of another person, asking for what you need, and sharing deep, vulnerable experiences with another person in the service of improving the relationship.
*'''Love (L)''' behaviors involve responding to another's courage behaviors with attunement to what that person needs in the moment. These include providing safety and acceptance in response to a client's vulnerability.
FAP has the potential to target awareness, courage, and love behaviors as they occur in session as described by the five rules above. More research is needed to confirm the utility of the ACL model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.02.001|title=Where is the love?

==Third generation behavior therapy==
FAP belongs to a group of therapies referred to as [[Behavior therapy#Third generation|third-generation behavior therapies]] (or third-wave behavior therapies) that includes [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), [[behavioral activation]] (BA), and [[integrative behavioral couples therapy]] (IBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. | last2 = Masuda | first2 = A. | last3 = Bissett | first3 = R. | last4 = Luoma | first4 = J. | last5 = Guerrero | first5 = L. | year = 2004 | title = DBT, FAR and ACT: How empirically oriented are the new behavior therapy technologies? | url = http://www.personal.kent.edu/~dfresco/CBT_Readings/ACT_FAP_%26_DBT_review.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 35–54 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(04)80003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
FAP has been criticized for "being ahead of the data", i.e. having not enough empirical support to justify its widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Corrigan, P. W. (2001). "Getting ahead of the data: A threat to some behavior therapies". ''The Behavior Therapist'', 24, 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges encountered by FAP researchers are widely discussed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maitland, D. W. M., Gaynor, S. T.|year=2012|title=Promoting Efficacy Research on Functional Analytic Psychotherapy|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy|volume=7|issue=2–3|pages=63–71|doi=10.1037/h0100939|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bct/7/2-3/63.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Weeks, C.

There is also criticism of using the ACL model as it detracts from the idiographic nature of FAP.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite journal|authors=Darrow S. M., Follette W. C.|year=2014|title=Where's the beef?: Reply to Kanter, Holman, and Wilson|journal=Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|volume=3|issue=4|pages=265–268|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grenzau Feud''' ({{lang-de|Grenzauer Fehde}}) was a warlike conflict between the troops of [[Koblenz]] in the [[Electorate of Trier]] on the one hand and Lord Philip of [[House of Isenburg|Isenburg]] and Lord Reynard of [[Barony of Westerburg|Westerburg]] on the other at [[Grenzau Castle|Grenzau]] on 20 April 1347. The Koblenz soldiers were ambushed and 172 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Tilemann Elhen von Wolfhagen: ''The Limburg Chronicle'' (=''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]. Scriptores qui vernacula lingua usi sunt." T.4, P.1 = "''Deutsche Chroniken und andere Geschichtsbücher des Mittelalters.''" Vol. 4, Pt. 1). Published by Arthur Wyss. Hahn, Hanover, 1883,[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0000/bsb00000777/images/?id=00000777&amp;page=31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

Processions and memorial services to commemorate the fallen citizens were held in the churches of Koblenz on the Friday after Easter annually until about 1800. After mass in the [[Church of Our Lady, Koblenz|Church of Our Lady]], a citizen of Koblenz used to climb a stone block on a house opposite (then the parsonage) and told the story of the feud..&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Christian von Stramberg|Christian von Stramberg]]: ''Coblenz, die Stadt. Historisch und topographisch dargestellt'' (= ''Denkwürdiger und nützlicher Rheinischer Antiquarius, welcher die wichtigsten und angenehmsten geographischen, historischen und politischen Merkwürdigkeiten des ganzen Rheinstroms, von seinem Ausfluß in das Meer bis zu seinem Ursprunge darstellt. Mittelrhein.'' Sect. 1, Vol. 4). Vol. 4. Hergt, Koblenz, 1856, [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb11041175.html?pageNo=353 p.&amp;nbsp;327].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grenzau Feud is classified as one of the warlike conflicts surrounding the election of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. From 1314, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] was the [[Roman-German king]]. After 1340, however, the German electors increasingly distanced themselves from Louis and in 1346 elected Charles IV as [[counter-king]]. The election of Charles IV marked the beginning of a civil war between king and counter-king. On the side of Charles were the Archbishop of Trier, [[Baldwin of Luxembourg|Baldwin]], and the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Walram of Jülich|Walram]]. Louis's allies included the Limburg dynasty of [[Gerlach V of Isenburg-Limburg|Gerlach]] and Reinhard of Westerburg. In the course of these disputes, Reinhard captured Grenzau Castle in the [[Westerwald]] mountains. When they attempted to recapture the castle, the troops of Koblenz were ambushed. Following the massacre of 172 Koblenz citizens, Reinhard had to escape and fled to Gerlach at Limburg Castle. Now the Lords of Limburg had the castle as a fiefdom, one third each from the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse]] and the Archbishop of Trier. Baldwin advanced on the castle in Limburg and demanded that it was opened, citing the feudal treaty. But Gerlach rejected this, because he was only obliged to remain loyal to Baldwin if the feud did not go against the Reich, the Archbishop and the Landgrave. Baldwin withdrew, leaving it as unfinished business.

Though the term usually refers to relatively minor acts of violence such as hitting or slapping the victim, more serious crimes such as the [[manslaughter]] of a pensioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10331547|title='Happy slapping' gang members admit killing Ekram Haque|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual assault]] have been classified as "happy slapping" by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=sexattack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6970516.stm|title=Sex attack phone girls detained|work=BBC News|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use with video technology==
The ease and general availability of video cameras in mobile phones means that such attacks need not be planned carefully beforehand and are more easily watched and circulated for entertainment. Some political and media commentators claim the craze was inspired by such television shows as ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', ''[[Dirty Sanchez (TV series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'' and ''[[Bumfights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tv-to-blame-for-happy-slapping-craze-1069006|title=TV to blame for 'happy slapping' craze |date=30 June 2005|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4539861.stm|title='Don't ban' slap attack TV shows|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2005|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=1972548|title='Happy Slapping' Spreads in London|first=Nick|last=Watt|date=17 May 2006|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Happy slapping" started in the [[South London]] [[London Borough of Lewisham|Borough of Lewisham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4539913.stm|title=Does 'happy slapping' exist?|last=Akwagyiram|first=Alexis|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1620568,00.html|title=Happy-slap link to TV shows |last=Johnston|first=Chris|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a format known as "Slap Happy TV", where a happy-slapping video would be recorded, and then watched by dozens of people like a TV show, but in the form of a montage. Videos of Happy Slapping were commonly circulated via Bluetooth on mobile phones. The first newspaper article to use the phrase "happy slapping" was "Bullies film fights by phone", published in The ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' on 21 January 2005, in which reporter Michael Shaw described teachers' accounts of the craze in London schools.

Gary Martin, writing on "The Phrase Finder" website described the phenomenon as: "Unprovoked attacks on individuals made in order to record the event, and especially the victim's shock and surprise, on video phones."&lt;ref name=phrases&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/170890.html|title=Happy slapping|first=Gary|last=Martin|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin wrote that happy slapping "began as a youth craze in the UK in late 2004. Children or passers by are slapped or otherwise mugged by one or more of a gang while others record the event on video and then distribute it by phone or Internet. Initially the attacks were, as the phrase would have us believe, fairly minor pranks ... As the craze spread the attacks became more vicious – often serious assaults known in legal circles as grievous bodily harm."&lt;ref name=phrases/&gt;

==Legal consequences==

===Denmark===
When the international media attention surrounding attacks abroad reached a high point, a girl was sentenced to eight months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netavisen-sjaelland.dk/news.php?item.326 "8-måneders fængsel for 'happy slapping'"], ''Netavisen Sjaelland'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced on a number of counts including previous crimes. {{clarify|date=September 2016}}

A common punishment in 2007 was a fine or up to 40 days in prison, suspended if the attacker has no previous record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigsadvokat.dk/media/bilag/RI_17-2007_Bilag_til_redegorelse____244-246.pdf Oversigt over straffene i voldssager efter ændringen af straffelovens §§ 244–246], Prosecutor General of Denmark (Overview of punishments in cases of violence after change of §244–246); accessed 1 September 2016.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Banke [http://www.bt.dk/article/20060419/krimi/104190023 "Slap med bøde for 'happy slapping'"], BT.dk, 19 April 2006.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for any term which does not exceed 3 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/34/javascript:void();|title=Criminal codes - Legislationline|website=www.legislationline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happy slapping is judged as "simple battery" as defined by section 244 of the Danish Criminal Code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===France===
In February 2007, an amendment aimed at criminalising "happy slapping" was added to a law "on the prevention of delinquency" by the [[Parliament of France]] based on a proposal from then [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/dossiers/prevention_delinquance.asp Legislative file], assemblee-nationale.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=INTX0600091L Law #2007-297], legifrance.gouv.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anti-happy-slapping clause appears as the last part of Article 44, which also deals with ambushing law enforcement personnel. The law equates filming or photographing certain classes of violent crimes, including severe beatings and rape, with being an [[accomplice]] of such crimes. The law makes it illegal to broadcast the images of such crimes, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and/or a €75,000 fine.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The law does not apply to those who took the above actions in order to obtain evidence in court, or as professional [[journalism]]. Professional journalism is delimited in France by the "press card", which is awarded by a commission representing journalist unions and press organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccijp.net/ Commission de la carte d'identité des journalistes professionnels]''&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by law,&lt;ref&gt;Work Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-2 article L761-2], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-15 article L761-15], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-16 article L761-16]&lt;/ref&gt; a professional journalist is one whose main activity is professional paid journalism.

The bill was signed into law on 5 March 2007, despite some organizations, including [[Reporters Without Borders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|title=Communiqué|work=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503213819/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|archivedate=3 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French chapter of [[Wikimedia France|Wikimedia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimedia.fr/index.php/Communiqu%C3%A9s_de_presse/Projet_de_loi_prevention_delinquance Communiqué] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that this clause created a legal discrimination in criminal law between professional journalists and ordinary citizens practicing journalism. Specifically, it was argued that citizens filming incidents of [[police brutality]] and publishing such information online could be intimidated by law enforcement into remaining silent, or prosecuted for their actions. This criticism was relayed by the international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1490130.ece Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], timesonline.co.uk, 9 March 2007.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07070/767887-96.stm Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], post-gazette.com, 11 March 2007.&lt;br&gt; [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/410gvlul.asp Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], WeeklyStandard.com, 14 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French presidential election, 2007|French President]] Nicolas Sarkozy declared to Reporters Without Borders that "the spirit of the law is not to infringe of freedom of information. However, if the least doubt subsisted, then I'm in favour of a clarification of the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 Communiqué] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225940/http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Reporters without Borders|rsf.org]], 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf Nicolas Sarkozy comments on "happy slapping" legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181146/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, rsf.org; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2008, a teenage girl who filmed the fatal beating of a man on her mobile phone was sentenced to two years' detention in the first prosecution of its kind in the United Kingdom. The judge stated that the courts had to make an example of such youths. She had pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court in February 2008 to [[aiding and abetting]] the [[manslaughter]] of Gavin Waterhouse, 29, from [[Keighley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Mark Masters, 19, from Keighley, and Sean Thompson, 17, from Bradford, were sentenced to seven and six years respectively after admitting to manslaughter. Waterhouse died from a ruptured spleen after being beaten in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7244782.stm?lsm|title=Happy slap attack girl guilty|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_yorkshire/7244782.stm|title='Happy slap' death girl convicted|work=BBC News|date=14  February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/happyslap.killing|title=Girl jailed for filming 'happy-slap' killing|work=The Guardian|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK|first=Angela|last=Balakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the attack, the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to "video this", prosecutors said. She approached Waterhouse, asked for money, and recorded the subsequent attack. She was sentenced to serve a two-year [[Sentencing in England and Wales#Detention and training orders|detention training order]]. Police said they were satisfied with the court's decision. The Crown Prosecutor said "this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called 'happy slapping' incident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-slapping-idUKL1884088120080318 "Suspect sentenced for aiding and abetting a 'happy slapping' incident"], news.com.au; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau''' (10 February 1810 – 12 January 1892) was a French [[natural history|biologist]].

== Life ==
He was born at [[Berthézène]], in the [[communes of France|commune]] of [[Valleraugue]] ([[Gard]]), the son of a [[Protestant]] farmer. He studied medicine at [[Strasbourg]] and then Science, where he took the double degree of M.D. and D.Sc., one of his theses being a ''Théorie d'un coup de canon'' (November 1829); next year he published a book, ''Sur les arolithes'', and in 1832 a treatise on ''L'Extraversion de la vessie''. Moving to [[Toulouse]], he practised medicine for a short time, and contributed various memoirs to the local ''Journal de Médecine'' and to the ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' (1834—36). But being unable to continue his research in the provinces, he resigned the chair of [[zoology]] to which he had been appointed, and in 1839 settled in Paris, where he found in [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] a patron and a friend.

Elected professor of natural history at the [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Napoléon]] in 1850, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1852, and in 1855 was appointed to the chair of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnography]] at the [[Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle]]. Other distinctions followed rapidly, and continued to the end of his otherwise uneventful career, the more important being honorary member of the [[Royal Society of London]] (June 1879), member of the Institute and of the Academie de médecine, and commander of the [[Legion of Honor]] (1881). He died in Paris.

He was an accurate observer and unwearied collector of zoological materials, gifted with remarkable descriptive power, and possessed of a clear, vigorous style, but somewhat deficient in deep philosophic insight. Hence his serious studies on the anatomical characters of the lower and higher organisms, man included, will retain their value, while many of his theories and generalizations, especially in the department of [[ethnology]], are already forgotten.

==Evolution==

Quatrefages was critical of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories but was not anti-evolution. From 1859 he corresponded with Darwin regularly and although they disagreed with each other they stayed on friendly terms.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"&gt;Burkhardt, Frederick. (2010). ''Introduction''. In ''The Correspondence of Charles Darwin: Volume 18; Volume 1870''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 21-22. {{ISBN|978-0-521-76889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quatrefages authored ''Charles Darwin et ses précurseurs francais'' (1870), which contained criticism of [[Darwinism]]. On receiving the book, Darwin in a letter to Quatrefages commented that "many of your strictures are severe enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy &amp; fairness. I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in this manner than praised by many others."&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"/&gt;

In 1870, Quatrefages and [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] nominated Darwin for election as a corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in the section of Anatomy and Zoology. This was met with strong opposition from [[Émile Blanchard]], [[Charles-Philippe Robin]] and others. Darwin lost the election by a narrow margin.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 147-148. {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''L'Espèce humaine'' (translated ''The Human Species'', 1879) he disputed the role of [[natural selection]] in evolution. Quatrefages proposed that natural "elimination" would have been a more exact term as natural selection does not create new species.&lt;ref&gt;Quatrefages de Bréau, Armand de. (1879). [https://archive.org/stream/humanspecies01quat#page/94/mode/2up ''The Human Species'']. New York: D. Appleton and Company. pp. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Quatrefages was a strict [[Monogenism|monogenist]] and was an opponent of [[polygenism]].&lt;ref&gt;Delisle, Richard. (2006). ''Debating Humankind's Place in Nature, 1860-2000: The Nature of Paleoanthropology''. pp. 59-60. {{ISBN|978-0131773905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, David N. (2008). ''Adam's Ancestors: Race, Religion, and the Politics of Human Origins''. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 122-123. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
{{Wikisource|Author:Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau}}

The work of de Quatrefages ranged over the whole field of [[zoology]] from the [[annelid]]s and other low organisms to the [[Simian|anthropoids]] and man. Of his numerous essays in scientific periodicals, the more important were:
*''Considérations sur les caractères zoologiques des rongeurs'' (1840)
*''De l'organisation des animaux sans vertèbres des Côtes de la Manche'' (Ann. Sc. Nat., 1844)
*''Recherches sur le système nerveux, l'embryognie, les organes des sens, et la circulation des annélides'' (Ibid., 1844–50)
*''Sur les affinités et les analogies des [[Earthworm|lombrics]] et des [[Leech|sangsues]]'' (Ibid.)
*''Sur l'histoire naturelle des tarets'' (Ibid., 1848–49)

Then there is the vast series issued under the general title of ''Etudes sur les types inférieurs de l'embranchement des annelés'', and the results of several scientific expeditions to the Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlands, Italy and [[Sicily]], forming a series of articles in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'', or embodied in the ''Souvenirs d'un naturaliste'' (2 vols., 1854).

These were followed in quick succession by the:
*''Physiologie comparée, métamorphoses de l'homme et des animaux'' (1862)
*''Les Polynésiens et leurs migrations'' (1866)
*''Histoire naturelle des Annelés marins et d'eau douce'' (2 vols., 1866)
*''La Rochelle et ses environs'' (1866)

*''La Race prussienne'' (1871)
*''Crania Ethnica'', jointly with Dr Hamy (2 vols., with 100 plates, 1875–82), a classical work based on French and foreign anthropological data, analogous to the ''Crania'' of [[John Thurnam]] and [[Joseph Barnard Davis]], and to [[Samuel George Morton]]'s ''Crania Americana'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca''.

'''Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross''' (April 2, 1889 – March 30, 1971) was an evangelist and civil rights leader. He was born in Berbice, [[British Guiana]], which is located in [[South America]], on April 2, 1889. He attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and later moved to Canada in 1913. During [[World War I]] Tross moved to the [[United States]] and attended [[Harvard University]]. He earned a Ph.D. in religion at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1918 Tross married Geneva Hopkins. The couple eventually settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] where Tross continued his career as a pastor at several AME  and [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church|AME Zion]] churches in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6k65ns7|title=Tross, J. S. Nathaniel (Joseph Samuel Nathaniel), 1889-1971.|website=socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Tross wrote ''This Thing Called Religion''. A copy of his book is in the rare book collection of J Murrey Atkins Library.

Tross had many jobs. In 1940 he was president of the Community Crusaders, appearing before the Charlotte City Council to lobby for street lights in black neighborhoods. During World War II he was president of the Charlotte Rationing Board. After the war he lobbied for the employment of African Americans as police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/841574207|title=ArchiveGrid : Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross Collection, 1927-1971.|website=beta.worldcat.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945 Tross began a weekly radio broadcast on WBT where he often discussed the idea of interracial goodwill in the community. He was the editor of ''[[The Charlotte Post]]'' an African American newspaper beginning in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rending the Veil|last=Bungarner-Davis|first=Marianne|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1971|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Tross gained his American citizenship. As a result, he ran for a seat on the Charlotte School Board in 1994, 1966 and 1967, although he never won. In 1965 Tross met [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B Johnson]] at the [[White House]] and advised Johnson not to acknowledge protesters sitting in at the White House because speaking would tarnish the dignity of the office of president. This advice created a split in the civil rights movement and created tension between Tross and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Civil Rights Movement|last=Griffin|first=Wille|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1972|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YekTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=joseph+samuel+nathaniel+tross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UYr-wNFnFY&amp;sig=jfmzwtLQs3UE6LObahOCK41yaZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx3Z7tu63QAhUq7IMKHVirBgEQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20samuel%20nathaniel%20tross&amp;f=false|title=Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer|last=Dallam|first=Marie W.|date=2009-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814720370|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 1971, Tross died from a stroke at the age of 82.

'''Lean Government''' refers to the application of [[lean production]] (also known as "Lean") principles and methods to both identify and then implement the most efficient, [[value added]] way to provide government services. Government agencies have found that when Lean is implemented, they see an improved understanding of how their own processes work, that it facilitates the quick identification and implementation of improvements and that it builds a culture of [[continuous improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 2008) and Graham Richard (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean for government focuses on governing and serving citizens with respect and continuously improving service delivery by cutting out "waste" and "inefficiency" in processes; this in turn will result in better services overall, engaged civil servants as well as more [[Value (economics)|value]] for tax-supported programs and services. Generally, proponents also see that a Lean government is a means to expand the capacity of government to provide more services per [[Unit of account|unit]] of [[investment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Miller, [http://www.governing.com/column/promise-going-lean &amp;ldquo; The Promise of Going Lean&amp;rdquo;], ''Governing,'' May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common methods and approaches==
Many Lean manufacturing methods have been successfully adapted to identify non-value added activities (waste) in administrative, transactional, and office processes that are common in government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Carlos | last = Venegas | title = Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements  | publisher= Productivity Press  | year =2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Lean methods include:

* [[Value Stream Mapping]] (VSM) – Value stream mapping refers to the development of a high‐level visual representation of a process flow that is involved in delivering a product or service (called a “value stream”) to customers. VSM events, which are typically 3–4 days, focus on identifying the sources of non‐value added activity and prioritizing possible improvement activities.
* [[Kaizen]] – Kaizen means to change for the good of all and is based on the philosophy of improvement, without regard to its size, type or duration. Kaizen activity is often focused on rapid process improvement events (called kaizen events) that bring together a cross‐functional team for 3‐5 days to study a specific process followed by implementing process changes.
* [[5S (methodology)|5S]] – 5S is the name of a workplace organizational method that uses a list of five Japanese words which, when translated into English, start with the letter S—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.

As more and more government services are delivered electronically, Lean government initiatives are commonly applications of [[Lean IT]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Maria. [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS119892+06-Mar-2009+PRN20090306 &amp;ldquo;The City of Cape Coral Enables Leaner Government with AMX and JD Edwards&amp;rdquo;] ''Reuters''. March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean government approaches typically have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/primer/resources/LeanGovtPrimer.pdf | title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Council of States, Working Smart for Environmental Protection: Improving State Agency Processes with Lean and Six Sigma | publisher= U.S. EPA | work = Publication #EPA-100-R-08-007 | date = March 2008 | pages =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Take a [[customer service]] perspective that seeks to optimize value delivered to the public, the regulated community, and/or other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s;
*Involve employees and external stakeholders in continual improvements and [[problem-solving]] activities;
*Deploy a rapid [[continuous improvement]] framework that emphasizes implementation over prolonged planning;
*Seek to reduce the complexity of processes and the variation in process outputs;
*Use [[performance metrics]] and visual controls to provide rapid feedback to improve real-time [[decision-making]] and problem-solving; and
*Approach improvement activities using [[systems thinking]].

Lean government does not necessarily promote low [[taxes]], only efficient use of those taxes levied. Tax policy is discerned by the [[legislative]] and executive branches of government with oversight of the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Lean government is implemented by the administrative function of government through executive order, legislative mandate, or departmental administrative decisions.  Lean government can be applied in legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

==Types of waste==
Several types of non-value added activity, or waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] in Japanese), are common in government administrative and service processes.  Lean methods focus on identifying and eliminating these wastes.  The list below identifies common administrative process wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/starterkit/index.htm|title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lean in Government Starter Kit: How to Implement Successful Lean Initiatives at Environmental Agencies, Version 2.0|publisher=U.S. EPA Publication # EPA-100-K-09-007, May 2009, p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative process wastes with examples===

* Inventory = Backlog of Work, Excess Materials or Information
* Defects = Data Errors, Missing Info
* Overproduction = Unneeded Reports, Doing Work Not Requested
* Complexity = Unnecessary Process Steps
* Waiting = Unnecessary Approval Cycles
* Excess Motion = Trips to Remote Printer or Files
* Moving Items = Report Routing, File Storage

Wastes in administrative and service processes can relate to:
# collection, use, and management of information
# design and implementation of work processes
# the efficiency and effectiveness with which individuals work.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Venegas, Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements, Productivity Press, 2007, pp. 10-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lean government activity==
Numerous government agencies, such as the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the States of [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]] [[Washington (state)|and Washington]], are using Lean to improve the quality, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and speed of government processes. As in the manufacturing and service sectors, some government agencies are implementing Lean methods in conjunction with [[Six Sigma]] process improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Michael L. George, Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed &amp; Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions, The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a ‘tenacious force for good’|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFrançois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of ‘mental illness’".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packard’s lifetime to be labeled as ‘mad’ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as ‘sane’ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride Köln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Toronto’s Queen Street West “to raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health system” &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 – 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10600">{{planes of existence}}
The '''mental plane''', or '''world of thought''', in [[Hermeticism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]], [[Rosicrucian]], [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindonian]], and [[New Age]] thought refers to the macrocosmic or universal [[Plane (cosmology)|plane]] or [[reality]] that is made up purely of [[thought]] or mindstuff. In contrast to [[Western world|Western]] [[secularism|secular]] [[modernism|modernist]] and [[postmodernism|post-modern]] thought, in [[Occultism|occult]] and [[esoteric cosmology]], thoughts and [[consciousness]] are not just a byproduct of [[brain]] functioning, but have their own [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] reality quite independent of the [[physical plane|physical]]. This reality itself constitutes only one gradation in a whole series of planes of [[existence]] (the total number of planes varies, although seven is a common number in Theosophical formulations). In most such cosmologies and explanations of reality, the mental plane is located between, and hence is intermediate between, the [[astral plane]] below and the higher spiritual realms of existence above.

== Predecessors of the concept ==

In India in the seventh century b.c.e., the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] referred to five levels of self, of which the middle one is the "self made of mind" (''[[mana]]s''). Although the text is describing the nature of the individual rather than the cosmos as a whole, it established the concept of [[mind]] as only one of a series of [[ontology|ontological]] layers of being. The Taittiriyan concept of the five selves would represent an important element of Vedantic ontology, for example the five [[koshas]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]].

Meanwhile in Greece, and coming from a philosophical-mystical rather than a yogic perspective, [[Plato]] spoke of [[Platonic realism|archetypal forms or ideas]] as the original spiritual prototypes behind the physical world. These ideas were not equivalent to mind or thought as such. But they did eventually help inspire [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]] (including [[Philo]]'s) and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] metaphysics in which the ideas exist in the mind of God or the Demiurge, or (according to [[Plotinus]] and hence Neoplatonism) the Divine Mind or ''[[Nous]]''. In the metaphysics of [[Proclus]], the Nous is only one level of [[Hypostasis (Neoplatonism)|hypostasis]], with higher ones like Life, Being, and Unity above it.

== Theosophical and Hermetic interpretations ==

The esoteric conception of the mental plane had to wait till the occult revival of the late 19th century, with the development of modern Theosophical, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic ideas that were to serve as the foundation for the current [[New Age]] movement.

[[H. P. Blavatsky]] taught a cosmology and ontology consisting of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] and seven [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. In her writings she aimed at showing how different spiritual systems share a common source, and therefore refers to Vedantic, Buddhist, Samkhyan, Tantric, Neoplatonic, Ancient Egyptian, Kabbalistic, and Occult systems. She relates the mind with the principle of ''Manas'', and also talks about a kosmic Manasic plane. However, the latter represents a very sublime level of consciousness which can be experienced only by enlightened beings.

In ''The Kabbalah Unveiled'', [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]] divides the [[sephirot]] (apart from the lowest, ''Malkhut'', representing the physical world) of the [[Tree of Life]] into three triads: the Intellectual, Moral, and Astral triads. The Intellectual triad could be compared to the Neoplatonic ideas (Intellect = ''Nous'') and this here represents the highest subdivision.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, [[Max Théon|Max]] and [[Alma Théon]] were producing ''[[Cosmic Tradition|The Tradition]]''. This involved a [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic Kabbalistic]]-inspired cosmology in which the ineffable Godhead emanates a number of sublime worlds, the lowest of which is made up of seven or eight ''States''. The third or fourth lowest State is the Mental or Intellectual, which again corresponds to a very high, spiritual level of consciousness.

== The world of thought in the Western Wisdom Teachings ==

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, immediately beyond the higher regions of the [[astral plane|desire world]] &amp;mdash; which exhibit the marked peculiarity of blending [[Substantial form|form]] and [[sound]] &amp;mdash; and before entering the world of thought (mental plane), there is the "Great Silence", where all the world seems to disappear and the spirit has the feeling of floating in an ocean of intense light: all is one [[Eternity|eternal]] [[Now (time)|now]]. The world of thought is, according to this author, divided into two regions: the "Region of Concrete Thought" (inferior) related to the [[Mental body|mind]] and the "Region of Abstract Thought" (superior) related to the third (lower) aspect of the threefold Ego, the ''Human Spirit'' aspect.

His writings, called ''[[Western Wisdom Teachings]]'', describe that the [[Akashic Records|Memory of Nature]] may be read, in an entirely different manner covering the essence of a whole life, in the highest subdivision of the ''Region of Concrete Thought'' of the ''World of Thought''.

A discipline prevalent in the West is mathematics. The field was strengthened by [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Philosophy]] ([[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]]), which were, alongside ancient Egyptian philosophy, among the oldest non-mythical wisdom paradigms. Math once meant "[[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]" and is still important within [[occultism]], especially topics farther beyond the earthly. Any mathematician who considers the mental plane's [[dimensionality]] equal to or more than the earthly one defines them as "hyperplanes." Classical [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] (other precursors of Heindel) may not have defined those dimensions, but several [[neo-Theosophy|neo-Theosophists]] call the mind 5-dimensional, (i.e. in [[Einstein]]-[[Minkowski]] [[spacetime]]) [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms such as [[nous]] or [[Nous]] (human or divine mind), synonymous (in contexts) with [[logistikon]]/[[logos]] or [[first cause|Protologos]]/[[causeless cause|Logos-Alogos]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelean]] ([[empiricist]], including much/all [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]) acceptance/use of the terms differ. They may reject that [[Causeless cause|Logos Alogos]] causes Protologos or [[Logos|Logoi]] cause/are [[Nous]], or that such or infinite dimensions enumerated in abstract philosophical [[logic]] have any use in semi-abstract/-concrete mathematical logic. However, contemporary philosophers are considering dimensions of [[M-theory]] physics.

== Some current definitions of the mental plane ==

The influence of [[C.W. Leadbeater]]'s work on the New Age movement has been underrated. One of Leadbeater's achievements was to make Blavatsky's difficult cosmology simpler and more understandable; for example by equating each of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] or [[subtle body|vehicles of consciousness]] with a corresponding [[Plane (cosmology)|cosmic plane]]. So there is a physical body that is the vehicle of consciousness on the dense matter of the [[physical plane]]; an [[etheric body]], which is formed by the etheric matter found on subtler counterpart of the physical plane; an [[astral body]] that corresponds to the [[astral plane]]; a [[mental body]] which belongs to the lower mental plane, and a [[causal body]], or vehicle of the individual [[soul]], which is located at the level of the higher mental or [[Causal plane]].

Thus, for Leadbeater and subsequent theosophists, ex-theosophists (e.g. [[Alice Bailey]]) and occultists, the mental plane is a distinct reality or zone of being, more subtle and refined than the Astral, but denser and coarser than the Causal. A detailed account of The Mental Plane and the Mental Body and their associated phenomena, as described by Leadbeater and his co-worker [[Annie Besant]] (who succeeded Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society), can be found in [[Arthur E. Powell]]'s ''The Mental Body''.

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Theon's ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Théon's student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk. 1 ch. 27). The Aurobindonian Mind or mental plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of pure mind or pure thought.

In the law of [[real property]], the '''merger doctrine''' stands for the proposition that the [[contract]] for the conveyance of property merges into the [[deed]] of conveyance; therefore, any guarantees made in the contract that are not reflected in the deed are extinguished when the deed is conveyed to the buyer of the property.

The merger doctrine traditionally applies only to covenants of title; covenants relating to the physical condition of the property (say, a promise that the furnace is in good working order) will not merge, and will not extinguish. The parties may by contract abrogate the doctrine and provide that some or all terms of the contract survive the closing and delivery of the deed.{{citation needed|date = January 2015}}

Merger also refers to the doctrine whereby "a [[fee simple]] estate, once fragmented into present and future interests, can thereafter be reconstituted. 'Merger is the absorption of a lesser estate by a greater estate, and takes place when two distinct estates of greater and lesser rank meet in the same person or class of persons at the same time without any intermediate estate.'
"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Edward, &amp; Julia Forrester|title=Property Law|date=2010|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-08205-7094-5|pages=262–63|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an easement by necessity to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity. The lack of any property interest removes the necessity and the easement.

An '''obscenity''' is any utterance or act that strongly offends the prevalent [[morality]] of the time.&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene Merriam-Webster Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221155/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene |date=10 April 2010 }}, accessed September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Latin ''obscaena'' (offstage) a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek]] root ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]'', because some potentially offensive content, such as [[murder]] or [[sex]], was depicted offstage in classical drama. The word can be used to indicate a strong moral repugnance, in expressions such as "obscene [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s" or "the obscenity of war".  As a legal term, it usually refers to graphic depictions of people engaged in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] and [[Excretion|excretory]] activity.

In the [[United States|United States of America]], issues of obscenity raise issues of limitations on the [[freedom of speech]] and of [[freedom of the press|the press]], which are otherwise protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]].

Federal obscenity law in the U.S. is unusual in that there is no uniform national standard. Former Justice [[Potter Stewart]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in attempting to classify what material constituted exactly "what is obscene," famously wrote, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced ... [b]ut [[I know it when I see it]]...."&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote:
:''The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;''

While most recent (2016) obscenity cases in the United States have revolved around images and films, the first obscenity cases dealt with textual works.

The classification of "obscene" and thus illegal for production and distribution has been judged on printed text-only stories starting with "Dunlop v. U.S., 165 U.S. 486 (1897)", which upheld a conviction for mailing and delivery of a newspaper called the 'Chicago Dispatch,' containing "obscene, lewd, lascivious, and indecent materials", which was later upheld in several cases. One of these was "A Book Named ''John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''" v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, "[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|383 U.S. 413 (1966)]]" wherein the book "[[Fanny Hill]]", written by John Cleland c. 1760, was judged to be obscene in a proceeding that put the book itself on trial rather than its publisher. Another was "Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115 (1973)" whereby the court most famously determined that "Obscene material in book form is not entitled to any First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content."

In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice formed the [[Obscenity Prosecution Task Force]] in a push to prosecute obscenity cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Larry | last = Abramson | title = Federal Government Renews Effort to Curb Porn | date = 27 September 2005 | publisher = NPR | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | work = Morning Edition | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120630022330/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | archivedate = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Barton | last = Gellman | title = Recruits Sought for Porn Squadn | date = 20 September 2005 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | work = The Washington Post | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121020085913/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | archivedate = 20 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Rose Stories, a site dedicated to text-only fantasy stories, became one of many sites targeted by the FBI for shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Red Rose Stories Closed by FBI | date = 7 October 2005 | url = http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | work = XBiz | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425211555/http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | archivedate = 25 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government alleged that Red Rose Stories contained depictions of child rape.

Literature (non-fiction) communicating [[contraceptive]] information was prohibited by several states. The last such prohibition, in Connecticut, was overturned judicially in 1965.

===Key U.S. court cases on obscenity===

*In 1957, two associates of acclaimed poet Allen Ginsberg were arrested and jailed for selling his book "Howl and Other Poems" to undercover police officers at a beatnik bookstore in San Francisco. Eventually the California Supreme Court declared the literature to be of "redeeming social value" and therefore [[Howl#1957 obscenity trial|not classifiable as "obscene"]]. Because the poem "Howl" contains pornographic slang and overt references to drugs and homosexuality, the poem was (and is) frequently censored and confiscated; however, it remains a landmark case.
*'''''[[FCC v. Pacifica]]''''' (1978) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=438&amp;invol=726 (external link)] better known as the landmark "[[seven dirty words]]" case. In that ruling, the Court found that only "repetitive and frequent" use of the words in a time or place when a minor could hear can be punished.
*In '''''[[State v. Henry]]''''' (1987), the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] ruled that the Oregon state law that criminalized obscenity was an unconstitutional restriction of free speech under the free speech provision of the [[Oregon Constitution]], with the ruling making Oregon the "first state in the nation to abolish the offense of obscenity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|title=Wisconsin high court could strike down obscenity law|author=Hudson, David|publisher=[[First Amendment Center]]|date=1998-10-28|accessdate=2011-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104093910/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|archivedate=4 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In '''''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union|Reno v. ACLU]]''''' (1997), the Supreme Court struck down indecency laws applying to the Internet.
*In '''''[[Miller v. California]]''''' (1973) - the currently-binding Supreme Court precedent on the issue - the Court ruled materials were obscene if they appealed, "to a prurient interest", showed "[[patently offensive]] sexual conduct" that was specifically defined by a state obscenity law, and "lacked serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value." Decisions regarding whether material was obscene should be based on local, not national, standards.

Standards superseded by the [[Miller Test]] include:
* ''Wepplo'' (1947): If material has a substantial tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting [[lascivious]] thoughts or arousing lustful desires. (People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App.2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853).
* ''[[Hicklin test]]'' (1868): the effect of isolated passages upon the most susceptible persons. (British common law, cited in Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. LR 3 QB 360 - overturned when Michigan tried to outlaw all printed matter that would 'corrupt the morals of youth' in Butler v. State of Michigan 352 U.S. 380 (1957))
* ''[[Roth Standard]]'' (1957): "Whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". [[Roth v. United States]] 354 U.S. 476 (1957) - overturned by Miller
* ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio|Roth-Jacobellis]]'' (1964): "community standards" applicable to an obscenity are national, not local standards. Material is "utterly without redeeming social importance". Jacobellis v. Ohio 378 US 184 (1964) - famous quote: "I shall not today attempt further to define ''[hardcore pornography]'' ...But I know it when I see it."
* ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|Roth-Jacobellis-Memoirs Test]]'' (1966): Adds that the material possesses "not a modicum of social value". (A Book Named ''John Cleland's [[Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]]'' v. Attorney General of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966))

[[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules and federal law govern obscenity in broadcast media. Many historically important works have been described as obscene or prosecuted under obscenity laws, including the works of [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]].

===Criticism===

Obscenity law has been criticized in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2005obscenity/75-82.pdf Huston, William: "Under Color of Law, Obscenity vs. the First Amendment", ''Nexus Journal'', Vol 10 (2005): 75:82.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Federal law forbids obscenity in certain contexts (such as broadcast);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=9 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the law does not define the term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* The U.S. Supreme Court similarly has had difficulty defining the term. In ''[[Miller v. California]]'', the court defers definition to two hypothetical entities, "contemporary community standards" and "hypothetical reasonable persons".
* The courts and the legislature have had similar problems defining this term because it is paradoxical, and thus impossible to define.
* Because the term "obscenity" is not defined by either the statutes or the case law, this law does not satisfy the [[Vagueness doctrine]], which states that people must clearly be informed as to the prohibited behavior.
* Because the determination of what is obscene (offensive) is ultimately a personal preference, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require a right).
* Because no actual injury occurs when a mere preference is violated, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require an injury).

Obscenity laws remain enforceable under Miller despite these criticisms.  Some states have passed laws mandating censorship in schools, universities, and libraries even if they are not receiving [[Children's Internet Protection Act|government aid that would require censorship in these institutions]]. These include Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Twenty more states were considering such legislation in 2001–2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |title=Technology and Liberty &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015042228/http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |archivedate=15 October 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'', {{ussc|458|747|1982}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that child pornography need not be legally obscene in order to be outlawed. The Court ruled that in contrast to the types of images considered in ''Miller'', images that depicted underlying harm to children need not appeal to "the prurient interest of the average person," portray sexual conduct in "a patently offensive manner," nor be considered holistically, in order to be proscribed. Another difference between U.S. constitutional law concerning obscenity and that governing child pornography is that the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Stanley v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|394|557|1969}}, that possession of obscene material could not be criminalized, while in ''[[Osborne v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|495|103|1990}}, the high court ruled that possession of child pornography could be criminalized. The reason was that the motive for criminalizing child pornography possession was "to destroy a market for the exploitative use of children" rather than to prevent the material from poisoning the minds of its viewers.&lt;!--quote source?--&gt; The three dissenting justices in that case argued, "While the sexual exploitation of children is undoubtedly a serious problem, Ohio may employ other weapons to combat it."&lt;!--quote source?--&gt;

===Censorship in film===
{{main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
This is most notably shown with the "X" rating under which some films are categorized. The most notable films given an "X" rating were ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973). These films show explicit, non-simulated, penetrative sex that was presented as part of a reasonable plot with respectable production values. Some state authorities issued injunctions against such films to protect "local community standards"; in New York, the print of ''Deep Throat'' was seized mid-run, and the film's exhibitors were found guilty of promoting obscenity.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |title=Sex and violence - Censorship - actor, film, movie, show, cinema, scene |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185451/http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', films that include gay sex (even if implied) or female pleasure have been more harshly censored than their heterosexual, male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=This Film Is Not Yet Rated | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) issues [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|ratings]] for motion pictures exhibited and distributed commercially to the public in the United States; the ratings are issued through the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA). The intent of the rating system is to provide information about the content of motion pictures so parents can determine whether an individual motion picture is suitable for viewing by their children.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Obscene Publications Acts]] sets the criteria for what material is allowed to be publicly accessed and distributed.

[[Stanley Kauffmann]]'s novel ''The Philanderer'' was published by Penguin Books in 1957 and was unsuccessfully prosecuted for obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, S. (1957) ''The Philanderer''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books "When first published in 1954, this book was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscene libel. Mr. Justice Stable's historic summing-up on that occasion is included as an appendix."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex crime has generated particular concern. In 1976 the BBFC claimed that, in that year, it had viewed 58 films depicting "explicit rape", declaring scenes that glorified it as "obscene". As opposed to questions of "indecency", which have been applied to sexual explicitness, films charged with being obscene have been viewed as having "a tendency to deprave and corrupt" and been liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

Obscenity law in [[England and Wales]] is currently governed by the [[Obscene Publications Act]], but obscenity law goes back much further into the English [[common law]]. The conviction in 1727 of [[Edmund Curll]] for the publication of ''[[The Nun in her Smock|Venus in the Cloister or the Nun in her Smock]]'' under the common law offence of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] appears to be the first conviction for obscenity in the United Kingdom, and set a [[legal precedent]] for other convictions. These common law ideas of obscenity formed the original basis of obscenity law in other common law countries, such as the United States.

For visual works of art the main obscenity law in England and Wales was, until the 1960s, the [[Vagrancy Act 1838]] which was successfully used in prosecutions against D.H. Lawrence for an exhibition of his paintings at the Warren Gallery, London, in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;See T.W. Earp, 'The Paintings of DH Lawrence' in ''The New Statesman'' (London newspaper), 17 August 1929, p.578&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1966 against the British artist [[Stass Paraskos Obscenity Trial 1966|Stass Paraskos]] for an exhibition of his paintings held that year in the northern English city of [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Lynton, Stass Paraskos (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2003) 7f&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Act were repealed shortly after the Paraskos trial and it has rarely been used since in relation to visual art.

The Obscene Publications act is notoriously vague, defining obscenity as material likely to "deprave and corrupt". The 1959 act was passed just as most [[Western world|Western]] countries were about to enter a new phase of [[sexual freedom]]. The trial of [[Penguin Books]] over [[Lady Chatterley's Lover]] in 1960 failed to secure a conviction and the conviction in the 1971 trial of [[Oz (magazine)|Oz magazine]] was overturned on appeal. An attempt to prosecute the [[University of Central England]] in 1997 over a copy of a library book by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] was abandoned amidst derision from [[academics]] and [[News media|the media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=After a year out on loan Mapplethorpe book is set to return to library shelves|accessdate=6 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823022442/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s most Western countries legalised [[hardcore pornography]]. By the 1980s the UK was almost the only [[liberal democracy]] where the sale of hardcore pornography was still completely illegal, although ownership was not a criminal offence (except [[child pornography]]). Home [[videotape]] was a booming market and it was relatively simple for individuals to [[smuggling|smuggle]] hardcore material in from [[Europe]] or the United States, where it had been purchased legally, either for personal use or to copy it for distribution. This resulted in a considerable [[black market]] of poor quality videotapes. Meanwhile, people attempting to buy pornography legally would often be stuck with heavily censored [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] material.

While the authorities did their best to stay on top of illegal pornography they found that [[jury|juries]], while not particularly liking the material, were reluctant to convict defendants where the material was intended for private use among consenting adults. During the 1990s the advent of the [[internet]] made it easier than ever before for British citizens to access hardcore material. Finally, in 2000, following the dismissal of a test case brought by the [[BBFC]], hardcore pornography was effectively legalised, subject to certain conditions and licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |title=FAQ: Buying Adult Films: Is it legal? |publisher=Melonfarmers.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808192607/http://melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still an offence to sell obscene material by [[mail order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; High Court blocks web porn sales |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620115419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1984 videotape sellers were more likely to be prosecuted under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]] rather than the OPA. The VRA requires that all videos must have a certificate from the BBFC. If the BBFC refuses a certificate a video is effectively banned for home viewing, but not necessarily in the [[Movie theater|cinema]]. Four films that were originally refused a certificate, [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]], [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]], [[The Evil Dead]] and [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]] were granted a certificate in the late 1990s and have subsequently been screened on mainstream [[television]].

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, screening of ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) was only cleared in 1986. However, the film has not been screened because the only cinema that has tried to organize a screening was thwarted by the city council that owned the building's lease.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

Section 163 of the Canadian Criminal Code provides the country's legal definition of "obscenity". Officially termed as

The current law states

163. (1) Every one commits an offense who

:(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever; or

:(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purposes of publication, distribution or circulation a crime comic.

"Crime comics" are stated to be books that glorify criminal activities and have at least one depiction of such criminal actions of the book's text.

The [[Canada Border Services Agency]] seizes items it labels obscene.

In 1993, Canadian police arrested the 19-year-old writer of a fictional sex story "The Forestwood Kids"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|title=Child-less Pornography|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310121053/http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the case was dismissed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/court/R.v.Pecciarich.html|title=Regina v.

Ever since 1940, in the Title VI of the Penal Code, naming crimes against sexual dignity (until 2009 crimes against social conventions), the fourth chapter is dedicated to a crime named "public outrage related to modesty" ({{lang-pt|ultraje público ao pudor}}, {{IPA-pt|uwˈtɾaʒi ˈpublikw aw puˈdoʁ|pron}}).

It is composed of two articles, Art. 233 "Obscene Act", "to practice an obscene act in a public place, or open or exposed to the public", punished with arrest of 3 months to 1 year or a fine; and Art. 234 "Obscene Written Piece or Object", to do, import, export, purchase or have in one's property, to ends of trade, distribution or public display, any written, drew, painted, stamped or object piece of obscenity, punished with arrest of 6 months to 1 years or a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm DJi -233 a 234- DL-002.848-1940 - Còdigo Penal - Ultraje Público ao Pudor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918053011/http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm |date=18 September 2013 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They do not attack anyone's sexual dignity, instead causing outrage at best, but generally just slight discomfort or embarrassment, that can be easily avoided through not looking to such a scene.
* The Art. 234 is aside obsolete, unconstitutional, for the 1988 post-military dictatorship Constitution having in its Fifth Chapter: "[the people] are free to the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific and communicative activity, independently of censorship and license", reason to which, instead of making it suffer penal restriction, gives any distribution of media the right to be fully exerted.
* The flourishing internet culture of Brazil, where such media is freely shared, as well as its pornographic industry and shops catered to the interests of enhancing apparatus to masturbatory and sexual activity.

It is often used against people who expose their nude bodies in public environments that were not warranted a license to cater to the demographic interested in such practice (the first such place was the Praia do Abricó in Rio de Janeiro, in 1994), even if no sexual action took place, and it may include for example a double standard for the chest area of women and men in which only women are penalized. Such a thing took place in FEMEN protests in São Paulo, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://direito.folha.uol.com.br/1/category/ato%20obsceno/1.html Category: Ato Obsceno - Para Entender Direito - Folha Uol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027063340/http://direito.folha.uol.com.br/1/category/ato%20obsceno/1.html |date=27 October 2013 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
Various countries have different standings on the types of materials that they as legal bodies permit their citizens to have access to and disseminate among their local populations. The set of these countries' permissible content vary widely accordingly with some having extreme punishment up to and including execution for members who violate their restrictions, as in the case of Iran where the current laws against pornography now include death sentences for those convicted of producing pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Saeed Kamali Dehghan (18 January 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer "Iran confirms death sentence for 'porn site' web programmer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152548/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer |date=4 September 2017 }} ''The Guardian''.

In India the Obscenity law is the same as had been framed by the British Government. Charges of obscenity have been levelled against various writers and poets till date; the law has not yet been revised. The famous trials relate to the [[Hungryalists]] who were arrested and prosecuted in the 1960s.

A '''peroneal strike''' is a temporarily disabling [[strike (attack)|blow]] to the [[common peroneal nerve]] of the leg, just above the [[knee]]. The attacker aims roughly a [[hand]] span above the exterior side of the knee, towards the back of the leg. This causes a temporary loss of [[motor control]] of the leg, accompanied by [[numbness|numbness and a painful tingling sensation]] from the point of impact all the way down the leg, usually lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes in duration.

The strike is commonly made with the knee, a [[Club (weapon)|baton]], or [[shin kick]], but can be done by anything forcefully impacting the nerve. The technique is a part of the [[pressure point]] control tactics used in [[martial art]]s and by [[law enforcement agent]]s.

This strike is similar to and utilizes the same nerve as the childhood [[prank]] of "dead-legging" someone. Repeated strong peroneal strikes can cause nerve damage and have a high chance of damaging the surrounding tissues due to the spontaneous nature of the technique and the nerve location.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion. Pressure Point Control Tactics/Training (PPCT) which is "Legally and medically acceptable" and deemed safe uses this nerve motor point.|date=August 2011}}

The peroneal strike was used against [[detainee]]s during the 2002 [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Ahmed. ''Descent into Chaos: The U.S. and the Disaster in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia''. 2008. New York: Viking Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as '''Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments''', and have called them frivolous and vexatious.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v.

Common among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include [[freemen on the land]] and the [[sovereign citizen movement]]. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]].

Also under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the [[redemption movement]] believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim money from this fund. See [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the "legal name fraud" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a [[personal name]] and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalgleish|first1=Katherine|title=Guns, border guards, and the Magna Carta: the Freemen-on-the-Land are back in Alberta courts|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=018e9df4-b9fe-4c88-9db9-d784f423348c|website=lexology.com|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=The mystery of the 'legal name fraud' billboards|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36499750|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name.

The term '''rational animal''' ([[Latin]]: ''animal rationale'' or ''animal rationabile'') refers to a classical definition of humanity or [[human nature]], associated with [[Aristotelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognition-animal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

While the Latin term itself originates in [[scholasticism]], it reflects the Aristotelian view of man as a creature distinguished by a rational principle.  In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' I.13, Aristotle states that the human being has a rational principle ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: λόγον ἔχον), on top of the nutritive life shared with plants, and the instinctual life shared with other animals, i. e., the ability to carry out rationally formulated [[Praxis (process)|projects]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 75 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;.  That capacity for deliberative imagination was equally singled out as man's defining feature in ''[[De anima]]'' III.11.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Stigum, ''Econometrics and the Philosophy of Economics'' (2003) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; While seen by Aristotle as a universal human feature, the definition applied to wise and foolish alike, and did not in any way imply necessarily the ''making'' of rational choices, as opposed to the ''ability'' to make them.&lt;ref&gt;Stigum, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] defined man as a "mortal rational animal", and also considered animals to have a (lesser) rationality of their own.&lt;ref&gt;L. Johnson, ''Power Knowledge Animals'' (2012) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of man as a rational animal was common in [[scholastical philosophy]].&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|inline=1|wstitle=Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] states that this definition means that "in the system of classification and definition shown in the [[Arbor Porphyriana]], man is a [[Substance (philosophy)|substance]], [[Matter|corporeal]], [[life|living]], [[sentient]], and [[Rationality|rational]]".&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt;


In Meditation II of ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[Descartes]] arrives at his famous [[cogito ergo sum|"I think, I exist"]] claim. He then goes on to wonder "What am I?" He considers and rejects the scholastic concept of the "rational animal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shall I say 'a rational animal'? No; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, what rationality is, and in this one question would lead me down the slope to other harder ones.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes Volume II''. Translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, Dugald Murdoch. Cambridge University Press. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern use==

[[Freud]] was as aware as any of the irrational forces at work in humankind, but he nevertheless resisted what he called too much “stress on the weakness of the ego in relation to the id and of our rational elements in the face of the daemonic forces within us”.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Kantian philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]], in his work ''An Essay on Man'' (1944), altered Aristotle definition to label man as a ''[[symbolic animal]]''. This definition has been influential in the field of [[philosophical anthropology]], where it has been reprised by [[Gilbert Durand]], and has been echoed in the [[naturalist]] description of man as the compulsive communicator.&lt;ref&gt;D. Attenborough, ''Life on Earth'' (1992) Ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists in the tradition of [[Max Weber]] distinguish rational behavior (means-end oriented) from irrational, emotional or confused behavior, as well as from traditional-oriented behavior, but recognise the wide role of all the latter types in human life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Schutz]], ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnomethodology]] sees rational human behavior as representing perhaps 1/10 of the human condition, dependent on the 9/10ths of background assumptions which provide the frame for means-end decision making.&lt;ref&gt;A. Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'' (1974) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] satirized the concept that man is rational, saying "Man is a rational animal — so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life I have been looked diligently for evidence in favour of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell'' (2009), p. 45&lt;!--please give the original reference to Russell himself--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The humor of his observation derives from an equivocation between describing mankind as rational (i.e., that all members of the species has the potential to think, whether that potential is realized or not) and describing an individual person as rational (i.e., the person actually can think well, avoid biases, make valid inferences, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9452">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a '''semiautomaton''' is a [[deterministic finite automaton]] having inputs but no output. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Q'' of [[state (computer science)|states]], a set Σ called the input alphabet, and a function ''T'': ''Q'' × Σ → ''Q'' called the transition function.

Associated with any semiautomaton is a [[monoid]] called the '''characteristic monoid''', '''input monoid''', '''transition monoid''' or '''transition system''' of the semiautomaton, which [[monoid action|acts]] on the set of states ''Q''. This may be viewed either as an action of the [[free monoid]] of [[string (computer science)|strings]] in the input alphabet Σ, or as the induced [[transformation semigroup]] of ''Q''.

In older books like Clifford and Preston (1967) [[Semigroup action#Formal definitions|S-acts]] are called "operands".

In [[category theory]], semiautomata essentially are [[functor]]s.

==Transformation semigroups and monoid acts==

: {{main|semigroup action}}

A '''transformation semigroup''' or '''transformation monoid''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(M,Q)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Q'' (often called the "set of [[state (computer science)|states]]") and a [[semigroup]] or [[monoid]] ''M'' of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or "transformations", mapping ''Q'' to itself. They are functions in the sense that every element ''m'' of ''M'' is a map &lt;math&gt;m\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt;. If ''s'' and ''t'' are two functions of the transformation semigroup, their semigroup product is defined as their [[function composition]] &lt;math&gt;(st)(q)=(s\circ t)(q)=s(t(q))&lt;/math&gt;.

Some authors regard "semigroup" and "monoid" as synonyms. Here a semigroup need not have an [[identity element]]; a monoid is a semigroup with an identity element (also called "unit"). Since the notion of functions acting on a set always includes the notion of an identity function, which when applied to the set does nothing, a transformation semigroup can be made into a monoid by adding the identity function.

===''M''-acts===

Let ''M'' be a [[monoid]] and ''Q'' be a non-empty set. If there exists a multiplicative operation

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\colon Q\times M \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(q,m)\mapsto qm=\mu(q,m)&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the properties

:&lt;math&gt;q1=q&lt;/math&gt;

for 1 the unit of the monoid, and 
:&lt;math&gt;q(st)=(qs)t&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;q\in Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s,t\in M&lt;/math&gt;, then the triple &lt;math&gt;(Q,M,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''right ''M''-act''' or simply a '''right act'''. In long-hand, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the ''right multiplication of elements of Q by elements of M''. The right act is often written as &lt;math&gt;Q_M&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''left act''' is defined similarly, with

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\colon M\times Q \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(m,q)\mapsto mq=\mu(m,q)&lt;/math&gt;

and is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;\,_MQ&lt;/math&gt;.

An ''M''-act is closely related to a transformation monoid. However the elements of ''M'' need not be functions ''per se'', they are just elements of some monoid. Therefore, one must demand that the action of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be consistent with multiplication in the monoid (''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mu(q, st)=\mu(\mu(q,s),t)&lt;/math&gt;), as, in general, this might not hold for some arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, in the way that it does for function composition.

Once one makes this demand, it is completely safe to drop all parenthesis, as the monoid product and the action of the monoid on the set are completely [[associative]].  In particular, this allows elements of the monoid to be represented as [[String (computer science)|strings]] of letters, in the computer-science sense of the word "string". This abstraction then allows one to talk about [[string operation]]s in general, and eventually leads to the concept of [[formal languages]] as being composed of strings of letters.

Another difference between an ''M''-act and a transformation monoid is that for an ''M''-act ''Q'', two distinct elements of the monoid may determine the same transformation of ''Q''. If we demand that this does not happen, then an ''M''-act is essentially the same as a transformation monoid.

===M-homomorphism===

For two ''M''-acts &lt;math&gt;Q_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_M&lt;/math&gt; sharing the same monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, an '''''M''-homomorphism''' &lt;math&gt;f\colon Q_M\to B_M&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon Q \to B &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(qm)=f(q)m&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;q\in Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all ''M''-homomorphisms is commonly written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(Q_M, B_M)&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_M(Q, B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''M''-acts and ''M''-homomorphisms together form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] called '''''M''-Act'''.

==Semiautomata==

A '''semiautomaton''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set, called the ''input alphabet'', ''Q'' is a non-empty set, called the ''set of states'', and ''T'' is the ''transition function''

:&lt;math&gt;T\colon Q\times \Sigma \to Q.&lt;/math&gt;

When the set of states ''Q'' is a finite set—it need not be—, a semiautomaton may be thought of as a [[deterministic finite automaton]] &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T,q_0,A)&lt;/math&gt;, but without the initial state &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; or set of [[accept state]]s ''A''. Alternately, it is a [[finite state machine]] which has no output, and only an input.

Any semiautomaton induces an act of a monoid in the following way.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the [[free monoid]] generated by the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (so that the superscript * is understood to be the [[Kleene star]]); it is the set of all finite-length [[string (computer science)|strings]] composed of the letters in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

For every word ''w'' in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;T_w\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; be the function, defined recursively, as follows, for all ''q'' in ''Q'':

* If &lt;math&gt;w=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon(q)=q&lt;/math&gt;, so that the [[empty word]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; does not change the state.
* If &lt;math&gt;w=\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a letter in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma(q)=T(q,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;w=\sigma v&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_w(q)=T_v(T_\sigma(q))&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; be the set

:&lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)=\{T_w \vert w\in\Sigma^* \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[function composition]]; that is, for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;T_w\circ T_v=T_{vw}&lt;/math&gt;. It also contains &lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[identity function]] on ''Q''. Since function composition is [[associative]], the set &lt;math&gt;M(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid: it is called the '''input monoid''', '''characteristic monoid''', '''characteristic semigroup''' or '''transition monoid''' of the semiautomaton &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Sigma,T)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

If the set of states ''Q'' is finite, then the transition functions are commonly represented as [[state transition table]]s.  The construction of all possible transitions driven by strings in the free group has a graphical depiction as [[de Bruijn graph]]s.{{clarify|reason=(1) No 'free group' was mentioned before; probably, the free monoid of all strings is meant instead? (2) The construction of transitions appears to be a process, so how can it have a 'depiction as ... graphs'?|date=April 2014}}

The set of states ''Q'' need not be finite, or even countable. As an example, semiautomata underpin the concept of [[quantum finite automata]]. There, the set of states ''Q'' are given by the [[complex projective space]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;, and individual states are referred to as ''n''-state [[qubit]]s. State transitions are given by [[unitary matrix|unitary ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrices]].  The input alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; remains finite, and other typical concerns of automata theory remain in play.  Thus, the '''quantum semiautomaton''' may be simply defined as the triple &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{C}P^n,\Sigma,\{U_{\sigma_1},U_{\sigma_2},\dotsc,U_{\sigma_p},\})&lt;/math&gt; when the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; has ''p'' letters, so that there is one unitary matrix &lt;math&gt;U_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for each letter &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Stated in this way, the quantum semiautomaton has many geometrical generalizations. Thus, for example, one may take a [[Riemannian symmetric space]] in place of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;, and selections from its group of isometries as transition functions.

The [[syntactic monoid]] of a [[formal language]] is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the transition monoid of the [[minimal automaton]] accepting the language.

'''Social comparison bias''' is having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen physically, or mentally better than yourself.

==Introduction==
A majority of people in [[society]] base their moods and feelings on how well they are doing compared to other people in their environment.  Social comparison bias happens in everyday society regularly.  Social comparison bias can be defined as having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen as physically or mentally better than yourself.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97–101}}  This can be compared to [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], which is believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of [[injustice]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[jealousy]] and people's willingness to remain in relationships or jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Buunk &amp; Gibbons 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suls &amp; Wheeler 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  People often compete to get the best grades, the best jobs and the best houses.  In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.  For example, you might make a comparison if you shop at low-end department stores and a peer shops at the designer stores, and you are overcome with feelings of [[resentment]], [[anger]] and [[envy]] with that peer.  This social comparison bias involves [[wealth]] and [[social status]].  Some of us make social comparisons,{{Who|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- 1/6 of the world population is hungry! --&gt; but are largely unaware of them.{{Sfn|Smith|Leach|2004|pp=297–308}}  In most cases, we try to compare ourselves to those in our [[peer group]] or with whom we are similar.{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569–575}}

==Research==
There are many studies revolving around social comparison and the effects it has on [[mental health]].  One study involved the relationship between depression and [[social comparison]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  Thwaites and Dagnan, in "Moderating variables in the relationship between social comparison and depression", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework.  Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out.  This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people.  What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a [[self-esteem]] test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989.  The test consisted of 10-point [[Likert scale]] ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. [[intelligence]], [[social skills]], [[Humour|sense of humor]]).  "Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions.  Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people."{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  They concluded that social comparison did have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected.  More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison.

==Cognitive effects==
One major symptom that can occur with social comparison bias is the mental disorder of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].  Depression is typically diagnosed during a clinical encounter using the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] volume IV (DSM-IV) criteria.  Symptoms include depressed mood, [[hope]]lessness, and [[Sleep disorder|sleep difficulties]], including both [[hypersomnia]] and [[insomnia]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  Clinical depression can be caused by many factors in a person's life.  Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias.{{Sfn|Pyszczynski|Greenberg|1987|pp=122–138}}  Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.  It is caused by the brain because of the [[hippocampus]] decreasing in size and the lowering levels of [[serotonin]] that circulates through the brain.{{Sfn|Nolen-Hoeksema|Morrow|1993|pp=561–570}}  Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is [[suicide ideation]].  "Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about [[suicide]] and suicide attempts.  Suicide is the taking of one's own life."{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569–575}}  Suicide ideation can occur due to social comparison bias because people that compare themselves to people that are seen better than themselves get mentally discouraged because they believe they can not perform or look a certain way which causes low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem is one of the main factors in suicide ideation.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97–101}}

==In the media==
[[Mainstream media]] is also a main contributor to social comparisons.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73–81}} Everywhere one goes, advertisements try to portray to the public what [[beauty]] should be. Magazines, commercials and billboards all show what beauty is supposed to look like. When a growing generation of youth and adults see this, they socially compare themselves to the advertisements they see all around them.&lt;ref name="Wood 1989"&gt;Wood V. J. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; When they do not look a certain way or weigh a certain amount, society puts them down for it. This can cause low self-esteem and an onset of depression because they do not fit the mold of what beauty is seen to be.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73–81}} People get criticized when they do not look like the models in the magazine or on TV. Socially comparing oneself to the people in the media can have negative effects and cause mental anxiety, stress, negative body image and eating disorders.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}} With media being such an important part of our generation, having low self-esteems and negative self-images of ourselves effects society with tragic incidents including suicide and [[self-harm]].  Social comparison to others whether on TV and magazines can cause people to lose confidence in themselves and stress over trying to be perfect and be what society expects them to be.  In an experiment that studied women's body image after comparing themselves to different types of models, body image was significantly more negative after viewing thin media images than after viewing images of either average-size models, or plus-size models.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}} [[Mass media|Media]] is one of the leading causes for bad body image among youth and adults because of social comparison.{{Sfn|Menon|Kyung|Agrawal|2008|pp=39–52}}

===Through social media===
[[Social media]] being a main source of news and breaking new stories, people can connect to people from all over the world and learn in new ways.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}}  It is easier to see people's private life on a public network.  This being said, social networks such as [[Facebook]] makes viewing someone's daily life as simple as sending a request.  Society is exposed to everyone's lives and people are starting to compare themselves with their friends that they have on Facebook.  It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539–547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. February 2012, 15(2): 117-121. doi:10.1089/cyber.2011.0324.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social comparison bias in the classroom==
Social comparisons are also very important in the school system.  Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competitiveness|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.&lt;ref name="Möoller 2006"&gt;Möoller 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.&lt;ref name="Möoller 2006" /&gt;  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.&lt;ref name="Wood 1989" /&gt;  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.

==Conclusion==
{{POV section|date=June 2016}}
Social comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.  It can be negative to one's mental health due to the increasing risks of depression, suicide ideation and other mental disorders.{{Sfn|Kendler|1995|pp=5–9}}  Social comparison in this generation is everywhere and society revolves around comparing ourselves to each other if it is to have a higher self-esteem or to try and better themselves as a whole.  With social comparison being so important, it will lead to social comparison bias and cause negative effects in a person's life.  With the research found, the hypothesis was proven correct stating that depression does have a relationship with the social comparison that people in society participate in.

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ISO/IEC 14764:2006 international standard has kept the basic four categories.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which enrich the description of the many evolution activities.

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''temporal theory''' of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] states that human perception of sound depends on [[Time|temporal]] patterns with which [[neurons]] respond to [[sound]] in the [[cochlea]]. Therefore, in this theory, the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a [[pure tone]] is determined by the period of neuron firing patterns—either of single neurons, or groups as described by the [[volley theory]]. Temporal or '''timing theory''' competes with the [[place theory (hearing)|place theory]] of hearing, which instead states that pitch is signaled according to the locations of vibrations along the [[basilar membrane]].

Temporal theory was first suggested by [[August Seebeck]].

==Description==

As the basilar membrane vibrates, each clump of [[hair cell]]s along its length is deflected in time with the sound components as filtered by [[basilar membrane]] tuning for its position. The more intense this vibration is, the more the hair cells are deflected and the more likely they are to cause [[cochlear nerve]] firings. Temporal theory supposes that the consistent timing patterns, whether at high or low average firing rate, code for a consistent pitch percept.

==High amplitudes==

At high sounds levels, [[nerve fiber]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s whose characteristic frequencies do not exactly match the stimulus still respond, because of the motion induced in larger areas of the basilar membrane by loud sounds. Temporal theory can help explain how we maintain this discrimination. Even when a larger group of nerve fibers are all firing, there is a periodicity to this firing, which corresponds to the periodicity of the stimulus.

==High frequencies==

Neurons have a maximum firing frequency within the range of frequencies we can hear. To be complete, rate theory must somehow explain how we distinguish pitches above this maximum firing rate. The [[volley theory]], in which groups of neurons cooperate to code the temporal pattern, is an attempt to make the temporal theory more complete, but some frequencies are too high to see any synchrony in the [[cochlear nerve]] firings.

===The random firing solution===

Beament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Beament | title = How We Hear Music | publisher = The Boydell Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-85115-813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a potential solution. He noted that in two classic studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nelson Y. S. Kiang | title = Discharge Patterns of Single Auditory Fibers | publisher = MIT Research Monograph 35 | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. J. Rose |author2=J. Hind |author3=D. Anderson |author4=J. Brugge  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Response of Auditory Fibers in the Squirrel Monkey | journal = J. Neurophysiol. | volume = 30 | year = 1967 | pages = 769–793 | pmid = 4962851 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual hair cell neurons did not always fire at the first moment they were able to. Though they would fire in time with the vibrations, the neurons would not fire on every vibration. The number of skipped vibrations was seemingly random. The gaps in the resulting train of neural impulses would then all be integer multiples of the period of vibration. For example, a pure tone of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz has a period of 10 ms. The corresponding train of impulses would contain gaps of 10 ms, 20 ms, 30 ms, 40 ms, etc. Such a group of gaps can only be generated by a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tone. The set of gaps for a sound above the maximum neural firing rate would be similar except it would be missing some of the initial gaps, however it would still uniquely correspond to the frequency. The pitch of a pure tone could then be seen as corresponding to the difference between adjacent gaps.

===Another solution===

Modern research suggests that the perception of pitch depends on both the places and patterns of neuron firings. [[Place theory (hearing)|Place theory]] may be dominant for higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Pitch Perception Models | author = Alain de Cheveigné | title = Pitch |editor1=Christopher J. Plack |editor2=Andrew J. Oxenham |editor3=Richard R. Fay |editor4=Arthur N. Popper | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-387-23472-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n6VdlK3AQykC&amp;pg=PT214&amp;dq=place+pitch++volley+theory++believed }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also suggested that place theory may be dominant for low, resolved frequency harmonics,
and that t[[Temporal theory|emporal theory]] may be dominant for high, unresolved frequency harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackleton|first1=Trevor M.|last2=Carlyon|first2=Robert|title=The role of resolved and unresolved harmonics in pitch perception and frequency modulation discrimination|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=1994|volume=95|issue=6|pages=3529|doi=10.1121/1.409970|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/95/6/10.1121/1.409970|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments to distinguish rate and place effects on pitch perception==

Experiments to distinguish between place theory and rate theory using subjects with normal hearing are difficult to devise, because of the strong correlation between rate and place: large vibrations at a low rate are produced at the apical end of the [[basilar membrane]] while large vibrations at a high rate are produced at the basal end. The two stimulus parameters can, however, be controlled independently using [[cochlear implant]]s: pulses with a range of rates can be applied via different pairs of electrodes distributed along the membrane and subjects can be asked to rate a stimulus on a pitch scale.

Experiments using implant recipients (who had previously had normal hearing) showed that, at stimulation rates below about 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, ratings on a pitch scale were proportional to the [[Logarithm|log]] of stimulation rate, but also decreased with distance from the round window. At higher rates, the effect of rate became weaker, but the effect of place was still strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fearn R, Carter P, Wolfe J |title=The perception of pitch by users of cochlear implants: possible significance for rate and place theories of pitch |journal=Acoustics Australia |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=41–43 |year=1999 | url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/Fearnetal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">In [[mathematics]], the '''tensor representations''' of the [[general linear group]] are those that are obtained by taking finitely many [[tensor product]]s of the fundamental representation and its dual.  The irreducible factors of such a representation are also called tensor representations, and can be obtained by applying [[Schur functor]]s (associated to [[Young tableaux]]).  These coincide with the [[rational representation]]s of the general linear group.

More generally, a [[matrix group]] is any subgroup of the general linear group.  A tensor representation of a matrix group is any representation that is contained in a tensor representation of the general linear group.  For example, the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') admits a tensor representation on the space of all trace-free symmetric tensors of order two.  For orthogonal groups, the tensor representations are contrasted with the [[spin representation]]s.

The [[classical group]]s, like the [[symplectic group]], have the property that all finite-dimensional representations are tensor representations (by [[Weyl's construction]]), while other representations (like the [[metaplectic representation]]) exist in infinite dimensions.

'''The [[Gay Straight Alliance]] [[Bermuda]] (GSA Bermuda)''' is a support and advocacy group for persons in the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[queer]]/[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] [[LGBT community]]. It was founded by Jordan Ess in 2013. Jordan Ess is a [[Hedge Fund]] Trader, [[Consultant]], [[lobbying]] professional and [[Human Rights]]. The group was founded to address the needs of the [[LGBTQ community]] in the Island of [[Bermuda]] but it also engages in advocacy activities in persons in the [[LGBTQ community]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsabermuda.org/gsabermuda|title=GSA Bermuda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2010/03/11/iran-or318-memorial-to-blogger-death-in-priso/|title=Juliana Rincon Parra (March 11, 2010). “Iran: Or318 memorial to blogger’s death in prison”|work=Global voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Objective==
The [[Gay Straight Alliance]] Bermuda was founded on October 25, 2013. It was a break out group from the Rainbow Alliance. It branched out to get more work done as a result of enough not being done by the rainbow alliance. It was set up primarily as a lobby group, sending out emails and  letters and publishing articles in order to influence policies and public opinion. It has a blog which is run by the founder Jordan Ess which he uses to promote the group’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20131025/news/131029780|title=Ceola Wilson (October 2015 2013). “Gay rights campaigner forms advocacy group”|work=The Royal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven network for members of the [[LGBTQ community]] and for all other persons being discriminated against in any way. It has a large presence of non-gay volunteers and anonymous financial partners.

==Current and Recent Issues==

===Hotline dedicated to persons in the LGBTQ COMMUNITY===
In response to a 2016 article written by the [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|Royal Gazette]], the need for support services for young person’s dealing with [[sexual identity]] issues in Bermuda was addressed, the Gay Straight Alliance Bermuda have set plans in motion to set up a telephone hotline to help young people dealing with sexual identity issues in [[Bermuda]]. In an interview with the [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|Royal Gazette]], GSA founder Jordan Ess said: “There are sufficient crisis services available on the island to meet demand. Our goal in creating a help desk for LGBTQ youth, especially, is to deal not with emergency situations but with coping skills and life strategies to handle issues that LGBTQ youth may face, like parental disapproval, [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]]”.

On February 9, 2016, members of the LGBTQ community came to stand against hundreds of members of Preserve Marriage, a group dedicated to preserving the virtues of traditional marriage held a demonstration on the grounds of the Cabinet Building of the government of [[Bermuda]] where they submitted their objectives against [[civil union]]s and [[same-sex marriage]]. The major goal of their protest was to oppose the rights of same-sex couples to raise kids. Jordan Ess, founder of the Gay Straight Alliance Bermuda was also present to lend support to the LGBTQ community. Saying, “I am for every human being having human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160210/NEWS/160219988|title=Same-sex marriage issue stirs passions|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160204/NEWS/160209829|title=Group calls for same-sex marriage referendum|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160304/NEWS01/160309833|title=Dunkley: Why we called marriage referendum|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental and public response to gay rights in Bermuda===
In 1944, [[homosexuality]] was decriminalized by the government of [[Bermuda]] but since then, no further action has been taken to prevent discrimination of persons in this group with discrimination based on [[gender identity]] issues not criminalized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-bermuda/|title=Gay Life in Bermuda|work=The Global gayz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On recent response to gay rights, the [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermudian parliament]] recently called for a referendum on the marriage rights of persons in the LGBTQ community and with a poll conducted by the Royal Gazette in 2015 showing that 44% of Bermudans were against same-sex marriage and 48% for it, it leaves one guessing as to what will be the result of the referendum due to be debated on in a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160304/NEWS01/160309833|title=Dunkley: Why we called marriage referendum|work=The Royal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Amongst the challenges being encountered by the gay straight alliance Bermuda include insufficient staff strength and funds to carry out some of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsabermuda.org/gsabermuda/2016/02/20/we-need-you-volunteer-with-us/|title=We need you!

In [[mathematics]], '''trace diagrams''' are a graphical means of performing computations in [[linear algebra|linear]] and [[multilinear algebra]]. They can be represented as (slightly modified) [[graph theory|graphs]] in which some edges are labeled by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The simplest trace diagrams represent the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and [[determinant]] of a matrix. Several results in linear algebra, such as [[Cramer's Rule]] and the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], have simple diagrammatic proofs. They are closely related to [[Penrose's graphical notation]].

== Formal definition ==

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] of [[vector space|dimension]] ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' (with ''n''≥2), and let Fun(''V'',''V'') denote the [[linear transformation]]s on ''V''. An ''' ''n''-trace diagram''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}=(V_1\sqcup V_2\sqcup V_n, E)&lt;/math&gt;, where the sets ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') are composed of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] ''i'', together with the following additional structures:
* a ''ciliation'' at each vertex in the graph, which is an explicit ordering of the adjacent edges at that vertex;
* a labeling ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fun(''V'',''V'') associating each degree-2 vertex to a linear transformation.
Note that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' should be considered as distinct sets in the case&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. A '''framed trace diagram''' is a trace diagram together with a partition of the degree-1 vertices ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into two disjoint ordered collections called the ''inputs'' and the ''outputs''.

The "graph" underlying a trace diagram may have the following special features, which are not always included in the standard definition of a graph:
* [[Loop (graph theory)|Loops]] are permitted (a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself).
* Edges that have no vertices are permitted, and are represented by small circles.
* Multiple edges between the same two vertices are permitted.

=== Drawing conventions ===

* When trace diagrams are drawn, the ciliation on an ''n''-vertex is commonly represented by a small mark between two of the incident edges (in the figure above, a small red dot); the specific ordering of edges follows by proceeding counter-clockwise from this mark.
* The ciliation and labeling at a degree-2 vertex are combined into a single directed node that allows one to differentiate the first edge (the ''incoming'' edge) from the second edge (the ''outgoing'' edge).
* Framed diagrams are drawn with ''inputs'' at the bottom of the diagram and ''outputs'' at the top of the diagram. In both cases, the ordering corresponds to reading from left to right.

=== Correspondence with multilinear functions ===

Every framed trace diagram corresponds to a [[multilinear]] function between [[tensor]] powers of the vector space ''V''. The degree-1 vertices correspond to the inputs and outputs of the function, while the degree-''n'' vertices correspond to the generalized [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (which is an [[anti-symmetric tensor]] related to the [[determinant]]). If a diagram has no output strands, its function maps tensor products to a scalar. If there are no degree-1 vertices, the diagram is said to be '''closed''' and its corresponding function may be identified with a scalar.

By definition, a trace diagram's function is computed using [[signed graph]] coloring. For each [[edge coloring]] of the graph's edges by ''n'' labels, so that no two edges adjacent to the same vertex have the same label, one assigns a ''weight'' based on the labels at the vertices and the labels adjacent to the matrix labels. These weights become the coefficients of the diagram's function.

In practice, a trace diagram's function is typically computed by ''decomposing'' the diagram into smaller pieces whose functions are known. The overall function can then be computed by re-composing the individual functions.

== Examples ==

=== 3-Vector diagrams ===
Several [[vector identities]] have easy proofs using trace diagrams. This section covers 3-trace diagrams. In the translation of diagrams to functions, it can be shown that the positions of ciliations at the degree-3 vertices has no influence on the resulting function, so they may be omitted.

It can be shown that the [[cross product]] and [[dot product]] of 3-dimensional vectors are represented by

:[[Image:Trace diagram vector product definitions.png|300px]]

In this picture, the inputs to the function are shown as vectors in yellow boxes at the bottom of the diagram. The cross product diagram has an output vector, represented by the free strand at the top of the diagram. The dot product diagram does not have an output vector; hence, its output is a scalar.

As a first example, consider the scalar triple product identity

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w})=(\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{u})\cdot\mathbf{v}=\det(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}\mathbf{w}).&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this diagrammatically, note that all of the following figures are different depictions of the same 3-trace diagram (as specified by the above definition):

:[[File:Trace diagram triple product identity.png|350px]]

Combining the above diagrams for the cross product and the dot product, one can read off the three leftmost diagrams as precisely the three leftmost scalar triple products in the above identity. It can also be shown that the rightmost diagram represents det['''u''' '''v''' '''w''']. The scalar triple product identity follows because each is a different representation of the same diagram's function.

As a second example, one can show that
:[[File:Trace diagram 3 binor identity.png|100px]]
(where the equality indicates that the identity holds for the underlying multilinear functions). One can show that this kind of identity does not change by "bending" the diagram or attaching more diagrams, provided the changes are consistent across all diagrams in the identity. Thus, one can bend the top of the diagram down to the bottom, and attach vectors to each of the free edges, to obtain
:[[File:Trace diagram quadruple product identity.png|350px]]
which reads
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{u})\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w})=(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{v})(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{w})-(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{w})(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}),&lt;/math&gt;
a well-known identity relating four 3-dimensional vectors.

=== Diagrams with matrices ===

The simplest closed diagrams with a single matrix label correspond to the coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]], up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension of the matrix. One representation of these diagrams is shown below, where &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate equality up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension ''n'' of the underlying vector space.

:[[File:Trace diagram invariant diagrams.png|600px]].

== Properties ==

Let ''G'' be the group of n×n matrices. If a closed trace diagram is labeled by ''k'' different matrices, it may be interpreted as a function from &lt;math&gt;G^k&lt;/math&gt; to an algebra of multilinear functions. This function is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under simultaneous [[conjugacy class|conjugation]], that is, the function corresponding to &lt;math&gt;(g_1,\ldots,g_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the function corresponding to &lt;math&gt;(a g_1 a^{-1}, \ldots, a g_k a^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; for any invertible &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

== Extensions and applications ==

Trace diagrams may be specialized for particular [[Lie groups]] by altering the definition slightly. In this context, they are sometimes called [[birdtracks]], [[Penrose graphical notation|tensor diagrams]], or [[Penrose graphical notation]].

Trace diagrams have primarily been used by physicists as a tool for studying [[Lie groups]]. The most common applications use [[representation theory]] to construct [[spin network]]s from trace diagrams. In mathematics, they have been used to study [[character variety|character varieties]].

The '''Tunisian Human Rights League''' ({{lang-ar|الرابطة التونسية للدفاع عن حقوق الإنسان}}, {{lang-fr|Ligue tunisienne des droits de l'homme}}) is an association to observe and [[Human Rights Defenders|defend human rights]] in Tunisia. It was founded in 1976, but associations had to be government-recognized, and the government delayed considerably before giving official recognition in May 1977.&lt;ref name=waltz/&gt; The organization's name is usually abbreviated LTDH, for its French name.&lt;ref name=waltz&gt;Susan E. Waltz. 1995. ''Human Rights and Reform: Changing the Face of North African Politics''. University of California Press. Pages 134-139.

[[Hassib Ben Ammar]] was an early organizer who later received a [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]]. [[Saâdeddine Zmerli]] was the first president and a longtime officer from the beginning of the organization till the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Leaders"&gt;Who's who : Saâdeddine Zmerli.

LDTH had about 1000 members in 1982 and 3000 in 1985, partly because it had taken stands against the death penalty and the release from prison of Islamists who had been "imprisoned for acts of conscience."&lt;ref name=waltz/&gt;

'''Special rapporteur''', '''independent expert''', and '''working group member''' are titles given to individuals working on behalf of the [[United Nations]] (UN) within the scope of "special procedure" mechanisms who have a specific country or thematic mandate from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. The term "[[rapporteur]]" is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body.
 
The mandate by the United Nations has been to "examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report" on human rights problems through  "activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities."&lt;ref name="special-procedures"&gt;"[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/index.htm#code Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council]". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the manual ''Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods'' (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include "special representative of the secretary-general" or "independent expert", or a [[working group]] usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet.

==Appointment authority==
Appointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20&amp;nbsp;(XXXVI). The first Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions reporting to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/35 begun work in 1982.
		
They do not receive any financial compensation for their work from the United Nations, though they receive personnel and logistical support from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and are often backed by charities and corporations.

To mark [[Human Rights Day]] in 2006, the 37 special rapporteurs, special representatives and independent experts issued a joint statement on the importance of human rights in the fight against poverty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/Bulletin3.pdf Human Rights Day 2006 (10 December)]". ''Special Procedures Bulletin''. Third issue. September&amp;nbsp;–December 2006. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role description==
Special Rapporteurs often conduct fact-finding missions to countries to investigate allegations of human rights violations. They can only visit countries that have agreed to invite them.

Aside from fact-finding missions, Rapporteurs regularly assess and verify complaints from alleged victims of [[human rights violations]]. Once a complaint is verified as legitimate, an urgent letter or appeal is sent to the government that has allegedly committed the violation. If no complaint has been made, Rapporteurs may intervene on behalf of individuals and groups of people of their own accord.

==Role application==
Thematic special rapporteurs are typically appointed to serve for three years, after which their mandate can be extended for another three years. Country special rapporteurs are appointed to serve for one year, and their term is renewed every year.

==Controversies==
In June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all special rapporteurs by one year to enable it to conduct a review of the mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, special rapporteurs for countries which did not approve a special rapporteur came under question and the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed.

Other controversies between the special rapporteurs and the council include the introduction of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the special rapporteurs from addressing the media. However a compromise was reached and a code of conduct now exists for the special rapporteurs.&lt;ref name="special-procedures"/&gt;

==Current thematic and country mandates==

The HRC oversees 43 thematic and 14 specific country mandates for which it can assign special rapporteurs. Currently there are at least 38 Special Rapporteurs, Special Representatives and Independent Experts who serve under the following country and thematic mandates:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/ Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council] International Justice Resources Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Introduction.aspx Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council], United National Human Rights Commission, September 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17803">'''Verificationism''', also known as the verification idea or the '''verifiability criterion of meaning''', is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] doctrine that only statements that are [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable (i.e. verifiable through the [[sense]]s) are cognitively meaningful, or else they are truths of logic ([[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]).

Verificationism thus rejects as cognitively "meaningless" statements specific to entire fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[spirituality]], [[theology]], [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Such statements may be meaningful in influencing emotions or behavior, but not in terms of [[truth value]], information or factual content.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626091/verifiability-principle "Verifiability principle"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Website accessed 12 Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Verificationism was a central thesis of [[logical positivism]], a movement in [[analytic philosophy]] that emerged in the 1920s by the efforts of a group of philosophers who sought to unify philosophy and science under a common [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]].

==Origins==
Although verificationist principles of a general sort—grounding scientific theory in some verifiable [[empiricism|experience]]—are found retrospectively even with the American [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] and with the French [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] [[Pierre Duhem]]&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt; who fostered [[instrumentalism]],&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Miran Epstein, ch 2 "Introduction to philosophy of science", in Clive Seale, ed, ''Researching Society and Culture'', 3rd edn (London: Sage Publications, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBCvNlypL4C&amp;pg=PA18 pp 18–19].&lt;/ref&gt; the vigorous program termed ''verificationism'' was launched by the [[logical positivists]] who, emerging from [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]] in the 1920s, sought [[epistemology]] whereby philosophical discourse would be, in their perception, as authoritative and meaningful as [[empirical science]].

Logical positivists garnered the verifiability criterion of cognitive meaningfulness from young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s [[philosophy of language]] posed in his 1921 book ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt; and, led by [[Bertrand Russell]], sought to [[analytic–synthetic distinction|reformulate the analytic–synthetic distinction]] in a way that would reduce mathematics and logic to [[semantics|semantical]] conventions. This would be pivotal to verificationism, in that logic and mathematics would otherwise be classified as [[synthetic a priori]] knowledge and defined as "meaningless" under verificationism.

Seeking grounding in such [[empiricism]] as of [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;Despite Hume's radical empiricism, set forth near 1740, Hume was also committed to [[common sense]], and apparently did not take his own skepticism, such as the [[problem of induction]], as drastically as others later did [Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156 "Hume"], p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Comte]], and [[Ernst Mach]]—along with the [[positivism]] of the latter two—they borrowed some perspectives from [[Immanuel Kant]], and found the exemplar of science to be [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

==Revisions&lt;!--'Confirmationism' redirects here--&gt;==
Logical positivists within the [[Vienna Circle]] quickly recognized that the verifiability criterion was too stringent. Notably, all [[universal generalization]]s are empirically unverifiable, such that, under verificationism, vast domains of science and reason, such as scientific [[hypothesis]], would be rendered meaningless.&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer&gt;Sahotra Sarkar and Jessica Pfeifer, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A–M (New York: Routledge, 2006), "Rudolf Carnap", [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA83 p 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Philipp Frank]] led a faction seeking to make the verifiability criterion more inclusive, beginning a movement they referred to as the "liberalization of empiricism". [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]] led a "conservative wing" that maintained a strict verificationism. Whereas Schlick sought to reduce universal generalizations to frameworks of 'rules' from which verifiable statements can be derived,&lt;ref name=Schlick&gt;Moritz Schlick, 1931, "Die Kausalität in der gegenwärtigen Physik", ''Die Naturwissen-schaften'', 19: 145–162; transl. "Causality in Contemporary Physics" in Schlick 1979b, pp. 176–209&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn argued that the verifiability criterion should accede to less-than-conclusive verifiability.&lt;ref name=Hahn&gt;Hahn, Hans, 1933, Logik, Mathematik und Naturerkennen, Wien: Gerold, transl. "Logic, Mathematics, and Knowledge of Nature", in B. McGuiness 1987, pp. 24–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other ideas espoused by the liberalization movement were [[physicalism]], over [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]], [[coherentism]] over [[foundationalism]], as well as [[pragmatism]] and [[fallibilism]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flew-Neurath&gt;Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA245 "Neurath"], p 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Carnap sought a switch from verification to ''confirmation''.&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/&gt; Carnap's confirmability criterion ('''confirmationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) would not require conclusive verification (thus accommodating for universal generalizations) but allow for partial testability to establish "degrees of confirmation" on a probabilistic basis. Carnap never succeeded in formalizing his thesis despite employing abundant logical and mathematical tools for this purpose. In all of Carnap's formulations, a universal law's degree of confirmation is zero.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap&gt;Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year saw the publication of [[A. J. Ayer]]'s work, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he proposed two types of verification: ''strong'' and ''weak''. This system espoused conclusive verification, yet accommodated for probabilistic inclusion where verifiability is inconclusive. Ayer also distinguished between practical and theoretical verifiability. Under the latter, propositions that cannot be verified in practice would still be meaningful if they can be verified in principle.

[[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' proposed [[falsificationism]] as a criterion under which scientific hypothesis would be tenable. Falsificationism would allow hypotheses expressed as universal generalizations, such as "all swans are white", to be provisionally true until falsified by evidence, in contrast to verificationism under which they would be disqualified immediately as meaningless.

Though widely recognized as a revision of verificationism,&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt; Popper intended falsificationism as a methodological standard specific to the sciences rather than as a theory of meaning.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Karl Popper, ch 4, subch "Science: Conjectures and refutations", in Andrew Bailey, ed, ''First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy'', 2nd edn (Peterborough Ontario: [[Broadview Press]], 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ngXNqiH_cDQC&amp;pg=PA338 pp 338–42].&lt;/ref&gt; Popper regarded scientific hypotheses to be unverifiable, as well as not "confirmable" under [[Rudolph Carnap|Carnap]]'s thesis.&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Godfrey-Smith&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith, ''Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=k23egtSWrb8C&amp;pg=PA57 p 57–59].&lt;/ref&gt; He also found unscientific, metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic statements often rich in meaning and important in the origination of scientific theories.&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falsificationism is simply Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology, whereas [[critical rationalism]] is Popper's ''general'' [[epistemology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The 1951 article "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]] and apparently rendered the verificationist program untenable. [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], one of verificationism's greatest internal critics, had recently concluded the same as to the verifiability criterion.&lt;ref name=Fetzer&gt;James Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2013): "However surprising it may initially seem, contemporary developments in the [[philosophy of science]] can only be properly appreciated in relation to the historical background of [[logical positivism]]. [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement.  ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936; 2nd edition, 1946), authored by [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], offers a lucid exposition of the movement, which was—with certain variations—based upon the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained.  Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables.  In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not.  The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable".&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]] explained that even direct observations must be collected, sorted, and reported with guidance and constraint by theory, which sets a horizon of expectation and interpretation, how observational reports, never neutral, are [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Caldwell, ''Beyond Positivism: Economic Methodology in the 20th Century'', rev edn (London: [[Routledge]], 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrqLZsCOg4sC&amp;pg=PA47 p 47–48].&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was also recognized as being [[self-refuting]]: it cannot itself be empirically verified, and it is not a logical tautology, so must be meaningless under its own terms.

[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s landmark book of 1962, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''—which identified ''[[normal science|paradigms of science]]'' overturned by [[revolutionary science]] within [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—critically destabilized confidence in scientific [[foundationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly if erroneously attributed to verificationism.&lt;ref&gt;"But for a brief lapse around 1929/30, then, the post-''[[The Logical Structure of the World|Aufbau]]'' [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] fully represents the position of [[Vienna Circle]] anti-foundationalism. In this he joined [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] whose long-standing anti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile likening scientists to sailors who have to repair their [[Neurath's boat|boat]] without ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions contrasted at least ''[[prima facie]]'' with that of [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] (1934) who explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle's protocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all scientific statements were [[fallibilism|fallible]] ones, so his position on [[foundationalism]] was by no means the traditional one. The point of his 'foundations' remained less than wholly clear and different interpretation of it have been put forward. ... While all in the [[Vienna Circle|Circle]] thus recognized as futile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge claims, not all members embraced positions that rejected foundationalism ''[[tout court]]''. Clearly, however, attributing [[foundationalist]] ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total misunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development, if it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist faction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left wing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both the empirical and [[formal science]]s" [[Thomas Uebel]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"], sec "3.3 Reductionism and foundationalism: Two criticisms partly rebutted", in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2012 edn).&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper, who had long claimed to have killed verificationism but recognized that some would confuse his falsificationism for more of it,&lt;ref name=Hacohen&gt;Malachi Haim Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years, 1902–1945: Politics and Philosophy in Interwar Vienna'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212 pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[knighted]] in 1965.  In 1967, [[John Passmore]], a leading historian of 20th-century philosophy, wrote, "Logical positivism is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"—a general view among philosophers.&lt;ref name=Hanfling&gt;Oswald Hanfling, ch 5 "Logical positivism", in Stuart G Shanker, ''Philosophy of Science, Logic and Mathematics in the Twentieth Century'' (London: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jIzT7AT3ILIC&amp;pg=PA193 pp 193–94].&lt;/ref&gt;  Logical positivism's fall heralded [[postpositivism]], where Popper's view of human knowledge as hypothetical, continually growing, and open to change ascended,&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt; and verificationism became mostly maligned.&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Karl Popper]] has been the only philosopher of science often praised by scientists,&lt;ref name=Godfrey-Smith/&gt; whereas [[logical positivists|verificationists]] have been likened to economists of the 19th century who took circuitous, protracted measures to refuse falsification, that is, refutation, of their preconceived principles.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Blaug ''The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain'', 2nd edn (Cambridge UK: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992), ch 3 "The verificationists, a largely nineteenth-century story", [https://books.google.com/books?id=T4y7HyduGnIC&amp;pg=PA51 p 51].&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, logical positivists practiced Popper's principles—conjecturing and refuting—until they ran their course, catapulting Popper, initially a contentious misfit, to carry the richest philosophy out of [[interwar]] Vienna.&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt;  And his [[falsificationism]], as did verificationism, poses a criterion, ''falsifiability'', to ensure that empiricism anchors scientific theory.&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;

In a 1979 interview, [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], who had introduced logical positivism to the [[English-speaking world]] in the 1930s, was asked what he saw as its main defects, and answered that "nearly all of it was false".&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;  Still, he soon admitted still holding "the same general approach".&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;  The "general approach" of empiricism and [[reductionism]]—whereby mental phenomena resolve to the material or physical, and philosophical questions largely resolve to ones of language and meaning—has run through Western philosophy since the 17th century and lived beyond logical positivism's fall.&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;

In 1977, Ayer had noted, "The verification principle is seldom mentioned and when it is mentioned it is usually scorned; it continues, however, to be put to work.  The attitude of many philosophers reminds me of the relationship between Pip and Magwitch in [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.  They have lived on the money, but are ashamed to acknowledge its source".&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;  In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the general concept of verification criteria—in forms that differed from those of the logical positivists—was defended by [[Bas van Fraassen]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Crispin Wright]], [[Christopher Peacocke]], [[David Wiggins]], [[Richard Rorty]], and others.&lt;ref name=Misak&gt;C J Misak, ''Verificationism: Its History and Prospects'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EObr91F6rJ8C&amp;pg=PR8 p viii].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victim mentality''' is an acquired [[personality]] [[trait theory|trait]] in which a person tends to recognize themselves as a victim of the negative actions of others, and to behave as if this were the case in the face of contrary evidence of such circumstances. Victim mentality depends on clear [[thought]] processes and [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. In most cases, those with a victim mentality have in fact been the victim of wrongdoing by others or have otherwise suffered misfortune through no fault of their own; however, such misfortune does not necessarily imply that one will respond by developing a ''pervasive and universal'' victim mentality where one frequently or constantly perceives oneself to be a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → Constantly acting a victim can have perceived benefits: '''(1) Having the 'Right' to Complain (2) Less likely to Receive Criticism (3) More likely to be Granted Requests (4) Avoiding Anger, too Occupied w/ Feeling Sad'''. → People with a victim mentality '''believe they have little other means of achieving Attention, Feelings of Value, &amp; Power'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in reference to the tendency for recognizing one's misfortunes on somebody else's misdeeds, which is also referred to as '''victimism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Annelie J.|last2=Callan|first2= Mitchell J. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103766/|pmc=4103766|title=Getting "Just Deserts" or Seeing the "Silver Lining": The Relation between Judgments of Immanent and Ultimate Justice|date=July 18, 2014|department=Abstract|journal=[[PLOS ONE]] - beta version of PLOS (Public Library of Science) - Scientific Journal|volume=9|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0101803 |accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → Observers engaged in more ultimate justice reasoning for a "good" victim &amp; '''greater immanent justice reasoning for a "bad" victim.'''

Victim mentality is primarily developed, for example, from family members and situations during childhood. Similarly, criminals often engage in victim thinking, believing themselves to be moral and engaging in crime only as a reaction to an immoral world and furthermore feeling that authorities are unfairly singling them out for persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Sequential stages: the process of victimization; Victim-to-victimizer cycle|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=234; 256|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=those who '''perceive themselves as a victim attempt to gain social validation by persuading others (family, friends, authorities''', etc.) to recognize that the harm occurred &amp; that they are victims...the sense of '''collective victimhood is related to negative affective consequences of fear, reduced empathy &amp; anger, to cognitive biases such as interpretation of ambiguous information as hostile &amp; threatening, to emergence of the belief that violent action taken is morally justified, to reduced moral accountability &amp; finally to a tendency to seek revenge'''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundations ==
In the most general sense, a victim is anyone who experiences injury, loss, or misfortune as a result of some event or series of events.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aquino and K. Byron, 'Dominating interpersonal behavior and perceived victimization in groups: Evidence for a curvilinear relationship', Journal of Management, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2002, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative experience, however, is insufficient for the emergence of a sense of victimhood. Individuals may identify as a victim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → You might be the victim of a crime. In such a case you have every right to feel that things were out of your control, because they were, &amp; any thought that it’s somehow your fault &amp; you are responsible is erroneous thinking. '''A healthy person recognises that beyond random bad occurrences, many things in life happen because of choices they themselves made, &amp; that they have power to choose differently. They understand that when misfortune does happen, it is nothing to do with personal value or 'deserving' or 'not deserving''''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they believe that:
* they were harmed;
* they were not the cause of the occurrence of the harmful act;
* they were under no obligation to prevent the harm;
* the harm constituted an injustice in that it violated their rights (if inflicted by a person) and/or in that they possessed qualities (''e.g.'', strength or goodness of character) making them persons whom that harm did not befit;
* they deserve empathy.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Sykes, ''A nation of victims: The decay of the American character,'' St. Martin's Press: New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
The desire of empathy is crucial in that the mere experience of a harmful event is not enough for the emergence of the sense of being a victim. In order to have this sense, there is the need to perceive the harm as undeserved, unjust and immoral, an act that could not be prevented by the victim. The need to obtain empathy and understanding can then emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=IRC&amp;volumeId=91&amp;seriesId=0&amp;issueId=874|title=International Review of the Red Cross: Volume 91 - War victims - Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals harbouring a victim mentality would believe that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* their lives are a series of challenges directly aimed at them;
* most aspects of life are negative and beyond their control;
* the challenges in their lives merit them deserving of sympathy;
* as they have little power to change things, little action should be taken to improve their problems. 
In essence, victim mentality is a method of avoiding responsibility and criticism, receiving attention and compassion, and evading feelings of genuine [[anger]].

==Features==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
A victim mentality may manifest itself in a range of different behaviours or ways of thinking and talking:
* Identifying others as the cause for an undesired situation and denying an personal responsibility for one's own life or circumstances.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt;
* Exhibiting heightened attention levels ([[hypervigilance]]) when in the presence of others. 
* Awareness of negative intentions of other people.
* Believing that other people are generally more fortunate.
* Gaining relief from feeling empathy for oneself or receiving empathy from others.

In has been typically characterized by attitudes of [[pessimism]], [[self-pity]], and repressed anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drshirin.com/victimme.htm|title=The Victim Mentality|website=DrShirin.com|department=Articles|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327185951/http://www.drshirin.com:80/victimme.htm|archivedate=March 27, 2007|first=Dr. Kim K.|last=Shirin|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with victim mentality may develop convincing and sophisticated explanations in support of such ideas, which they then use to explain to themselves and others of their situation.

People with victim mentality may also be generally:
* realist, with a general tendency to realistically perceive a situation; yet may lack an awareness and/or curiosity about the root of actual powerlessness in a situation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/inviting-monkey-tea/201801/are-you-ready-stop-feeling-victim|first=Nancy|last=Colier|title=Are You Ready to Stop Feeling Like a Victim?|magazine=Psychology Today|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspective
* likely to display entitlement and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;
Zitek, E. M., Jordan, A. H., Monin, B., &amp; Leach, F. R. (2010). Victim entitlement to behave selfishly. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98(2), 245-255.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0017168&lt;/ref&gt;
* defensive: In conversation, reading a negative intention into a neutral question and reacting with a corresponding accusation, hindering the collective solution of problems by recognizing the inherent conflict.
* categorizing: tending to divide people into "good" and "bad" with no gray zone between them.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;de Vries M.F.R.K. (2014) Are You a Victim of the Victim Syndrome?. In: Mindful Leadership Coaching. INSEAD Business Press. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;
* unadventurous: generally unwilling to take even small and calculated risks; exaggerating the importance or likelihood of possible negative outcomes.
* exhibiting [[learned helplessness]]: underestimating one's ability or influence in a given situation; feeling powerless.
* [[self-abasing]]: Putting oneself down even further than others are doing.

A victim mentality may be reflected by linguistic markers or habits, such as pretending
* not to be able to do something ("I can't..."),
* not to have choices ("I must...") ("I have no choice..."), or
* epistemological humilty ("I don't know").

==Victims of abuse and manipulation==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaking out==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Since victim mentality is primarily a reaction to one's experiences and not inborn, it is possible to change it which may be provoked by an extraordinary situation or crisis. Since recognizing naive and condescending suggestions is a general characteristic feature of victim mentality, a person with victim mentality will generally not respond positively to attempts by another person to wrongly identify the problem and its solution. For this reason, the condition may become chronic.

However, successful identified techniques have included therapeutic teaching methods regarding concepts of [[normative]] [[decision theory]], [[emotional intelligence]], [[cognitive therapy]], and psychological [[locus of control]]. These methods have proven helpful in allowing individuals with a victim mentality mindset to both recognize and release the mindset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danziger|first=Sanford|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/9766a32d3470e98b8b39bb8ea8fdfd4a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=47765|title=The Educational Benefits of Releasing "Victim Mentality": An Approach from the Fields of Business and Psychology|date=2010|department=Developments|journal=Journal of Developmental Education|volume=34|issue=2|page=43|url-access=subscription|format=PDF|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|location=Boone, North Carolina|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

One may consider collective victimhood in political settings. If the leaders of a country, and the citizens who support them, collectively feel like victims of neighboring countries (e.g. following past border disputes), those leaders may be more likely to advocate violent conflict resolution or suppression of freedom of speech.

Political psychologists Bar-Tal and Chernyak-Hai write that collective victim mentality develops from a progression of self-realization, social recognition, and eventual attempts to maintain victimhood status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Foundations|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=233|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 21, 2018|postscript= → Sense of Victimhood has 3 foundations: (1) rooted in a Realization of Harm Experienced either directly or indirectly (2) 'Victim': a social label → result of Social Recognition of an act as illegitimate harm (3) Individuals Perceive Themselves as Victims → often attempt to maintain this status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wonderloch Kellerland''' was an international project and exhibition space founded by [[René Luckhardt]] in his [[Berlin]] apartment in the beginning of 2010. The name relates to Dostoyevsky’s [[Notes from Underground]] (German: “Aufzeichnungen aus dem Kellerloch”) and Lewis Carroll’s [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]. A role model was also [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], the “greatest Kellerloch-artist of all times”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ART Magazine| first=Interview| url=http://www.art-magazin.de/extra/45232/off_spaces_wonderloch_kellerland_berlin_los_angeles|title=Off-Spaces: Wonderloch Kellerland Berlin/Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German magazine ART Das Kunstmagazin refers to Wonderloch Kellerland as the “boot camp of subculture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ART Magazine| first=Interview| url=http://www.art-magazin.de/extra/45232/off_spaces_wonderloch_kellerland_berlin_los_angeles|title=Off-Spaces: Wonderloch Kellerland Berlin/Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Exhibitions included upcoming L.A. and Berlin based artists. But also works by  [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Friedrich Schroder-Sonnenstern]], [[Helga Goetze]], [[Louis Waldon]], [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] or a selection of Viennese artists curated by Stefan Bidner and [[Elke Krystufek]]. Apart from that Wonderloch Kellerland regularly hosted previously unseen curiosities, e.g. handpainted ceramics of the [[French Foreign Legion]] from the [[Adam Saks]] Collection, or a "space clearing" by [[Bettina Sellmann]].

With ARTISTS MERCHANDISING ART Wonderloch Kellerland initiated the first series of international exhibitions to deal with the issue of merchandising in contemporary art. The show featured about 300 artists and was exhibited in Berlin, Paris, Los Angeles, Hamburg and Vienna.
In 2011 a branch of Wonderloch Kellerland opened in Los Angeles, run by Hans-Peter Thomas. Both spaces are included in the Art Spaces Directory of the New Museum New York. Wonderloch Kellerland closed in 2014.

==Project Philosophy==
The philosophy of the project was given as: “As an artist you have to go through rabbit holes or cellar holes (German: Kellerlocher) – like Lewis Carroll’s Alice – in order to get to the Wonderland, to blossom anew and to set free new energies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lützow| first=Gunnar| url=http://www.tip-berlin.de/kultur-und-freizeit-kunst-und-museen/kellerland-im-soldiner-kiez|title=Das Kellerwunder|work=Tip Berlin (14/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
